<text>Sibiu ( , , , , Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Härmeschtat&quot; or &quot;Hermestatt&quot;) is a city in central Romania, situated in the historical region of Transylvania. Located some north-west of Bucharest, the city straddles the Cibin River, a tributary of the Olt River. Now the seat of Sibiu County, between 1692 and 1791 and 1849–65 Sibiu was the capital of the Principality of Transylvania. Until 1876, the Hecht hause in Sibiu served as the seat of the Transylvanian Saxon University.

Nicknamed &quot;The Town with Eyes&quot; (given its historical buildings with partly open rooftops), the town is a well-known tourist destination for both domestic and foreign visitors. Known for its culture, history, gastronomy or local cuisine, and diverse architecture, which includes the iconic houses with eyes that gave Sibiu its nickname, the town has garnered significant attention since the beginning of the 21st century.

In 2004, its historical center was added to the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Sibiu was subsequently designated the European Capital of Culture in 2007, a title which it shared that year along with Luxembourg City. One year later, it was ranked &quot;Europe&#x27;s 8th-most idyllic place to live&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot;. In 2019, Sibiu was named the European Region of Gastronomy. Sibiu hosted the European Wandering Capital event in 2021, the most important tourist wandering event in Europe. A European Union summit was also hosted by the town in 2019.

Sibiu is also known nationally and internationally for its Christmas market. Renowned personalities include Transylvanian Saxon scientists Conrad Haas and Hermann Oberth, who were both pioneers of rocketry. The company Elrond, which created the eGold cryptocurrency (among the biggest in the world), was founded by people from Sibiu.

As of 2021 census, the city has a population of 134,309, making it the 15th-largest city in Romania. The proposed Sibiu metropolitan area has a population of 267,170. The town also administers the village of Păltiniș, a ski resort located 35 kilometres to the southwest.

During the High and Late Middle Ages, Sibiu was the most important cultural and administrative centre of the Transylvanian Saxons. It is called &quot;Härmeschtat&quot; in their local dialect, which is close to Luxembourgish, from which it primarily descended during the Ostsiedlung.

== Name ==

The name of the city derives from the Bulgar-Turkic name Sibin&lt;Sebin&lt;Säbin, perhaps meaning &quot;rejoice&quot;. An archaic version of the Romanian name Sibiu is &quot;Sibiiu&quot;, while an obsolete folk name is &quot;Sâghii&quot;, formerly spelled &quot;Sîghii&quot;. Its Hungarian name is &quot;Nagyszeben&quot; (&quot;Big/Greater Sibiu&quot;), or colloquially, &quot;Szeben&quot;.

In German, it is called &quot;Hermannstadt&quot; (&quot;Hermann&#x27;s town&quot;), while in the local Transylvanian Saxon dialect, it is known as &quot;Härmeschtat&quot;. In Yiddish, it is called סעבען &quot;Seben&quot; or הערמאנשטאט &quot;Hermanshtat&quot;.

A number of other languages also have their own variants of the city&#x27;s name, like Czech &quot;Sibiň&quot;, Polish &quot;Sybin&quot;, Serbo-Croatian &quot;Sibinj&quot;, Old Bulgarian &quot;Sibin&quot; (Сибин) and the proposed Esperanto name &quot;Sibio&quot;.

== History ==


The Roman fort of Cedonia was perhaps in the same location as Sibiu. The town was founded by Saxon (German) settlers brought there by King of Hungary and King of Croatia Géza II during the mid-late 12th century, as part of the Ostsiedlung. They came from territories of the Holy Roman Empire and Kingdom of France (nowadays parts of Germany, France and the Benelux countries) and arrived at around 1147. The first references to the area were &quot;Cibinium&quot; and &quot;Cipin&quot; from 1191 when Pope Celestine III confirmed the existence of the free prepositure of the Saxons in Transylvania, having its headquarters in Sibiu. The city also used the names &quot;Prepositus Cibiniensis&quot; (1192–1196) and &quot;Prepositus Scibiniensis&quot; (1211). In 1223, it was renamed to &quot;Villa Hermanni&quot;, either in honor of archbishop Hermann II of Cologne or after a man who is believed to have founded the city, Hermann of Nuremberg. The actual German name of &quot;Hermannstadt&quot; (&quot;Hermann&#x27;s city&quot;) dates from 1366, while an earlier form, &quot;Hermannsdorf&quot; (&quot;Hermann&#x27;s village&quot;) was recorded in 1321. An alternative urban legend has it that the town was named after a certain shoemaker by the name Hermann.

In the 14th century, it was already an important trade centre. In 1376, the craftsmen were divided in 19 guilds. Hermannstadt became the most important ethnic German city among the seven cities that gave Transylvania its German name &quot;Siebenbürgen&quot; (literally &quot;seven citadels&quot;). It was home to the Transylvanian Saxon University (; i.e. Community of the Saxons), a network of pedagogues, ministers, intellectuals, city officials, and councilmen of the German community forging an ordered legal corpus and political system in Transylvania since the 1400s. In 1699, after the Ottomans withdrew to their base of power in Hungary and Transylvania, the town became capital of Principality of Transylvania (since 1570 the principality was mostly under suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, however often had a dual vassalage).

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became the second- and later the first-most important centre of Transylvanian Romanian ethnics. The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The &quot;Albina&quot; Bank), as did the ASTRA (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian&#x27;s People Culture). After the Romanian Orthodox Church was granted status in the Austrian Empire from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the Metropolitan seat, and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Between the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and 1867 (the year of the &quot;Ausgleich&quot;), Hermannstadt was the meeting-place of the Transylvanian Diet, which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.

After World War I, when Austria-Hungary was dissolved and Sibiu became part of the Kingdom of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnically German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until 1990, most of the town&#x27;s ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany and Austria. The trend continued to a moderate extent after 1990 as well to unified Germany. Nonetheless, among the approximately 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons who decided to remain as per the 2011 Romanian census was Klaus Iohannis, the President of Romania and former longtime mayor of the town between 2000 and 2014, who was succeeded by Astrid Fodor since 2014 onwards, initially ad interim/acting, and then, subsequently in full constitutional powers after 2016.

The city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania, as it holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12+ institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.

Since 2007, a Christmas market has been held in Sibiu. The first of its kind in Romania, it is inspired by Viennese Christmas markets, being a project developed by the Social Attaché of the Austrian Embassy in Romania, dr.h.c. Barbara Schöfnagel. It was held in the &quot;Lesser Square&quot; (Piața Mică) with 38 small stalls, a small stage and an area dedicated to children, having several mechanical attractions installed there. Since 2008, the market has been held in the &quot;Grand Square&quot; (Piaţa Mare) grew to a number of about 70 stalls, a bigger stage was set up, where Christmas carols concerts are held. An ice skating rink and a children&#x27;s workshop are also attractions which have been added in the following years. It was the first Christmas Market in Romania, but soon other Christmas markets emerged across the country. In 2013, the Sibiu Christmas market was included in the &quot;15 Of the Most Beautiful Christmas Markets in Europe&quot;.

In 2019, Sibiu planned to host the European Gastronomical capital, by encouraging the local producers and businesses in the field of food production and culinary and gourmet culture, traditional workshops in the villages of the region, promoting farms and gastronomic circuits, or developing public programs to support small businesses in gastronomy and of the hospitality industry in the Sibiu region.

=== European Cultural Capital ===

The designation of Sibiu as European Cultural Capital in 2007 was owed greatly to the excellent collaboration with Luxembourg (and to the noteworthy historical ties between the Transylvanian Saxon community and Luxembourg), but also to what many regard as a miraculous social rebirth taking place in the town during the last years. The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007 and so it did.

== Administration ==

The town government is headed by a mayor. Since 2014, the office is held by Astrid Fodor from the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (FDGR/DFDR), who replaced Klaus Iohannis, the latter having become the 5th president of Romania. Iohannis, a Transylvanian Saxon, was mayor from 2000 to 2014, despite ethnic Germans nowadays making up less than 2% of Sibiu&#x27;s population. Decisions are approved and discussed by the local government () made up of 23 elected councillors. Sibiu is the capital of the Sibiu County.

<text>Mărășești () is a small town in Vrancea County, Western Moldavia, Romania. It administers six villages: Călimănești, Haret, Modruzeni, Pădureni, Siretu, and Tișița.

==Geography==
The town is located in the eastern part of the county, on the border with Galați County. It is north of the county seat, Focșani. Mărășești lies on the right bank of the river Siret, which separates it from Galați County, in the area where the Siret receives the waters of the rivers Șușița and Zăbrăuț. 

==History==
King Milan I of Serbia was born in Mărășești on 22 August 1854.

In 1917 during World War I, the Battle of Mărășești between the Kingdom of Romania and the German Empire was fought near the town. It was the last major battle between the German Empire and the Kingdom of Romania on the Romanian front during World War I. A mausoleum containing the remains of 5,073 Romanian soldiers was built to commemorate the Romanian victory.

Maria Zaharia (1905–1917) was born in Pădureni village. She acted as an impromptu artillery observer for the Romanian Army and was killed during the Battle of Mărășești. She is buried at the Mausoleum of Mărășești, the only child who is laid to rest there.

<text>West Hampstead is a London Underground station in West Hampstead. It is located on West End Lane between Broadhurst Gardens and Blackburn Road and is situated in Travelcard Zone 2. It is on the Jubilee line between Kilburn and Finchley Road stations. It is from West Hampstead station on the London Overground&#x27;s Mildmay line and from West Hampstead Thameslink station. Metropolitan line trains also pass through the station, but do not stop.

==History==
The station was opened on 30 June 1879 by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line) when it extended its tracks from Swiss Cottage. The station acted as the temporary terminus of the branch until it was further extended to Willesden Green on 24 November that year. The original station had two tracks with facing platforms; the booking office was to the south of the current surface building location with separate stairs to each platform. Consequential to the extension of the Great Central Railway displacing the Metropolitan Railway toward the north, this construction was replaced by an island platform overlapping the position of the previous Up platform.

On 20 November 1939, most stopping services were transferred to the Bakerloo line when it took over operations on the Stanmore branch; at this time the platform was rebuilt in the Underground&#x27;s standard style, but the station building was retained. Stopping services were transferred to the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979. Metropolitan line services run past the station on their own tracks either side of the Jubilee Line having not served the station (a few trains in the early morning and late at night) since the connection between the Metropolitan and Jubilee Lines at Finchley Road was removed as part of the preparation for automatic operation of the Jubilee Line.

==Access and interchanges==
Due to stairs leading from the ticket hall to the platform, the station is not accessible. Facilities include an automatic ticket machine, two quick ticket machines, a ticket booth, countdown timers, a waiting room and both male and female toilets.

Most maps show the three stations as connections. Through ticketing is allowed.

==Development==
There have been proposals since before 1990 for a new West Hampstead interchange linking all three stations in the area and additionally serving two further lines that currently pass through the site.
In 2008 it was proposed that the North and West London Light Railway could serve the station.

==Image gallery==
==Connections==
London Buses routes 139, 328 and C11 serve the station.

<text>Strathearn or Strath Earn (), also the Earn Valley, is the strath of the River Earn, which flows from Loch Earn to meet the River Tay in the east of Scotland.

The area covers the stretch of the river, containing a number of settlements in Perthshire. It shares a name with a modern ward used for elections to Perth and Kinross Council. 

Strathearn was also the name of an ancient province of the Kingdom of Alba, under the authority of a mormaer and then an Earl. More recently, the name has since been used in a number of titles used by the British Royal Family. 

==History==
The historic province of Strathearn was bounded on the north by Atholl, north west by Breadalbane, south west by Menteith, south east by Fife, and on the east by &quot;Perthia&quot;.

The earliest attested mormaer of Strathearn is Mael Ísu I, who is recorded fighting alongside David I at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. Unlike some provinces where the holder of the office of mormaer rotated between kin-groups, the mormaership of Strathearn was dominated by a single family, with a Mael Ísu in every generation until the death of Mael Ísu V in the mid 14th century.

===Battle of Strathearn===
In 904, during the reign of Constantine II of Scotland, sons of Bárid mac Ímair sent a Danish army to attack Strathearn, and were ultimately defeated, the Kingdom of Scotland wasn&#x27;t attacked by Vikings for the next 50 years. 

===Modern administrative history===
Strathearn became a stewartry under the authority of the Earls of Perth and part of Perthshire for administrative purposes, until the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1748. It continued to be recognised as one of the ancient divisions of the county, without administrative or judicial function.

The Strathearn ward of Perth and Kinross Council was created in 2007. 

==Geography==
===Settlements===

The primary settlements of Strathearn are: 
* Lochearnhead
* St Fillans
* Comrie
* Crieff
* Muthill
* Auchterarder
* Dunning
* Forteviot
* Forgandenny
* Bridge of Earn
* Abernethy

==Royal title==

Following the demise of the ancient Earls of Strathearn, with the title in its later creation being forfeited by Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, the Strathearn title was resurrected for use for a number of Royal dukedoms, awarded to members of the British Royal Family.

The name appeared in the titles of the Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.

More recently, Prince William, now Prince of Wales and Duke of Rothesay, was created Earl of Strathearn, as a subsidiary title to Duke of Cambridge, on 29 April 2011, the day of his wedding to Catherine Middleton.

==Other uses==
* &quot;Strathearn&quot; / &quot;Strathern&quot; is also a surname in the United States and Northern Ireland, predominantly in the Bellaghy area of County Londonderry.

<text>Finchley Road is a London Underground station at the corner of Finchley Road and Canfield Gardens in the London Borough of Camden, north-west London. It is served by the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines and is located in Travelcard Zone 2. On the Jubilee line, the station is between West Hampstead and Swiss Cottage stations. On the Metropolitan line, it is between Wembley Park and Baker Street stations. 

The station is south of the O2 Centre. It serves the Frognal and South Hampstead areas. It is also a five-minute walk from the Finchley Road &amp; Frognal station on the London Overground&#x27;s Mildmay line, and this is marked as an official out-of-station interchange. The station is in a cutting covered by a single glass and metal canopy and is the northernmost station below street level on the line.

== History ==

The station was opened on 30 June 1879 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) on its extension from its now closed station at Swiss Cottage (a different station from the current Swiss Cottage Jubilee line station). The station was rebuilt in 1914 with entrances incorporated into a new parade of shops.

By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan line was suffering from congestion on its main routes from north-west London, caused by the limited capacity of its tracks between Finchley Road and Baker Street stations. To alleviate this congestion new sections of deep tube tunnels were bored between Finchley Road and Baker Street to carry some of the traffic from the Stanmore branch and stations south of Wembley Park. These new tunnels opened on 20 November 1939, and from that date Finchley Road station was also served by Bakerloo line trains running from Baker Street using the new tunnels. The Bakerloo line services were subsequently transferred to the Jubilee line when that line commenced operation on 1 May 1979.

There is a proposal to add a new entrance to the station from the site of the O2 Centre, as a part of the proposal to redevelop the site for housing.

== Services ==

Finchley Road station is served by Jubilee and Metropolitan line services of the London Underground. The Jubilee line uses platforms 2 &amp; 3 and operates a service frequency of about 16 trains per hour between Stanmore and Stratford. The Metropolitan line uses platforms 1 &amp; 4 and offers services to the north-west of London and certain stations in the home counties.

==Connections==
London Buses day and night services call at the station.

<text>Swiss Cottage is a London Underground station at Swiss Cottage, north London. It was opened in 1939 as a stop on the Bakerloo line. Today, the station is on the Jubilee line between and stations. It lies in Travelcard Zone 2 and is located at the junction of Finchley Road, Avenue Road and College Crescent. The station is a local station, with the Metropolitan line bypassing the station nearby.

Swiss Cottage is 550 yards (500 m) from South Hampstead station on the London Overground&#x27;s Lioness line, however this is not a recognised out-of-station interchange.

==History==

The station was opened on 20 November 1939, on a new section of deep-level tunnel constructed between and stations when the Metropolitan line&#x27;s services on its branch were transferred to the Bakerloo line. It is named after a nearby pub built in 1803–4, originally called The Swiss Tavern and later renamed Swiss Cottage.

The new station initially operated as part of a combined station with the Metropolitan line&#x27;s adjacent sub-surface Swiss Cottage station (platforms 1 and 2 were Metropolitan line and 3 and 4 were Bakerloo line), but the Metropolitan line station was closed on 17 August 1940. The Bakerloo line station was subsequently transferred—along with the rest of the Stanmore branch—to the Jubilee line when it opened on 1 May 1979.

The station was used extensively during The Blitz of World War II as an air raid shelter.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 13, 31, 46, 113, 187, 268, 603 and C11 and night routes N28, N31 and N113 serve the station.

<text>St. John&#x27;s Wood is a London Underground station located in St John&#x27;s Wood in the City of Westminster, north-west London. It was opened in 1939 as a stop on the Bakerloo line. Today, the station is on the Jubilee line between Swiss Cottage and Baker Street stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2. Essentially, St. John&#x27;s Wood station is a local station with the nearby Metropolitan line bypassing this station. A Jubilee line journey between St. John&#x27;s Wood and Baker Street typically takes less than three minutes.

==Location==
The station building is located on the corner of Acacia Road and Finchley Road and tube maps from late 1938 and early 1939 indicate that it was originally to be given the name Acacia Road or Acacia. This station is the nearest to Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground and Abbey Road Studios. The station is therefore not to be confused with Abbey Road DLR station in east London.

==History==

=== Station origin as Lord&#x27;s Tube Station === 

&quot;Further Information: Lord&#x27;s Tube Station&quot;

In 1868, the original Tube network extended from St John’s Wood to Swiss Cottage stopping at St John’s Wood and Marlborough Road. St John’s Wood station was right next to Lord’s Cricket Ground and during matches, it even had its own ticket office at the ground. The following year, the Finchally Line tried to extend to Finchley Road in order to get a bigger catchmatch area, but it was not successful. Eventually, they wanted to extend the line to West Hampstead, but were not successful at doing so.

=== Transfer from Lord&#x27;s to St John&#x27;s Wood ===

St John’s Wood Station was not always named St John’s Wood and nor was it always in the same location. The original station in St John’s Wood was named St John’s Wood Road, then St John’s Wood and finally Lords, which was on the Metropolitan Line. Lord’s was once the only station that allowed customers to park their cars on the roof instead of in a ground-level car park or parking garage. 

Right after the start of World War II, Lord’s was renamed to St John’s Wood and the new station served the present-day Bakerloo line. Meanwhile both Lord’s and nearby Marlborough Road shut down due to the close proximity.

During the Second World War, the station was used as a shelter and even had flats that had rooms for servants. Most of the recreational facilities were a short Tube ride away near present day Finchley Road. Despite this, there were still canteens, libraries, bunks and drinking water. 
The station was opened on 20 November 1939 on a new section of deep-level tunnel constructed between Baker Street and Finchley Road when the Metropolitan line&#x27;s services on its Stanmore branch were transferred to the Bakerloo line. The new station replaced two nearby stations on the Metropolitan line which had closed the previous day. These were Lord&#x27;s (originally named &quot;St. John&#x27;s Wood Road&quot;, then &quot;St. John&#x27;s Wood&quot; and, finally, &quot;Lord&#x27;s&quot;) and Marlborough Road.

The station was transferred along with the rest of the Stanmore branch to the Jubilee line when it opened on 1 May 1979.

The station building designed by Stanley Heaps is Grade II listed.

The platform design remains the same as when opened in 1939, with ceramic relief tiles designed by Harold Stabler and that were also fitted to a number of other contemporary stations. In 2006, the tiles were cleaned up and replaced.

=== Transfer from Bakerloo Line to Jubilee Line ===

After the start of World War II, Lord&#x27;s station closed and was replaced by St John&#x27;s Wood, which was on the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line. At the time, there were two branches of this line: the Stanmore Branch and the Watford branch, although getting to Watford required a change at Harrow and Wealdstone. In 1979, the Jubilee line was opened and replaced the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line while the Watford branch remained the Bakerloo line.

In March 2007, a test was held at the station to allow understanding of how toxic gas might spread throughout London Underground stations and buildings during a terrorist attack. A non-toxic test gas – Sulfur hexafluoride – was released throughout the station, and monitored as it drifted around. The station operated as normal throughout the tests.

==Services==
St John&#x27;s Wood station is on the Jubilee line between Swiss Cottage to the north and Baker Street to the south. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–5 minutes between 05:54 and 00:18 in both directions. During some events at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, this station sometimes becomes exit only. Other nearby stations are Maida Vale, Warwick Avenue, Swiss Cottage and Baker Street. 

=== Up-lighters ===

Up-lighters are lights that are seen along the escalator as a way to help see and provide light all the way from the street to the platform. It also helps keep the passengers in line with where they are going at all times. The up-lighters date back to 1939 when the station first opened.

== Incidents ==
In the spring of 2021, there was an incident where a passenger was found on the tracks. It led to life-changing injuries and the individual was taken to hospital. There were no grounds for suspicion but police and fire officers were sent to St John’s Wood station in order to investigate the issue. This caused the Jubilee line to be suspended and then it was running on severe delays due to the incident.

== Accessibility ==

There is one gate inward and one gate outward from the Tube that is big enough to fit a buggy or wheelchair. The station is not step free and the only way to access the platforms is by escalator or stairs. Prior to 1993, it was illegal to have a wheelchair anywhere on the London Underground due to fire safety concerns.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 13, 46, 113, 187 and night route N113 serve the station.

== In popular culture ==
The station appeared in the music video for &quot;Bedsitter&quot; by Soft Cell.

The recording of the underground train heard at the beginning and end of The Jam&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot; was recorded at St John&#x27;s Wood. 

A common trivia question is, &quot;Which London Underground station does not contain any of the letters in the word &quot;mackerel&quot;? The answer is St John&#x27;s Wood, which does not contain any of the letters A-C-E-K-L-M-R. This is only true because the word &quot;Saint&quot; is always abbreviated &quot;St&quot; in the name, and because Hoxton is on the London Overground but not the Underground. Victoria Coren Mitchell described this as her favourite trivia question. Two former stations also fulfill the mackerel test: Wotton and Wood Siding, which were part of the Underground network between 1933 and 1935.

<text>Bond Street is an interchange station in Mayfair, in the West End of London for London Underground and Elizabeth line services. Entrances are on Oxford Street, near its junction with New Bond Street, and on Hanover Square.

The London Underground station is served by the Central and Jubilee lines. On the Central line, the station is between Marble Arch and Oxford Circus stations. On the Jubilee line, it is between Baker Street and Green Park stations. The Elizabeth line station is between Paddington and Tottenham Court Road stations. 

The station is in fare zone 1.

==History==

The station was first opened on 24 September 1900 by the Central London Railway, three months after the first stations on the Central line opened. The surface building was designed, in common with all original CLR stations, by the architect Harry Bell Measures. The original plans for the railway named the station as Davies Street rather than Bond Street.

In 1920 a possible joint venture was considered by London Underground and the nearby Selfridges store. This would have involved rebuilding the station, to include an entrance in Selfridge&#x27;s basement. The idea was revisited in the early 1930s, leading to a concept of a subway connecting the station to the store, with a new ticket office in the basement of Selfridge&#x27;s. However, these plans were not pursued, probably due to the cost of the construction.

The station has had several major reconstructions. The first, which saw the original lifts replaced by escalators, and the addition of a new sub-surface ticket hall and new station façade, designed by the architect Charles Holden, came into use on 8 June 1926. The tiling to the new ticket hall used the same tiling scheme used by Holden on other station projects at the time (notably the extension of the City and South London Railway to Morden).

===Jubilee line era===
In the 1970s, the Jubilee line was extended through central London to Charing Cross, via Bond Street. As part of the construction of the line, the station ticket hall was extended and new entrances were provided on the north side of Oxford Street and to the east of Davies Street. The Holden facade was demolished along with the Grosvenor Court Hotel that occupied the corner of Oxford Street and Davies Street, being replaced by the &quot;West One&quot; shopping arcade with offices above. The Jubilee line opened on 1 May 1979.

In 2007, the station underwent a visual modernisation, removing the murals installed on the Central line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style similar to those used when the station opened in 1900.

=== 21st century ===
In the 2010s, the station was upgraded and expanded in preparation for the arrival of the Elizabeth line, bringing Bond Street into the National Rail network. As part of these works, the Central line platforms closed from April to June 2014, and the Jubilee line platforms closed from July to December 2014.

The £300m upgrade increased the capacity of the station entrances and exits by 30 per cent, added a new entrance to the station on Marylebone Lane on the north side of Oxford Street, and installed lifts to make the station step-free. It was completed in November 2017, prior to the completion of the Elizabeth line.

During London Fashion Week in September 2023, TfL renamed the station to Burberry Street, as a publicity for the fashion company, Burberry. The name was reverted to Bond Street at the end of the fashion week.

==== Elizabeth line ====
Between 2009 and 2022, the Crossrail project built a new Elizabeth line station at Bond Street. Originally planned to open in 2018, Bond Street did not open with the rest of the central London Elizabeth line stations in May 2022, due to tunnelling problems dating back to 2014. The various delays meant that the station was approximately £500m over budget. 

The Elizabeth line station was opened on 24 October 2022 by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.

Two new ticket halls were built by Crossrail at Davies Street and Hanover Square. Architects included John McAslan and Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. Although there is no connecting corridor, the Hanover Square exit of the Bond Street Elizabeth line station is approximately from Oxford Circus tube station and out-of-station interchange is permitted, allowing interchange with the Bakerloo and Victoria lines. The escalators to the Hanover Square exit, at are the longest on the Elizabeth line, and the second longest on the Transport for London (TfL) network, shorter than those at Angel station on the Northern line.

== Services ==
Services at Bond Street are operated by the Elizabeth line, and London Underground&#x27;s Central and Jubilee lines.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

The station also served by a night service on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Tube. The station is served by Central and Jubilee line trains every 10 minutes in each direction.

== Artwork ==

The station features multiple pieces of artwork. On the Jubilee line platforms, Tom Eckersley designed a stylised &quot;hat box&quot; motif. The Elizabeth line station has three artworks by British artist Darren Almond. Located in and around the western Davies Street entrance, these artworks reference nameplates attached to railway locomotives.

== Cultural references ==
The westbound Central line platform of the station is featured on the cover art for The Jam&#x27;s 1978 single &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot;, with the band standing at the end of the platform as a 1962 Stock train rushes into the station.

== Connections ==
A large number of London Bus routes serve the station during the day and night.

<text>Târgu Mureș (, ; ; German: &quot;Neumarkt am Mieresch&quot;) is the seat of Mureș County in the historical region of Transylvania, Romania. It is the 16th-largest city in Romania, with 116,033 inhabitants as of the 2021 census. It lies on the Mureș River, the second-longest river in Romania (after the Danube).

==Names and etymology==


The current Romanian name of the city, &quot;Târgu Mureș&quot;, is the equivalent of the Hungarian &quot;Marosvásárhely&quot;, both meaning &quot;market on the Mureș (Maros) [River]&quot;. &quot;Târg&quot; means &quot;market&quot; in Romanian and &quot;vásárhely&quot; means &quot;marketplace&quot; in Hungarian. Local Hungarians often shorten &quot;Marosvásárhely&quot; to &quot;Vásárhely&quot; in speech.

The Jesuit priest Martin Szentiványi provides the first known written reference naming the city; in his work &quot;Dissertatio Paralipomenonica Rerum Memorabilium Hungariae&quot; (written in 1699) he records the name as &quot;Asserculis&quot; by stating, in Latin, &quot;Asserculis, hoc est Szekely Vasarhely&quot;, meaning, &quot;Asserculis, here is Szekely Vasarhely&quot;. He provides the year 1230 for the reference. A second work of his, &quot;Curiosiora Et Selectiora Variarum Scientiarum Miscellanea&quot; (dated 1702) also mentions this name.

Another written reference of the city was in the Papal registry in Latin as &quot;Novum Forum Siculorum&quot; in 1332, and later as &quot;Sekulvasarhel&quot; (modern Hungarian: &quot;Székelyvásárhely&quot;), meaning &quot;market of the Székelys&quot;, in 1349. Greek traders called it &quot;Agropolis&quot;. Another name for it was &quot;Areopolis&quot;.

In 1616, Gabriel Bethlen gave the name &quot;Marosvásárhely&quot; to the newly upgraded royal free city. The Romanian name for the city, &quot;Oșorhei&quot; was a phonetic derivation from &quot;Vásárhely&quot; while the German name for the town, &quot;Neumarkt am Mieresch&quot; (also shortened to &quot;Neumarkt&quot; or &quot;Marktstadt&quot;; in Transylvanian Saxon, &quot;Nai Mark&quot; or &quot;Nai Muark&quot;), can be translated as &quot;New Market&quot;.

Other historical Romanian names for the town besides &quot;Oșorhei&quot; were &quot;Mureș-Oșorhei&quot; and &quot;Târgul-Mureșului&quot;; other historical Hungarian names in addition to &quot;Székelyvásárhely&quot; included &quot;Újszékelyvásár&quot; and &quot;Újvásár&quot;.

After World War I, Marosvásárhely became part of Romania and was renamed &quot;Oșorheiu&quot;. The name &quot;Târgu Mureș&quot; became common in the interwar period. After World War II, the spelling of the city&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Tîrgu Mureș&quot;, following a 1953 spelling reform that replaced the letter &quot;â&quot; with &quot;î&quot; in all words. Another spelling reform in 1993 replaced the letter &quot;î&quot; with &quot;â&quot; in many words and the city&#x27;s name has since been officially spelled &quot;Târgu Mureș&quot;.

==History==


The first known recorded documentation of the city dates to 1332. It is mentioned in the papal registry under the Latin name &quot;Novum Forum Siculorum&quot; meaning &quot;New Szekler Marketplace&quot;, and under the Hungarian name &quot;Sekulvasarhel&quot; (Székelyvásárhely) meaning &quot;Szekler Marketplace&quot; in 1349.

Prior to 1332 a Dominican church stood where the Fortress&#x27; Church is now sited, up until the Mongol invasion, when it was destroyed. The current Fortress&#x27; Church was built by the Franciscans in a new Gothic-style around 1332.

In 1405, the King of Hungary Sigismund of Luxembourg granted the city the right to organize fairs. Since 1439 the town was the scene of the sessions of the Transylvanian parliament (diet) 36 times. In 1470 King Matthias Corvinus granted the first judicial privilege to the city, and in 1482 declared the city a royal settlement. In 1492, wayvoda (prince) István Báthory strengthened a monastery with fortifications.

In 1506, the troops of Pál Tomori were beaten by the Székelys who were rising against the payment of an extraordinary Ox tax imposed on them on occasion of the birth of Louis II of Hungary. In 1557, the Reformed Church College (i.e., Presbyterians) was established as the oldest Hungarian school of Transylvania. In 1571, the session of the Transylvanian parliament under prince John II Sigismund Zápolya accepted the free preaching of the word of God, including by the Unitarian Church. In 1600–1601, as a result of the siege of Giorgio Basta under the direction of Emperor Rudolf II, the fortress crumbled to ruins. In 1602, the troops of Gergely Németh put on fire the remaining houses of the town, therefore, in 1602 the reconstruction of the fortress was started on the advice of mayor Tamás Borsos, but it was actually built between 1614 and 1653. Mózes Székely the only prince of Szekler origin visited the city in 1603 when he liberated Transylvania from foreign domination. In 1616, Târgu Mureș was granted the status of a free royal city under the name of Maros-Vásárhely by fejedelem (prince) Gábor Bethlen.

In 1658 Ottoman and Tartar troops invaded the city and burned it, where 3,000 people were taken into captivity. In 1661, as no one showed willingness to accept the duty of prince, under Turkish pressure Mihály Apafi was elected prince of Transylvania here. In 1662, resulting from the negligence of the Turkish military residing here, the city almost completely burnt down. In 1687 it was devastated by German imperial troops. In 1704, the kuruc troops of Pál Kaszás occupied the fortress, which was re-occupied by Austrian troops led by Lőrinc Pekry in 1706. On 5 April 1707 Francis II Rákóczi was raised to the chair of princes here. In 1707 the city was struck by the plague with more than 3,500 deaths. The plague renewed in 1709, 1719 and in 1738–39.

The city received a major boost to its social and economic life when it became home to the Supreme Court of Justice of the Principality of Transylvania in 1754. In 1802, the Teleki Library founded by count Sámuel Teleki opened to the public with 40,000 volumes.

Avram Iancu, the leader of the 1848 Romanian revolution in Transylvania, was a young lawyer in the city of Marosvásárhely before engaging in the fight for the rights of the Romanians living in Transylvania. On 4 November 1848, the Szekler troops were beaten by the Austrian imperial troops under its walls, and the city was also captured. On 13 January 1849 the troops of major Tolnay recaptured it. On 30 July 1849, Sándor Petőfi and Józef Bem set out from here for the Battle of Segesvár. Finally, the Austrian commander Karl von Urban captured the city on 2 August 1849, closing the chapter of the Revolutionary War in the city.

In 1854, Szekler martyrs Károly Horváth, János Török, and Mihály Gálfi were executed on the Postarét for plotting against Austrian rule. Since 1874 a monument marks the place. In 1861, Marosvásárhely became the seat of Marosszék, in 1876 that of Maros-Torda County. In 1880 the statue of Bem was inaugurated in Roses Square, in downtown area; in 1893 the statue of Kossuth was as well. The statue of Rákóczi was also inaugurated in 1907. All three statues were demolished between 1919 in 1923, after Transylvania became part of Romania.

The provincial appearance of the city changed greatly in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1913, the Hungarian Art-Nouveau style city hall complex and Palace of Culture was inaugurated, as part of mayor Bernády György&#x27;s urban renewal. After World War I, together with the rest of Transylvania, Marosvásáshely became part of Romania and became known as &quot;Târgu Mureș&quot;. From having been an 89% Hungarian-populated city (in 1910), the Romanian population increased throughout the second half of the 20th century.

From 1940 to 1944, as a consequence of the Second Vienna Award, the city was ceded back to the Kingdom of Hungary. After Hungary was occupied by Germany in 1944, a Jewish ghetto was established in the city. Târgu Mureș re-entered the Romanian administration in October 1944. However, on 12 November 1944 General Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov of the Soviet Red Army expelled the returning Romanian authorities from Northern Transylvania with reference to the massacres committed by members of the so-called Maniu Guard, and the Romanian authorities were not allowed to return until the government of Petru Groza was formed on 6 March 1945.

After World War II, the communist administration of Romania conducted a policy of massive industrialization that completely re-shaped the community. Between 1950 and 1968, Târgu Mureș was the center of the Magyar Autonomous Region, later renamed as Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. On 7 September 1959, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Secretary-General of the Romanian Workers Party, and Prime Minister Chivu Stoica visited the city. It was decided at the time where to build the fertilizer production plant, and the new residential quarters of the city. It was decided that the residential quarters would not be built in the Mureș valley, but on the surrounding hills.

In March 1990, shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 overthrew the communist regime, the city was the scene of violent ethnic clashes between ethnic Hungarians and ethnic Romanians.

In the 21st century, the local economy started to get stronger after various investors settled in the area. In 2020 the city elected Independent candidate Zoltán Soós as mayor - the first ethnic Hungarian in twenty years.

==Main sights==
===Places of worship===
The Reformed Fortress Church is the oldest church in the town. According to historical evidence, less than a century had passed after the first appearance of the Franciscan order in Transylvania, Hungarian Kingdom, that the Franciscan friars arrived at Vásárhely. The building of the church took an entire century, from the middle of the 14th century until the middle of the 15th and it consisted of a monastery building, an older chapel, the church and the steeple. The church was finalized between 1400 and 1450. The church may have been originally decorated with frescos, as traces of mural paintings were found inside. The almost complete disappearance of these paintings is due to the fact that the church became the property of Protestant believers in 1557. The religious reform required for churches to have no paintings, statues or religious frescos.

The existence of the Franciscan order in Vásárhely was directly affected by the religious reform which was largely spread in Transylvania during the 16th century. In 1557, the influence of the Reformed Church over the Hungarians in the town was so strong that it eventually led to the confiscation of the properties of Catholic monastic orders. Franciscan friars, who until that time had been attending the church in the fortress, were forced to leave town. They returned after nearly two centuries when the political climate had become favorable to Catholicism due to the instauration of the Habsburgs in Transylvania. They bought the land in the center of the town where they built a new church and monastery by 1777. The tower, the only part that is still standing, was added to the church&#x27;s façade in 1802 by architect János Topler. In 1971 the municipality decided to demolish the monastery to create the necessary space for the construction of the National Theater and the square in front of it. A new church was built in 1972 for the Franciscans on Libertății street.

At the beginning of the 18th century, one of the most representative Baroque churches of Transylvania was built in the town. St John the Baptist Church was erected in the North-Eastern part of the city center and belongs to the Roman Catholic parish. The inside of the church is luxurious, with liturgical objects that are true works of art. The main altar, made in 1755 by Anton Schuchbauer and Johannes Nachtigal is of monumental dimensions and has a pseudo-architectural structure. The paintings of the altars in the lateral chapels: Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, Saint Joseph, Saint John of Nepomuc, Holy Cross belong to the same Michael Angelo Unterberger. The stained glass windows made by the Türke Company of Grottau were installed in 1898.

The Great Synagogue (also known as the Big Synagogue) was built between 1899 and 1900 at the initiative of the Jewish community &quot;Status Quo&quot;. The design of the building was drawn up by Gartner Jacob from Vienna and the construction works were coordinated by the Hungarian Pál Soós. The entire edifice is dominated by the central cupola. Each side of the central spire is decorated with a floral rosette similar to the ones on the façade. This type of window is also used several times on the lateral façades. The vast interior is richly decorated, both with shapes and color. The synagogue has 314 seats on the ground floor and 238 on the top floor. The most recent large scale remodeling of the building took place in 2000 when the walls were reinforced and the interior decoration was re-done.

The existence of the Unitarian faith in the town is linked to the name of Ferenc Dávid, founder of Unitarianism and the first Unitarian bishop. The political circumstances in Transylvania became favourable for Ferenc Dávid&#x27;s activity as the Diet of Torda held between 1557 and 1568 granted freedom of faith to all religions in Transylvania. The Unitarianism became religio-recepta together with all the other Protestant faiths. The king of the state himself, John II Sigismund Zápolya became Unitarian. The Unitarian Church was built between 1929 and 1930 next to the old Unitarian prayer house dating from 1869.
===Other sights===

The first fortress in the town was erected in 1492 upon order of voivode Stephen Báthory, and was accomplished somewhere between 1602 and 1652 under judge Tamás Borsos. Having a pentagon plan, surrounded by a defense wall, the Citadel has seven forts, five of them bearing the names of the guild which – according to tradition – supported its maintenance: the leather dressers&#x27;, the tailors&#x27;, the butchers&#x27;, the ironmongers&#x27;, the coopers&#x27;. After the Citadel was taken over by the Austrian troops, it became the headquarters of the military garrison based in the town. In the meantime the Baroque style building was built (on the left hand side of the road in front of the entrance gate) and in the second half of the 18th century the construction works of the &quot;barkey&quot; were started, an addition finished in the 19th century. On the occasion of the Târgu Mureș days – which have as central point of performance the Citadel – a museum center was opened in the gate fort (erected in 1613) presenting the history of the town and of the Citadel.

The Teleki-Bolyai Library is a historic public library and current museum in the town. One of the richest Transylvanian collections of cultural artefacts, it was founded by the Hungarian Count Sámuel Teleki in 1802, at the time when Transylvania was part of the Habsburg monarchy, and has been open to the reading public ever since. It was among the first institutions of its kind inside the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Hungary. It houses over 200,000 volumes, of which many are rarities, constituting a comprehensive scientific database. The book collection is divided into several smaller libraries, of which the two main donations are the original 40,000-volume Teleki Library and the 80,000-volume Bolyai Library; the rest, grouped as the &quot;Miscellaneous Collection&quot;, is made up of several private libraries, volumes previously held by religious schools and those of a Franciscan friary. Overall, the library constitutes a collection of most traditional types of Transylvanian book.

The old City Hall was built in 1906–1907 after the construction plans of Márcell Komor and Dezső Jakab. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading to the first floor, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by Gothic architecture. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of the front hall include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of the banister resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on Hungarian-Székely folk motives made of polychromatic ceramics. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the middle area of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated Gábor Bethlen, Francis II Rákóczi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc Deák and Franz Joseph I of Austria are missing from the halls.

The Palace of Culture is a remarkable construction in the city center. It was built upon initiative of the mayor of the town, György Bernády. Building works started in the spring of 1911. They contributed to the establishment of the distinctively flavored Hungarian Art Nouveau school in Transylvania by their works in Deva and Oradea. The plan is an irregular rectangle, with protuberances on the sides and at the extremities. The building has five floors: a tall ground floor, a mezzanine and three floors differentiated by the use of various construction materials. The façades are characterized by bi-dimensionality and by a liniar-rectangular style, with only a few curvilinear elements: the six bow-windows covered by semi-caps above the main portal and the circular balconies on the edges. The main entrance is in the middle of the façade on Enescu street and is made up of four massive doors, protected by an architectural element made of glass and with an iron framing. This element, as well as the doors decorated with iron floral motifs are typical for the early 20th century style. The exterior is richly decorated, with colored mosaic panels, with relieved scenes and busts of Hungarians. The mosaic on the main façade is an allegorical scene inspired by the Hungarian folklore. The cardboards were made by Nagy Sándor, a Hungarian artist, who founded with Körösföy Kriesch Aladár the School of Gödöllő. The art is characterized by bi-dimensionality and vertical rhythmicalness. Most of the mosaics and stained glass windows were authored by Róth Miksa, particularly those on the side facing Square.

The city skyline can be seen from Cornești Heights [&quot;in Hungarian: Somostető&quot;].

==Culture==

Beside the main companies, there are also alternative underground theater companies called &quot;Yorick Studio&quot; and &quot;Teatru 74&quot;.

The city was home to the Peninsula / Félsziget Festival, Romania&#x27;s former biggest music festival.

The establishment was one of the first schools of the Reformed Church in Transylvania, was first working in the old building of the Franciscan friary in the fortress, and had Baranyai Decsi Czimor János, Tordai Ádám, Laskói Csókás Péter as teachers, as well as others. After being sacked in 1601 and 1602, the &quot;Schola&quot; was moved into another building, on the place of the present high school. For centuries it had accommodated the Reformed College and the present high school. The present aspect was acquired at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

<text>Southwark () is a London Underground station in the London Borough of Southwark at the corner of Blackfriars Road and The Cut. It is between and stations on the Jubilee line, and is in Travelcard Zone 1. It was opened on 20 November 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension. The station is somewhat west of historic Southwark, which is served by Borough and London Bridge stations. Its entrance is across the road from the disused Blackfriars Road railway station.

==History==
The original plan for the Jubilee Line Extension did not include a station between those at Waterloo and London Bridge; Southwark station was added after lobbying by the local council as well as North Southwark and Bermondsey MP Simon Hughes.

The architects MacCormac, Jamieson, Prichard were appointed in January 1991 by the Jubilee Line Extension design team led by Roland Paoletti. Planning approval for the station was given in 1992, with the contract to build the station and adjacent tunnels awarded to a joint venture of Aoki Corporation and Soletanche in November 1993 at a cost of £64 million. Construction began in 1994, with tunnelling beginning in April 1995.

Built on a cramped site, with its platforms underneath the Victorian main line viaduct between Waterloo East and London Bridge stations, the station presented significant technical and architectural difficulties which were resolved by constructing two concourses at different levels. Substantial compensation grouting was required to stabilise the railway viaducts. The station opened with the final phase of the Jubilee Line Extension on 20 November 1999.

Although it is close to Waterloo, not near the Bankside attractions it was intended to serve, and its only National Rail interchange is to main line station; the passenger usage matches those of other minor central stations. It does however get over twice the traffic of nearby Borough station, and around three times that of Lambeth North.

==Design==

The station was designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MacCormac, Jamieson, Prichard. Jubilee Line Extension project director Hugh Doherty called the station a &quot;remarkable feat of engineering&quot;.

The upper concourse is the centrepiece of the station. It is a space high with a glass roof that allows daylight to enter deep into the station. It is faced with a spectacular glass wall, long, consisting of 660 specially cut pieces of blue glass, which was designed by the artist Alexander Beleschenko. MacCormac said the design of this and the lower concourse was inspired by a stage set design by 19th-century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel for The Magic Flute. The wall is one of the extension&#x27;s more celebrated architectural features, winning critical approval and a number of awards.

The two platforms have platform screen doors which are meant to prevent passengers or debris from falling onto the tracks. They are connected at each end to the lower concourse which is a simple tunnel between the platforms and is illuminated by glass and steel &quot;beacons&quot; at each end, and is faced with stainless steel panels, deliberately left unpolished. Stairs lead up to a section of high floor in the central area of the tunnel, from where three narrow tube-like escalator shafts lead sideways (south) to the higher concourse.

One end of the higher concourse connects to Waterloo East station, and the other end to the station&#x27;s modest low-rise entrance building which is intended as a base for a future commercial development.

In 2000, the station was awarded a Royal Institute of British Architects Bronze medal, as well as being named Royal Fine Arts Commission/British Sky Broadcasting Building of the Year.

London Buses routes 40, 63 and night routes N63 and N89 serve the station.

<text>Bermondsey () is a London Underground station. It is in the eastern part of Bermondsey in the London Borough of Southwark and also serves the western part of Rotherhithe, in south-east London.

The station itself was designed by Ian Ritchie Architects. Although it was originally intended to have a multi-storey office building on the top, London Underground have yet to realise the second phase of the scheme.

It is on the Jubilee line, having been built as part of the Jubilee Line Extension from 1999 between and stations. It is notable for its extensive use of natural light. The main station entrance is on the south side of Jamaica Road. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
The station was opened on 17 September 1999. 

In 2002, a plaque to Dr Alfred Salter - who worked to improve the &quot;living conditions of the poor in the Bermondsey area&quot; in the 20th century - was unveiled by local MP Simon Hughes. The station had been built on the site of Salter&#x27;s former doctors surgery.

==Station design==
Like its extension counterparts, Bermondsey station was designed with a futuristic style in mind by Ian Ritchie Architects. Extensively using natural light, it is built in both a cut-and-cover and tube design. The cut-and-cover section is supported by latticed concrete beams allowing light to penetrate to the platform level. The escalators down to this area are lined by flat concrete with a high ceiling to give a feeling of spaciousness. The bored section is encased with metal to keep in line the futuristic and metallic theme of the extension. As with all other deep level stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, Bermondsey station has platform screen doors for passenger safety and comfort.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 47, 188, 381 and C10 and night routes N199 and N381 serve the station.

<doc id="370053" wikidata="Q1245075" url="?curid=370053" title="Monmouthshire (historic)">
<text>Monmouthshire ( ), also formerly known as the County of Monmouth ( ; ), was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales in the south-east of Wales, on the border with England. Its area now corresponds approximately to the present principal areas of Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Newport and Torfaen, and those parts of Caerphilly and Cardiff east of the Rhymney River. 
The eastern part of the county was mainly agricultural, while the western valleys had rich mineral resources. This led to the area becoming highly industrialised with coal mining and iron working being major employers from the 18th century to the late 20th century. Its five largest towns were Newport, Cwmbran, Pontypool, Ebbw Vale and Abergavenny.

Monmouthshire&#x27;s Welsh status was ambiguous between the 16th and 20th centuries, with it considered by some to be part of England during this time; its legal inclusion in Wales was clarified by the Local Government Act 1972, the same act that changed the structure of local government within the county.

==History==
===Formation===
The &quot;county or shire of Monmouth&quot; was formed from parts of the Welsh Marches by the Laws in Wales Act 1535. According to the Act the shire consisted of all &quot;Honours, Lordships, Castles, Manors, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, lying or being within the Compass or Precinct&quot; of the following &quot;Lordships, Townships, Parishes, Commotes and Cantrefs... in the Country of Wales&quot;:

Monmouth • Chepstow • &quot;Matherne&quot; (Mathern) • &quot;Llanvihangel&quot; (Llanfihangel Rogiet) • &quot;Magour&quot; (Magor) • &quot;Goldcliffe&quot; (Goldcliff) • Newport • Wentlooge • &quot;Llanwerne&quot; (Llanwern) • &quot;Caerlion&quot; (Caerleon) • Usk • &quot;Treleck&quot; (Trellech) • Tintern • Skenfrith • Grosmont • &quot;Witecastle&quot; (White Castle) • Raglan • &quot;Calicote&quot; (Caldicot) • &quot;Biston&quot; (Bishton) • Abergavenny • &quot;Penrose&quot; (Penrhos) • &quot;Grenefield&quot; (Maesglas) • &quot;Maghen&quot; (Machen) • &quot;Hochuyslade&quot; (possessions of Llanthony Priory)

The Act also designated Monmouth as the &quot;Head and Shire town of the said county or shire of Monmouth&quot;, and ordered that the Sheriff&#x27;s county or shire court be held alternately in Monmouth and Newport.

===Boundaries and subdivisions===

The county boundaries are the River Wye on the east, dividing it from Gloucestershire and the Rhymney River to the west dividing it from Glamorganshire, with the Bristol Channel to the south. The boundaries with Herefordshire to the northeast and Brecknockshire to the north were less well-defined. The parish of Welsh Bicknor, was an exclave of Monmouthshire, sandwiched between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The area was considered part of Monmouthshire until it was made part of Herefordshire &quot;for all purposes&quot; by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, while the Herefordshire hamlet of Fwthog (or Ffwddog) adjoining the Honddu Valley remained an exclave within Monmouthshire until 1891.

The county was divided into six hundreds in 1542: Abergavenny, Caldicot, Raglan, Skenfrith, Usk and Wentloog.

The county contained the three boroughs of Monmouth, Newport and Usk.

==== Civil parishes ====
In the medieval period Monmouthshire was divided into the following civil parishes, listed by hundred (chapelries in &quot;italics&quot;):

1extra-parochial, but still had its own church

===Municipal reform===
Monmouth and Newport were reformed as municipal boroughs with elected town councils by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Usk continued as an unreformed borough until its final abolition in 1886.

New forms of local government were established in the urban areas of the county with the setting of local boards under the Public Health Act 1848 and Local Government Act 1858. The Public Health Act 1875 divided the rural areas into rural sanitary districts.
An administrative county of Monmouthshire, governed by an elected county council, was formed in 1889 under the terms of the Local Government Act 1888. The act directed that where urban sanitary districts straddled county boundaries they should be placed entirely in the administrative county which had the majority of the urban sanitary district&#x27;s population. Along the boundary between Monmouthshire and Brecknockshire were four urban sanitary districts which straddled the county boundary: Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale, Rhymney, and Tredegar. The majority of Brynmawr&#x27;s population was in Brecknockshire, and so the southern parts of Brynmawr within Monmouthshire were transferred to the administrative county of Brecknockshire. For the other three urban sanitary districts the majority of the population was in Monmouthshire, which therefore gained from Brecknockshire the Beaufort and Rassau areas of Ebbw Vale, the Dukestown area of Tredegar, and the Llechryd area of Rhymney.

The county council was based in Newport, rather than the historic county town of Monmouth. In 1891 the borough of Newport achieved county borough status and therefore left the administrative county, although the administration of the county council continued to be based at Shire Hall, Newport. In the same year the parish of Fwthog was transferred to both the administrative and geographic county of Monmouthshire.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the administrative county was divided into urban and rural districts, based on existing sanitary districts.


In 1899 Abergavenny was incorporated as a borough. Two further urban districts were formed: Mynyddislwyn in 1903, and Bedwas and Machen in 1912. The County of Monmouth Review Order 1935 revised the number and boundaries of the urban and rural districts in the administrative county. A new Cwmbran urban district was formed by the abolition of Llanfrechfa Upper and Llantarnam UDs, Abersychan and Panteg UDs were absorbed by Pontypool urban district, and Magor and St Mellons RD was formed by a merger of two rural districts.

The county boundaries provided the basis of the boundaries of the new Diocese of Monmouth, created in October 1921 following the disestablishment of the Church in Wales from the Church of England in April 1920. The Diocese covered all of the County of Monmouthshire but also included the Parish of Cyncoed in north-east Cardiff, a situation which continues in 2023. 

The last major boundary change to affect the administrative county came in 1938 when the Monmouthshire parish of Rumney was incorporated into the city and county borough of Cardiff. However, the geographical Monmouthshire/Glamorgan and England/Wales border remained the Rhymney River.

=== Local government reform ===
The administrative county of Monmouth and county borough of Newport were abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The successor authority, with minor boundary changes, was titled Gwent. Some border parishes became part of the new Rhymney Valley district of Mid Glamorgan or the Cardiff district of South Glamorgan.

==Ambiguity over status==

===Background===
The historic county covers an area roughly contiguous with the medieval Kingdom of Gwent&#x27;s core Cantrefi of &quot;Gwent Uch-coed&quot;, &quot;Gwent Is-coed&quot;, which 

Gwent became part of the Kingdom of Morgannwg in the 10th century, and part of the unified Kingdom of Wales under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Following the Norman invasion of Wales, Monmouthshire was subject to the Marcher Lords, and was not subject to English law. Following the Acts of Union the land which is today called Monmouthshire was undisputedly in Wales.

===The 16th to 19th centuries===

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 integrated Wales directly into the English legal system and the &quot;Lordships Marchers within the said Country or Dominion of Wales&quot; were allocated to existing and new shires. Some lordships were annexed to existing counties in England and some were annexed to existing counties in Wales, with the remainder being divided up into new counties, one of which was Monmouthshire.

Although the original Laws in Wales Act 1535 specifically includes Monmouthshire as being in the &quot;Country or Dominion of Wales&quot;, the Laws in Wales Act 1542 enumerates the Welsh counties as twelve in number, omitting Monmouthshire from the count. Monmouthshire was made directly responsible to the courts of Westminster rather than falling under the Court of Great Sessions in Wales. According to historian John Davies, this arrangement was the origin of the belief that the county had been annexed by England rather than remaining part of Wales. Davies disagrees, and says, &quot;Monmouthshire was no less Welsh in language and sentiment than any other eastern county&quot;. Moreover the belief that Monmouthshire was somehow specially annexed to England is not consistent with the wording in the Act &quot;That his said Country or Dominion of Wales shall be, stand and continue for ever from henceforth incorporated, united and annexed to and with this his Realm of England&quot;, making it clear that the whole of Wales was being &quot;annexed&quot; to England, not just Monmouthshire.

Despite Monmouthshire being a new county, it was given two knights of the shire in common with existing counties in England, rather than one as in the counties in Wales. The relevant section of the Act states that &quot;one Knight shall be chosen and elected to the same Parliaments for every of the Shires of Brecknock, Radnor, Montgomery and Denbigh, and for every other Shire within the said Country of Dominion of Wales&quot;. However, it was given only one Borough member, like the other Welsh counties (apart from Pembrokeshire which had two Borough members and Merioneth which had none). In ecclesiastical terms, most of the county outside the town of Monmouth itself remained within the Diocese of Llandaff; the town of Monmouth was in the diocese of Hereford, while the parishes of Cwmyoy and Llanthony were in the diocese of St David&#x27;s. In 1549 Edward VI granted a Charter to Monmouth which was described as being &quot;in the Marches of Wales&quot;. Later writers who described Monmouthshire as being in Wales included Humphrey Llwyd (&quot;History of Cambria&quot;, 1568); Thomas Churchyard (&quot;Worthiness of Wales&quot;, 1587); and Michael Drayton (&quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;, 1613).

In the late 17th century, under Charles II, Monmouthshire was added to the Oxford circuit of the English assizes following which, according to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, it gradually &quot;came to be regarded as an English county&quot;. The &quot;Modern Universal British Traveller&quot; of 1779 stated: &quot;Monmouthshire was formerly a part of Wales, and continued so till the reign of Charles II, when it was reckoned an English county (as it has been ever since) because the judges then began to keep the assizes here in the Oxford circuit.&quot; A later traveller, George Borrow in 1862, wrote: &quot;Monmouthshire is at present considered an English county, though certainly with little reason, for it not only stands on the western side of the Wye, but the names of almost all its parishes are Welsh, and many thousands of its population still speak the Welsh language.&quot;

Although Wales was legally integrated into England, the word &quot;England&quot; was still taken to exclude Wales in many contexts. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 ensured that &quot;in all Cases where the Kingdom of England, or that Part of Great Britain called England, hath been or shall be mentioned in any Act of Parliament, the same has been and shall from henceforth be deemed and taken to comprehend and include the Dominion of Wales and Town of Berwick upon Tweed&quot;.

The eastern part of the county is mainly agricultural, while the western valleys had rich mineral resources. This led to the area becoming highly industrialised with coal mining and iron working being major employers from the 18th century to the late 20th century.

===&quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;===

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; unambiguously described the county as part of England, but notes that &quot;whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire&quot;. However, most Acts of Parliament listed Monmouthshire as part of England; for example, the Local Government Act 1933 listed both the administrative county of Monmouth and county borough of Newport as part of England. In the rare event that an Act of Parliament was restricted to Wales, Monmouthshire was usually included, in the format &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;; for example, although the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 did not apply to Monmouthshire, the creation of the Welsh Office in 1965 and the Welsh Language Act 1967 did (although the latter had the paradoxical effect of reinforcing the legal connection of Monmouthshire with England: see next section). The Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 also applied to Monmouthshire. The Sunday Closing Act was also extended to Monmouthshire in 1915 under wartime legislation. In considering the Sunday Closing Act in 1921, Monmouthshire County Council resolved, with only one vote against, to request that the county should be included in Wales for all legislative purposes. Another typical example was the division of England and Wales into registration areas in the 19th century — one of which, the &quot;Welsh Division&quot;, was defined as including &quot;Monmouthshire, South Wales and North Wales&quot;.

According to Chris Williams of Cardiff University:&quot;...The problem with Monmouthshire is that it was located not on, strictly speaking, a national frontier, but within a single political formation. This had been the case since the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543 which had extended the English system of justice, government and parliamentary representation to the principality of Wales and the March. From the mid-sixteenth century to the early nineteenth century it had not been a matter of very much importance as to whether an England/Wales border could be identified and, if so, where it ran in respect of Monmouthshire. That situation changed in the nineteenth century, as the particular cultural, linguistic and political characteristics of Welsh society emerged as both a problem (for the British state) and as a cause (particularly among Welsh Liberals and nonconformists). Once specific policies (be they considered corrective or emancipating) began to be designed for application to Wales, then the question of Monmouthshire&#x27;s placement became important.&quot;

It has been suggested that the question of the status of Monmouthshire arose in earnest in the 19th century, when some of the local gentry such as the Dukes of Beaufort established family seats in England, and many industrialists and others moved into Monmouthshire, particularly in the eastern part of the county. Some of these, and others with &quot;social aspirations&quot;, considered it essential to emphasise their &quot;Englishness&quot;, and there were attempts to refine the notion that anomalies in the 16th-century legislation had made the county non-Welsh. The distinction implied in the description &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot; was nurtured by elements of the establishment, and became increasingly accepted on the English side of the border and in central government, until the local Welsh residents more fully asserted themselves in the 20th century.

===Twentieth-century debate===

Following the Welsh Church Act 1914, the Church in Wales was set up in 1920, containing within it the Diocese of Llandaff which included almost all of Monmouthshire. The new Diocese of Monmouth was formed in 1921. In Anglican terms, the area thus came to be treated as part of Wales.

The question of Monmouthshire&#x27;s status continued to be a matter of discussion, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century. This sometimes led to heated debates in Parliament. In 1921 the Earl of Plymouth objected strongly to the inclusion of the county in legislation forcing the closing of public houses in Wales on Sundays. &quot;I stand as strongly as I can for the privileges of Monmouthshire, to say it is a county of England.&quot; He went on to complain that Welsh representatives were imposing the ban &quot;against the will of the people of Monmouthshire&quot;. The extension of the legislation to Monmouthshire was confirmed by Parliament despite a petition of over 77,000 names against Sunday closing.

In 1937, the Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, Sir Henry Mather Jackson, stated: &quot;Monmouthshire is not in Wales... We are in England, and I am not going to be added to Wales for any purpose whatsoever&quot;. During a debate on the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in 1938, Lord Raglan objected to the stipulation that the chairman of the Monmouthshire quarter sessions should be a Welsh-speaker. Raglan stated that &quot;The County of Monmouth is an English county. I do not think that will be disputed..&quot; and he claimed that Welsh nationalists had attempted to convince the Lord Chief Justice to move Monmouthshire from the Oxford Circuit to the South Wales Circuit, thereby making it part of Wales in matters of court administration. He alleged that these &quot;persons unconnected with Monmouthshire&quot; had claimed incorrectly that the inhabitants of the county &quot;spoke nothing but Welsh&quot;.

In 1948, Monmouthshire County Council was granted a coat of arms with the motto &quot;Utrique fidelis&quot; (&quot;Faithful to both&quot;), to reflect the dual loyalties of the area. Increasingly in legislation, &quot;the state was prepared to treat Monmouthshire as if it were part of Wales, even if it was not able to concede that legally it was Welsh.&quot; In 1949, Monmouthshire was included within the remit of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire, an appointed body established by the Government to advise on Welsh affairs and a precursor of the Welsh Office. Treating Monmouthshire as part of Wales in legislation occasionally created further anomalies. For example, the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 contained the provision that &quot;For the purposes of this Act the administrative county of Monmouth shall be taken to be part of Wales and not part of England.&quot; This left the county borough of Newport as part of England but treated the rest of the county as part of Wales.

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Abertillery, Llywelyn Williams, campaigned to have Monmouthshire unambiguously placed in Wales. Speaking in the House of Commons in February 1957 he said &quot;I think that it is about time we dropped this Wales and Monmouthshire business. Apart from a few cranks who search the files of the distant past for some very flimsy tokens of evidence to suggest that Monmouthshire belongs to England, no person acquainted with the county — its history, customs, place names, culture and way of life — would dream of regarding Monmouthshire people as anything but Welsh.&quot; Later in the year he asked Henry Brooke, Minister of Housing and Local Government and Welsh Affairs, &quot;whether he will now remove from official documents and records relating to Wales the additional words &#x27;and Monmouthshire&#x27;, since Monmouthshire is included in the term Wales.&quot;. Brooke replied in the negative, as he did not think &quot;such a course would be consistent with various statutory provisions relating to Monmouthshire.&quot;

The Local Government Commission for Wales established in 1958 included Monmouthshire within its review area, and in 1961 proposed merging the area into a new &quot;South East Wales&quot; county. The proposed inclusion of Monmouthshire in Wales infuriated Lord Raglan, by now Lord Lieutenant of the county. In reaction, a &quot;Make Monmouthshire Welsh&quot; campaign was launched in August 1961 to gain parliamentary recognition that the county was in Wales. In November 1961 it was announced that a branch of the Royal Society of St George was to be formed, emphasising the county&#x27;s English identity. Another group, the &quot;Monmouthshire is Welsh&quot; society, was formed and was supported by local MPs Michael Foot and Leo Abse. Two years later Monmouth Borough Council made representations to the Minister of Housing and Local Government seeking the transfer of the town to Herefordshire in the event that the reforms were carried out. Signs erected by Monmouthshire County Council welcoming motorists to Wales were defaced or removed. The County Council placed a revised sign at Monmouth stating &quot;Welcome to Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;; first, the words &quot;..and Monmouthshire&quot; were painted over, and then the words &quot;..to Wales&quot; were also obliterated.

The Welsh Office, established in 1965, included Monmouthshire within its remit. The Wales and Berwick Act was repealed in regard to Wales in 1967 by the Welsh Language Act 1967, which however also continued to use the phrase &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;. The Interpretation Act 1978 hence provides that in legislation passed between 1967 and 1974, &quot;a reference to England includes Berwick upon Tweed and Monmouthshire&quot;.

===Clarification of position in Wales===
In 1969 George Thomas, Secretary of State for Wales proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. Lord Raglan (son of the former lord lieutenant), asked the following question in the House of Lords: &quot;To ask Her Majesty&#x27;s Government why they propose to incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales without consulting Monmouthshire&#x27;s inhabitants.&quot; Replying for the government, Baroness Phillips stated that &quot;The purpose of the change is to remove the anomaly arising from the present need to refer to Monmouthshire separately from Wales in Statutes. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State believes that the proposal commands wide support in the county.&quot; In April of the following year Plaid Cymru MP Gwynfor Evans asked Thomas &quot;when he proposes to implement his undertaking that the phrase &#x27;Wales and Monmouthshire&#x27; &quot; will be dropped.&quot; The Secretary of State indicated that it would be after the passing of legislation to reform local government in Wales.

The issue was finally clarified in law by the Local Government Act 1972, which provided that &quot;in every act passed on or after 1 April 1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) &quot;Wales&quot;, subject to any alterations of boundaries...&quot; included &quot;the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport&quot;.

Debate on the relevant amendment, Clause 256, took place late on 20 July 1972, with few local MPs present. The Minister of State, David Gibson-Watt, agreed to a question from George Thomas that &quot;...in future the argument about Monmouthshire being part of Wales is over, and that [his] statement makes it clear that Monmouthshire is part of Wales for good and for ever?&quot; Raymond Gower said that the statement was &quot;quite consistent with the fact that towns with names such as Abergavenny and Llantarnam could not be anything other than Welsh&quot;; it was opposed by Gerald Kaufman, who stated: &quot;Am I to take it that an act of annexation of this magnitude is to be carried through a sparsely attended House of Commons on the nod at five minutes to midnight on the same basis as Europe has annexed England? I wish to voice my protest.&quot;

==Legacy==
The name &quot;Monmouthshire&quot; was revived for one of the principal areas created on further local government reorganisation in 1996. The principal area covers only part of the historic county, which also included Newport, Torfaen, most of Blaenau Gwent, and parts of Caerphilly and Cardiff.

The preserved county of Gwent, which still exists for some ceremonial purposes, is similar in extent to historic Monmouthshire with the addition of the west bank of the Rhymney Valley.

<text>Canada Water is an interchange station in London. It is on the Jubilee line of the London Underground and the Windrush line of the London Overground, and is located in Travelcard Zone 2. The station is in Rotherhithe in the Southwark. It takes its name from Canada Water, a lake which was created from a former dock in the Port of London. London Overground services commenced on 27 April 2010, as the replacement extension of the historic tube line.
==History==
Canada Water was originally intended to be a stop on the aborted Fleet line Extension to Thamesmead. The extension was never built, but Canada Water became the only projected Fleet line Extension station to be realised on the Jubilee Line Extension.

The station is a wholly new building on a derelict site formerly occupied by Albion Dock, part of the old Surrey Commercial Docks. The station was one of the first designed for the Jubilee line Extension. The contract for the station&#x27;s construction was initially awarded to Wimpey in 1993 for £21.3 million and was later taken over by Tarmac. Construction began in 1995. It proved extremely challenging, requiring the excavation (by cut-and-cover) of a void long, wide and deep. The building of the East London line station required a separate slot at right angles, long, deep and tapering in width, incorporating a Victorian railway tunnel. Construction was complicated by the high water table on the site, which is located on the Thames flood plain; extensive deep-well dewatering was required to lower the water table before the enclosure to the excavations could be built. A total of of spoil had to be excavated. An additional complication was the location of the excavation site, near the foundations of two existing 22-storey tower blocks and the northern end of the former Canada Dock, now the ornamental lake Canada Water. The section of East London line running through the station was completely reconstructed, with the 19th-century brick railway tunnel being dismantled and the track relaid over a new structure bridging the Jubilee line tracks below. As the East London line had to be closed for this work, London Underground took the opportunity to carry out other remedial works such as repairs to the Thames Tunnel, a short distance to the north.

It was opened on 19 August 1999, served initially by East London line trains. The Jubilee line passenger service from the station began on 17 September that year.

In 2012, it was used as a filming location for part of the pilot episode of the BBC/Cinemax British-American spy drama, &quot;Hunted&quot; (TV series).

Canada Water was the first station to receive external sponsorship; Nestlé sponsored the station on the day of the 2015 London Marathon, and roundels in the station were edited to advertise Nestlé&#x27;s Buxton Water. The one-day sponsorship was part of a plan to increase Transport for London&#x27;s non-fare revenue, costing Nestlé £110,000.

==Architecture==
The station, which was the first to be designed in the Jubilee line Extension project, has been described by the Hong Kong MTR&#x27;s chief architect Roland Paoletti as &quot;the only station on the JLE that has been built to the strict engineering economies of the specification of a Hong Kong interchange station.&quot; Above ground, its most salient feature is a striking glass &quot;drum&quot; across, which covers a deep opening descending almost to the Jubilee line platforms, below the surface. This feature was designed to allow natural light to reach deep into the station, a design principle common to many of the stations on the Jubilee line Extension. The drum was designed and constructed by Buro Happold. It is notably similar to the brick drum designed by Charles Holden for station on the Piccadilly line in the 1930s, but is much more oriented towards the entry of daylight.

The drum is accompanied by a glass-roofed bus station designed by Eva Jiřičná which serves as a hub for services in the Rotherhithe and Bermondsey areas. The bus station was designed to fit in a relatively small site between the station drum, the railway&#x27;s ventilation openings, a high wall and the adjoining tower blocks. Its most distinctive feature is a row of -long roof spans cantilevered from a row of central columns supporting a -long glass and aluminium canopy. This provides acoustic protection to the residential blocks and shelters passengers waiting below.

Below ground, the station is dominated by a huge concrete box, large enough to accommodate one of the Canary Wharf skyscrapers on its side. It is lined by a series of huge concrete pillars designed to take the weight of a planned nine-storey building on the surface as well as the roadway and bus station. The station has four lifts and eight escalators with an average rise of about to connect the lower parts of the station with street level. It is built on three levels: the ticket office and shops lie immediately below ground, the two north-south Windrush line platforms are situated on the second level below the ground, and the two east-west Jubilee line platforms are on the lowest level down.

The station was the winner of the Civic Trust Building of the Year Award for 2000, and the Interchange Awards&#x27; Medium Size Project of the Year award for 2001.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 1, 47, 188, 199, 225, 381, C10, P12 and night routes N199 and N381 serve the station and bus station.

==Services==
The station currently is served off peak during the day by 24 Jubilee line trains per hour, increasing to 30 in the peak, and 16 Windrush line trains per hour at all times. On Friday and Saturday nights, the station receives 6 Jubilee line trains per hour and 4 Windrush line trains per hour. Canada Water is the busiest two-platform National Rail station, with 25 million entries and exits to the Overground platforms in 2017–18.

There is a scissors crossover to the south of the London Overground platforms to enable trains to terminate there.

<text>Långnäs is a port in Lumparland on the eastern mainland of Åland, about 30 km over the road away from Åland&#x27;s capital Mariehamn. Road ferries to Kumlinge (Snäckö) and Galtby via Föglö (Överö) and Kökar start here. Långnäs is an alternative to Åland&#x27;s main passenger harbour, the Western Harbour in Mariehamn, for ferries between Finland and Sweden.

== Ferry traffic ==
Långnäs has two Ålandstrafiken ferry connections. The southern line goes to Galtby (with a connection to mainland Finland) via Överö, Sottunga, Husö, Kyrkogårdsö and Kökar. The other line goes to Snackö in Kumlinge via Överö and Sottunga.

The shipping company Ab Lillgaard has connections between Långnäs and Naantali via the ferry . The ferry companies Viking Line and Silja Line use Långnäs as an alternative to Mariehamn as a night-time stop on the Stockholm—Turku route. The ferry operator Finnlines has a connection from Naantali to Kapellskär via Långnäs.

In 1999, European Union legislation outlawed the sale of duty-free goods on ferry services within the EU, but Åland&#x27;s tax privileges provide a legal exemption for ships that call at a port in Åland. As duty-free sales are a considerable source of revenue for the ferry shipping companies, the major routes between the Stockholm region (Kapellskär and Stockholm) and southern Finland (Turku and Helsinki) include a stop there.

== History ==
Långnäs has been used as a harbour for inter-island traffic on Åland since the 1920s.

In the early 1960s, Silja Line built a ferry terminal in Långnäs, designed by Finnish architect Bengt Lundsten. The terminal was in use 1965–1975. It was a large futuristic glass building suspended in the air by cable wires connected to two supporting arches. It gained international recognition for its architecture. Silja Line terminated its traffic to Långnäs in 1975 and the terminal fell into disuse and was eventually dismantled in 1993. A new terminal was built in 1999 to accommodate the large cruiseferries on the Stockholm—Turku route.

The company Långnäs Hamn Ab was founded in 1988 when the municipality of Lumparland bought the harbour area from Silja Line. Långnäs was the first harbour in Finland to be operated as a joint-stock company. The newly formed company had visions of an oil harbour, and a passenger harbour to serve the then booming ferry industry. The municipality&#x27;s ambitions exceeded their capabilities and in 1992 the entire stock of the company was acquired by the Government of Åland. In 1993 Lillgaard Ab started traffic from Långnäs to Naantali.

Finland&#x27;s entry in the European Union in 1995 and the tax exemption law for Åland caused a renovation of the harbour. A new deep quay and a simple terminal building were built so that ferries between Turku and Stockholm would have time to stop at Åland in both directions. Traffic started on 1 July 1999, on the same day when the new tax laws for intra-EU traffic came into force.

== Accidents ==
On 28 November 1968, the passenger ships &quot;Ilmatar&quot; and &quot;Botnia&quot; collided in front of the Långnäs harbour travelling on the Stockholm—Turku route. Six people were killed in the accident and it caused almost 700 000 Finnish markka worth of damage. Because of the thick mist at the time, visibility conditions were very poor.

<text>Flintshire (), also known as the County of Flint, was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales, in the north-east of Wales.

Most of what was Flintshire was along the north-east coast of Wales, however the county was notable for having one of the few large county exclaves, the English Maelor (), to survive the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

The administrative county of Flint was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, and became part of the new administrative area of Clwyd. The exclaves became part of Wrexham Maelor district – other parts formed the districts of Alyn and Deeside, Delyn and Rhuddlan. A unitary authority, also named Flintshire, was formed in 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, consisting only of the Alyn and Deeside and Delyn districts – the Wrexham Maelor parts now form part of Wrexham County Borough, with the former Rhuddlan district forming the northernmost part of the current Denbighshire unitary authority.

==Geography==
The former county did not have the same boundaries as the current administrative county of Flintshire; in particular the former county included a large exclave called the English Maelor (); it also included Prestatyn, Rhyl and St Asaph which are now administered as part of modern-day Denbighshire, as well as Bangor-on-Dee and Overton-on-Dee, which are administered as part of Wrexham County Borough. Other exclaves of the historic Flintshire included the manors of Marford and Hoseley, Abenbury Fechan and Bryn Estyn, all on the outskirts of Wrexham, and also a small part of the parish of Erbistock around the &quot;Boat Inn&quot;. These were all completely surrounded by the historic county of Denbighshire. Additionally, a small part of Flintshire, including the village of Sealand, was isolated across the River Dee when its course was changed to improve navigation.

Flintshire was a maritime county bounded to the north by the Irish Sea, to the north-east by the Dee estuary, to the east by Cheshire and to the south and southwest by Denbighshire. The Maelor Saesneg was bounded on the north-west by Denbighshire, on the north-east by Cheshire, and on the south by Shropshire. A medium height range of hills, the Clwydian Range (part of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) ran in southeast-northwest direction along the border between the main part of Flintshire and Denbighshire, almost reaching the sea near Prestatyn. The Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path ran along the crest of these hills. 

The highest point in the historic county (county top) was found within these hills at Moel Famau, height , a notable viewpoint topped by the ruined remains of the Jubilee Tower, built in 1810 to commemorate the golden jubilee of King George III.

Flintshire was the smallest of what are now known as the historic counties in Wales. The coast along the Dee estuary was heavily developed by industry and the north coast much developed for tourism. The Clwydian Mountains occupied much of the west of the county. The highest point was Moel Famau (1,820 feet / 554 metres). The chief towns were Buckley, Connah&#x27;s Quay, Flint, Hawarden, Holywell, Mold, Queensferry, and Shotton. The main rivers were the Dee (the estuary of which forms much of the coast) and the Clwyd. The main industries were manufacturing of aircraft components (Airbus), engines (Toyota), paper (Shotton Paper), steel processing (Corus), agriculture and tourism.

Places of special interest included castles in Flint, Hawarden, Rhuddlan and Ewloe, Greenfield Valley, St. Winefride&#x27;s Well in Holywell and Wepre Country Park, in Connah&#x27;s Quay.

==Formation==

The county was formed in 1284 under the terms of the Statute of Rhuddlan, following the defeat of the Principality of Wales. However, the region had been English since the 8th century, and formed part of Cheshire until it was captured by the Welsh in the late 12th century. In the 13th century, prior to its re-capture by the Normans, the region comprised:

* Tegeingl (Mercian &quot;Englefield&quot;), a Cantref in Gwynedd
* certain Commotes within the Cantref of Maelor, in Powys Fadog:
** Maelor &quot;Saesneg&quot; (i.e., &quot;Saxon&quot; Maelor)
** Yr Hob - i.e., &quot;Hopedale&quot;
** Ystrad Alyn

Yr Hob and Ystrad Alyn, which been part of Gwynedd earlier in the century, had become sufficiently Welsh that they were regarded as another part of &quot;Welsh Maelor&quot;, rather than distinguished from it like &quot;English Maelor&quot; (&quot;Maelor Saesneg&quot;). They were not initially included in Flintshire, but instead became Marcher Lordships. Yr Hob became the &quot;Lordship of Hope&quot;, while Ystrad Alyn was split in two - the Lordships of Mold and Hawarden. Following the Laws in Wales Act (1536), these three Lordships were merged into Flintshire.

== Civil parishes ==
From the medieval period until 1974, Flintshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales. Chapelries are in italics.

1chapelry to Ellesmere in Shropshire 2chapelry to Malpas in Cheshire
Most of these parishes are in the modern county of Flintshire, but those marked D are in Denbighshire, and those marked W are in Wrexham.

==County offices==

Flintshire County Council established its base at the old County Hall in Chester Street in Mold. Additional facilities acquired included a local militia barracks (originally designed by Thomas Mainwaring Penson) which was converted for use as council offices in the late 1880s. After finding, in the 1930s, that the Chester Street facilities were too cramped, county leaders decided to procure modern facilities: the site they selected formed part of the Llwynegrin Hall estate which was acquired for the purpose. The new building, known as County Hall, Mold, was completed in October 1967.

<doc id="370059" wikidata="Q1033431" url="?curid=370059" title="Canning Town station">
<text>Canning Town is an interchange station located in Canning Town, London for London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and London Buses services. 

It is designed as an intermodal metro and bus station, fully opening in 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension - replacing the original station site north of the A13.

On 11 November 2015, the Mayor of London announced that it would be rezoned to be on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 2 and Travelcard Zone 3.

== Location ==
The interchange is on a north–south alignment, constrained by Bow Creek immediately to the west, Silvertown Way to the east, the A13 Canning Town Flyover (a major east–west road bridge crossing the Canning Town Roundabout at the throat of the station) to the north, and the River Thames to the south, while directly next to the River Lea.

== History ==

The first station, originally named &quot;Barking Road&quot;, was opened on 14 June 1847 by the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway on the south side of Barking Road in the Parish of West Ham. It was renamed &quot;Canning Town&quot; on 1 July 1873, and in 1888, this station was closed, being replaced by a new station on the north side of Barking Road (near Stephenson Street). The booking hall was replaced in the 1960s, and survived until 28 May 1994. The station was served by trains on the North London line to North Woolwich.

In the late 1980s, plans for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) extension to Beckton considered various options - either running directly east/west between Blackwall and Royal Victoria, or following the River Lea to call at Canning Town. In the early 1990s, the planned Jubilee Line Extension station on the site meant that the dedicated DLR station was not built, with a combined interchange station to be built instead. The DLR extension to Beckton began running through the future station site in March 1994.

The new station was built on the south side of the A13, designed by Troughton McAslan. The tiered design of the station placed the DLR platforms directly above the Jubilee line platforms allowing for easy interchange. A substantial bus station was also built as part of the station complex.

On 29 October 1995, the first part of the new station opened, serving the North London Line. The DLR platforms opened on 5 March 1998. With the opening of the Jubilee line platforms on 14 May 1999, the new station complex was complete and officially &#x27;opened&#x27;.

The DLR branch to London City Airport opened on 2 December 2005. This branch diverges from the branch to Beckton south of the interchange, with trains from both branches serving the current platforms.

=== Stratford International DLR extension ===
The North London Line platforms closed on 9 December 2006 as part of the closure of the to section of the line. On 31 August 2011 these platforms re-opened on the new Stratford International branch of the Docklands Light Railway.

In October 2019, the station was hit by Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests, causing the suspension of services at rush hour. During the protest, two XR members climbed on top of a train, one appearing to kick commuters who were attempting to remove them. The protest ended when the protesters were grabbed by their ankles, dragged onto the platform and mobbed by the crowd.

==Design==

Designed by Troughton McAslan, the station is connected by an underground concourse stretching the width of the site and connected to all platforms and the bus station by escalators, stairs and lifts. The station is fully accessible, with step-free access throughout.

To the west of the complex two island platforms are one above the other. The lower level island platform (platforms 5 &amp; 6) is served by the Jubilee line and the higher level island platform (platforms 3 &amp;4) is served by the DLR branch to/from Poplar. To the east of the Jubilee platforms on the same level, an island platform (platforms 1 &amp; 2) is served by the Stratford International branch of the DLR. This platform was formerly served by the North London line.

Adjacent to Silvertown Way, on the eastern side of the interchange is a bus station with seven stands, with an enclosed above-ground concourse with doors to the surrounding bus bays. The bus station is fully connected to the DLR and Underground platforms via the underground concourse.

As well as entrances onto Silvertown Way and Barking Road, an entrance facing Bow Creek allows access to London City Island via the Leamouth Lifting Footbridge, Bow Creek Ecology Park and the Limmo Peninsula. This entrance was built as part of the JLE project in the late 1990s, but opened in 2016.

== Artwork ==

Carved into the walls of a station staircase, an artwork by Richard Kindersley commemorates the Thames Iron Works, which previously stood on the site. It was unveiled in February 1998 by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who grew up in the local area.

<doc id="370060" wikidata="Q5256625" url="?curid=370060" title="Denbighshire (historic)">
<text>Denbighshire (), or the County of Denbigh, was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales, in the north of Wales. It was a maritime county, that was bounded to the north by the Irish Sea, to the east by Flintshire, Cheshire and Shropshire, to the south by Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire, and to the west by Caernarfonshire.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the use of Denbighshire for local government and ceremonial purposes ended on 1 April 1974, with the creation of the new county of Clwyd. A different county of the same name was created on 1 April 1996, for modern local government purposes, covering a substantially different area from the historic county.

==History==
Denbighshire was created by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 from areas previously in the Marches. It was formed from &quot;Cantrefi&quot; taken as follows;

From the Lordship of Denbigh:

* Rhos
* Rhufoniog
* Dyffryn Clwyd

From Powys Fadog:

* Iâl
* Maelor Gymraeg
* Nanheudwy
* Cynllaith

==Geography==
In the south and west of what was Denbighshire, the mountains of the Clwydian Range rose from 1000 to high. The east was hilly. There was some level ground along the coastal strip. The highest points were Moel Sych and Cader Berwyn at . Pistyll-y-Rhaeader, a waterfall, was located in the county. The chief rivers were the Clwyd and the Dee. The River Conwy ran north along its western boundary.

The main towns in the county were Rhyl, Abergele, Mochdre, Denbigh, Kinmel Bay, Llangollen, Llanrwst, Wrexham, Colwyn Bay and Ruthin. Villages such as Glan Conwy, Eglwysbach, and Llansannan had also come under Denbighshire. The most important industries were agriculture and tourism, but near Wrexham the county had major resources in coal (see Denbighshire Coalfield) and ironstone, leading to ironworks of significance during the industrial revolution, notably at Bersham Ironworks and Brymbo Steelworks.

== Civil parishes ==
From the medieval period until 1974, Denbighshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales. Chapelries are in &quot;italics&quot;.

Many of these parishes ended up in modern Denbighshire, but those marked C are in Conwy, those marked P are in Powys, and those marked W are in Wrexham.
==Places of special interest==
*Bodnant Garden, Tal-y-Cafn (); 
*Chirk Castle (); (now in Wrexham County Borough)
*Denbigh Castle (); 
*Pillar of Eliseg (); 
*Plas Newydd, Llangollen (); 
*Valle Crucis Abbey, Llangollen ().

==Municipal reform==

An administrative county of Denbighshire was created in 1889 by the Local Government Act 1888. The county was governed by an elected county council, who took over the functions of the Quarter Sessions courts. The county council was based at County Hall in Ruthin, a building which was designed by Walter Douglas Wiles and completed in March 1909.

The administrative county was subdivided into municipal boroughs and urban and rural districts.

*The boroughs of Denbigh and Ruthin were reformed in 1835 by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The county&#x27;s third borough, Wrexham was incorporated in 1857. Colwyn Bay urban district was incorporated in 1934.
*Three urban districts were formed by the Local Government Act 1894: Abergele and Pensarn (renamed Abergele in 1935), Colwyn Bay and Colwyn (renamed Colwyn Bay in 1926, and incorporated as a borough in 1934) and Llangollen, as successors to urban sanitary districts. in 1897 Llanrwst urban district was formed. 
*Eight rural districts were formed (also by the 1894 Act), based on existing rural sanitary districts: Chirk, Llangollen, Llanrwst, Llansillin, Ruthin, St Asaph (Denbigh), Uwchaled and Wrexham.

Two civil parishes: Llaneilian yn Rhos and Llansanffraid Glan Conway were administered as part of Conwy Rural District in the neighbouring county of Caernarfonshire. This area was sometimes called Glan Conway Rural District.

In 1935 the rural districts were reorganised by a County Review Order, and reduced to five in number: Aled, Ceiriog, Hiraethog, Ruthin and Wrexham.

The administrative county was abolished in 1974, with most of its territory becoming part of the new districts of Colwyn, Wrexham Maelor and Glyndŵr in Clwyd. The urban district of Llanrwst and five rural parishes were included in Gwynedd.

<text>West Ham () is an interchange station in West Ham, London, England for London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and National Rail services. It was opened in 1901 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on the route from Fenchurch Street to Barking. In the late 1990s, the station was rebuilt and significantly expanded as part of the Jubilee Line Extension, fully opening in 1999. The station is in London fare zone 2 and zone 3.

== History ==

===East to west alignment===
The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway direct line from Bow to Barking was constructed east to west through the middle of the Parish of West Ham in 1858. Before this, trains took a longer route via Stratford and Forest Gate to the north. The new line opened with stations initially at Bromley, Plaistow and East Ham. In November 1897 Arnold Hills, the owner of the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, whose football team Thames Ironworks F.C. (which reformed in 1900 as West Ham United) played at the Memorial Grounds, secured an agreement with the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway to build a station at the intersection of Manor Road and Memorial Avenue. The company board approved this in February 1898 and Mowlem&#x27;s was given the contract to build a four platform station, which allowed for the proposed quadrupling of the line with the completion of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway. The station was completed in May 1900, but did not open until 1 February 1901. The station was initially known as West Ham.

The North London Railway had run a daily service to Plaistow via the Bow-Bromley curve since 18 May 1869 and when West Ham opened it used the northern platforms. In 1905 they switched to the southern platforms, with the opening of a new bay platform at Plaistow on the southern side. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway allowed through services of the Metropolitan District Railway to operate through West Ham to Upminster from 1902. The Metropolitan District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway trains from Fenchurch Street used the southern platforms when the Metropolitan District services began but stopping was reduced to a few a week in 1908 and to nil in 1913. Ownership of the station passed to the Midland Railway in 1912 and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. The station was renamed West Ham (Manor Road) on 11 February 1924. When the North London Railway service to Plaistow ceased on 1 January 1916 the southern platforms were unused in normal service.

The Metropolitan District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line. Hammersmith &amp; City line services started, as part of the Metropolitan line, in 1936. The southern platforms were removed after war damage in 1940 which had completely closed the station from 7 September 1940 until 11 August 1941. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways. In 1969 ownership was transferred to the London Underground and the station was renamed back to West Ham on 1 January.

On 15 March 1976, nine people were injured here by an explosion on a train by a member of the Provisional IRA. Julius Stephen, the driver of the train, was shot dead at the scene when he attempted to pursue the fleeing bomber.

As part of the Jubilee Line Extension, the station was completely rebuilt, with reconstructed District and Hammersmith and City line platforms. In addition, platforms were re-established on the main line from Fenchurch Street, now operated by c2c. As part of the work, the existing entrance was closed, and the refurbished ticket hall became a connecting concourse to the new ticket hall and the rest of the station. Additionally, the station was made fully accessible.

The island platform for c2c services, along with the access staircases, are narrow and get easily congested. To ensure safety for passengers, staff must be present on the platforms at peak times. c2c have proposed an escalator to replace the stairs. The construction of an additional platform for westbound trains would eliminate the problem. 

==== London 2012 Summer and Paralympic Games ====
The station was temporarily modified to allow it to cope with an increase in passenger numbers during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. A footbridge was constructed to connect the station to the Greenway foot and cycle path, which connects directly to the Olympic Park in Stratford.

Work began in January 2011, with the construction of temporary stairs and a walkway from the eastern end of the District line platforms, over the eastbound track and running back parallel to the platform ending at Manor Road. The footbridge was demolished in mid-October 2012, following the end of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The foundations of the temporary footbridge have been left for possible use in future expansion of the station.
A double-ended centre siding east of West Ham was constructed to compensate for lost reversing capacity caused by the rebuilding of Whitechapel station as part of Crossrail work. This was commissioned on 17 January 2011.

===North to south alignment===
The Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway was constructed north to south through West Ham, linking Stratford with Canning Town in 1846. Platforms were constructed on the line at West Ham and opened on 14 May 1979 when the Crosstown Linkline service began between Camden Road and North Woolwich. The Crosstown Linkline was replaced with the electric North London Line service between Richmond and North Woolwich on 13 May 1985. In the 1990s, the station was comprehensively rebuilt as part of the Jubilee Line Extension, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects. A new bridge crosses four rail lines and a main road, to connect the Jubilee line and North London line platforms with the new ticket hall and the rest of the station. Jubilee line services began on 14 May 1999. North London Line services at the station ceased on 9 December 2006, when the line from Stratford to North Woolwich was closed, to allow for the line to be converted for the Docklands Light Railway. The platforms reopened on 31 August 2011 as part of the extension to Stratford International.

==== New entrance ====
As part of the TwelveTrees development on the former Parcelforce distribution depot, a new station entrance is being built to connect to the upper Jubilee line concourse. As well as this, two new pedestrian bridges over the railway will be built.

==Design and architecture==
The station was rebuilt as part of the Jubilee Line Extension in the 1990s. The majority of the station design was by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, with the District and Hammersmith and City line platforms designed by Jestico + Whiles. 

The station design was considered to evoke work by Charles Holden in the 1930s, with use of brick and glass blocks, as well as a clock tower. The station was designed in 27 weeks, and was the cheapest of the new stations to be built. Critics called the station &quot;effortlessly elegant&quot; and an &quot;impressive architectural essay in brick, concrete and glass&quot;. It was later awarded a Royal Fine Art Commission Trust Award.

The station consists of four sets of island platforms, two on an elevated east–west alignment and another perpendicular pair at street level, giving a total of eight platform faces. The existing entrance was closed, with the old ticket hall refurbished to become a connecting concourse to the District and Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms and the (new) c2c platforms. A new ticket hall - facing onto Manor Road - connects this concourse to the Jubilee line and North London line platforms via a high level bridge that spans four rail lines and a main road. The station building and connecting passageways are finished in a mixture of red brick, concrete and glass, inspired by Charles Holden. The station was built at a fraction of the cost of other Jubilee Line Extension stations, just £10.5m compared to over £100m at stations like Canary Wharf.

At the upper level, the northern island platform (Platform 1 and 2) are used by District line and Hammersmith &amp; City line trains, and the southern island platform (Platforms 7 and 8) are used by c2c trains. At the lower level, the western island platform (Platforms 5 and 6) are used by Jubilee line trains, with the eastern island platform (Platforms 3 and 4) - formerly the North London line platforms - are now used by Docklands Light Railway trains.

Jubilee line trains can terminate here to enter into the nearby Stratford Market Depot. This is regularly used during peak times/at the end of the working day. Secondly, there is a crossover to the south of the DLR platforms so that trains can reverse early and head back south. Additionally there is a siding that opened in 2011 east of the sub-surface line platforms so that trains from both directions can terminate. 

== Incidents ==

On 15 March 1976, seven people were injured by a Provisional IRA bomb on a Metropolitan line train. The terrorist then shot and killed the train&#x27;s driver Julius Stephen.

== Location ==
The station is located at the corner of Durban Road and Manor Road, in the London Borough of Newham. The station is named after the former parish and borough of West Ham within which it was located to the west of the centre. The neighbourhood of West Ham is located some distance to the north-east. Since West Ham United Football Club moved to the Boleyn Ground in 1904, the station is no longer located near their home ground. East London Rugby Football Club is situated nearby on Holland Road, which is also home to Kings Cross Steelers RFC and Phantoms RFC.

== Services ==
Services at West Ham station are operated by National Rail, Docklands Light Railway and London Underground. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

The station also served by a night service on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Tube. The station is served by Jubilee line trains every 10 minutes in each direction between Stratford and Stanmore.






==Connections==
London Bus route 276 serves the station.

<text>Stratford is a major multi-level interchange station serving the town of Stratford and the mixed-use development known as Stratford City, in the London Borough of Newham, East London for London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and Elizabeth line services. National Rail services also operate on the West Anglia Main Line and the Great Eastern Main Line, from Liverpool Street. 

It is the fifth busiest railway station in Britain, the busiest station in London outside the London station group, and is the busiest station on the London Underground network outside Travelcard Zone 1.

On the London Underground, the station is on the Central line between and stations. It is also the eastern terminus of the Jubilee line and the next station towards west is West Ham. On the DLR, it is a terminus for some trains and for others it is a through-station between and . On the Overground, it is the terminus of the Mildmay line; on the main line it is served by Elizabeth line stopping services between Paddington and and by medium- and longer-distance services operated by Greater Anglia to and from numerous destinations in the East of England. There are also limited off-peak services operated by c2c connecting to the London, Tilbury and Southend line to .

The station was opened in 1839 by the Eastern Counties Railway. Today it is owned by Network Rail and is in Travelcard zone 2/3. To distinguish it from in Warwickshire it is sometimes referred to as Stratford (London), or as Stratford Regional to differentiate it from Stratford International, which is some to the north. Stratford served as a key travel hub for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games held in London.
==History==

===Early days: 1839–62===
Stratford station was opened on 20 June 1839 by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) with the first station building being located on Angel Lane which crossed the line on an over-bridge to the east of the station. The Northern and Eastern Railway opened a section of its authorised line from to join the ECR at Stratford on 15 September 1840. As well as a station, a railway works was built adjacent to the line to Broxbourne. This and the engine shed later expanded into the area to the west of the station which is now occupied by a shopping centre and Stratford International station.

The ECR tracks were originally set to a gauge of on the recommendation of engineer John Braithwaite. At this time there was no legislation dictating the choice of gauge and indeed the directors favoured the Great Western Railway&#x27;s broad gauge . Braithwaite persuaded the directors otherwise on the grounds of additional cost but recommended the gauge in an effort to reduce wear on locomotive parts. This choice meant that the Northern &amp; Eastern Railway who were planning to share the ECR line between Stratford and Bishopsgate were forced to adopt the same gauge.

With the extension of the ECR in the early 1840s it became apparent that standard gauge was a more realistic choice and subsequently between September and October 1844 the gauge conversion was carried out. At the same time the associated Northern &amp; Eastern Railway was also converted.

New station buildings were built in 1847 replacing the original structure on Angel Road. These were located in the V between the Cambridge and Colchester lines and access was via Station Road.

The line through the low level platforms first opened in 1846 as a goods only branch as far as Thames Wharf. The bridge under the main line was too low for many locomotives, so a number of engines were equipped with hinged chimneys in order they could operate the line. On opening there was also a line that linked what is now known as the Great Eastern Main Line directly to the docks enabling through running from Colchester to Thames Wharf. The docks and associated railway networks expanded with passenger services to North Woolwich starting in 1847.

There was an accident at Stratford station on 18 July 1846 when an up goods train ran into the back of a passenger train from Ipswich. There were 10 passengers seriously injured one of whom later died.

In 1854 the newly opened London Tilbury and Southend Railway served Stratford joining the main line at Forest Gate Junction a few miles north. Their services generally served Fenchurch Street and were routed via the Bow Road route (although that station was not opened at this time) although some carriages were detached at Stratford for onward working to Bishopsgate. This practice was discontinued in 1856 as passengers preferred the more conveniently sited (for the city) Fenchurch Street.

In connection with the introduction of the new LTSR services a third line was built from Stratford to Bow Junction which was used by down Fenchurch Street services and a new platform face opened.

It soon became apparent that congestion was a problem at Stratford and by 1856 permission was sought to build a line from Barking to Gas Factory Junction (Bow) which was opened in 1858. After that LTSR trains were no longer routed via Stratford.

By 1855 there were links from both the low and high-level stations to the North London Line as well as a spur that enabled trains from Liverpool Street to North Woolwich to avoid Stratford altogether (although this served Stratford Market station) which was a short distance away. Services from the North London line normally started from Victoria Park and ran through to Stratford Market. This service operated from 1866 until 1874 and was operated by the GER and North London Railway in alternate years up until 31 October 1874.

The North London Railway was also running through Stratford high level with two return trains per day from Hampstead Road (later renamed Chalk Farm) via Victoria Park and Forest Gate Junctions to Tilbury which commenced on 1 July 1855 and finished 30 September.

Services to Loughton commenced on 22 August 1856 and used the Lea Valley platforms, leaving the main line at Loughton Branch Junction half a mile north of Stratford. Initially nine trains per day operated to Fenchurch Street (Bishopsgate on Sundays) on this route.

By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation. Thus Stratford became a GER station in 1862.

===Great Eastern Railway: 1862–1923===
The Loughton branch was extended to Ongar on 24 April 1865 and by 1874 there were a total of 40 trains each day (10 terminating at Loughton, 18 at Epping and 12 at Ongar) with most serving the newly opened Liverpool Street although a few peak hour services continued to serve Fenchurch Street.

Even after LTSR services were routed away from Stratford in 1858 working remained intense. Following an accident in 1866 the accident report noted that &quot;Stratford needs complete re-arranging, extending and fitting with modern improvements for working points and signals, as in its present state it appears to be quite insufficient for the traffic that passes through it&quot;. Although one of the signal boxes had interlocking fitted soon after, the poor state of GER finances saw little further work until 1877 when a significant rebuilding of Stratford took place.

Another short-lived North London Railway service operated in September and October 1866, linking Chalk Farm with Barking (again routed via Victoria Park and Forest Gate Junctions). This service was withdrawn due to congestion, and one of the services was involved in a collision on 10 September 1866 with 20 passengers being injured.

The 1877 rebuilding saw a number of changes made, which were:
* A fourth line was added from Bow Junction to Stratford;
* Western Junction (where a spur to towards the Woolwich line existed along with various crossovers) was moved further west;
* New Goods lines added on the down (north) side of the line between Western Junction and the Cambridge line platforms – changes made at Central Junction to accommodate these;
* New Goods lines between Western Junction and Maryland Point signal box (west of the current 2015 station);
* Eastern curve (which allowed up goods trains from the main line to directly access the low level line towards the docks) was re-aligned; and
* New signal boxes at Eastern, Central and Western Junctions.

Between 1886 and 1887, improvements were made to the station buildings and the canopies extended.

On 26 December 1886, a train was derailed at Stratford station as facing points had not been properly locked into position. Fortunately there was no loss of life.

By 1889, traffic on the GER had grown to such an extent, that quadrupling the section from Bethnal Green to Bow Junction and from Maryland Point-Romford was proposed. Once again significant changes which were implemented between 1891 and 1893 and included:
* Two additional lines from Bow Junction resulting in six tracks in total (named Up and Down Local, Up and Down Through and Up and Down Fenchurch Street);
* To accommodate these the Up and Down Fenchurch Street lines were slewed to the south of the formation;
* The 1877 signal boxes at Western, Central and Eastern Junctions were all replaced between 1891 and 1893; and
* Carpenters Road curve added at this time (Western Junction to Carpenters Road Junction)

In 1896, the low-level line was lowered under the main line so locomotives no longer required hinged chimneys.

By July 1897, it was apparent that the decision not to include platforms on both Through lines was causing some operational difficulty. To address this a new platform serving the Up Through line was opened in 1900.

The Fairlop Loop opened on 1 May 1903 and services generally ran as an out and back circle from either Liverpool Street or Fenchurch Street. The routing of these services was Liverpool Street – Stratford – Ilford – Fairlop Loop – Woodford – Stratford – Liverpool Street) and Liverpool Street – Stratford – Woodford – Fairlop Loop – Ilford – Stratford – Liverpool Street in the reverse direction.

On 1 January 1923, the GER became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway.

===London and North Eastern Railway: 1923–47===
By the 1930s electric tramways were taking a lot of traffic from the railway and proposals were drawn up to electrify the lines from Liverpool Street to Shenfield using the 1500 V DC system. By 1938 the major contracts were let and work started. Despite the commencement of the Second World War in 1939, work was initially continued on the scheme, however, the scheme was postponed in late 1940. In February 1946, the LNER announced work would recommence. On 5 October 1946, the new interchange platforms with the Central line (see below) were opened.

London Underground Central line services started on 4 December 1946, extended from Liverpool Street station in new tunnels after being delayed due to the Second World War. The line was further extended to on 5 May 1947 and then to the former Great Eastern Railway branch lines to , and progressively until 1957. Prior to this date trains to and from Epping and Ongar had used the currently numbered platforms 11 and 12 and diverged from the Broxbourne line about half a mile north of the station. Trains for the Hainault loop used either these platforms or the currently numbered platform 5 (up) or 8 (down) diverging from the Great Eastern Main Line at a junction between Ilford and Seven Kings which has since been redeveloped as part of the Ilford Carriage sheds.

===British Railways: 1948–96===

The nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways saw the operation of Stratford station pass to British Railways Eastern Region. A new station building was designed by Thomas Bennett and opened in 1948. 

Progress on electrification that had been halted by the Second World War resumed after the end of hostilities. The line between Liverpool Street and Stratford was electrified from 3 December 1946, and the full electrification of the Shenfield line at 1500 V DC was completed in September 1949.
The electric service between Liverpool Street to Shenfield was inaugurated on 26 September 1949 but services were run to steam timings with a number of steam trains still operating. The full electric service officially commenced on 7 November 1949 (although a full dummy run had taken place the previous day). Two days earlier services to Fenchurch Street via Bow Road were withdrawn.

On 8 April 1953, 12 people were killed and 46 were injured as a result of a rear-end collision in a tunnel just to the east of Stratford station, caused by driver error after a signal failure.

Between 1960 and 1961, the 1,500 V DC electrification to Shenfield line which had been extended to Southend and Chelmsford was converted to 6.25kV ac.

In the autumn of 1980, conversion of the overhead electrification from 6.25kV ac to the standard supply of 25kV ac of the Liverpool St. to Shenfield line.

The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) opened on 31 August 1987 reusing redundant rail routes through the Bow and Poplar areas to reach the new Docklands developments on the Isle of Dogs. Initially the line used one of the south facing bays which had been built for the Fenchurch street via Bow Road service (but never used).

===Privatisation era: 1996–present===

In the 1990s, the low-level station was substantially rebuilt as part of the Jubilee Line Extension works. This work included three additional surface platforms and a train crew building (designed by Troughton McAslan) and a large steel and glass building that encloses much of the low-level station, providing a new ticket hall (designed by Wilkinson Eyre). The old ticket hall, at the eastern end of the station and connected via a subway, has since been demolished. The Jubilee line opened to passengers on 14 May 1999 as far as station, and to and in November 1999. 

In preparation for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the capacity of the station was tripled at a cost of around £200m, with construction work funded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (£125m) and Westfield. It was estimated that around 120,000 people would use the station at peak periods during the Games. 

Construction took place between 2005 and 2011, and work included:

* New high level DLR platforms, allowing three-car trains to use the station. These platforms were designed by Will Alsop, and opened in December 2007.
* Expansion, reopening and refurbishment of interchange subways
* Provision of step free access to all platforms, including 14 new lifts
* Widened and lengthened platforms 
* New mezzanine entrance on the south side of the station, connecting to a unpaid pedestrian link bridge over the railway funded by Westfield 
* New platforms for London Overground (newly built high-level platforms 1 &amp; 2, moving from the original low-level platforms 1 &amp; 2). These opened in spring 2009.
* Additional Spanish solution westbound platform for the Central line. This opened in September 2010.
* New northern ticket hall built as part of the Westfield Stratford City development, adjacent to Stratford City bus station
* An extension of the DLR to Stratford International station using the old North London line route from Canning Town, using the platforms vacated by the North London line. This opened in August 2011.

Since the turn of the millennium, &quot;passenger movements&quot; have risen from around 40 million a year in 2006 to 128 million in 2019, making it one of Britain&#x27;s major rail interchanges.

From 6 November 2022, Elizabeth line services enter the central tunnel built as part of the Crossrail project, allowing direct trains to Heathrow and Reading via Paddington. All trains, save for some early morning, late night and peak hour services, go via Whitechapel.

Work started in 2023 to add a new entrance to the station at its southwestern corner, adjacent to the Jubilee line concourse, allowing access to the Carpenters Estate. This will reducing walking time for local residents by up to 20 minutes.
The new entrance opened on 10 July 2024.

==Station layout==


===High-level platforms===

The high-level platforms run at right angles to the low-level, roughly east–west. The Docklands Light Railway serving platforms 16 and 17 passes beneath the high-level station. Except for platforms 4A and 4B, access from the main station entrance is via subways, one of which links the Jubilee line platforms directly to platforms 3 and 5 to 10. Another subway, which had served the old entrance to the station, was re-opened in September 2010.
* Platforms 1 and 2 are used by the London Overground&#x27;s Mildmay line. They comprise an island platform with a step-free link to platform 12 and the subways linking to platforms 3 to 11. The platforms can accommodate trains with up to six carriages, though at present, due to short platforms elsewhere, shorter trains are used.
* Platforms 3, 3A and 6 are used by the London Underground Central line, which rise from their tunnels onto the overground here and then immediately descend back underground upon departure from Stratford. Platforms 3 and 6 are island platforms providing cross-platform interchange with the Elizabeth line and weekend c2c services operating from platforms 5 and 8 respectively, while platform 3A has a direct step-free connection at mezzanine level, facilitating easier interchange with Jubilee line trains on platforms 13 to 15 and DLR trains on platforms 4A and 4B. Westbound Central line trains travelling towards central London open doors on both sides so that passengers can alight and board trains from either platform, reducing dwell times and peak-hour congestion in the passageways.
* Platforms 4 and 7 are disused. When the main line to was electrified in the 1940s there was an intention to run a shuttle service from to Stratford, calling at Stepney East (now Limehouse) and , which would have terminated at these bay platforms. However, this service was never introduced (despite all the works required being carried out). From the 1980s platform 4 was used as the terminus of the DLR while platform 7 remained abandoned. In 2007, platform 4 was abandoned again as the DLR moved to two new platforms to the south of platform 4, though these are signposted as &quot;platform 4&quot; within the station.
* Platforms 4A and 4B (signposted as &quot;platform 4&quot;) are used by the DLR for services to Poplar, Canary Wharf, and . They are formed of an island platform, and are not accessed by the subways but through a separate entrance on the upper level of the main concourse.
* Platforms 5 and 8 are used by Elizabeth line stopping services on the electric line between Paddington and Shenfield. They may also be used by some Greater Anglia-operated main line trains to and from . Weekend c2c trains call on the way to or from Liverpool Street connecting to or from the London, Tilbury and Southend line via . Cross-platform interchange is available with the Central line running from platforms 3 and 6 respectively.
* Platforms 9, 10 and 10A are used by Greater Anglia services on the main line out of Liverpool Street towards and intermediate stations and branch lines. Originally there were only two platforms here, but in the 1990s the station buildings on platform 9 were demolished to make an island platform with faces on both sides. The new face became number 9, the former 9 became 10, and the previous platform 10 became 10A.
* Platforms 11 and 12 are used for the Greater Anglia services to that start from Stratford. There is currently a half-hourly service Mondays to Saturdays, with additional services to and from , , or in the peak hours with a half-hourly service to Hertford East on Sundays. In 2021 these platforms were additionally used for London Overground&#x27;s North London line.

===Low-level platforms===
These platforms are at ground level and run north–south. Platforms 13 to 16 are served by a footbridge (with lifts and escalators) from the main station entrance, while platform 17 adjoins directly onto the main station concourse.
* Platforms 13 to 15 were built in the late 1990s to serve the Jubilee line when it was extended to Stratford in 1999. All three are bay platforms. A footbridge joins the platforms at the southern end, away from the main station building. Since 2018, almost all trains use platforms 14 and 15 (an island platform), with platform 13 only seeing a few trains at either end of the day (including Night Tube services).
* Platforms 16 and 17 (known as platforms 1 and 2 until 2009) originally served trains from Palace Gates in north London to , but this service has since been discontinued. In the 1980s, North London line trains from to Broad Street were diverted to run via these platforms to North Woolwich. Following the closure of the line to North Woolwich in 2006, these effectively became terminus platforms, with trains departing westbound only towards Richmond. Following the North London line trains moving to new platforms 1 and 2 on the high level, they were converted in 2011 for use by DLR services: platform 16 is for northbound trains to and platform 17 is for southbound trains via to . The new platforms have also been built with a reversing siding immediately to the south, accessible from both running lines. This enables trains from Stratford International to terminate at Stratford and trains from Canning Town to also terminate here. There is also a crossover immediately to the north, allowing trains from the southbound platform to reverse onto the northbound line back to Stratford International.

==Services==

Stratford is a major rail hub with services operated by Greater Anglia, London Overground (on the Mildmay line), the Elizabeth line and London Underground (on the Central and Jubilee lines). The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:


==Electrification==
All lines at Stratford are electrified, although a few passenger and freight services which pass through this station are hauled by diesel locomotives. At one time there were four different systems of electrification in use, a record for any station in London. However, since the diversion of the North London line from the low-level to the new high-level platforms these trains have changed the electrical system they use while at this station. The remaining systems used are:
* 25 kV 50 Hz overhead on Network Rail lines, including Mildmay line (high level)
* 630 V DC fourth rail on London Underground Central and Jubilee lines
* 750 V DC bottom-contact conductor rail on Docklands Light Railway
* Since April 2009, 750 V DC third rail is no longer used at this station. This was used for the London Overground (low level) North London line services.

In 1949, the Great Eastern Main Line through Stratford was electrified at 1,500VDC overhead before being converted to 6.25kV AC 50Hz overhead in 1960 and converted again to 25kV in about 1976.

==Geography==
===Channelsea River===
The Channelsea River is a culverted major tidal stream that is one of the Bow Back Rivers that flow into the Bow Creek part of the River Lea. It flows under Stratford station and rises along the Jubilee line platforms to the south. It was diverted in the 19th century by the Great Eastern Railway and again during construction of the Jubilee line platforms in the 1990s.

==Nearby facilities==

===Goods facilities===
There were three primary goods facilities in the Stratford area in the steam age, although the nearby Stratford Works and engine shed generated their own traffic. A short distance to the north of Stratford station (on the line to Cambridge) there were marshalling yards at Temple Mills. There was a small goods yard north of the station on the east side of the line which occupied a constrained site. The mainstay of traffic was domestic coal although shortly before closure in the 1960s the site was used as a reception point for concrete components for the building of tower blocks in Newham.

There was a small depot at Carpenters Road about a quarter of a mile south of Stratford station. Opened in 1900, the depot consisted of four long sidings and primarily dealt with coal and building materials. It was closed on 7 December 1964.

There was a large depot at Stratford Market railway station. All of these three facilities were operated by the Great Eastern Railway up until 1923 before being taken over by the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until nationalisation in 1948 when they became part of British Railways Eastern Region.

There was also a goods terminal at Bow operated by the Midland Railway which is still open today mostly for building materials. This yard operated as the terminal for building materials for the adjacent Olympics site.

Between Stratford and Maryland stations Windmill Lane cattle pens existed on the down side of the line whilst four private sidings belonging to Young &amp; Martens were located on the up side.

During the 1960s part of the Stratford Works site was converted to the London International Freight Terminal (LIFT) which opened in 1967 and there was a freight liner terminal that operated on the far side of the Stratford railway complex (on the Channelsea Loop line) between 1967 and 1994. The former site is now occupied by the international station and shopping centre.

===Stratford International===

The nearby Stratford International station opened on 30 November 2009 (for preview services only). Since 13 December 2009 Southeastern began its full domestic high-speed service between London St Pancras, directly to Ebbsfleet International and Ashford in Kent. The Docklands Light Railway &#x27;Stratford International&#x27; extension has provided a link between the two stations since 31 August 2011. There is also a walking route between the two stations passing through Westfield Stratford City Shopping Centre.

Despite Stratford International&#x27;s name, no international trains call there, and Eurostar (currently the only international operator) has no plans to do so. Passengers instead interconnect on high-speed trains travelling to either London St Pancras or Ebbsfleet in Kent, there are a number of other potential operators that may use the station for international services. These include Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s proposed London-Frankfurt/Amsterdam service.

===Stratford City===

In preparation for the Olympics and the Stratford City development, a new north-facing exit and ticket hall has been built. Both existing passenger subways have been extended north to connect with the ticket hall, and the abandoned subway at the eastern end of the station, which formed part of the old station complex, has been reopened and refurbished to allow interchange between platforms 3–12 and the new high-level platforms 1 &amp; 2. A new pedestrian bridge has also been built to connect Stratford shopping centre with the Stratford City development. This also connects the mezzanine-level ticket hall with the northern one. The northern ticket hall and the footbridge opened along with Westfield Stratford City on 13 September 2011.

===Bus stations===
Stratford bus station is to the south of the station and Stratford City bus station is to the north. Both are served by bus services right across London and to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

==Future proposals==
Stansted Express may call at Stratford in the future via the West Anglia Main Line, reconnecting the two to each other.

The Hall Farm Curve link could be reinstated allowing a Liverpool Street to Chingford service via Stratford. Designs for new services have been suggested to reduce journey times between Chingford and Stratford to 20 minutes, and high-frequency journeys between Walthamstow Central and Stratford to 12 minutes from the current duration of about 35 minutes.

=== Rebuild of station ===
In the 2020s, work is underway planning a rebuild of the station. &quot;Passenger movements&quot; have grown by 90 million in 13 years, and this is predicted to rise by 60% by 2041, leading to overcrowding. Three different plans have been outlined, ranging from &quot;modest changes to a major redevelopment of the station&quot;. Redevelopment would also include transit-oriented development including new homes and offices.

<doc id="370064" wikidata="Q190588" url="?curid=370064" title="Love Actually">
<text>Love Actually is a 2003 Christmas romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis. The film features an ensemble cast, composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous projects. An international co-production of the United Kingdom, United States and France, it was mostly filmed on-location in London. The film delves into different aspects of love as shown through 10 separate stories involving a variety of individuals, many of whom are interlinked as the plot progresses. The story begins six weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place in the New Year.

The film was released in the US on 14 November 2003 and a week later in the UK during its theatrical run. &quot;Love Actually&quot; was a box-office success, grossing $250.2million worldwide on a budget of $40million. The film received mixed reviews and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. A made-for-television short film sequel, &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;, aired in two different versions on BBC One and NBC in 2017, as part of the fundraising event Red Nose Day 2017. In retrospective years, it has developed a cult following, and is often a staple film shown during the Christmas period in both the United Kingdom and United States.

==Plot==
A voice-over opens the film, commenting that whenever the narrator gets gloomy about the state of the world, he thinks of the arrivals gate at London Heathrow Airport, and the pure and uncomplicated love of lovers, friends and families welcoming their loved ones. He also points out that the messages from the 9/11 victims were messages of love and not hate. The story then switches among the interconnecting &quot;love stories&quot; of many people:

===Billy Mack and Joe===
With his long-time manager Joe (Gregor Fisher), rock and roll legend Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) records a Christmas version of the Troggs&#x27; 1967 song &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, titling it &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot;. Although believing the record is terrible, Mack promotes the release in the hope it will become the Christmas number one single, which it does. He forgoes a victory party hosted by Elton John to celebrate Christmas with Joe, since he realised that Christmas was the time to be with the people one loved. Billy then confesses to Joe that he turned out to be the love of his life. After hugging each other, Billy suggests that they get drunk and watch porn.

===Juliet, Peter, and Mark===
The wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is videotaped by the best man, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), where a surprise band plays the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as they walk out of the church. Although Juliet believes Mark dislikes her, he is actually in love with her.

When he evades her requests to see the video he shot at the wedding, she shows up at his flat. Juliet insists she wants them to be friends, but when she views the wedding video Mark recorded, she sees many extreme close-ups of herself and few of Peter&#x27;s face. She realises Mark&#x27;s true feelings towards her. After an uncomfortable silence, Mark blurts out that he acts coldly toward her out of &quot;self-preservation&quot;.

On Christmas Eve, Juliet answers the doorbell to find Mark carrying a boombox playing a Christmas carol and large cue cards. While Peter is inside watching television, Mark shows a message of his love to Juliet through a series of cue cards. As he walks away down the street, Juliet runs after him, gives him a quick kiss, and returns inside. Mark walks away, uttering &quot;Enough&quot;, to imply he can move on and be content as friends.

===Jamie and Aurélia===
Writer Jamie (Colin Firth) is pushed by his girlfriend to attend Juliet and Peter&#x27;s wedding alone because she is ill. He returns before the reception to check on her, discovering she is having sex with his younger brother. Crushed, Jamie withdraws to his French cottage, where he meets Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz), who does not speak English. Despite not sharing a common language, a mutual attraction grows.

Jamie returns to the United Kingdom, realises he is in love with Aurélia and begins learning Portuguese. He returns to Marseille, France to find her and ends up walking through town with her father and sister, gathering additional people as they walk to her waitressing job. In basic, and often grammatically incorrect, Portuguese, he declares his love for her and proposes. She says yes in broken English, showing she too had been studying English &quot;just in cases&quot;, as the crowd erupts in applause.

===Harry, Karen, and Mia===
Harry (Alan Rickman) is the managing director of a design agency. Mia (Heike Makatsch) is his secretary. Harry is married to Karen (Emma Thompson), a stay-at-home mother. They have two children, Bernard and Daisy (Lulu Popplewell). Mia behaves in an overtly sexual way with him at the office and asks him for a Christmas present. At the company Christmas party held at Mark&#x27;s gallery, they dance closely.

Before Christmas shopping at a department store, Harry calls Mia and asks what she wants for Christmas. He is almost caught by his wife purchasing an expensive necklace with a gold heart pendant from the jewelry department when the salesman, Rufus (Rowan Atkinson), takes an inordinate amount of time to wrap it. Later, Karen finds the necklace in Harry&#x27;s coat pocket and assumes it is for her. 

Opening a similarly shaped box on Christmas Eve, she is heartbroken to find it is a Joni Mitchell CD, realises he bought the necklace for someone else, and cries in their bedroom alone. She keeps a happy face so as not to ruin her family&#x27;s holiday. She later confronts Harry and asks what he would do if he were her. She feels he has made a mockery of their marriage and of her. Harry comes clean and admits that he has been foolish.

===David and Natalie===
David (Hugh Grant), Karen&#x27;s brother and the recently elected Prime Minister, is single. Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) is a new junior member of the household staff at 10 Downing Street. During a meeting with the US president (Billy Bob Thornton), they pass Natalie, and the president makes inappropriate comments to David about her. Later, David walks in on Natalie who is serving tea and biscuits to the president, and finds him kissing her. Natalie seems embarrassed, and the president has a sly grin on his face. At the following 
joint press conference, David is uncharacteristically assertive while taking a stand against the president&#x27;s intimidation techniques.

Feeling uncomfortable around Natalie, David has her moved to another position. He is spurred to action on Christmas Eve when he finds a Christmas card from her in his red box, declaring that she is his and only his. He finds her after a door-to-door search of her street. Her entire family is on their way to a multi-school Christmas play, and he offers to drive them so he can talk to her. As Natalie sneaks him into the school, he runs into his heartbroken sister, Karen, who believes he is there for his niece and nephew. As David and Natalie try to keep from being seen and watch from backstage, they finally kiss. Everyone sees them kissing as the back-cloth is raised.

===Daniel, Sam, Joanna, and Carol===
Daniel (Liam Neeson), Karen&#x27;s close friend, mourns the recent death of his wife, Joanna, as he tries to care for his stepson Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster). Sam has fallen for an American classmate, also named Joanna (Olivia Olson), and after talking with his stepfather, decides to learn the drums to accompany her in the big finale of their school&#x27;s Christmas pageant at Karen and Harry&#x27;s children&#x27;s school.

Sam feels he has missed his chance to impress her, but Daniel convinces him to try to tell Joanna how he feels at the airport before she returns to the US. Sam slips through airport security and catches up with her. She acknowledges him by name, which surprises him. Sam returns to Daniel to tell him, and Joanna follows him, surprising him again, and kisses him on the cheek.

A subplot in this storyline involves Daniel stating a few times his wish to date Claudia Schiffer. Eventually, Daniel meets Carol (portrayed by Claudia Schiffer) who is the mother of Sam&#x27;s schoolmate, and there is a mutual spark.

===Sarah, Karl, and Michael===
Sarah (Laura Linney) first appears at Juliet and Peter&#x27;s wedding, sitting next to Mark. An American working at Harry&#x27;s graphic design company, she is in love with the creative director, Karl (Rodrigo Santoro). Prompted by Harry, they finally connect at the Christmas party, and Karl drives her home. Sarah invites Karl in and they immediately pull off their clothes and begin to get intimate when Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), her mentally ill brother, telephones from a psychiatric hospital, aborting their tryst. On Christmas Eve, they are both working late. Karl tries to find words but just wishes her a merry Christmas and leaves. In tears, Sarah calls Michael and visits him to give him a Christmas gift.

===Colin, Tony, and the American girls===
After unsuccessfully attempting to woo various British women, including Mia and Nancy (Juliet and Peter&#x27;s wedding caterer; Julia Davis), Colin Frissell from Basildon (Kris Marshall) informs his friend Tony (Abdul Salis) that he plans to go to the US, convinced that his Britishness will be an asset. Landing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US, Colin hails a taxi and asks the driver to take him to the nearest bar. There, he immediately meets Stacey (Ivana Miličević), Jeannie (January Jones), and Carol-Anne (Elisha Cuthbert), three stunningly attractive women who instantly fall for his Estuary English accent, and invite him to stay at their home, where they are joined by their &quot;sexiest&quot; roommate Harriet (Shannon Elizabeth).

===John and Judy===
John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are professional stand-ins for films. They meet doing the sex scenes for a film for which Tony is a production assistant. John tells Judy, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.&quot; While they are perfectly comfortable being naked and simulating sex on-set, they are shy and tentative off-set. They carefully pursue a relationship, attending the Christmas pageant (involving David and Natalie, Harry and Karen&#x27;s children, Daniel and Sam) at the local school with John&#x27;s brother. They get engaged by the end of the film.

===Rufus===
Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) is the jewellery salesman at Department Store whose meticulous gift-wrapping nearly results in Karen seeing Harry buying a necklace for Mia. In another scene, his distraction of airport staff at Heathrow enables Sam to sneak past them to talk to Joanna. In the director and cast commentary, it is revealed that Rufus was originally supposed to be a Christmas angel, but this was dropped from the final script.

===Epilogue===
A month later, all the characters are seen at Heathrow Airport. Billy&#x27;s Christmas single has spurred a comeback. Juliet, Peter, and Mark meet Jamie and his bride, Aurélia. Karen and the kids greet Harry, but Karen&#x27;s stilted reaction suggests they are struggling to move past his affair. 

Sam greets Joanna, who has returned from the US, and Daniel is joined by his new girlfriend, Carol, and her son. Newlyweds John and Judy, heading off to their honeymoon, run into Tony who is awaiting Colin&#x27;s return from the US. Colin returns with Harriet and her sister Carla, who meets Tony for the first time and greets him with a hug and a kiss on the lips. 
Natalie welcomes David back from his flight in view of the press, showing that their relationship is now public. These scenes dissolve into footage of actual arrivals at Heathrow, as the screen is divided into an increasing number of smaller segments to form a photographic mosaic of a heart.

===Story association===
All the stories are linked in some way; while Mack and his manager do not connect with the other characters physically, Billy appears frequently on characters&#x27; radios and TVs, his music video twice providing an important plot device for Sam&#x27;s pursuit of Joanna, and they also cross paths with the other characters in the closing Heathrow scene. John and Judy work with Tony, who is best friends with Colin, who works for a catering company that services the office where Sarah, Karl, Mia, and Harry work. Mia is friends with Mark, who runs the art gallery where the Christmas office party takes place. Mia also lives next door to Natalie. Mark is in love with Juliet and friends with Peter. The couple is friends with Jamie and Sarah. Harry is married to Karen, who is friends with Daniel, and her brother is David, who works with Natalie. Harry and Karen&#x27;s children (and thus David&#x27;s niece and nephew), Natalie&#x27;s siblings (and thus Mia&#x27;s neighbours), and Carol&#x27;s son are all schoolmates of Sam and Joanna. Daniel proclaims that his late wife was the only one for him unless he met Claudia Schiffer. Carol is played by Schiffer.

==Production==
===Development===

Initially, Curtis started writing with two distinct and separate films in mind, each featuring expanded versions of what would eventually become storylines in &quot;Love Actually&quot;: those featuring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. He changed tack and became frustrated with the process. Partly inspired by the films of Robert Altman as well as films such as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and inspired by Curtis having become &quot;more interested in writing a film about love and what love sort of means&quot; he had the idea of creating an ensemble film. The film initially did not have any sort of Christmas theme, although Curtis&#x27;s penchant for such films eventually caused him to write it as one.

Curtis&#x27;s original concept for the film included fourteen different scenarios, but four of them were cut (two having been filmed). The scene in which Colin attempts to chat up the female caterer at the wedding appeared in drafts of the screenplay for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, but was cut from the final version. The music video for Billy Mack&#x27;s song, &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot;, is a tribute to Robert Palmer&#x27;s 1986 video, &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;. Curtis has spoken negatively about the editing process for the film, which he labelled in 2014 as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and &quot;the only nightmare scenario that I&#x27;ve been caught in&quot;. The film was rushed in order to be ready for the 2003 Christmas season which he likened to &quot;three-dimensional chess&quot;. For the scene in which Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s character Rufus annoys Harry, Alan Rickman&#x27;s reaction was reportedly genuine, having been &quot;driven insane&quot; by the time constraints. Hugh Grant disliked filming the dance scene as he called it &quot;excruciating&quot; and &quot;absolute hell&quot;. In a 2023 interview, Curtis would later call the card scene &quot;a bit weird&quot;.

===Casting===
Ant &amp; Dec played themselves in the film with Nighy&#x27;s character referring to Dec as &quot;Ant or Dec&quot;. This refers to the common mistaking of one for the other, owing to their constant joint professional presence as a comedy and presenting duo. The veteran actress Jeanne Moreau is seen briefly, entering a taxi at the Marseille Airport. The soul singer Ruby Turner appears as Anderson&#x27;s mother, one of the backing singers at the school Christmas pageant. Helder Costa plays Mr Barros, Aurelia&#x27;s father. He is a veteran actor in Portuguese cinema. Thompson used the experience of her own marriage breaking up for the role of Karen. Joe Alwyn auditioned for the role of Sam; Alwyn read scenes with Grant and Curtis.

Curtis cast his mother-in-law, actress Jill Freud, as the Prime Minister&#x27;s cleaner. Curtis cast his daughter Scarlett in the film; she was given the choice of being an angel or a lobster, and played the part of Lobster number 2 in the nativity play, on the condition that she meets Keira Knightley. Curtis originally had two actors in mind for the part of Mack, but he could not decide and then told casting director Mary Selway to find someone who would do the part well but whom he would never think to cast; she suggested Nighy.

===Locations===
Most of the film was made on location in London, including Heathrow Airport, Trafalgar Square, the central court of Somerset House in the Strand, Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street near Hyde Park, St Paul&#x27;s Church, Clapham, the Millennium Bridge, Selfridges department store on Oxford Street, Lambeth Bridge, the Tate Modern in the former Bankside Power Station, Canary Wharf, Marble Arch, St. Luke&#x27;s Mews off All Saint&#x27;s Road in Notting Hill, Chelsea Bridge, the OXO Tower, London City Hall, Poplar Road in Herne Hill, Elliott School in Pullman Gardens, Putney, and Marseille Airport. Scenes set in 10 Downing Street were filmed at Shepperton Studios.

===Standing up to the US president===
Following Tony Blair&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister, pundits and speculators commented on a potential anti-American shift in Gordon Brown&#x27;s cabinet as a &quot;&quot;Love Actually&quot; moment&quot;, referring to the scene in which Hugh Grant&#x27;s character stands up to the US President. 

In 2009, during President Barack Obama&#x27;s first visit to the UK, Chris Matthews referred to the president in &quot;Love Actually&quot; as an example of George W. Bush and other former presidents&#x27; bullying of European allies. Commenting on this, Mediaite&#x27;s Jon Bershad described the U.S. president character as a &quot;sleazy Bill Clinton/George W. Bush hybrid&quot;. 

In the scene in question, the swaggering president bullies the prime minister and then sexually harasses a member of the household staff. In September 2013, David Cameron made a speech in reply to Russia&#x27;s comment that Britain was &quot;a small island no one listens to&quot;, which drew comparisons with Hugh Grant&#x27;s speech during the film.

===Cut storyline===
One storyline consisting of two scenes, featuring the only gay love story, was cut and not included. In the first scene, Anne Reid, as the headmistress of Karen&#x27;s children&#x27;s school, is revealed to be going home to her terminally ill partner, Geraldine, played by Frances de la Tour. In the second scene, while speaking at the Christmas concert, Karen acknowledges Geraldine&#x27;s recent death. Curtis said he regretted losing this storyline.

==Soundtrack==

===US version===
The US edition of the soundtrack removed two pieces of the score and &quot;Sometimes&quot; by Gabrielle and reordered the tracklist. It also replaced the Girls Aloud cover of &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; with the original by The Pointer Sisters, and replaced Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; with a medley of &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; with &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;.

===Score===
The film&#x27;s original score was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Craig Armstrong. It was commercially unreleased until 19 November 2021, when it was released digitally by Universal Pictures&#x27; Back Lot Music, and on CD by La-La Land Records.
===Certifications===


The soundtrack album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and by Christmas 2018 it had spent 348 weeks on the Chart. It reached the top forty on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2004 and ranked second on the Top Soundtracks chart.

===Use in film===
The UK and US versions of the actual film contain two instances of alternative music. In the UK cut, the montage leading up to and continuing through the first part of the office party is set to the song &quot;Too Lost in You&quot;, by the British group Sugababes. In the US version of the film, this song is replaced with &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;, performed by the American singer Kelly Clarkson. Subsequently, in the UK version&#x27;s end credit roll, the second song is a cover of &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; performed by Girls Aloud; in the US version, this song is replaced with &quot;Too Lost in You&quot;.

Several songs were heard in the film but did not appear on either soundtrack:
* &quot;Bye Bye Baby (Baby Goodbye)&quot; performed by Bay City Rollers
* &quot;Puppy Love&quot; performed by S Club Juniors
* &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; performed by Tessa Niles
* &quot;River&quot; performed by Joni Mitchell
* &quot;Rose&quot; from the &quot;Titanic&quot; score, written by James Horner
* &quot;Like I Love You&quot; performed by Justin Timberlake
* &quot;All Alone on Christmas&quot; performed by Darlene Love
* &quot;Smooth&quot; by Santana featuring Rob Thomas
* &quot;Silent Night&quot; performed by Pre Teens
* &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; performed by Hugh Grant (as David) and Andrew Tinkler (as Gavin)
* &quot;Catch a Falling Star&quot; performed by child cast

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Love Actually&quot; grossed $59.7million in the United States and Canada, $62.7million in the United Kingdom, and $122.6million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $244.9million, against a budget of $40million. It spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the U.S. box office.

===Critical response===

Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;love British style, handicapped slightly by corny circumstance and populated by colorful neurotics&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half out of four stars, describing it as &quot;a belly-flop into the sea of romantic comedy ... The movie&#x27;s only flaw is also a virtue: ... It feels a little like a gourmet meal that turns into a hot-dog eating contest.&quot;

Nev Pierce of the BBC awarded it four of a possible five stars and called it a &quot;vibrant romantic comedy ... Warm, bittersweet and hilarious, this is lovely, actually. Prepare to be smitten.&quot; In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, journalist A. O. Scott called it &quot;a romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic&quot; and added, &quot;It is more like a record label&#x27;s greatest-hits compilation or a &quot;very special&quot; sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.&quot;

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers rated it two stars out of a possible four, saying &quot;there are laughs laced with feeling here, but the deft screenwriter Richard Curtis dilutes the impact by tossing in more and more stories.&quot; Christopher Orr of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; was negative toward the work and described it as the least romantic movie of all time, considering its ultimate message to be &quot;It&#x27;s probably best if you give up on love altogether and get on with the rest of your life.&quot;

Since its initial release some publications have come to regard &quot;Love Actually&quot; as a cult film as it is habitually watched by many people as a holiday staple. Despite this, the film continues to be highly divisive amongst critics and audiences. Publications such as CNN, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot; have written positively about &quot;Love Actually&quot; whilst others such as &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; have panned the film. Some publications in later years have labelled it as one of the worst Christmas films ever made.

==Accolades ==
==Other adaptations==
The screenplay by Richard Curtis was published by Michael Joseph Ltd. in the United Kingdom and by St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin in the US.

==&quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;==

In 2017, Richard Curtis wrote a script for Red Nose Day that reunited a dozen characters and picked up their storylines fourteen years later. Filming began in February 2017, and the short film was broadcast on BBC One on 24 March 2017.

== Home media ==
Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in November 2009. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 21 November 2023 for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, featuring a 4K restoration.

<text>Queensbury is a London Underground station in Queensbury, north-west London. It is on the Jubilee line between Canons Park and Kingsbury stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
The station opened on 16 December 1934 on the Stanmore branch of the Metropolitan line, which was then transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1939, and then to the Jubilee line in 1979.

The name Queensbury did not, when it was chosen, refer to any pre-existing area. It was coined by analogy with the adjacent Kingsbury station. Most of the locale now known as Queensbury is actually to the north-west of the tube station, in the London Borough of Harrow, just across the borough border from the tube station, which is in the London Borough of Brent.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 79, 114, 288 and 324, night route N98 and non-TFL routes 614 and 644 serve the station.

==The Hive Stadium==
Since 2013 and together with Canons Park station, Queensbury station is the next Tube station for &quot;The Hive Stadium&quot;, the new football ground of Barnet FC, that is located 400 metres north along the railway tracks.

==Trivia==

The station, and its local surroundings and characters were cited in the song &quot;Queensbury Station&quot; by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band The Magoo Brothers on their album &quot;Beyond Believable&quot;, released on the Bouncing Corporation label in 1988. The song was written by Paul Bonin and Melanie Hickford, who both grew up and lived in the area.

<doc id="370066" wikidata="Q7500046" url="?curid=370066" title="Shoepeg corn">
<text>Shoepeg corn is a cultivar of white sweetcorn valued for its sweetness. It is characterized by small, narrow kernels tightly and unevenly packed on the cob. The corn has a sweet, mild flavor. The most common variety of shoepeg corn available today is &quot;Country Gentleman.&quot;
Shoepeg corn is popular in some regions of the United States, particularly in the South. An early promoter of canned shoepeg corn was Malcolm Mitchell of Maryland — &quot;Mitchell&#x27;s Shoe Peg Sweet Corn&quot; is a brand still available today. The brand was owned by F.O. Mitchell &amp; Bro., Inc., which was founded in 1903 by brothers Frederick O. Mitchell and Parker Mitchell Sr. The brand was sold to Hanover Brands, Hanover, PA in the late 1980s. Although its original center of production was turned into the Aberdeen Proving Ground soon after the U.S. declared war on the Central Powers in April 1917.

The name &quot;shoepeg corn&quot; derives from a shoemaking term used during the 19th century. Shoepeg corn kernels resemble the wooden pegs used to attach soles to the upper part of shoes.

Shoepeg corn is a common ingredient in salads and corn dishes throughout the Southern United States, but is relatively unknown in other areas of the country. It is on rare occasions available fresh in some areas, but it is most often canned. Shoepeg corn is also the best variety of corn for Sockeye salmon bait.

<text>Stanmore is a London Underground station in Stanmore, north-west London. It is the northern terminus of the Jubilee line and the next station towards south is Canons Park. The station is on the south side of London Road (part of the A410) and is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==History==
Stanmore station was opened on 10 December 1932 by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line). The station building and those on the branch were designed by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s architect, Charles W. Clark, in the suburban style used on the company&#x27;s other post-First World War stations such as those on the Watford branch. The introduction of fast, direct trains into London attracted commuters to the Metropolitan Railway and presented competition for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, who operated a rival train service from Stanmore Village railway station approximately away. The slower LMS trains ran on the Stanmore branch line as far as , where they connected with London-bound services, but after 20 years of competing with the Metropolitan line, the Village station was closed by British Railways in 1952.

In 1934, a proposal to extend the Metropolitan line northwards was discussed by the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s Engineering Committee as an alternative or complementary scheme to the extension of the Northern line from Edgware. It would have required of double track tunnel to reach the proposed station at Elstree South with Metropolitan line trains continuing to Bushey or Aldenham. A revision of the proposal in 1936, considered extending the Stanmore line to Elstree. The proposals were not included in the plans eventually submitted for parliamentary approval in the LPTB&#x27;s New Works Programme.

Following construction of deep-level tube tunnels between Finchley Road and Baker Street, the Stanmore branch of the Metropolitan line with its five stopping stations between Finchley Road and Wembley Park was transferred to the Bakerloo line on 20 November 1939. This service was then transferred to the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979.

In 2005, Transport for London began the construction of a third platform at the station. This was structurally complete by the summer of 2009 but could not be brought into use until new signalling equipment on that part of the line had been commissioned, the platform opening to use in July 2011.

== Services ==
Stanmore station is the northern terminus of the Jubilee line and the next station is Canons Park to the south.

The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 12tph to Stratford

The peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

<text>Lambeth North is a London Underground station in the district of Lambeth, at the junction of Westminster Bridge Road and Baylis Road. It is the penultimate station on the Bakerloo line between Waterloo and Elephant &amp; Castle stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 1. It is located at 110 Westminster Bridge Road, and is the nearest tube station to the Imperial War Museum. In 2017, it was ranked the least-used Underground station in Zone 1.

==History==
Designed by Leslie Green, the station was opened by the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway on 10 March 1906, with the name &quot;Kennington Road&quot;. It served as the temporary southern terminus of the line until 5 August 1906, when Elephant &amp; Castle station was opened. The station&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Westminster Bridge Road&quot; in July 1906 and it was again renamed, to Lambeth (North), in April 1917, and then to Lambeth North in 1928.

At 03:56 on 16 January 1941, a German &quot;Satan&quot; 1800 kg general-purpose bomb hit a hostel at nearby 92 Westminster Bridge Road. The shock wave severely damaged the southbound platform tunnel injuring 28 people sheltering there, one of whom died in hospital 15 days later. Thirty-seven rings of the damaged tunnel had to be completely replaced, 15 partially replaced, and of platform rebuilt. Traffic through the station resumed after 95 days.

The station closed for maintenance works in July 2016, and reopened in February 2017.

==Layout==
There are two tracks in separate tunnels. The station has two lifts and a spiral staircase connecting the street level to platform level (about below). Immediately north of the station is a crossover enabling trains to terminate at either platform. This is necessary for trains that are stabled at the London Road Depot, which can be seen on London Road at St George&#x27;s Circus, and connects with the Bakerloo line north of the station. The Northern line does not serve the station but only passes beneath it.

==Services==

The typical service pattern in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6tph to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone via Queens Park &amp; Stonebridge Park (Northbound)
* 3tph to Stonebridge Park via Queens Park (Northbound)
* 5tph to Queens Park (Northbound)
* 14tph to Elephant and Castle (Southbound)

==Connections==
London Buses routes 12, 53, 59, 148, 159 and 453 and night route N109 serve the station.

<text>Regent&#x27;s Park is a London Underground station south of Regent&#x27;s Park. It is on the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Oxford Circus stations. Its access is on Marylebone Road, within Park Crescent, in Travelcard Zone 1, in which zone it is the second-least used station (least-used is Lambeth North) – it saw 3.5 million entries or exits in 2015. It is west of Great Portland Street tube station on the same arterial road. It is the nearest station to exit for London Zoo.

==History==

The station was opened on 10 March 1906 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR); in the original parliamentary authority for the construction of the BS&amp;WR no station was allowed at Regent&#x27;s Park. Permission was granted to add it to the already partially constructed line in 1904. In 1983, London Transport proposed to close the station on the basis that the passenger lifts, which at the time were 77 years old, needed to be replaced at a cost of more than £3 million. The proposal was dropped following a request by the GLC for the matter to be reconsidered.

==Station design==
Construction of the station ticket hall involved digging a box like void underneath the garden above. This caused significant subsidence, this is why the large metal beams in the ticket hall are present.

Unlike most of the BS&amp;WR&#x27;s other stations, Regent&#x27;s Park has no surface buildings and is accessed from a subway. The station is served by lifts, and between 10 July 2006 and 14 June 2007 it was closed to allow essential refurbishment work on these and other parts of the station. There is also a staircase which can be used which has 96 steps.

Nearby points of interest are Regent&#x27;s Park itself, the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Physicians, Holy Trinity Church, Portland Place and Harley Street.

Great Portland Street station is within walking distance to the east for interchanges to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines; however, out-of-station interchange fares do not apply and both journeys will continue to be charged separately.

==Services==
The typical service pattern in trains per hour (tph) operated during off-peak hours weekdays and all day Saturdays is:
* 6tph to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone via Queen&#x27;s Park and Stonebridge Park (Northbound)
* 3tph to Stonebridge Park via Queen&#x27;s Park (Northbound)
* 11tph to Queen&#x27;s Park (Northbound)
* 20tph to Elephant &amp; Castle (Southbound)
Weekday peak service operates with one or two additional Queen&#x27;s Park-Elephant &amp; Castle trains per hour, and Sunday service operates with two fewer Queen&#x27;s Park-Elephant &amp; Castle trains per hour during the core of the day.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses routes 18, 27, 30, 88, 205, 453 and night route N18.

<text>Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira (; born 17 May 1952 in Cambrils, Catalonia, Spain) is a Catalan politician. He was the vice-president of the Catalan Government from 2006 to 2010. From 1996 to 2008 he was the leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia (&quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot;, ERC).
ERC campaigns for Catalonia&#x27;s independence from Spain and, secondarily, extend it to other Catalan Countries, the whole Catalan linguistic domain.

He was one of the two vice presidents of the Catalan autonomous government formed after the 2006 Catalan regional election. He now serves as vice president of the Ramon Llull Foundation. Previously, after the previous 2003 cabinet, he was appointed First Minister (Catalan: &quot;conseller en cap&quot;) of the Generalitat de Catalunya. After his, at times, controversial style, eventually the other partners in the cabinet forced him to resign after his action culminated in a secret meeting with representatives of the Basque separatist group ETA, which was leaked to the press; this was followed by general political pressure asking for his resignation.

== Education and professional background ==
Carod-Rovira received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Catalan philology from the UB. He then enrolled as a teacher of the Catalan language at the University School of Tarragona (from 1978 to 1982). In the university world, he was also professor and vice president of the Catalan Summer University (&quot;Universitat Catalana d&#x27;Estiu&quot;) between 1986 and 1995. Before this, he also worked as Head Technician of Generalitat&#x27;s linguistic planning policy (1981–1988) and headed the Cultural Territorial Services of the Generalitat at Tarragona (1982 to 1984).

==Civic background==
Carod-Rovira has been involved in several civic organisations, among which are &quot;Òmnium Cultural&quot; (member of its board between 1986 and 1995 and president of its Tarragonès division), &quot;Llull-Federació d&#x27;Entitats dels Països Catalans&quot; (member of its board between 1991 and 1995), the &quot;castellers&quot; association &quot;Colla Jove Xiquets de Tarragona&quot; (&quot;colla&quot; means association), the Catalan Language Writers Association, the PEN Club of Catalonia and the &quot;Societat Catalana d&#x27;Onomàstica&quot;.

As a writer, he has published &quot;Rovira i Virgili i la qüestió nacional&quot; (1994), &quot;Marcel·lí Domingo, de l&#x27;escola a la República&quot; (1988), &quot;Tornar amb la gent&quot; (1997), &quot;Jubilar la Transició&quot; (1998), &quot;El futur a les mans&quot; (2003) and &quot;La nova Catalunya&quot; (2003). He also has contributed in the &quot;Catalans from America Dictionary&quot; and in the book &quot;America and Catalonia&quot;, as well as several encyclopedias and specialized magazines. He has won several awards for historical essays and journalism.

==Political background==
He was actively involved in the fight against the authoritarian government of Franco and was jailed in 1973 when the 113 members of the Permanent Board of Assembly of Catalonia were arrested and the board was dissolved. Before entering, in 1987, ERC, he was an active member of the Socialist National Liberation Party (PSAN) between 1970 and 1977 and of the Left Nationalists (NE) between 1980 and 1986. Carod-Rovira also wrote the Resolution about the right to self-determination of the Catalan nation in 1989.

Carod-Rovira was first elected general secretary of ERC in November 1996, in the 21st National Congress of the party at Vilafranca del Penedès. He was reelected in Girona (22nd National Congress) by July 1998 and in Tarragona (23rd National Congress) by March 2001.

Carod-Rovira is president of ERC since its 24th National Congress, held in Lleida on 3 and 4 July 2004.

After the Catalan elections in 2003, he achieved the position of First Minister of the Catalan government between December 2003 and January 2004 in the coalition government led by socialist Pasqual Maragall, when he was forced to resign over his secret meeting with ETA. He subsequently became a candidate for the Spanish Congress of Deputies in the elections of March 2004 and his party got eight seats and almost quadrupled its popular support. This represented a major boost for ERC, which had had at most one seat since the establishment of the Spanish modern democracy in 1979. After the elections, Carod-Rovira asked for its substitution as a deputy and remained in the Catalan Parliament.

==Institutional background==
Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira has been deputy at the Parliament of Catalonia since 1988 and also was First Minister of the Generalitat de Catalunya between December 2003 and January 2004. He was the vice president of the Catalan Government in the eighth constituency.

<text>The Republican Left of Catalonia (, ERC; ; generically branded as ) is a pro-Catalan independence, social democratic political party in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia, with a presence also in Valencia, the Balearic Islands and the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales (Northern Catalonia). It is also the main sponsor of the independence movement from France and Spain in the territories known as Catalan Countries, focusing in recent years on the creation of a Catalan Republic in Catalonia proper. Its current president is Oriol Junqueras and its secretary-general is Elisenda Alamany. The party is a member of the European Free Alliance.

ERC, a party of relevant Catalan politicians including Francesc Macià, Lluís Companys and Josep Tarradellas, played an important role in Catalan and Spanish politics during the Second Republic, the Civil War, the anti-Francoist resistance and the transition to democracy. Recovering a key position during the 2000s, it became a coalition partner in various Catalan governments, obtaining in 2021 the presidency of Catalonia for the first time since 1980 after the appointment of Pere Aragonès as President of the Generalitat. In 2022, it had 9,047 members.

==History==
===Republic and first Catalan self-government (1931–1936)===
After the fall of Primo de Rivera (1930), the Catalan left made great efforts to create a united front under the leadership of left-wing independentist leader Francesc Macià. The Republican Left of Catalonia was founded on the Conference of the Catalan Left held in Sants, Barcelona, on 19 March 1931 as the union of the independentist Estat Català (&quot;Catalan State&quot;), led by Francesc Macià, the Catalan Republican Party, led by Lluís Companys and the &quot;L&#x27;Opinió&quot; Group of Joan Lluhí i Vallescà. The party had done extremely well in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. Two days later, on 14 April, few hours before the proclamation of the Spanish Republic in Madrid, Macià proclaimed in Barcelona the Catalan Republic within the Iberian Federation. This was not exactly what had been agreed in the Pact of San Sebastián, so three days later they negotiated with the Madrid government that Macià would become president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, an autonomous Catalan government within the recently founded Spanish Republic.

In September 1932, the Spanish Republican Cortes approved the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia which, among other provisions, granted a Catalan Parliament with full legislative powers, and it was elected on 20 November 1932. The Republican Left of Catalonia, in coalition with the Socialist Union of Catalonia and other minor left-wing parties, won a large majority of seats (67 of 85), while the previously hegemonic Regionalist League, representing a more conservative view of Catalan nationalism, came in second place but far behind ERC (17 from 85). From this strong position, the ERC sought to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie, approving laws in areas such as in culture, health, education and civil law, and the Crop Contracts Law, which protected tenant farmers and granted access to the land they were cultivating, but it was contested by the Regionalist League and provoking a legal dispute with the Spanish government. In October 1933, Joan Lluhí and other members of the l&#x27;Opinió Group, as well Josep Tarradellas, left ERC because there were in disagree with Macià over the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and the President of the Generalitat, and founded the Nationalist Republican Left Party (PNRE).

On 6 October 1934, Lluís Companys, who had been elected by the Parliament of Catalonia as the new President of the Generalitat after the death of Francesc Macià in December 1933, following the entry of right-wing ministers of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the Government of the Spanish Republic, unlawfully declared a Catalan State within a &quot;Spanish Federal Republic&quot;. CEDA was considered close to fascism and, therefore, it was feared that this was the first step towards suppressings the autonomy and taking complete power in Spain. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan government was arrested. The party leaders (including Companys itself) and the Catalan government were sentenced by the Supreme Court of the Republic and jailed, while the Statute of Autonomy was suspended until February 1936.

In 1936, at the dawn of the Spanish Civil War, ERC became part of the Popular Front to contest that year&#x27;s election. Esquerra became the leading force of the Popular Front, (called &quot;Front d&#x27;Esquerres&quot;, &quot;Left Front&quot; in Catalan) in Catalonia, which it won 41 from 54 Catalan seats, 21 of them belonging to ERC. The new left-wing Spanish government pardoned Companys and the members of the Catalan government, restoring the self-government. In June Estat Català split from ERC, while the PNRE rejoined it.

===Civil War, Francoism and clandestinity (1936–1976)===
During the Spanish Civil War ERC, as the leading force of the Generalitat, tried to maintain the unity of the Front in the face of growing tensions between the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and the pro-soviet Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), while struggled to recover the control of the situation, de facto controlled by the anarchist trade union CNT and their militias, and attempted to organize the war efforts in Catalonia. President Companys appointed Josep Tarradellas &quot;Conseller Primer&quot; (Prime Minister) in order to form a coalition government with the other Republican forces, including anarchists and communists. However, the party unsuccessfully tried to avoid the full control of Catalonia by the Republican government, enacted after the May Days event.

The party was declared illegal (along with all other participants in the &quot;Popular Front&quot;) by Francisco Franco after he came to power in 1939. The former president of the Catalan Generalitat, Lluís Companys, was arrested by Nazi German agents in collaboration with Vichy France, returned to Spain and executed on 15 October 1940 in Montjuïc Castle, Barcelona.

Since 1939, despite the weak situation of the party, almost disbanded after the Francoist occupation of Catalonia, ERC went underground and tried to organize anti-fascist resistance around Manuel Juliachs and Jaume Serra. In 1945, the ERC Congress, held in Toulouse since many ERC members lived in exile in France, appointed former Minister Josep Tarradellas as Secretary General, a position he left in 1954 when he was elected President of the Generalitat of Catalonia in exile, replacing Josep Irla. The office of General Secretary of ERC then passed to Joan Sauret. At the end of World War II, in view of a possible overthrow of Francoist Dictatorship with the intervention of the Allied forces, the direction of ERC in exile sent to Catalonia Pere Puig and Joan Rodríguez-Papasseit. During those years ERC was present at the Council of Catalan Democracy and the Council of Democratic Forces. In 1952, Heribert Barrera returned to the interior and assumes the direction of the party &quot;de facto&quot;. On 11 September 1964, the National Day of Catalonia, ERC and other groups organized the first anti-Franco demonstration since the end of the war. ERC participated successively in any initiative that confronts the Dictatorship.

===Transition to democracy and the years of decline (1976–1987)===

After the death of General Franco (1975), ERC celebrated in July 1976 the 8th National Congress, in which Barrera was confirmed as leader. In the election to Constituent Cortes of 1977, ERC went into coalition, as it was not yet legalized because of its status as a Republican party. ERC had requested registration in the register of political parties on 14 March of that year, but the Ministry of Interior - a month after the elections - responded: &quot;The name proposed by the entity, referring to a political system incompatible with the one that is legally valid in Spain, can represent an assumption of inadmissibility &quot;. The party tried a coalition with Left Front or with Democratic Convergence, although finally it allied with the Party of Labour of Spain. The name of the electoral coalition was Left of Catalonia–Democratic Electoral Front (&quot;Esquerra de Catalunya-Front Electoral Democràtic&quot;). The coalition won a seat (Barrera). Some of the electoral promises were the Statute of Autonomy or a referendum about the Monarchy.

In October 1977, President Josep Tarradellas (a founder of the party in 1931) returned to Catalonia and the Generalitat was restored. A new text of the Statute was drafted, which ERC opposed because it did not guarantee a minimum self-government. However, in the referendum for its approval, in 1979, ERC was in favour, as it was the only way to regain autonomy. In the first election to the restored Parliament of Catalonia, in 1980, ERC obtained 14 seats (out of a total of 135), which brought Barrera to the Presidency of the Parliament of Catalonia. At the crossroads of forming a tripartite with the PSUC and the socialists or favouring Convergència i Unió (CiU), Barrera—refractory to alliances with parties from a Marxist tradition—determined ERC would vote Jordi Pujol (CiU) as president of the Generalitat without compensation and without joining the government, as a gesture of &quot;national unity&quot;. In 1984, however, ERC only obtained five deputies, and began a brief period of decline, overshadowed by the hegemony of the center-right Catalan nationalist coalition CiU. This trend persisted during the next years. In 1986, it lost its presence in the Spanish Cortes.

=== Recovering (1986–1996) ===
In 1987, the National Call manifesto was published, signed by personalities like Àngel Colom and Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira, who wanted ERC to bring together the new generation of independentists that aroses as a result of the disenchantment with the Spanish Transition. The entrance of these young people dynamizes the party, and in the Catalan election of 1988 obtained six seats. In 1989 a new direction led by Àngel Colom assumed the independence of Catalonia as a political aim. As a result of this new orientation, in 1990, the National Front of Catalonia, a historic organization founded in exile in 1940, joined ERC. In 1991, the organization Terra Lliure reconsidered its strategy, and abandoned the armed struggle, where some of its members joined ERC and many of those who formed Catalunya Lliure were incorporated too. These facts turned ERC, de facto, into the reference of the left-wing Catalan independentism.

The results obtained in the 1992 election to the Parliament of Catalonia placed ERC as the third political force of Catalonia, with the support of more than 210,000 voters and the obtaining of 11 seats, after a campaign in which, for the first time a party that appeared as a pro-independence party was widely popular. The 18th National Congress of ERC, held in June 1992, approved the reform of its statutes in the face of electoral growth, militancy and territorial presence. ERC advocates in its first statutory article the territorial unity and independence of the Catalan Countries, building its own state within the European framework and together with an ideological position of the left that takes the defense of democracy and environment, human rights and rights of the peoples, and based its ideology and political action on social progress and solidarity.

In the 1993 Spanish general election, ERC recovered its presence in the Congress of Deputies. The same year, Jordi Carbonell and Avel·lí Artís i Gener &quot;Tísner&quot;, Left Nationalists members, joined ERC. The local elections of 28 May 1995 represented an important quantitative and qualitative leap of the institutional presence of the party. ERC recovered the presence in many local councils of Catalonia, reaching more than 550 elected councillors and 32 mayors, and thus becomes the third municipal political force. In the 1995 Catalan election, ERC obtained the best result in number of votes since the Republic era, more than 305,000 voters and 13 seats.

In 1996, after a serious internal crisis, Àngel Colom, along with Pilar Rahola left the party and founded the Independence Party. This party, however, had a short life. In the local elections of 1999, they obtained poor results and Pilar Rahola, who presented himself as head of the list in Barcelona, did not obtain a seat. After that, the party was dissolved.

=== New era with Carod Rovira and return to the Government ===

In November 1996, the 21st National Congress of ERC was held. The militants chose a new direction for the party, with Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira as new president and Joan Puigcercós as new general secretary. The new direction announced some changes on the strategy: it does not renounce the independence of Catalonia, but it stops using that idea as the only reference. The new direction wanted to place the party as the new reference of the Catalan left.

On 16 November 2003, in the election to the Parliament of Catalonia, ERC obtained 23 seats, becoming the &quot;key party&quot; that would define the composition of the government, since to obtain the majority the other parties were obliged to agree with ERC. After several weeks in which it seemed that he would close an agreement with CiU (center-right and nationalist party), it finally opted for a &quot;progressive pact&quot; (called the Pact of the Tinell or popularly the &quot;Tripartit&quot;) with the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia and the ecosocialist coalition ICV-EUiA.

ERC became part of the tripartite government of the Generalitat, chaired by the socialist Pasqual Maragall, assuming six government departments, among which the &quot;Conseller en Cap&quot; (Prime Minister), belonging to Carod-Rovira. The other five ministries assumed by ERC were Education (Josep Bargalló), Welfare and Family (Anna Simó), Commerce, Tourism and Consumption (Pere Esteve), Government and Public Administration (Joan Carretero) and Universities, Research and Information Society (Carles Solà). In addition, another ERC leader, Ernest Benach, was elected President of the Parliament.

Despite having been one of the main forces behind the movement for amendment, the party eventually opposed the 2006 changes to the Catalan Statute of Autonomy to increase Catalonia&#x27;s autonomy. It did so on the grounds that it did not do enough to increase Catalan self-government. This caused a government crisis with its partners (specially with the PSC) which led to an early election in 2006.

== Ideology ==
The party has been described historically as social democratic and more recently as democratic socialist. ERC is a strong supporter of Catalan independence, as well as being regionalist, Catalan nationalist, eco-nationalist, and left-wing nationalist. Additionally, it advocates for republicanism and regionalism, and has a federalist faction. It is a catch-all/big tent party in nature, and is generally positioned as centre-left to left-wing.

==Political principles and representation==

Its basic political principles are defined in the Statement of Ideology approved at the 19th National Congress in 1993. This is organised into the three areas that give the organisation its name: Esquerra (commitment to the Left&#x27;s agenda in the political, economic and social debate), República (commitment to the Republican form of government vs. Spain&#x27;s current constitutional monarchy) and Catalunya (Catalan independentism, which, as understood by ERC, comprises the Catalan Countries).

The party is also federated with parties in the Balearic Islands and in Northern Catalonia in France, as well as with Republican Left of the Valencian Country in the Valencian Community. Except for their Balearic counterpart, none of the latter currently have any parliamentary representation in their respective territories, though they do have eight municipal councillors in the Balearic Islands and six councillors in the Valencian Community. Occitan Republican Left, formed in 2008, acts as the Aranese section of the party.

The Republican Left of Catalonia is the oldest political party in Catalan politics that has supported the idea of a sovereign Catalan nation for the entirety of its existence. From the inception of ERC in 1931, they have always been in favor of
statehood for Catalonia.

After the last Catalan parliamentary election in 2021, the Republican Left of Catalonia has 33 seats in the Parliament of Catalonia, making it the largest group by number of seats, tied with the PSC, and second in number of votes. It also has one seat in the Balearic Parliament. Until 2010, it was one of the three coalition members of the tripartite left-wing Catalan Government, together with Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV). The coalition was often uneasy due to tensions related to the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. The snap election on 25 November 2012 saw ERC rise to a total of 21 seats in the Catalan Parliament. Out of Catalonia, it has thirteen seats (fifth largest group) in the Spanish Parliament, eleven seats in the Senate (third largest group) and two seats in the European Parliament.

<text>Euston () is a London Underground station. It directly connects with its National Rail railway station above it. The station is in Travelcard Zone 1.

Euston was constructed as two separate underground stations. Three of the four Northern line platforms date from the station&#x27;s opening in 1907. The fourth Northern line platform and the two Victoria line platforms were constructed in the 1960s when the station was significantly altered to accommodate the Victoria line. Plans for High Speed 2 and Crossrail 2 both include proposals to modify the station to provide interchanges with the new services.

The station serves two branches of the Northern line and the Victoria line. On the Northern line&#x27;s Bank branch, the station is between Camden Town and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras stations. On the line&#x27;s Charing Cross branch, it is between Mornington Crescent and Warren Street stations. On the Victoria line, it is between Warren Street and King&#x27;s Cross St. Pancras stations. The station is near Euston Square station allowing connections at street level to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines.

==History==

===Northern line===

====Planning====
An underground station to serve Euston station was first proposed by the Hampstead, St Pancras &amp; Charing Cross Railway in 1891. The company planned a route to run from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross with a branch diverging from the main route to run under Drummond Street to serve Euston, St Pancras and King&#x27;s Cross stations. Following parliamentary review of the proposals and a change in name to the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR), permission was granted for the route in 1893, although the branch line was only permitted as far as Euston.

For the remainder of the 1890s, the CCE&amp;HR struggled unsuccessfully to raise the necessary capital to fund construction of the new line. Whilst doing so it continued to develop its route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route at the south end of Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE&amp;HR was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary finance.

The same year, a proposal was presented to Parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I&amp;ER) for an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C&amp;SLR was in the process of constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant that it had to be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King&#x27;s Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C&amp;SLR itself, was successful and approved in 1903.

====Construction and opening====

With funding obtained, tunnelling for the CCE&amp;HR was carried out between September 1903 and December 1905, after which the station buildings and fitting-out of the tunnels commenced. The C&amp;SLR&#x27;s Euston extension was constructed at the same time from the newly opened Angel station and opened on 12 May 1907, with the station building designed by Sidney Smith located on the east side of Eversholt Street. The CCE&amp;HR opened on 22 June 1907; its building, designed by Leslie Green, is located at the corner of Drummond Street and Melton Street.

Although built and initially operated as two separate stations by the two companies, the C&amp;SLR and the CCE&amp;HR platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE&amp;HR building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.
====Reconstruction and extension====
Most of the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s route had been constructed with tunnels or in diameter, smaller than the diameter that had been adopted as the standard for the CCE&amp;HR and other deep level tube lines. The smaller tunnel size restricted the capacity of the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s trains and, in 1912, the C&amp;SLR published a bill for their enlargement. A separate bill was published at the same time by the London Electric Railway (LER), that included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C&amp;SLR at Euston to the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable trains of each company to run over the route of the other, effectively combining the two separate railways. The reconstruction and extension works were postponed during World War I and did not begin until 1922. The C&amp;SLR platforms and the tunnels between Euston and Moorgate were closed for the reconstruction on 8 August 1922. They reopened on 20 April 1924 along with the new link to Camden Town.

===London &amp; North Western Railway===

In 1906, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), operator of the main line station, announced proposals to construct an underground station of its own. The company planned to construct new tracks parallel with its line to Watford, the first section of which would have been constructed as a single-track loop long and deep beneath the surface station. The single platform underground station would have been close to the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s platforms. The proposal was presented to Parliament in November 1906 and received royal assent on 26 July 1907. The LNWR did not proceed with the loop plan and the underground station, which were dropped in 1911.

===Victoria line===

====Planning====
Plans for the route that eventually became the Victoria line date from the 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre was included in the &quot;County of London Plan&quot; in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or north-east London. Each of these connected the three main line termini at King&#x27;s Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.

====Construction and opening====

At Euston, major reconstruction works were undertaken to incorporate the new Victoria line platforms so that cross-platform interchanges could be provided with the Northern line&#x27;s Bank branch—the former C&amp;SLR route to King&#x27;s Cross and Bank. Unlike the Charing Cross branch tracks, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide cross-platform interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. Each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.

In conjunction with the reconstruction of the main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury &amp; Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.

==Future proposals==
Unlike the neighbouring main line termini, St Pancras and King&#x27;s Cross, Euston is not served by the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines. Euston Square station, which is served by these lines, is approximately to the south-west. Plans for the redevelopment of the main line station for High Speed 2 (HS2) include the construction of a direct connection to Euston Square. The CCE&amp;HR station building on Melton Street sits within the HS2 development site area and will be demolished to make way for the station.

Proposals for Crossrail 2 include an underground station serving Euston and St Pancras that will be integrated with the existing London Underground station.

A new underground line between Euston and Canary Wharf has been suggested and is being considered by the government.

==Services==
Euston station is on the Northern and Victoria lines and is in Travelcard Zone 1. On the Northern line&#x27;s Bank branch the station is between Camden Town and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras. On the line&#x27;s Charing Cross branch it is between Mornington Crescent and Warren Street. On the Victoria line it is between Warren Street and King&#x27;s Cross St. Pancras. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally, Northern line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:49 to 00:45 northbound and 05:49 to 00:28 southbound. Victoria line trains operate every 1–6 minutes from approximately 05:41 to 00:42 northbound and 05:31 to 00:26 southbound.

==Connections==
London Bus routes are served by Euston bus station outside the main line station.

<text>Warwick Avenue () is a London Underground station in Little Venice in the City of Westminster, north-west London. The station is on the Bakerloo line, between Maida Vale and Paddington stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

== History ==

Warwick Avenue opened on 31 January 1915 on the Bakerloo tube&#x27;s extension from Paddington to Queen&#x27;s Park.

The ticket hall and its ticket machines were destroyed by fire overnight on 17 September 1985, causing the station to be closed for the day.

== Location and layout ==
The station is located at the junction of Warwick Avenue, Warrington Crescent and Clifton Gardens. For a time prior to its opening, the proposed name for the station was &quot;Warrington Crescent&quot;.

There is no surface building and the station is accessed by two sets of steps to a sub-surface ticket hall. It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use escalators rather than lifts. A plain, utilitarian brick ventilation shaft has been built on the traffic island in the middle of the road to improve ventilation of the tunnels.

==Connections==
London Bus Routes 6, 46 and 187 serve the station.

A regular waterbus service runs from nearby Little Venice along the Regent&#x27;s Canal; during the summer months boats depart hourly towards London Zoo and Camden Lock.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;Warwick Avenue&quot; by British singer Duffy makes reference to the station.

<text>Maida Vale () is a London Underground station in Maida Vale in inner north-west London. The station is on the Bakerloo line, between Kilburn Park and Warwick Avenue stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station is a Grade II listed building being of architectural and historic interest. In 2009 the station won a National Railway Heritage Award, in the London Regional category, for the successful modernisation of a historic station.

== History ==

A proposed 1908 extension of the Bakerloo Line had envisaged a stop at nearby Abercorn Place but this route was rejected. Maida Vale opened on 6 June 1915 on Bakerloo tube&#x27;s extension from Paddington to Queen&#x27;s Park five months after the extension. At the time, it was the first station to be entirely staffed by women. The women continued to work at the Maida Vale station until 1919 when servicemen returning from the war displaced them. The outbreak of World War II again opened up jobs for women.
On 6 June 2015, the station celebrated its 100th anniversary as part of the 100 years of women in transport campaign.

== Location and layout ==
The station is located at the junction of Randolph Avenue and Elgin Avenue and has a surface building designed by Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s architect Stanley Heaps. He used a standardized design that appears in many station buildings under control of UERL whilst Maida Vale was provided with buildings in the style of the earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use escalators rather than lifts.

==Transport links==

Bus routes 16 and 98, and Night Bus routes N32 and N98 serve Maida Vale road, a short distance to the north-east.

== In popular culture ==
The station surface building and the distinctive staircase mosaics feature in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Downhill&quot;, as well as the 1983 film &quot;Runners&quot;, written by Stephen Poliakoff. Both films feature shots down the escalators, those in the earlier production being the original wooden versions.

The exterior was used for a scene in the 1974 film adaptation of the popular British television situation comedy &quot;Man About the House&quot;.

A scene shot at platform level—complete with arriving train—appears in the video for The Chemical Brothers&#x27; single &quot;Believe&quot; (2005).

Maida Vale tube station also features in a montage of scenes in the 2013 Richard Curtis film &quot;About Time&quot;, where the two main characters enter and leave the different platforms via the escalators.

In the 2014 film &quot;Paddington&quot;, the exterior was used to depict the fictional &#x27;Westbourne Oak&#x27; station, an amalgamation of the nearby Westbourne Park and Royal Oak stations. Interior scenes filmed at nearby St John&#x27;s Wood Station.

<text>Kilburn Park is a London Underground station at Kilburn in the London Borough of Brent. The station is on the Bakerloo line, between Queen&#x27;s Park and Maida Vale stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station is situated on Cambridge Avenue approximately west of Kilburn High Road, shortly before it becomes Maida Vale, (A5). It is Grade II listed.

==History==

Kilburn Park was opened on 31 January 1915 as the temporary terminus of the Bakerloo line&#x27;s extension from Paddington station towards Queen&#x27;s Park. Services were extended to Queen&#x27;s Park on 11 February 1915. At the extension&#x27;s opening, Maida Vale station was not complete and the previous station was Warwick Avenue until 6 June 1915. The station building was designed by Stanley Heaps in a modified version of the earlier Leslie Green designed Bakerloo line stations with glazed terra cotta façades but without the large semi-circular windows at first floor level. It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use escalators rather than lifts.

It opened a short distance south of Kilburn High Road station which had previously handled much of the commuter traffic of the area, providing a quicker connection to the West End.

==Transport links==
Bus routes 31, 32, 206, 316, 328, school route 632 and night routes N28 and N31 serve the station. Also, it is only a short walk from Kilburn High Road Station (London Overground) on the Lioness line.

<text>Linux malware includes viruses, Trojans, worms and other types of malware that affect the Linux family of operating systems. Linux, Unix and other Unix-like computer operating systems are generally regarded as very well-protected against, but not immune to, computer viruses.

==Linux vulnerability==
Like Unix systems, Linux implements a multi-user environment where users are granted specific privileges and there is some form of access control implemented. To gain control over a Linux system or to cause any serious consequences to the system itself, the malware would have to gain root access to the system.

In the past, it has been suggested that Linux had so little malware because its low market share made it a less profitable target. Rick Moen, an experienced Linux system administrator, counters that:

In 2008 the quantity of malware targeting Linux was noted as increasing. Shane Coursen, a senior technical consultant with Kaspersky Lab, said at the time, &quot;The growth in Linux malware is simply due to its increasing popularity, particularly as a desktop operating system ... The use of an operating system is directly correlated to the interest by the malware writers to develop malware for that OS.&quot;

Tom Ferris, a researcher with Security Protocols, commented on one of Kaspersky&#x27;s reports, stating, &quot;In people&#x27;s minds, if it&#x27;s non-Windows, it&#x27;s secure, and that&#x27;s not the case. They think nobody writes malware for Linux or Mac OS X. But that&#x27;s not necessarily true.&quot;

Some Linux users do run Linux-based anti-virus software to scan insecure documents and email which comes from or is going to Windows users. SecurityFocus&#x27;s Scott Granneman stated:

Because they are predominantly used on mail servers which may send mail to computers running other operating systems, Linux virus scanners generally use definitions for, and scan for, all known viruses for all computer platforms. For example, the open source ClamAV &quot;Detects ... viruses, worms and trojans, including Microsoft Office macro viruses, mobile malware, and other threats.&quot;

Cases of malware intended for Microsoft Windows systems posing a danger to Linux systems when run through compatibility layers such as Wine, while uncommon, have been recorded.

===Viruses and trojan horses===
The viruses listed below pose a potential, although minimal, threat to Linux systems. If an infected binary containing one of the viruses were run, the system would be temporarily infected, as the Linux kernel is memory resident and read-only. Any infection level would depend on which user with what privileges ran the binary. A binary run under the root account would be able to infect the entire system. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities may permit malware running under a limited account to infect the entire system.

It is worth noting that this is true for any malicious program that is run without special steps taken to limit its privileges. It is trivial to add a code snippet to any program that a user may download and let this additional code download a modified login server, an open mail relay, or similar program, and make this additional component run any time the user logs in. No special malware writing skills are needed for this. Special skill may be needed for tricking the user to run the (trojan) program in the first place.

The use of software repositories significantly reduces any threat of installation of malware, as the software repositories are checked by maintainers, who try to ensure that their repository is malware-free. Subsequently, to ensure safe distribution of the software, checksums are made available. These make it possible to reveal modified versions that may have been introduced by e.g. hijacking of communications using a man-in-the-middle attack or via a redirection attack such as ARP or DNS poisoning. Careful use of these digital signatures provides an additional line of defense, which limits the scope of attacks to include only the original authors, package and release maintainers and possibly others with suitable administrative access, depending on how the keys and checksums are handled. Reproducible builds can ensure that digitally signed source code has been reliably transformed into a binary application.

===Worms and targeted attacks===
The classical threat to Unix-like systems are vulnerabilities in network daemons, such as SSH and web servers. These can be used by worms or for attacks against specific targets. As servers are patched quite quickly when a vulnerability is found, there have been only a few widespread worms of this kind. As specific targets can be attacked through a vulnerability that is not publicly known there is no guarantee that a certain installation is secure. Also servers without such vulnerabilities can be successfully attacked through weak passwords.

===Web scripts===
Linux servers may also be used by malware without any attack against the system itself, where e.g. web content and scripts are insufficiently restricted or checked and used by malware to attack visitors. Some attacks use complicated malware to attack Linux servers, but when most get full root access then hackers are able to attack by modifying anything like replacing binaries or injecting modules. This may allow the redirection of users to different content on the web. Typically, a CGI script meant for leaving comments, could, by mistake, allow inclusion of code exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser.

===Buffer overruns===
Older Linux distributions were relatively sensitive to buffer overflow attacks: if the program did not care about the size of the buffer itself, the kernel provided only limited protection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the rights of the vulnerable application under attack. Programs that gain root access even when launched by a non-root user (via the setuid bit) were particularly attractive to attack. However, as of 2009 most of the kernels include address space layout randomization (ASLR), enhanced memory protection and other extensions making such attacks much more difficult to arrange.

===Cross-platform viruses===
An area of concern identified in 2007 is that of cross-platform viruses, driven by the popularity of cross-platform applications. This was brought to the forefront of malware awareness by the distribution of an OpenOffice.org virus called Badbunny.

Stuart Smith of Symantec wrote the following:

What makes this virus worth mentioning is that it illustrates how easily scripting platforms, extensibility, plug-ins, ActiveX, etc, can be abused. All too often, this is forgotten in the pursuit to match features with another vendor... The ability for malware to survive in a cross-platform, cross-application environment has particular relevance as more and more malware is pushed out via Web sites. How long until someone uses something like this to drop a JavaScript infecter on a Web server, regardless of platform?

===Social engineering===
As is the case with any operating system, Linux is vulnerable to malware that tricks the user into installing it through social engineering. In December 2009 a malicious waterfall screensaver that contained a script that used the infected Linux PC in denial-of-service attacks was discovered.

=== Go-written malware ===
The &quot;IBM Security Report: Attacks on Industries Supporting COVID-19 Response Efforts Double&quot; had as a key point that &quot;Cybercriminals Accelerate Use of Linux Malware – With a 40% increase in Linux-related malware families in the past year, and a 500% increase in Go-written malware in the first six months of 2020, attackers are accelerating a migration to Linux malware, that can more easily run on various platforms, including cloud environments.&quot; That these cybercriminals are increasingly using Linux and Unix to target hospitals and allied industries (that rely on these systems and cloud networks) that they are increasingly vulnerable during the COVID-19 crisis, such as the Red Cross cyberattack.

==Anti-virus applications==

There are a number of anti-virus applications available which will run under the Linux operating system. Most of these applications are looking for exploits which could affect users of Microsoft Windows.
===For Microsoft Windows-specific threats===
These applications are useful for computers (typically, servers) which will pass on files to Microsoft Windows users. They do not look for Linux-specific threats.

===For Linux-specific threats===
These applications look for actual threats to the Linux computers on which they are running.

* chkrootkit (free and open source software)
* ClamAV (free and open source software)
* Comodo (proprietary)
* Crowdstrike (proprietary)
* Dr.Web (proprietary)
* ESET (proprietary)
* Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool (KVRT) for Linux (free)
* Linux Malware Detect
* lynis (open source auditing)
* rkhunter (free and open source software)
* Samhain (free and open source software)
* Sophos (proprietary)

Linux malware can also be detected (and analyzed) using memory forensics tools, such as:
* Forcepoint (proprietary)
* Volatility (free and open source software)

==Threats==

The following is a partial list of known Linux malware. However, few if any are in the wild, and most have been rendered obsolete by Linux updates or were never a threat. Known malware is not the only or even the most important threat: new malware or attacks directed to specific sites can use vulnerabilities previously unknown to the community or unused by malware.

===Botnets===
* Mayhem – 32/64-bit Linux/FreeBSD multifunctional botnet
*Linux.Remaiten – a threat targeting the Internet of things.
*Mirai (malware) – a DDoS botnet spreads through telnet service and designed to infect Internet of Things (IoT).
* GafGyt/BASHLITE/Qbot – a DDoS botnet spreads through SSH and Telnet service weak passwords, firstly discovered during bash Shellshock vulnerability.
* LuaBot – a botnet coded with modules component in Lua programming language, cross-compiled in C wrapper with LibC, it aims for Internet of Things in ARM, MIPS and PPC architectures, with the usage to DDoS, spreads Mirai (malware) or selling proxy access to the cyber crime.
* Hydra, Aidra, LightAidra and NewAidra – another form of a powerful IRC botnet that infects Linux boxes.
* EnergyMech 2.8 overkill mod (Linux/Overkill) – a long-lasting botnet worm designed to infect servers with its bot and operated through IRC protocol, for the purposes of DDoSing and spreading itself.

<doc id="370085" wikidata="Q801347" url="?curid=370085" title="Queen's Park station (England)">
<text>Queen&#x27;s Park is an interchange station in London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground. On the Bakerloo line, the station is between Kensal Green and Kilburn Park stations. On the Lioness line, it is between Kensal Green and Kilburn High Road stations.

The station lies at the southern end of Salusbury Road, near the south-east corner of the public park from which the area now known as Queen&#x27;s Park has taken its modern name. It is located in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==

The station was first opened by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 2 June 1879, on the main line from London to Birmingham.

Services on the Bakerloo line were extended from Kilburn Park to Queen&#x27;s Park on 11 February 1915. On 10 May 1915, Bakerloo services began to operate north of Queen&#x27;s Park as far as Willesden Junction over the recently built Watford DC line tracks shared with the LNWR.

London Midland previously made three operational calls daily, which were not found in public timetables. As of the December 2013 timetable these stops no longer exist, with no main line services calling at the station.

==Station layout==
All platforms at Queen&#x27;s Park station are on the surface, the station being covered by a glazed roof. The slow main line platforms (platforms 5 and 6) are reserved for use during engineering work or partial line closures. The Bakerloo line tunnel portals are about to the east of the station. The two inner station tracks, platforms 3 (westbound) and 2 (eastbound), split into four tracks in a carriage shed to the west of the station. Bakerloo line services starting or ending at Queen&#x27;s Park normally do so in the two centre tracks of the four-track carriage shed. Bakerloo line trains joining or leaving the Watford DC line tracks (also used by the Lioness line) do so by passing through the carriage shed on one of the two outer tracks, which merge into the Watford DC line, the latter of which becomes the station&#x27;s outer tracks. Around a third of Bakerloo line trains terminate at Queen&#x27;s Park with others continuing onward to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.

All platforms are accessed by stairs and although there is local pressure for step-free access there are no firm plans for lifts or escalators to be installed. The stairs are all behind the ticket barriers.

==Services==
Queen&#x27;s Park is served by a mixture of trains operated by London Overground on the Lioness line and London Underground on the Bakerloo line. The current off-peak service is:

===London Underground (Bakerloo line)===
* 16 tph to Elephant &amp; Castle
* 4 tph to Stonebridge Park
* 4 tph to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone

8 tph from Elephant &amp; Castle terminate at Queen&#x27;s Park.

===London Overground (Lioness line)===
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to 

==Connections==
London Buses routes 6, 36, 187, 206, and 316 serve the station.

==Future improvements==
Great North Western Railway was given permission to run six trains per day from London to Blackpool North stopping at Queen&#x27;s Park from 2018, but these plans have yet to come to fruition. 

Queen&#x27;s Park may be the service&#x27;s terminus, as stopping patterns including permission to run the service beyond Queen&#x27;s Park to London Euston are dependent upon future infrastructural work to the West Coast Main Line.

<text>Kensal Green is an interchange station in London. It is served by Bakerloo line services of the London Underground and Lioness line services of the London Overground, between Willesden Junction and Queen&#x27;s Park stations. It is located in College Road, close to the junction with Harrow Road. The station is in a cutting with a tunnel at the western end. It is about 0.5 miles (750m) route distance from the older Kensal Rise station, located to the north east on the Mildmay line of the London Overground. 

==History==

The station opened on 1 October 1916 on the new electrified Watford DC line which runs parallel on the north side of the existing London and North Western Railway (LNWR) tracks from Euston to Watford.

The original station was replaced in 1980.

Bakerloo line services had been running between Queen&#x27;s Park and Willesden Junction since 10 May 1915.

Since November 2007, National Rail services serving Kensal Green have been operated by London Overground Rail Operations under contract to Transport for London under the London Overground brand; the station is managed by London Underground.

The station was in the news early in 2006, as it was the last station visited by Thomas ap Rhys Pryce before he was murdered in a robbery in Kensal Green. The two main suspects had also visited the station that same night, a short time before the murder, and mugged a man on the platform. A suspect also tried to use Pryce&#x27;s Oyster card a day after the incident at the station, and was picked up on CCTV, aiding the police investigation.

This incident sparked a major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was un-staffed when the passenger was mugged. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke on the issue of station safety and called on train companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station.

The Mayor of London at the time, Ken Livingstone, became personally involved in this, and publicly attacked Silverlink, the then operator of the station, for not providing staffing or security throughout the station&#x27;s opening hours. He also stated that any company that wanted to bid for the subsidy to run the train line would have commit to staffing the station until the last train had left. Eventually, towards the last quarter of 2006, Silverlink hired a private security firm to patrol the station, and also had speakers installed in the ticket hall to deter gangs of youths from loitering.

<text>Staog was the first computer virus written for the Linux operating system. It was discovered in the autumn of 1996, and the vulnerabilities that it exploited were fixed soon after. It has not been detected in the wild since its initial outbreak.

Staog was able to infect Linux despite its security-oriented design which requires users and programs to log in as root before any drastic operations can be taken. It worked by exploiting some kernel vulnerabilities to stay resident. Then, it would infect executed binaries.

Since it relied on fundamental bugs, software upgrades made systems immune to Staog. This, combined with its shot in the dark method of transmitting itself, ensured that it died off rather quickly.

Staog was written in assembly language by the hacker group VLAD.

<text>An offshore bank is a bank that is operated and regulated under international banking license (often called offshore license), which usually prohibits the bank from establishing any business activities in the jurisdiction of establishment. Due to less regulation and transparency, accounts with offshore banks were often used to hide undeclared income. Since the 1980s, jurisdictions that provide financial services to nonresidents on a big scale can be referred to as offshore financial centres. OFCs often also levy little or no corporation tax and/or personal income and high direct taxes such as duty, making the cost of living high.

With worldwide increasing measures on CTF (combatting the financing of terrorism) and AML (anti-money laundering) compliance, the offshore banking sector in most jurisdictions was subject to changing regulations. Since 2002 the Financial Action Task Force issues the so-called FATF blacklist of &quot;Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories&quot; (NCCTs), which it perceived to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

An account held in a foreign offshore bank is often described as an offshore account. Typically, an individual or company will maintain an offshore account for the financial and legal advantages it provides, including but not limited to:

* Strong privacy, including bank secrecy.
* Little or no corporate taxation via tax havens.
* Protection against local, political, or financial instability.

While the term originates from the Channel Islands being &quot;offshore&quot; from the United Kingdom, and while most offshore banks are located in island nations to this day, the term is used figuratively to refer to any bank used for these advantages, regardless of location. Thus, some banks in landlocked Andorra, Luxembourg, and Switzerland may be described as &quot;offshore banks&quot;.

Offshore banking has previously been associated with the underground economy and organized crime, tax evasion and money laundering; however, legally, offshore banking does not prevent assets from being subject to personal income tax on interest. Except for certain people who meet fairly complex requirements (such as perpetual travelers), the personal income tax laws of many countries (e.g., France, and the United States) make no distinction between interest earned in local banks and that earned abroad. Persons subject to US income tax, for example, are required to declare, on penalty of perjury, any foreign bank accounts—which may or may not be numbered bank accounts—they may have. Offshore banks are now required to report income to many other tax authorities, although Switzerland and certain other jurisdictions retain bank secrecy regimes that can be more difficult to deal with. This does not make the non-declaration of the income by the taxpayer or the evasion of the tax on that income legal and many OFCs have recently been important colleagues to onshore tax authorities and law enforcement against wrongdoers. Following the 9/11 attacks, there have been many calls to increase regulation on international finance, in particular concerning offshore banks, OFCs, crypto currency and clearing houses such as Clearstream, based in Luxembourg, which are possible crossroads for major illegal money flows. Most criminality involving the banking system has happened because of the regulations and controls being circumvented.

==Offshore banking comparison by jurisdictions==
The most popular offshore financial centres are in jurisdictions with a history of political and economic stability. In terms of offshore banking centres and in terms of total deposits, the global market is dominated by the US, Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. A letter by the District Attorney of New York, Robert M. Morgenthau, published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, states that the Cayman Islands has US$1.9 trillion on deposit in 281 banks, including 40 of the world&#x27;s top 50 banks, although official statistics published by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority suggest the amounts held on deposit are actually around US$1.5 trillion. Numerous other offshore jurisdictions also provide offshore banking to a greater or lesser degree. In particular, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man are also known for their well regulated banking infrastructure. Some offshore jurisdictions have steered their financial sectors away from offshore banking, thinking it was difficult to properly regulate and liable to give rise to financial scandal.

===Weakened bank secrecy===
Since starting to survey offshore jurisdictions on April 2, 2009, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at the forefront of a crackdown on tax evasion, will not object to governments using stolen bank data to track down tax evasion using offshore centers, such as in the 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair. The recent sharing of confidential UBS bank details about 285 clients suspected of willful tax evasion by the United States Internal Revenue Service was ruled a violation of both Swiss law and the country&#x27;s constitution by a Swiss federal administrative court. Nevertheless, OECD has removed 18 countries, including Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, from a so-called &quot;grey list&quot; of countries that did not offer sufficient tax transparency, and has re-categorized them as &quot;white list&quot; countries. Countries that do not comply may face sanctions.

A notable exception is Panama, whose canal provides it with a unique type of immunity to international pressure. Given the enlargement of the canal to accommodate larger shipping, it is unlikely that Panama would succumb in the foreseeable future to international pressure toward transparency.

===List of offshore financial centres===
==Scope of offshore banking==
Offshore banking constitutes a sizable portion of the international financial system. Some experts believe that as much as half the world&#x27;s capital flows through offshore centers. OFCs are said to have 1.2% of the world&#x27;s population and hold 26% of the world&#x27;s wealth, including 31% of the net profits of United States multinationals. A group of activists state that £13-20 trillion is held in offshore accounts yet the real figure could be much higher when taking into account Chinese, Russian and US deployment of capital internationally.
These often regurgitated figures have not stood up to scrutiny however, and nor has the black hole theory that capital is hoarded away from the financial and tax systems in OFCs. Much like a criminal using a wallet identified and seized as proceeds of crime, it would be counterintuitive for anyone to hold assets unused. Moreover, much of the capital flowing through vehicles in the OFCs is aggregated investment capital from pension funds, institutional and private investors which has to be deployed in industry around the World.

Trillions in deposits and securities are held in offshore banks, mostly by international business companies (IBCs) and trusts. Among offshore banks, Swiss banks hold an estimated 35% of the world&#x27;s private and institutional funds (or 3 trillion Swiss francs), and the Cayman Islands (over 2 trillion US dollars in deposits) are the fifth largest banking centre globally in terms of deposits. However, data by the Swiss National Bank show that the assets held by foreign persons in Swiss bank accounts declined by 28.1% between January 2008 and November 2009.

==Banking advantages==
*Offshore banks provide access to politically and economically stable jurisdictions. This will be an advantage for residents of areas where there is a risk of political turmoil, who fear their assets may be frozen, seized or disappear (see the &quot;corralito&quot; for example, during the 2001 1998–2002 Argentine great depression). However, it is also the case that onshore banks offer the same advantages in terms of stability.
*Some offshore banks may operate with a lower cost base and can provide higher interest rates than the legal rate in the home country due to the narrow range of services provided and technological advancements along similar lines to challenger banks such as Revolut and Starling. Advocates of offshore banking often characterize government regulation as a form of tax on domestic banks, reducing interest rates on deposits. However, this is scarcely true now; most offshore countries offer very similar interest rates to those that are offered onshore and the offshore banks now have considerable compliance requirements making certain categories of customers (those from the US or from higher risk profile countries) unattractive for different reasons.
*Offshore finance is one of the few industries, along with tourism, in which geographically remote island countries can competitively engage. It can help developing countries source investment and create growth in their economies, and can help redistribute world finance to and from the developed and developing worlds. Equally, well-resourced and developed OFC countries such as New Zealand and Singapore offer a safe and reasonably-well administered background for these similar financial services.
*Interest is generally paid by offshore banks without tax being deducted. This is an advantage to individuals who do not pay tax on worldwide income, or who do not pay tax until the tax return is agreed, or who feel that they can illegally evade tax by hiding the interest incomes. FATCA and CRS and other reporting mechanisms make the latter more difficult other than for the most blatant criminals.
*Some offshore banks offer banking services that may not be available from domestic banks such as anonymous bank accounts, higher or lower rate loans based on risk and investment opportunities not available elsewhere. The number of jurisdictions offering anonymous accounts (or bearer shares) has fallen considerably in the last 20 years.
*Offshore banking is often linked to other corporate structures, such as offshore companies, trusts or foundations, which may have specific uses and may still have tax advantages and bank security solutions incorporated in particular jurisdictions.

==Banking disadvantages==
*Offshore bank accounts are sometimes less financially secure than domestic ones in recent times. For example, in the banking crisis which swept the world in 2008, some savers lost funds that were not insured by the country in which they were deposited. Those who had deposited with the same banks onshore received all of their money back. In 2009, The Isle of Man authorities were keen to point out that 90% of the claimants were paid, although this only referred to the number of people who had received money from their depositor compensation scheme and not the amount of money refunded. In reality, only 40% of depositor funds had been repaid: 24.8% in September 2009 and 15.2% in December 2009. In reality. Switzerland, Luxembourg and other offshore jurisdictions now often have some form of compensation scheme.

Both offshore and onshore banking centres often have depositor compensation schemes. For example: The Isle of Man compensation scheme guarantees £50,000 of net deposits per individual depositor, or £20,000 for most other categories of depositor. Potential depositors should be aware that any deposits over the guaranteed amount are at risk. However, only offshore centres such as the Isle of Man have refused to compensate depositors 100% of their funds following bank collapses. Onshore depositors have been refunded in full, regardless of what the compensation limit of that country has stated. Thus, banking offshore is historically riskier than banking onshore.
*Offshore banking has been associated in the past with the underground economy and organized crime, thanks to movies such as the Firm through money laundering. Following September 11, 2001, offshore banks, onshore banks along with clearing houses, have been accused of helping various organized crime gangs, terrorist groups, and other state or non-state actors. However, offshore banking is a legitimate financial service used by many expatriate and international workers.
*Offshore jurisdictions can be remote, and therefore costly to visit, so physical access can be difficult. This problem has been alleviated to a considerable extent with the advent and realization of online banking as a practical system. 
*Offshore private banking is usually more accessible to those with higher incomes, because of the costs of establishing and maintaining offshore accounts. However, simple savings accounts can be opened by anyone and maintained with scale fees equivalent to their onshore counterparts. The tax burden in developed countries thus falls disproportionately on middle-income groups. Historically, tax cuts have tended to result in a higher proportion of the tax take being paid by high-income groups in doubles from time to time, as previously sheltered income is brought back into the mainstream economy. The Laffer curve demonstrates this tendency.
*The US Bank Secrecy Act requires U.S. Taxpayers to file a Department of the Treasury Form 90–22.1 Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (: Each person or entity (including a bank) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States having an interest in, signature, or other authority over one or more bank, securities, or other financial accounts in a foreign country must file an FBAR if the aggregate value of such accounts at any point in a calendar year exceeds $10,000. (31 CFR 103.24). A recent District Court case in the 10th Circuit may have significantly expanded the definition of &quot;interest in&quot; and &quot;other Authority&quot;. 
*Offshore bank accounts are sometimes touted as the solution to every legal, financial, and asset protection strategy, but the benefits are often exaggerated as in the more prominent jurisdictions, the level of Know Your Customer evidence required underplayed.

==Banking services==
It is possible to obtain the full spectrum of financial services from offshore banks, including:
*Savings accounts
*Corporate administration
*Credit
*Deposit taking
*Foreign exchange
*Fund management
*Investment management and investment custody
*Debit and Credit Cards
*Letters of credit and trade finance
*Trustee services
*Wire- and electronic funds transfers

Not every bank provides each service. Banks tend to polarise between retail services and private banking services. Retail services tend to be low-cost and undifferentiated, whereas private banking services tend to bring a personalised suite of services to the client.

===Scale of potential tax revenue===
Activists has stated that even just the lower estimate of £13 trillion on deposit in offshore accounts, if these assets earned an average 3% a year in income for their owners taxable at 30%, then the offshore funds would generate £121 billion in tax revenues, on the unrealistic assumption that no tax is paid (i.e. no one pays any tax on offshore holdings), and the equally curious narrative that 100% of those deposits would otherwise have been liable to tax. Projections are often predicated upon levying tax on the capital sums held in offshore accounts, whereas most national systems of taxation tax income and/or capital gains rather than accrued wealth.
Much of the capital held in offshore banks is taxed already at source and where the capital represents profits, is reportable by the beneficial owner and will be taxed according to that owner’s tax residence. Capital is always deployed in investments which also then generates further tax revenue on those activities that have been invested in onshore.

===Ownership===
According to Merrill Lynch and Capgemini&#x27;s “World Wealth Report” for 2000, one third of the wealth of the world&#x27;s “high-net-worth individuals” — nearly $6 trillion out of $17.5 trillion — may now be held offshore. A large portion, £6.3tn, of offshore assets, is owned by only a tiny sliver, 0.001% (around 92,000 super wealthy individuals) of the world&#x27;s population. In simple terms, this reflects the inconvenience associated with establishing these accounts, not that these accounts are only for the wealthy. Most all individuals can take advantage of these accounts.

==Money laundering==
The IMF has said that between $600 billion and $1.5 trillion of illicit money is laundered annually, equal to 2% to 5% of global economic output. Today, most of the world&#x27;s drug money is allegedly laundered through offshore and lesser regulated jurisdictions such as Paraguay and the UAE and even the US, estimated at up to $500 billion a year, more than the total income of the world&#x27;s poorest 20%. Add the proceeds of tax evasion and the figure increases significantly. Another few hundred billion may come from fraud and corruption. &quot;These offshore centers awash in money are the hub of a colossal, underground network of crime, fraud, and corruption&quot; commented Lucy Komisar quoting these statistics.
In cases such as the 1MDB scandal the HSBC scandal and a host of Ponzi schemes including Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities, it has been demonstrated that a mixture of onshore and offshore individuals conspiring together to either turn a blind eye or actively collaborate in order for large scale fraud and money laundering to succeed. Some have been jailed and fined, some banks have closed yet other key actors remain relatively unscathed. Large fraud cases invariably involved the major global retail banks and real estate in the major onshore or mid shore financial centres in order for the criminals to launder the proceeds of crime into safer jurisdictions and the global financial system as a whole.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; revealed that the United States government, specifically the US Treasury Department and the CIA, had a program to access the SWIFT transaction database after the September 11 attacks (see the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program) further diminishing the value of offshore banking for keeping Illicit activity secret.

==Regulation of international banks==
In the 21st century, regulation of offshore banking has increased exponentially but not evenly, although critics usually focus on the wrong areas. The quality of the regulation is monitored by supra-national bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Banks are generally required to maintain capital adequacy in accordance with international standards. They must report at least quarterly to the regulator on the current state of the business.

Since the late 1990s, especially following September 11, 2001, there have been a number of initiatives to increase the transparency of offshore banking, although critics such as the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens (ATTAC) non-governmental organization (NGO) maintain that they have been insufficient. A few examples of these are:
*The tightening of anti-money laundering regulations in many countries including most popular offshore banking locations means that bankers and other service providers are required by law to report suspicion of money laundering to the local police authority, regardless of banking secrecy rules. There is more international co-operation between police authorities.
*In the US the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) introduced Qualifying Intermediary requirements, which mean that the names of the recipients of US-source investment income are passed to the IRS.
*Following 9/11 the US introduced the USA PATRIOT Act, which authorizes the US authorities to seize the assets of a bank, where it is believed that the bank holds assets for a suspected criminal. Similar measures have been introduced in some other countries.
*The European Union has introduced sharing of information between certain jurisdictions, and enforced this in respect of certain controlled centers, such as the UK Offshore Islands, so that tax information is able to be shared in respect of interest.
*The Bank Secrecy Act requires that Taxpayers file an FBAR for accounts outside of the United States that have balances in excess of $10,000
*FATCA (the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) became law in 2010 and &quot;targets tax non-compliance by US taxpayers with foreign accounts [and] focuses on reporting by US taxpayers about certain foreign financial accounts and offshore assets [and] foreign financial institutions about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers or foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest.&quot;

Joseph Stiglitz, 2001 Nobel laureate for economics and former World Bank Chief Economist, told to reporter Lucy Komisar, investigating on the Clearstream scandal:

&quot;You ask why, if there&#x27;s an important role for a regulated banking system, do you allow a non-regulated banking system to continue? It&#x27;s in the interest of some of the moneyed interests to allow this to occur. It&#x27;s not an accident; it could have been shut down at any time. If you said the US, the UK, the major G7 banks will not deal with offshore bank centers that don&#x27;t comply with G7 banks regulations, these banks could not exist. They only exist because they engage in transactions with standard banks.&quot;

<text>Lucio Fulci (; 17 June 1927 – 13 March 1996) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and actor. Although he worked in a wide array of genres through a career spanning nearly five decades, including comedies and spaghetti Westerns, he garnered an international cult following for his &quot;giallo&quot; and horror films.

His most notable films include the &quot;Gates of Hell&quot; trilogy — &quot;City of the Living Dead&quot; (1980), &quot;The Beyond&quot; (1981), and &quot;The House by the Cemetery&quot; (1981)—as well as &quot;Massacre Time&quot; (1966), &quot;One on Top of the Other&quot; (1969), &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot; (1969), &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; (1971), &quot;Don&#x27;t Torture a Duckling&quot; (1972), &quot;White Fang&quot; (1973), &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; (1975), &quot;Sette note in nero&quot; (1977), &quot;Zombi 2&quot; (1979), &quot;Contraband&quot; (1980), &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; (1982), &quot;Murder Rock&quot; (1984), and &quot;A Cat in the Brain&quot; (1990). Although a number of films over the years were said to have been &quot;co-produced&quot; by Fulci, he was just allowing them to use his name to promote the films (with the exception of &quot;City of the Living Dead&quot;, which he did actively attempt to obtain some funding for).

Owing to his brand of expressive visuals and unconventional storytelling, Lucio Fulci has been called &quot;The Poet of the Macabre&quot; by genre critics and scholars, originally a reference to Edgar Allan Poe, whose work he freely adapted in &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1981). The high level of graphic violence in many of his films, especially &quot;Zombi 2&quot;, &quot;The Beyond&quot;, &quot;Contraband&quot; and &quot;The New York Ripper&quot;, has also earned him the nickname &quot;The Godfather of Gore&quot;, which he shares with Herschell Gordon Lewis.

==Life and career==

===The early years===
Lucio Fulci was born in Trastevere, Rome, on 17 June 1927. His mother Lucia was from a poor but reputable Sicilian, politically anti-fascist family from Messina, Sicily. She had earlier eloped to Rome with a cousin of hers, who she later left to raise their child (Lucio) alone. Lucio was raised Roman Catholic by his mother and a female housekeeper. He attended the Naval College in Venice, and near the end of World War II, completed his studies back in Rome at the Giulio Cesare State Classical School. He was interested in art, music, film, football, and had a love for sailing.

His mother encouraged him to be a lawyer, but he wound up going to medical school instead. After studying medicine for a time, he dropped out before completing his training, deciding there was more money to be made in the filmmaking industry He worked initially as an art critic, writing for Gazzetta delle Arti and Il Messaggero, and also joined the critical art group il Gruppo Arte Sociale. In the &quot;Fulci Talks&quot; interview filmed in Rome, Fulci mentions having in his youth met Truman Capote in Italy, who he said was reading books and spoke good Italian.

His interest in the arts led him to apply to the film school in Rome named Centro Sperimentale where he apprenticed, after which he worked first as a director of documentaries, then an assistant director of motion pictures, then a screenwriter working mainly in the Italian comedy field in the early 1950s. The famed Italian director Steno took Fulci under his wing and allowed him to assist in the making of a number of comedies starring Totò. He also directed a number of comedies starring the actors Franco and Ciccio.

===Fulci&#x27;s gialli and horror films===
Fulci moved into directing giallo thrillers with &quot;Una sull&#x27;altra&quot; (1969), &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sette note in nero&quot; (&quot;The Psychic&quot;, 1977), as well as Spaghetti Westerns such as &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; (1975) and &quot;Silver Saddle&quot; (1978), all of which were commercially successful and controversial in their depictions of graphic violence. Some of the special effects in &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; involving mutilated dogs in a vivisection room were so realistic that Fulci was charged with animal cruelty; the charges were dropped when he produced the artificial canine puppets that were utilized in the film (created by special effects maestro Carlo Rambaldi).

His first film to gain significant notoriety in his native country, &quot;Don&#x27;t Torture a Duckling&quot; (1972), combined scathing social commentary with the director&#x27;s trademark graphic violence. Fulci had a Catholic upbringing and always referred to himself as a Catholic. Despite this, some of his movies (&quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Torture a Duckling&quot;, &quot;City of the Living Dead&quot;, etc.) have been viewed as having very anti-Catholic sentiment.

In 1979, he achieved his international breakthrough with &quot;Zombi 2&quot;, a violent zombie film that was marketed in European territories as a sequel to George Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;/&quot;Zombi&quot; (1978) without permission from Fulci nor Romero.

Several of Fulci&#x27;s movies released in America were edited by the film distributor to ensure an R rating, such as &quot;The Beyond&quot;, which was originally released on video in severely edited form as &quot;Seven Doors of Death&quot;. Others were released unrated in order to avoid an X rating (as with &quot;Zombi 2&quot; and &quot;House by the Cemetery&quot;) which would have restricted the films&#x27; target audiences to adults. The unrated films often played worldwide in drive-ins and grindhouses where they developed a cult following. Many of Fulci&#x27;s horror films tend to contain &quot;injury to the eye&quot; sequences, in which a character&#x27;s eyeball is either pierced or pulled out of its socket, usually in lingering, close-up detail.

===Later career===
Fulci travelled to the Philippines and spent six weeks shooting the film &quot;Zombi 3&quot;. Two opposing views were given for Fulci leaving the film, the first being an illness that left him unable to film and the second being that he was having disputes with producers. After completing filming, he would later state &quot;(I) didn&#x27;t finish making &quot;Zombie 3&quot;, but the reason wasn&#x27;t anything to do with illness [...] there were arguments and so, I finished off an hour and a quarter of the film&quot;. Fulci stated that he could not get the script changed, which he deemed to be &quot;dreadful&quot;, and modified it with his daughter. Claudio Fragasso stated that Fulci simplified his screenplay and shot a seventy-minute film which shocked producer Franco Gaudenzi.

By the second half of the 1980s, the Italian film industry was struggling with less theatrical distribution of films and productions being made to sell to foreign markets for television and home video. In some films, such as Gianni Martucci&#x27;s &quot;The Red Monks&quot;, Fulci is credited as a &quot;special effects supervisor&quot; despite not showing up to set or preparing any special effects for the film. According to Martucci, Fulci &quot;agreed to &quot;present&quot; the movie&quot; as distributors required &quot;a &quot;heavy&quot; name for the sales abroad. By then Fulci had become a name, let&#x27;s say exportable. He was already very ill, and I met him to talk to him about the project&quot; While Fulci&#x27;s health did get better, Martucci stated that &quot;at that time he couldn&#x27;t even speak, devoured as he was by cirrhosis.&quot;

A series was developed titled &quot;I maestri del thriller&quot; was developed with the aim of television and home video markets, which was originally going to be a set of ten films but only eight were made. Fulci was invited by cinematographer Silvano Tessicini to the series as the director had just moved from Rome to Castelnuovo di Porto and was experiencing health problems after returning from the production of &quot;Zombi 3&quot;. Tessicini lived in the nearby Morlupo and on visiting him stated that Fulci &quot;was not well, and had a huge belly&quot;, a consequence of the liver disease that affected Fulci during the filming of &quot;Zombi 3&quot;. Fulci was initially hired on the film as a supervisor but submitted the idea to director his own film, &quot;Touch of Death&quot;. When one of the directors walked away from the series, Fulci was invited to begin filming &quot;Sodoma&#x27;s Ghost&quot;. It was filmed under the title &quot;Ghost Light&quot; and began shooting on 30 May 1988 with filming taking four weeks. Mario Bianchi was recruited by production supervisor Silvano Zignani to film some second unit scenes. According to Bianchi, &quot;Fulci didn&#x27;t leave the set he finished the film&quot; while also stating &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I shot half the film, but almost&quot; while Michele De Angelis stated that Bianchi was only on set for a couple of days. Three days after filming &quot;Sodoma&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, Fulci began work on &quot;Touch of Death&quot; which began filming on 22 June 1988. Another film in the series was &quot;Hansel e Gretel&quot;, which was originally set for Giovanni Simonelli to direct but after three weeks of filming only about 50 minutes of the film had been completed and large parts of the story were not filmed. Several weeks later Fulci was asked to supervise an additional week&#x27;s shooting. According to the assistant director of the film Michele de Angelis,&quot;Lucio shot everything. Simonelli stayed by his side, just watching...&quot; Along with Fulci, Andrea Bianchi was reportedly recruited to work on the film as well. Fulci was credited in another film in the series: as a supervisor in the film &quot;Bloody Psycho&quot; by Leandro Lucchetti. Fulci did not discuss the film with the director and did not show up at the set of the film. Fulci would later use the gory footage of the titles in the series used in his film &quot;A Cat in the Brain&quot;. Fulci added new scenes where he played himself, a horror director who visits a psychiatrist who he does not realize is a serial killer. The films in the &quot;I maestri del thriller&quot; series were later released on VHS and DVD as &quot;Lucio Fulci presenta&quot; by the Formula Home Video label.

Fulci would also develop films for television as part of the series &quot;Le case maledette&quot; set up by producer Luciano Martino. The films were shot outside Rome with a schedule of four weeks each, with &quot;The House of Clocks&quot; filmed between 31 January and 25 February 1989. Immediately after finishing work on the film, Fulci started work on &quot;The Sweet House of Horrors&quot; which finished filming in March. The series was not shown in Italy and was released on VHS in 2000 and later shown on Italian satellite TV in 2006.

===Fulci and Dario Argento===
In the last decade of his life, Fulci suffered from emotional and physical health problems, reflected by a marked decline in the quality of his work. Fulci also continued to suffer during the late 1980s from recurring problems with diabetes and his liver. He hid the severity of his illness from his friends and associates so that he would not be deemed unemployable. His wife&#x27;s suicide in 1969 had always weighed heavily on him (his wife Marina had killed herself with a gas oven after learning she had inoperable cancer but afterwards it turned out that she did not have cancer). People who knew Fulci well spoke of a third daughter he once had who he said was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, but this story was never confirmed, and the daughter&#x27;s name (if in fact she existed) was never revealed by any of his biographers. Fulci biographer Stephen Thrower wrote &quot;...the suicide of his wife in 1969 was followed not long after by the death of a daughter in a road accident.&quot; Dario Argento is quoted in one book as saying of Fulci &quot;His life was terrible. His wife committed suicide, and his daughter was paralyzed because of an accident.&quot; In a 2023 interview with actors Giovanni Lombardo Radice and Silvia Collatina at the Romford Horror event, the two confirm that one of Fulci&#x27;s daughters had an accident when she fell off a horse and was injured very badly and became paralyzed. This is also confirmed in the documentary &quot;Fulci for Fake&quot;.

Fulci and Argento met in 1994 at the Rome Fanta Festival and surprisingly agreed to collaborate on a horror film called &quot;Wax Mask&quot;, a loose remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic &quot;House of Wax&quot;. Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci&#x27;s miserable circumstances at the time and wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their 1994 meeting, and said he felt very sorry for him.

Fulci collaborated with writer Daniele Stroppa to create a screenplay for Argento, whose insistence on increasing the violence and gore quotient was, unusually, opposed by Fulci. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci&#x27;s earlier films, &quot;The House of Clocks&quot; and &quot;Voices from Beyond&quot;). Fulci was slated to also direct the film, but he died before filming could begin, due to a series of delays caused by Argento&#x27;s involvement with his own project, &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot;, at the time. &quot;Wax Mask&quot; was eventually directed by former special effects artist Sergio Stivaletti. The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci&#x27;s death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci&#x27;s original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci&#x27;s daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.

===Death and legacy===
Fulci died alone, in his sleep, in his apartment in Rome at around 2 pm on 13 March 1996 of a hyperglycemic diabetic coma, aged 68. Toward the end of his life, he had lost his house and was forced to move into a cramped apartment. Since Fulci had been so despondent in his later years, some believed that he may have intentionally allowed himself to die by not taking his glucose-controlling medication, but this is controversial. Dario Argento paid for Fulci&#x27;s funeral arrangements. He was initially buried in Cimitero Flaminio, though his remains were later moved to Cimitero Laurentino.

Fulci&#x27;s films had remained generally ignored or dismissed for many years by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as exploitation. However, genre fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, &quot;The Beyond&quot;, has &quot;amassed a large and dedicated following&quot;. In 1998, &quot;The Beyond&quot; was re-released to theaters by Quentin Tarantino, who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as a major source of inspiration. Fulci&#x27;s earlier, lesser-known giallo &quot;Don&#x27;t Torture a Duckling&quot; (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, &quot;Don&#x27;t Torture a Duckling&quot; and &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot;, as his best all-around work, and considered both &quot;Zombi 2&quot; and &quot;The Beyond&quot; as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989 to 1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.

Fulci made an appearance at the January 1996 Fangoria horror convention in New York City, two months before his death. Walking on crutches with a bandaged foot, he told attendees that he had had no idea his films were so popular outside of his native Italy, as hordes of starstruck gore fans braved blizzard conditions that weekend to meet him.

<doc id="370095" wikidata="Q334203" url="?curid=370095" title="Charles Manners-Sutton, 1st Viscount Canterbury">
<text>Charles Manners-Sutton, 1st Viscount Canterbury, (9 January 1780 – 21 July 1845) was a British Tory politician who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1817 to 1835.

==Background and education==
A member of the Manners family headed by the Duke of Rutland, Manners-Sutton was born at Screveton, Nottinghamshire, the son of the Most Reverend Charles Manners-Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury, fourth son of Lord George Manners-Sutton, third son of John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. His mother was Mary, daughter of Thomas Thoroton, of Screveton, Nottinghamshire, while Thomas Manners-Sutton, 1st Baron Manners, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was his uncle.

He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1798, graduated B.A. 1802, M.A. 1805, LL.D. 1824). He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1802, and called to the Bar in 1806.

==Political career==
In 1806 Manners-Sutton was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Scarborough, a seat he would hold until 1832, and then sat for Cambridge University from 1832 to 1835. He served as Judge Advocate General under Spencer Perceval and Lord Liverpool from 1809 to 1817 and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1809.

Manners-Sutton was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in the 1817 election, holding the post for the next eighteen years. Antonia Fraser described Manners-Sutton as &quot;a fine, friendly, genial figure, if inclined to pomposity (but that was a forgivable offence in a Speaker).&quot; Manners-Sutton, notably, was Speaker during the passing of the Reform Act 1832. Following the King&#x27;s prorogation of Parliament, Manners-Sutton led an angry group of MPs to the House of Lords to hear his proclamation. Manners-Sutton himself was said to be &quot;red-faced and quivering with rage&quot; at the news.

When Lord Grey resigned as Prime Minister in May 1832, this caused a period of political unrest known as the Days of May. The King asked the Duke of Wellington to form a government to replace Grey&#x27;s, but he was reluctant to do so. Nevertheless, according to Fraser, &quot;There was the possibility that... Charles Manners-Sutton might prove an acceptable anodyne leader because, by the nature of his office, he was not tarred by the brush of his own anti-Reform declarations.&quot; Manners-Sutton spent three hours outlining his views on the matter at &quot;exhaustive and exhausting length&quot; during a crucial meeting of the Tories at Apsley House. Following the meeting, Lyndhurst flung back his chair and exclaimed that he refused to listen any longer to such &quot;a damned tiresome old bitch.&quot; Manners-Sutton was only the third candidate in contention to lead a Tory administration, behind Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. In the end, &quot;he was understood to have declined&quot; the opportunity to head the proposed Tory administration.

After the passing of the Reform Act, Manners-Sutton was persuaded to postpone his retirement as Speaker by the government. Objecting to him as an opponent of the reform, the Radicals opposed his re-election in the 1833 election, nominating Edward Littleton, whom Manners-Sutton defeated by 210 votes. In the 1835 election the Whigs opposed Manners-Sutton, nominating James Abercromby, who defeated Manners-Sutton by 10 votes.

In 1835 Manners-Sutton was appointed High Commissioner for Canada, but did not take up the post. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1833 and in 1835 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Bottesford, of Bottesford in the County of Leicester, and Viscount Canterbury, of the City of Canterbury.

==Family==
Lord Canterbury was twice married.

He married as his first wife Lucy Maria Charlotte, daughter of John Denison, on 8 July 1811. They had two sons and a daughter:
* Charles John Manners-Sutton, 2nd Viscount Canterbury (1812–1869)
* John Henry Thomas Manners-Sutton, 3rd Viscount Canterbury (1814–1877)
* Charlotte Matilda Manners-Sutton (1815–1898)

After his first-wife&#x27;s early death at Ossington, Nottinghamshire, in December 1815, he married as his second wife Ellen, daughter of Edmund Power and widow of John Home Purves, on 6 December 1828. They had one daughter:
* Frances Diana Manners-Sutton (1829–1874)

Lord Canterbury died at Southwick Crescent, Paddington, London, in July 1845, aged 65, from apoplexy, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles. His second wife only survived him by a few months and died at Clifton, Gloucestershire, in November 1845.

<text>James Abercromby, 1st Baron Dunfermline FRSE (7 November 177617 April 1858), was a British barrister and Whig politician. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1835 and 1839, the first Scottish MP to hold that position.

==Background and education==
Abercromby was the third son of General Sir Ralph Abercromby, who fell at the Battle of Alexandria, and Mary, 1st Baroness Abercromby, daughter of John Menzies of Fernton, Perthshire. He was the younger brother of George Abercromby, 2nd Baron Abercromby and Sir John Abercromby and the elder brother of Alexander Abercromby. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and was called to the English Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1801. He became a commissioner of bankruptcy and later appointed steward of the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s estates.

==Legal and political career==
Abercromby sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Midhurst between 1807 and 1812 and for Calne between 1812 and 1830. He brought forwards two motions for bills to change the representation for Edinburgh in parliament. He received great support but no change was made until the Reform Act 1832. In 1827 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Judge-Advocate-General by George Canning, a post he held until 1828, the last months under the premiership of Lord Goderich.

In 1830 Abercromby was made Lord Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, a position he retained until 1832, when the office was abolished. He received a pension of £2,000 a year.

In 1831 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being John Hope, Lord Hope.

In 1832 returned to the House of Commons as one of two members for Edinburgh, whose representation had now been increased from one to two members. In July 1834 he entered Lord Melbourne&#x27;s cabinet as Master of the Mint, but only held the post until November of the same year, when the Whigs lost power.

Abercromby was considered for the speakership of the House of Commons by his party for the 1833 election, but Edward Littleton was eventually chosen instead (he was defeated by Charles Manners-Sutton). However, in the 1835 election he was chosen as the Whig candidate. Due to an evenly balanced House of Commons the election rendered great interest and was fiercely contested. On 19 February 1835 Abercromby was elected, defeating Manners-Sutton by 316 votes to 306. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; writes that &quot;As speaker Abercromby acted with great impartiality while he possessed sufficient decision to quell any serious tendency to disorder.&quot; During his tenure a number of reforms for the introduction of private bills were made. In spite of failing health Abercromby continued as speaker until 1839. On his retirement he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dunfermline, of Dunfermline in the County of Fife.

After his retirement Abercromby continued to take an interest in public affairs, specifically those involving the city of Edinburgh. He was one of the originators of the United Industrial School for the support and training of destitute children. In 1841 he was elected as Dean of Faculty at the University of Glasgow. He also wrote a biography of his father, published posthumously in 1861.

He died at Colinton House, just south-west of Edinburgh on 17 April 1858.

==Family==

Lord Dunfermline married Mary Anne, daughter of Egerton Leigh, of West Hall, in High Legh, on 14 June 1802. He bought property and land in Colinton, Midlothian in 1840.

He died at Colinton House, on the south-west edge of Edinburgh in April 1858, aged 81, and 
was buried at Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Sir Ralph Abercromby, KCB, who was Secretary of Legation at Berlin and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Sardinia between 1840 and 1851 and to The Hague between 1851 and 1858. Lady Dunfermline died in August 1874.

He was the nephew of Robert Bruce, Lord Kennet.

A portrait of James Abercromby as a child by David Allan (1779) is held by the University of Dundee Museum Services

<text>Willesden Junction () is an interchange station located in Harlesden, north-west London. It is situated on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness and Mildmay lines of the London Overground. The station is located close to the Old Oak Lane conservation area in the East Acton ward. 

==History==
The station developed on three contiguous sites: the West Coast Main Line (WCML) station was opened by the London &amp; North Western Railway on 1 September 1866 to replace the London and Birmingham Railway&#x27;s Willesden station of 1841 which was to the northwest. Passenger services ended in 1962 when the platforms were removed during the electrification of the WCML to allow the curvature of the tracks to be eased. Later the bridges for the North London line (NLL) were rebuilt.

The High-Level station on the NLL was opened by the North London Railway in 1869 for two Richmond tracks and later for two Shepherds Bush tracks, both crossing the WCML roughly at right angles. In 1894 a new, combined High-Level station was built, with an island platform plus a third shorter platform for Earls Court trains (which was later removed) together with a new station entrance building which still survives. By 1897 199 passenger trains and 47 goods trains passed through the High-Level station each day. The &#x27;Willesden New Station&#x27; or Low-Level station on the Watford DC line was opened in 1910 to the north of the main line with two outer through platforms and two inner bay platforms at the London end. The bay platforms were originally long enough for four-coach Bakerloo trains when such trains ran outside peak times, but were shortened in the 1960s when a new toilet block was installed; in more recent times the platform buildings have been reconstructed and the bay length increased due to the addition of a fourth and then a fifth coach to class 378 trains.

In 1896 staff totalled 271, including 79 porters, 58 signalmen (in 14 signal boxes) and 58 shunters and yard foremen. They issued 1,006,886 tickets to passengers in 1896, up from 530,300 in 1886. Many of them were housed in what is now the Old Oak Lane conservation area, built by the LNWR in 1889 and which included an Institute, reading room and church.

The main-line platforms were numbered from the south side (including one or two on the Kensington route) followed by the high level platforms and then the DC line platforms which thus had the highest numbers. Later the surviving platforms were renumbered.

A freight liner terminal was opened in August 1967. It was built on an 18-acre site of the steam locomotive depot alongside the main electrified rail-link. It was opened by John Morris, Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Transport. The terminal had the capacity to handle 2,000 containers a week.

In the late nineteenth century, it was nicknamed &quot;Bewildering Junction&quot; or &quot;The Wilderness&quot; because it contained such a maze of entrances, passages and platforms.

==Major accidents==
On 5 December 1910, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision with another at the station. Five people were killed and more than 40 were injured. The accident was due to a signaling error. In June 1936, one first-class passenger was killed and four other passengers were injured on the main line track just north of the station. An LMS passenger train heading to Watford was struck by a piece of equipment sticking out of the milk train heading to Euston. On 6 October 1986 at 17:00 a class 313 train collided with the rear of a stationary Bakerloo line train on the up line to the east of the station between the Scrubbs Lane overbridge and Kensal Green tunnel (the location was officially described as &quot;Kensal Green&quot;). 23 of 25 passengers were injured, all but one were discharged from hospital during the same evening.

==The station today==
There are no platforms on the West Coast Main Line, which is separated from the low-level station by the approach road to Willesden Depot which lies immediately south-east of the station.

The high-level (HL) station consists of an island platform rebuilt in 1956, with faces as platforms 4 and 5, which are roughly at the level of Old Oak Lane to the west of the station, serving the NLL and the West London line (WLL); some trains on the latter reverse in a central turnback siding on the NLL to the east of the station, this opened in 2011. Both platforms have been extended across the DC line to accommodate 4-coach class 378 trains. The HL station previously had a third platform on the eastern side which was used by services to/from Earls Court.
There is another turnback siding further east which was previously used; it was laid in the late 1990s to allow Royal Mail trains to reach the Royal Mail depot at Stonebridge Park.

The low-level station, at the level of the area to the south, is an Edwardian island platform, with outer faces as platforms 1 and 3 and northern bay platform bay as platform 2, the southern bay now has no track. In October 2014 the DC line was closed temporarily between Wembley Central and Queens Park reportedly by Network Rail (London Overground) to allow platform 2 to be extended further west as a through platform. Most of the original and later platform buildings were demolished when platform 2 was extended in preparation for longer trains and provision of a new footbridge and lift in 1999.

Platforms 1 and 3 are used by the Bakerloo line services, which began on 10 May 1915, and London Overground services between and . Until May 2008 north-bound Bakerloo line trains which were to reverse at depot (two stations further north) ran empty from Willesden Junction although the southbound service began at Stonebridge Park. This imbalance arose as there were no London Underground staff beyond Willesden Junction to oversee passenger detrainment, but this changed after London Underground took over the staffing of stations on the line, including Stonebridge Park, from Silverlink in November 2007, and trains bound for Stonebridge Park depot now terminate at Stonebridge Park station. Normally only the first and last NLL trains of the day, which start or terminate here, use the bay platform, though it is used for empty stock transfers between the depot and the North London and Gospel Oak to Barking lines.

The station signs on the platforms say, below the Overground roundel, &quot;Alight for Harlesden town centre&quot;.

===Motive power depot===

The LNWR opened a large locomotive depot on a site on the south side of the main line to the west of the station, in 1873. This was enlarged in 1898. The London Midland and Scottish Railway opened an additional roundhouse on the site in 1929. Both buildings were demolished when the depot was closed in 1965 by British Railways and replaced by a Freightliner depot. (The servicing of locomotives and multiple units was then undertaken by the present Willesden TMD on the other side of the line.)

The steam depot had the shed code 1A and was a major depot for predominantly freight locomotives used on the West Coast Main Line and for suburban passenger services from Euston.

<text>The Unionist Party was the main centre-right political party in Scotland between 1912 and 1965.

Independent of, although associated with, the Conservative Party in England and Wales, it stood for election at different periods of its history in alliance with a few Liberal Unionist and National Liberal candidates. Those who became members of parliament (MPs) would take the Conservative Whip at Westminster as the Ulster Unionists did until 1972. At Westminster, the differences between the Scottish Unionist and the English party could appear blurred or non-existent to the external casual observer, especially as many Scottish MPs were prominent in the parliamentary Conservative Party. Examples include party leaders Bonar Law (1911–1921 and 1922–1923) and Sir Alec Douglas-Home (1963–1965), both of whom served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The party traditionally did not stand at the local government level but it instead supported and assisted the Progressive Party in its campaigns against the Labour Party. This relationship ended when the Conservatives started fielding their own candidates, who stood against both Labour and the Progressives.

==Origins==
The origins of the Scottish Unionist Party lie in the 1886 split of the Liberal Party and the emergence of the Liberal Unionists under Joseph Chamberlain. The union in question was the 1800 Irish Union, not the Scottish Union of 1707. Before this, the Tory party in Scotland had never achieved parity with the dominant Whig and Scottish Liberal ascendancy since the election reforms of 1832. The Liberal Unionists quickly agreed to an electoral pact with the Tories, and in Scotland this overcame the former electoral dominance of the Scottish Liberals.

After the 1912 merger of Liberal Unionists and Conservatives as the Conservative and Unionist Party, the Scottish Unionist Party effectively acted as the Conservative Party in Scotland, although some candidates still stood on a Liberal Unionist ticket because of the latent appeal of the word &quot;Liberal&quot; in Scotland.

==Ethos and appeal==

Popular imperial unity was the central thread of the Scottish Unionist Party&#x27;s belief system. While the Scottish Unionist party was linked on a Parliamentary level with the Conservative Party in England and Wales, it was conscious that it had to appeal to the liberal tradition in Scotland, and so until 1965; it studiously avoided using the term &quot;Conservative&quot;. For example, it used Conservative Party literature but changed the word &#x27;Conservative&#x27; to &#x27;Unionist&#x27;.

The party built up significant working-class support by emphasising the connection between the Union, the Empire, and the fate of local industry. Unity across the classes was often cited as one of the party&#x27;s planks of unionism. Along with this protectionism, protestantism also played an important part in the party&#x27;s working-class appeal. Although not explicitly articulated by the party, lest it alienate what small but wealthy middle and upper-class Catholic support it had, this appeal was projected through the endorsement and promotion of well-known Church of Scotland members like John Buchan, or prominent Orangemen in areas of west and central Scotland where the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland had strong support. Prominent Orangemen included Sir John Gilmour, the intermittent Secretary for Scotland in the 1920s and Home Secretary in the 1930s. Some saw this as an anti-Catholic appointment; however, it was Gilmour who, as the Secretary for Scotland, repudiated the Church of Scotland&#x27;s highly controversial report entitled &quot;The Menace of the Irish Race to our Scottish Nationality&quot;.

Being an independent Scottish party also drew electoral appeal when set against the threat of a London-based centralising Labour Party. A crucial aspect of this, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, was the ability to place an &quot;alien&quot; identity upon Labour by successfully using the term &quot;Socialist&quot; to describe the Labour Party. This distinctively Scottish appeal was further strengthened when combined with opposition to the Labour Party&#x27;s post-war nationalisation programme, which centralised control (in London) of former Scottish-owned businesses and council-run services. The strong Scottish character of the party was even evident in relations with Conservative government ministers, when, for example, Lord Glendevon admitted he would be at odds with Scotland&#x27;s Unionist Party for refusing the post of Secretary of State for Scotland because he preferred to remain at Westminster.

The party&#x27;s campaigns reflected their desire to reconcile the themes of individualism and collectivism in their appeal to potential Labour voters. This projected an image of flexibility and pragmatism when they expressed their support for the synthesis of &quot;two fundamental ideas of human individuality and of service to others and to the community.&quot;

==Electoral record and the 1955 general election==
With the Liberal Party divided and declining, the Scottish Unionist Party managed to attract former Liberal voters during this period – sometimes with candidates standing on a Liberal Unionist ticket. The creation of the National Liberals also helped increase the Unionist vote.

Within this context, their support grew, and the emergence of the Labour Party as a threat to the middle-classes resulted in the Scottish Unionists gaining a majority of Scottish seats at the 1924 general election, with 37 out of Scotland&#x27;s 73 seats. Suffering a setback in 1929, they reasserted themselves at the 1931 general election during an electoral backlash against the Labour Party that resulted in the creation of the National Government. The Scottish Unionist Party won 79% of the Scottish seats that year, 58 out of 73. In 1935 they returned a reduced majority of 45 MPs.

This remained the case until Labour&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1945 general election. The Unionists won only 30 of the (now) 71 Scottish seats. At the 1950 general election, a majority of Labour MPs was returned again, but the Scottish Unionist Party closed the gap by returning 32 MPs. At the subsequent Conservative election victory of 1951, an equal number of Labour and Unionist MPs were returned from Scotland, 35, with Jo Grimond of the Liberal Party retaining the Orkney and Shetland seat.

With Church of Scotland membership peaking at 1,300,000 in 1955 – or over one-quarter of Scotland&#x27;s population – the 1955 general election brought unparalleled success as the party gained 50.1% of the vote and 36 of the 71 seats at Westminster. Often cited as the only party to achieve a majority of the Scottish vote, six of the Conservative and Unionist MPs were returned that year under the label of Liberal Unionist or National Liberal. This apparent success was the prelude to a number of events that weakened the appeal of both the Scottish Unionist Party and the Scottish Conservatives that followed.

==Merger with the Conservative Party==
Following electoral defeat when the Party lost six seats in Scotland at the 1964 United Kingdom general election, reforms in April 1965 brought an end to the Scottish Unionist Party as an independent force. It was renamed &quot;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party&quot; that constitutionally then came under the control of the mainstream UK party. These, and further reforms in 1977, saw the Scottish Conservatives transformed into a regional unit, with its personnel, finances, and political offices under the control of the party leadership in London.

==Consequences of merger==
As the British Empire came to an end, so too did the primacy of Protestant associations, as secularism and ecumenism rose. The decline of strictly Protestant associations, and the loss of its Protestant working-class base, spelled the erosion of the Unionist vote. Though many Conservatives would still identify with the Kirk, most members of the established Church of Scotland did not identify themselves as Conservatives.

With the &quot;Daily Record&quot; newspaper switching from endorsing the Unionists to the Labour Party, the Conservative Party in the 1960s was mercilessly portrayed as a party of the Anglicised aristocracy. Combined with the new name, this helped turn previous Unionist voters to the Labour Party and the SNP, which advanced considerably at the two general elections of February and October 1974.

The relations between the Scottish Conservatives with the largely working-class Orange Order also became problematic because of the perceived aristocratic connection of the former, but it was The Troubles in Northern Ireland that created more concrete problems. On one level, there was the residual perception of a connection that many mainstream Protestant voters associated with the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland – a perception that is unfair to a large extent since the Scottish Orange Order has dealt more stringently with members associating with Loyalist paramilitaries than its Northern Irish equivalent. However, the ramifications of this perception also led to the Scottish Conservative Party downplaying and ignoring past associations, which further widened the gap with the Orange Order. Any links that lingered were ultimately broken when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement. This event witnessed Orange Lodges (amongst other supporters) setting up their own Scottish Unionist Party.

<doc id="370112" wikidata="Q83005" url="?curid=370112" title="Gates to Paradise">
<text>Gates to Paradise (also known as Vrata Raja) is a 1968 film by Polish director Andrzej Wajda and starring Lionel Stander, Ferdy Mayne and Mathieu Carrière. The film is set in medieval France and is based on the 1960 novel by Polish writer Jerzy Andrzejewski that seeks to expose the motives behind youthful religious zeal. It was entered into the 18th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Plot==
In 1212, a Children&#x27;s Crusade is launched after Jakob claims to have had a vision in which it is said that the innocence of children would be able to liberate Jerusalem. A monk, returning from Jerusalem, joins the crusade and hears the children&#x27;s confessions, gradually realizing that most of them are taking part not for religious, but for more worldly reasons, like rejected love.

Both Alexander and Bianca are in love with Jakob. Alexander, who has learned that his adoptive father (and his lover), Count Ludwig, also a crusader, had killed Alexander&#x27;s Greek parents, is gleeful that Jakob is in love with the count, whom he had met after the count and Alexander had split after an argument. This allows Alexander to take revenge for the count&#x27;s infidelity by telling his beloved Jakob about the count&#x27;s recent demise by drowning in a river, watched by an unmoved Alexander.

Finally, it is revealed in Jakob&#x27;s confession that Jakob received the inspiration for the crusade not from God but from the Count, which means that the crusade must fail because it is not by the will of God. However, the monk is unable to stop the children&#x27;s progression and is left behind.

<text>Edgware Road () is a London Underground station on the Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, located on the corner of Chapel Street and Cabbell Street, within Travelcard zone 1. A separate station of the same name but is served by the Bakerloo line is located about 150 metres away on the opposite side of Marylebone Road.

There have been proposals in the past to rename one of the Edgware Road stations to avoid confusion. Neither of them should be confused with Edgware station, the northern terminus of the Edgware branch of the Northern line.

==History==

This station was part of the world&#x27;s first underground railway when it was opened as part of the Metropolitan Railway between and on 10 January 1863.

The station was rebuilt 1926-8 for the introduction of District services with a new street level building by Charles Walter Clark replacing the original 1863 building designed by Sir John Fowler.

It was the site of one of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Mohammad Sidique Khan detonated a bomb at about 8:50am, on board a westbound Circle line train as it was leaving the station, killing six passengers.

==Station layout==
The station lies in a cutting open to the elements, not in a tunnel. The station serves the cut-and-cover routes of the Hammersmith &amp; City, Circle and District lines, forming the northern terminus for the District line&#x27;s service to . All District line trains terminate at Wimbledon; passengers must change at for , , and .

To the east of the station, the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines share the same tracks towards . To the west all four lines run to , but the routes to and the Circle and District line trains via diverge at Praed Street Junction to separate stations within the Paddington complex.

Since December 2009, Circle line trains call at the station twice on each journey: initially as a through service from Hammersmith towards , then as the terminus for that same service completing the loop via (or the same journey in reverse). There are no longer through trains here between the northern part of the Circle line and its western part.

The usual service pattern is: platform 1 for outer rail services to Kings Cross, Liverpool Street and beyond, platform 2 for District line trains to Earl&#x27;s Court and Wimbledon, platform 3 for Circle line to High Street Kensington and Victoria, and platform 4 (inner rail) for Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market and Hammersmith. This may vary in times of disruption – trains can go east from platforms 1, 2 and 3 and to any of the westbound destinations from platforms 2, 3 or 4.

Prior to 13 December 2009, the Circle line trains travelled in both directions around a simple loop with 27 stations and 12.89 miles (20.75 km) of track. In December 2009 the Circle line was extended to include the Hammersmith &amp; City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasional trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. Service operation was changed to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.

The service pattern all day is:
*6tph via High Street Kensington (Anti-clockwise)
*6tph via Kings Cross St Pancras (Clockwise)
*6tph to Hammersmith (Anti-clockwise)

===District line===
Edgware Road is the terminus for all District line services via High Street Kensington. Trains usually terminate at platform 2 which can also be used as a through platform although this feature is rarely used.

The service pattern all day is:
*6tph Wimbledon (Westbound)

===Hammersmith &amp; City line===

The service pattern all day is:
*6tph to Barking (Eastbound)
*6tph to Hammersmith (Westbound)
== Artwork ==
As part of the introduction of the S7 and S8 Stock trains to the District, Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines in the early 2010s, power upgrades required the construction of a large electrical substation adjacent to the station. Art on the Underground commissioned artist Jacqueline Poncelet to produce designs for the of vitreous enamel cladding that would become the outer shell of the substation. The artwork - &quot;Wrapper -&quot; was unveiled in November 2012, a mosaic of 700 decorated panels of various patterns inspired by local history.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses day and night routes.

<doc id="370123" wikidata="Q205777" url="?curid=370123" title="Charles Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley">
<text>Charles Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley, GCB, PC (22 February 1794 – 28 December 1888), was a British Whig politician. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1839 to 1857. He is the second-longest serving Speaker of the House of Commons, behind Arthur Onslow.

==Background and education==
Shaw-Lefevre was the son of Charles Shaw-Lefevre by his wife Helena, daughter of John Lefevre. His younger brother, Sir John Shaw-Lefevre, was a senior civil servant and one of the founders of the University of London, while his nephew, George, was a Liberal politician. He was educated at Winchester and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1819 he was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

==Political career==

A Whig, he was Member of Parliament for Downton from 1830 to 1831, for Hampshire from 1831 to 1832 and for North Hampshire from 1832 to 1857. During the 1830s he was chairman of a committee on petitions for private bills and of a committee on agricultural distress. His report from the latter position was not accepted by the House of Commons but was published as a pamphlet addressed to his constituents. He acquired, says the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;a high reputation in the House of Commons for his judicial fairness, combined with singular tact and courtesy.&quot; When James Abercromby retired as Speaker of the House of Commons in 1839, Shaw-Lefevre was put forward as the Whig candidate and defeated the Tory candidate Henry Goulburn by 317 votes to 299. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time.

Shaw-Lefevre remained speaker until 1857, by which time he was second-longest-serving speaker ever, after Arthur Onslow, who held the post for more than 33 years. On his retirement in 1857 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Eversley, of Heckfield in the County of Southampton. He attended the House of Lords infrequently, with his last recorded speech in July 1873.

==Other work==
Shaw-Lefevre was director of the insurance company Sun Fire Office from 1815 to 1841, Recorder of Basingstoke 1823–35, and Chairman of Hampshire Quarter Sessions 1850–79. He also served in his father&#x27;s North Hampshire Yeomanry Cavalry as a lieutenant in 1821, and was Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant in 1823–27 and 1831–68, when he became its Honorary Lt-Col.

In 1857 he was appointed Governor of the Isle of Wight, which he remained until 1888. He was also an ecclesiastical commissioner and a trustee of the British Museum. In 1885 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

==Family==
Lord Eversley married Emma Laura (d. 1857), daughter of Samuel Whitbread and Lady Elizabeth Grey, in 1817. They had three sons, who all died in infancy, and two daughters. The family lived at Heckfield Place in Hampshire, which was previously the seat of his maternal grandfather. Lady Eversley died in June 1857. Lord Eversley survived her by over thirty years and died in December 1888, aged 94. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. As he had no surviving sons, the title became extinct on his death. The Eversley title was revived in 1906 in favour of his nephew, George Shaw-Lefevre.

<doc id="370132" wikidata="Q331773" url="?curid=370132" title="Milan Milutinović">
<text>Milan Milutinović (, ; 19 December 1942 – 2 July 2023) was a Serbian politician who served as the president of Serbia from 1997 to 2002.

Milutinović served as Secretary for Education and Science of Serbia (1977–1982), Director of the National Library of Serbia (1983–1987), Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Greece (1989–1995), Yugoslavia&#x27;s Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs (1995–1997). After his presidential term expired in December 2002, he surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia where he was tried for war crimes. He was found not guilty on all charges on 26 February 2009.

==Education and youth==
Milan Milutinović came from an old Belgrade family. He was born in Belgrade to Aleksandar, a civil engineer, and Ljubica (née Jokić), an art historian. He attended school in Belgrade and graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and obtained an LL.M in 1965.

==Early political career==
From 1969 to 1971, he was a Member of the Presidency of the Yugoslav Socialist Youth Union, and, from 1974 to 1977 Secretary for Ideology of the City Committee of the League of Communists of Belgrade. Milutinović was a Member of the Federal Parliament of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1969 to 1974, during which time he served, inter alia, on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

==Secretary for Education and Director of the National Library==
From 1977 to 1982, Milutinović was the Secretary for Education, Science and Sport of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. During his term, he worked on a comprehensive reform of the education system. His comparative research on higher education systems in Europe was published in his book, &quot;University-Eppur si Muove: University Reform-between Tradition and the Future&quot; (Belgrade, 1985). Following his term as Secretary for Education, Milan Milutinović was elected Director of the National Library of Serbia.

==Foreign Ministry==
In 1987, during the term of Federal Secretary Raif Dizdarević, Milan Milutinović joined the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs of the SFRY, as Ambassador and Head of Sector for Press, Information and Culture. In September 1989, Milutinović was appointed Ambassador of the SFRY to Greece.

During much of his term as Ambassador to Greece (between 1992 and 1995), Milutinović was Yugoslavia&#x27;s only Ambassador to a Western state, as, due to the UN embargo imposed in May 1992, new ambassadors could not be appointed, while Milutinović was never withdrawn by Belgrade. In August 1995, Milutinović was appointed Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In November 1995, he was one of the leading negotiators during the Bosnia peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio and one of the draftsmen of what subsequently became the Dayton Peace Accords, which led to the permanent cessation of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. During his term as Foreign Minister, he also signed several agreements between Yugoslavia and its neighbour Croatia aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries.

==Presidential Election 1997==
After Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s second, the last constitutionally allowable, mandate as the President of Serbia, he was controversially elected the president of Yugoslavia. Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia still wanted to retain the Serbian presidency, and their first candidate in the Serbian presidential elections in 1997 was Zoran Lilić. The first two rounds of elections failed as the necessary majority (under the 1990 Constitution) of population failed to vote.

A coalition of Socialist Party of Serbia, Yugoslav Left and New Democracy decided to change their candidate for the repeated elections, as the leader of the nationalist Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Šešelj won the plurality against Lilić. Many of the opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, boycotted the 1997 elections as they expected results manipulation.

Milutinović, a member of Socialist Party of Serbia, was the party&#x27;s choice after Lilić&#x27;s failure. In the second round of elections, held in December 1997, he won 2,177,462 votes or 59.18% by official count, while 50.96% voters turned out. Vojislav Šešelj, who got 1,383,781 votes or 37.61%, boycotted Milutinović&#x27;s inauguration ceremony.

==Presidency==

As Milošević became the President of the Yugoslav Federation, political power shifted to the federal level along with him, and Milutinović de facto enjoyed little political influence. However, Milutinović was part of the Yugoslavian government&#x27;s negotiation group in the Rambouillet Agreement in 1999, a prelude to the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia.

After Milošević and his party were ousted in October 2000 and their political power marginalized on federal, republic and most local levels, Milutinović still remained in office, as his term did not end until 2002. His powers as the president were trivialized from 2000 to 2002, since his political affiliation did not enjoy popular support and he could not be backed up by any other government branch. Milutinović was out of the eye of public performing only the most basic constitutional obligations without any opposition to the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. In 2002, when his mandate expired, the presidential elections were held in which Milutinović did not run. He was succeeded by an acting president Nataša Mićić.

During the transition to democracy in late 2000, Milutinović refused to support a violent suppression of the October Demonstrations in Belgrade. The smooth relations between him and the new government, while in office, incurred the dislike of Milošević&#x27;s closest allies, although there had never been an official rupture. At the same time, Milutinović did not enjoy the support of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, as he in turn was considered, by most of its members, as a close ally of Milošević.

==ICTY indictment==

Upon the expiry of his term in office, Milutinović turned himself into International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2003. He was tried under joint war crimes indictment along with five other Serb officials including Nikola Šainović and Dragoljub Ojdanić.

Milutinović was prosecuted on four counts: deportation, murder as a crime against humanity, murder as violation of laws or customs of war, and &quot;other inhumane acts&quot; during the War in Kosovo. The allegations include responsibility for mass murders at various locations during 1999.

According to the indictment, Milutinović had personal responsibility as the President of Serbia, with power over various governmental institutions. He was a member of the Yugoslavian Supreme Defense Council, thus making decisions in regard to the Yugoslavian Army. He also had a power to dissolve the Serbian Parliament. According to the indictment, during wartime his de jure powers were extended to ones belonging to the Parliament during peacetime, including control of the police, subordinate to the Army at the time. This claim was hotly contested by Milutinović&#x27;s defense counsel and some constitutional lawyers, as the 1990 Constitution was written in view of Serbia possibly becoming a sovereign, unitary state, due to the impending collapse of Tito&#x27;s Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which finally occurred in mid-1991).

In reality, Serbia was not sovereign, as it still formed part of Milošević&#x27;s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose President (Milošević) held the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In addition, according to the defense, the Supreme Defense Council was not exercising operational control over Yugoslav troops, neither de jure nor de facto.

The ICTY Prosecution also claimed that Milutinović, as the President of Serbia, had de facto influence over the Parliament, the Army and the police (Ministry of Internal Affairs).

On 26 February 2009, Milutinović was acquitted on charges of war crimes. Finding Milutinović not guilty on all counts of the indictment, the court ruled that Milutinović had &quot;no direct control over the Yugoslav army&quot;. Judge Iain Bonomy blamed Slobodan Milošević for the alleged crimes, and said that Milutinović was &quot;not a key player in the ruling political party.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Milan Milutinović was married to Olga Milutinović (née Spasojević) from 6 December 1970 until her death, on 20 January 2017. They have one son, Veljko (born 1979). After his acquittal before the ICTY in 2009, Milutinović returned to live in Belgrade.

Milutinović died on 2 July 2023, at the age of 80.

She played the lead role in &quot;The First Grader&quot;, directed by Justin Chadwick, which was premiered on 18 May 2011 in the Seattle International Film Festival.

Harris co-starred in the 23rd &quot;James Bond&quot; film, &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), playing Miss Moneypenny. She is the first black actress to play Moneypenny, and is the first Moneypenny to be given a first name. Harris reprised her role as Moneypenny in the 24th &quot;Bond&quot; film, &quot;Spectre&quot;, which was released on 26 October 2015.

Harris portrayed Winnie Mandela in the biopic &quot;&quot;, based on the book of the same name, opposite the actor Idris Elba. The film was released on 29 November 2013. On viewing the film, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela told Harris that it seemed as if she were not acting, but channeling her, and that it was &quot;the first time she felt truly captured on film&quot;.

In 2016, Harris starred as Paula in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Moonlight&quot;. She played the abusive, drug-addicted mother of the film&#x27;s main character, Chiron. The film follows her son and her through a 20-year period. &quot;Moonlight&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Harris was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture, among other awards.

== Personal life ==
At about 11, Harris was diagnosed with scoliosis. The condition progressed severely into her teen years which necessitated a spinal fusion; it took her a month to recover fully and she had to learn how to walk again. As a teenager, Harris also suffered from adenomyosis.

In 2012, Harris began a relationship with Peter Legler.

On the topic of having children, Harris stated in a 2017 interview with &quot;Woman&quot; magazine:

People ask, &#x27;So when are you going to have children?&#x27; I think it&#x27;s a really odd thing because it&#x27;s such a personal decision. And also, you don&#x27;t know what is happening in someone&#x27;s life. I find it bizarre, even with my friends, when they want me to have children. Why would you encourage anybody to have children unless it was their burning desire? You need to be fully committed to it... Have children when you&#x27;re ready, if you&#x27;re ready, but only then. I&#x27;d never had any pressure.

<text>The United Unionist Coalition (UUC), formerly known as the United Unionist Assembly Party, was a minor unionist political formation in Northern Ireland.

==Northern Ireland Assembly==

The UUC was formed by three members of the Northern Ireland Assembly who had been elected as &quot;independent unionists&quot; in 1998, and decided to form themselves into an official grouping to avail of facilities provided by the Assembly to parties. As such they were more a coalition of political expediency rather than a coherent political party. The founders of the group, which was initially called the &quot;United Unionist Assembly Party&quot;, were Fraser Agnew, Boyd Douglas and Denis Watson (all of whom have since left the grouping).

The grouping subsequently registered with the Electoral Commission as the &quot;United Unionist Coalition&quot;, a name recalling the anti-Sunningdale Agreement bloc of Unionist parties in the 1970s, the United Ulster Unionist Coalition.

Watson subsequently joined the Democratic Unionist Party. In the 2003 Assembly elections the UUC secured only 0.4% of first preference votes and all three UUC members lost their seats. The UUC did not contest the 2007 or 2011 Assembly elections.

==Local government==

Following the 2005 local government elections the UUC had two elected councillors: Agnew on Newtownabbey Borough Council and Douglas on Limavady Borough Council. A mid-term defection led to the party gaining one council seat in Limavady.

In January 2011 Agnew left the UUC, returning to the Ulster Unionist Party. Douglas joined Traditional Unionist Voice prior to the May 2011 Council elections (in which he held his seat). No candidate was elected on a UUC ticket.

As of April 2012, the UUC has no elected representatives and is not registered with the Electoral Commission.

<doc id="370149" wikidata="Q208566" url="?curid=370149" title="Skyros">
<text>Skyros (, ), in some historical contexts Latinized Scyros (, ), is an island in Greece. It is the southernmost island of the Sporades, an archipelago in the Aegean Sea. Around the 2nd millennium BC, the island was known as The Island of the [[Magnetes]]; later, it was consecutively known as Pelasgia, Dolopia, and finally Skyros. At , it is the largest island of the Sporades, and had a population of about 3,000 in 2021.

==Municipality==
The municipality Skyros is part of the regional unit of Euboea. Apart from the island Skyros, the municipality consists of the small inhabited island of Skyropoula and a few smaller uninhabited islands. The total area of the municipality is .

==Etymology==
One account associates the name &quot;Skyros&quot; with &quot;skyron&quot; or &quot;skiron&quot;, meaning &quot;stone debris&quot;. The island had a reputation for its decorative stone.

==History==
According to Greek mythology, Theseus died on Skyros when the local king, Lycomedes, threw him from a cliff. The island is also famous in the myths as the place from where Achilles set sail for Troy after Odysseus discovered him in the court of Lycomedes. Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, was from Skyros (or &quot;Scyros&quot;, as its name is sometimes transliterated), as told in Book Nineteen of the &quot;Iliad&quot; (lines 326-327) and in the play by Sophocles, Philoctetes (line 239). A small bay named Achili on the east coast of the island is said to be the place from where Achilles left with the Greeks, or rather where Achilles landed during a squall that befell the Greek fleet following an abortive initial expedition landing astray in Mysia.

In 475 BC, according to Thucydides (1.98), Cimon defeated the Dolopians (the original inhabitants) and conquered the entire island. From that date, Athenian settlers colonized it and it became a part of the Athenian Empire. The island lay on the strategic trade route between Attica and the Black Sea (Athens depended on supplies of grain reaching it through the Hellespont). Cimon claimed to have found the remains of Theseus, and returned them to Athens.

In 340 BC, the Macedonians took over the island and dominated it until 192 BC, when King Philip V of Macedon and the Roman Republican forces restored it to Athens.


After the Fourth Crusade of 1202–1204, the island became part of the domain of Geremia Ghisi. The Byzantines retook it in 1277. After the Fall of Constantinople, Venetians again ruled the island until 1538, when it passed to the Ottoman Empire. It became part of the new Greek state in 1830.

In 1848, Captain Thomas Graves surveyed Skyros for the British Admiralty in the frigate . He travelled around the island, and a record of his observations was published the following year.

Rupert Brooke, the famous English poet, is buried on Skyros, having died on board a French hospital-ship moored off the island on 23 April 1915, during World War I. Present at Brooke&#x27;s burial that same evening, were Patrick Shaw-Stewart and William Denis Browne. The tomb that visitors see today when they visit the grave, which is located in the Tris Boukes Bay, is one that was commissioned by Brooke’s mother and was placed after the 1st World War. On the tomb is an inscription of Brooke&#x27;s famous poem &quot;The Soldier&quot;.

In 1941 Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Karl Shapiro wrote the World War II poem &quot;Scyros&quot;, which he set on the island Skyros &quot;because it was a tribute to and irony upon Rupert Brooke.&quot;

In 1963 the Archaeological Museum of Skyros was established, with the inauguration taking place 10 years later in 1973. The Faltaits Folklore Museum was founded in 1964 - one of the first local folklore museums to operate in Greece.

===Spanish flu===
In 1918, during the spanish flu, approximately one third of the island&#x27;s population died in less than 30 days. Specifically, the influenza began on 27 October 1918, and of the 3,200 inhabitants on the island, almost 2,000 were infected and 1,000 died. described the dire consequences of the pandemic in a rare chronicle published in 1919, titled .

==Geography==
The north of the island is covered by a forest, while the south, dominated by the highest mountain, called Kochila, (792 m), is bare and rocky. The island&#x27;s capital is also called Skyros (or, locally, &quot;Chora&quot;). The main port, on the west coast, is Linaria. The island has a castle (the &quot;kastro&quot;) that dates from the Venetian occupation (13th to 15th centuries), a Byzantine monastery (the Monastery of Saint George), the grave of English poet Rupert Brooke in an olive grove by the road leading to Tris Boukes harbour. There are many beaches on the coast. The island has its own breed of Skyrian ponies.
===Climate===
Skyros has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with mild to cool, rainy winters and pleasantly warm, dry summers.

==Transportation==

===Air travel===
Skyros is home to the Skyros Island National Airport, a one-runway airport.

===Sea travel===
Skyros Shipping Company operates the ferry service to Skyros. During holiday season the ferry runs twice daily from Kymi to Linaria on Skyros. During the winter months the service operates daily. The ship has the name &quot;Achilleas SKYROS SHIPPING CO.&quot; (Greek: Αχιλλέας ΣΚΥΡΟΣ ΝΑΥΤΙΚΗ ΕΤΑΙΡΙΑ).

<text>William Henry Barlow (10 May 1812 – 12 November 1902) was an English civil engineer of the 19th century, particularly associated with railway engineering projects. Barlow was involved in many engineering enterprises. He was engineer for the Midland Railway on its London extension and designed the company&#x27;s London terminus at St Pancras.

With John Hawkshaw, he completed Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge. Following the Tay Bridge disaster he sat on the commission which investigated the causes and designed the replacement Tay Bridge. Barlow was also an inventor and experimenter, patenting a design for a rail and carrying out investigations on the use and design of steel structures.

==Early life and education==
Barlow was born on 10 May 1812 in Woolwich, Kent (now in south-east London), the son of mathematician and physicist Professor Peter Barlow, who taught at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. William Barlow was the younger brother of Peter William Barlow. After a private education, Barlow began to study civil engineering with his father at the age of sixteen. After a year he, went on to a pupillage at the machinery department of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Woolwich Dockyard close to his family home. He then worked at the London Docks for Henry Robinson Palmer.

Barlow married Selina Crawford Caffin in May 1842 at Charlton, Kent. The couple had four sons and two daughters. Their son Crawford Barlow became a civil engineer and was in practice with his father.

==Career==
From 1832 he spent six years working as an engineer in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, helping build an ordnance factory on behalf of machine tool manufacturers Maudslay, Sons &amp; Field. He also produced a report for the Turkish government on lighthouses in the Bosphorus, which led to his first two scientific papers. For his services to the Ottoman government he was awarded the Order of Nishan Iftikhar (Order of Glory).

Barlow returned to Britain in 1838 to take up a post as assistant engineer on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway working for George W. Buck. In 1842, he joined the Midland Counties Railway as resident engineer for the section between Rugby and Derby. When the Midland Counties Railway became part of the Midland Railway in 1844, he retained the position, later becoming chief engineer of the larger railway. On 1 April 1845, Barlow was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and on 6 June 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Whilst working on the Midland Railway&#x27;s main line, Barlow established that the replacement of sleepers was a larger part of the cost of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.

Joseph Paxton, designer of the cast iron and glass Crystal Palace for The Great Exhibition of 1851, was a director of the Midland Railway and he asked Barlow for his help in the preparation of the structural calculations for the frame of the building.
In 1857, Barlow left the Midland Railway to form his own consultant engineering practice in London, with the Midland Railway as a significant client. Following the death of Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1859, Barlow was commissioned with John Hawkshaw to complete the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, construction of which had been stalled since 1843 due to insufficient funds to finish it. Reusing the chains from Brunel&#x27;s earlier Hungerford Suspension Bridge in London, demolished in 1860, Barlow and Hawkshaw completed the bridge in 1864 with a more robust deck than Brunel had planned and other variations caused by the reuse of the existing chains. Its span was the longest in Britain at the time.

Between 1862 and 1869, Barlow was consultant engineer for the Midland Railway&#x27;s southern extension from Bedford to London, including the layout of the London terminus station at St Pancras on Euston Road. To deal with the sloping site and the need to cross the Regent&#x27;s Canal a short distance to the north, the platforms were constructed on a raised structure supported on cast iron columns and girders. Under this structure, storage was laid out for beer from the breweries at Burton upon Trent. With assistance from Rowland Mason Ordish, Barlow also designed the arched, cast iron station canopy which spans across the platforms without intermediate support – then the widest of its kind in the world. It was designed as a cost-effective and efficient means of avoiding the need for additional solid structure in the lower level. George Gilbert Scott designed the hotel in front of the train shed.

On 28 December 1879, the central section of the North British Railway&#x27;s bridge across the River Tay near Dundee collapsed in the Tay Bridge disaster as an express train crossed it in a heavy storm. All 75 passengers and crew on the train were killed. As the newly elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Barlow was appointed as a member of the Board of Trade&#x27;s Court of Inquiry into the disaster. He sat with Henry Cadogan Rothery and William Yolland, co-authoring one of the final reports with Yolland recommending a commission be established to examine wind loads on bridges. In its report dated 30 June 1880, the Court of Inquiry concluded that the bridge, designed by Sir Thomas Bouch and opened only the year before its collapse, had been &quot;badly designed, badly built and badly maintained&quot;. The entire central box truss section of the bridge known as the &quot;High Girders&quot; collapsed along with the thirteen trestles supporting it, leaving a gap of nearly half-a-mile in the bridge.

His reputation destroyed, Bouch died in October 1880. Work on the suspension bridge he had designed to cross the Firth of Forth was stopped after the Tay Bridge collapse and Barlow, Sir John Fowler and Thomas Elliot Harrison, consultant engineers for the three railway companies involved in the construction, were asked to choose a replacement design. The solution was the cantilevered Forth Bridge by Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.

In 1881 Barlow sat as member of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission established at the recommendation of the Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (1882–87) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder of the tragedy of 1879.

Barlow was an early experimenter with civil engineering uses for steel, carrying out research at Woolwich Arsenal in the 1850s and being a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers&#x27; committee on the subject. From 1873 he was a member of a Board of Trade committee which produced the first recommendations on safe working loads for steel in railway structures in 1877.

Barlow also experimented with sound recording. In February 1874 he presented the Royal Society with a talk &quot;On the Pneumatic Action which accompanies the Articulation of Sounds by the Human Voice, as exhibited by a Recording Instrument.&quot; He called his &#x27;recording instrument&#x27; a &quot;Logograph&quot;.

Barlow was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Arts. He served as Vice President of the Royal Society in 1881 and was an honorary member of the Société des Ingénieurs Civil de France. He was also a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Railway Volunteer Staff Corps.

With his health failing, he retired from practice in 1896, along with his son. He died on 12 November 1902 from exhaustion after breaking his leg, and was buried in Charlton Cemetery in a plot adjacent to that of his father&#x27;s grave. His home &quot;High Combe&quot;, Charlton Road, Greenwich, is marked with a blue plaque.

<text>The (Northern) Sporades are an archipelago along the east coast of Greece, northeast of the island of Euboea, in the Aegean Sea. They consist of 24 islands, four of which are permanently inhabited: Alonnisos, Skiathos, Skopelos and Skyros. They may also be referred to as the Thessalian Sporades ().

==Etymology==
&quot;Sporades&quot; means &quot;those scattered&quot; (compare with &quot;sporadic&quot;). From Classical Antiquity the name has referred to the Aegean island groups outside the central archipelago of the Cyclades.

==Geography==
In modern geographical parlance, there are five different Sporades groups:
* Thessalian Sporades () or Northern Sporades. Since 1960, the term &quot;Sporades&quot; refers mainly to these islands:
**Skopelos
** Alonnisos
** Skiathos
** Skyros
** Kyra Panagia
** Peristera
** Gioura
** Skantzoura
** Piperi
** Tsougria
* Saronic Islands or Western Sporades(): Salamis, Aigina, Poros, Hydra, Spetses, and the other islands of the Saronic Gulf and the Myrtoan Sea.
* Southern Sporades (), i.e. the Dodecanese, to which group Samos and Ikaria are sometimes appended.
* Eastern Sporades or Anatolic Sporades (), i.e. the islands of the eastern and northeastern Aegean, near the coast of Asia Minor: Samos, Ikaria, Lesbos, Chios, Tenedos, Psara, Oinousses and smaller island groups.
* Thracian Sporades (): Thasos, Samothrace, Imbros, Lemnos and Agios Efstratios.

The two latter groups together form the North Aegean islands.

==Administration==
As part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the &quot;Sporades Regional Unit&quot; () was created out of part of the former Magnesia Prefecture, region of Thessaly. The regional unit is subdivided into 3 municipalities. These are:

*Skiathos (1)
*Skopelos (3)
*Alonnisos (2)

The island of Skyros and a few uninhabited islets in its area are part of the &quot;Euboea regional unit&quot; and the &quot;administrative region of Central Greece&quot;.

<doc id="370156" wikidata="Q334165" url="?curid=370156" title="Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel">
<text>Arthur Wellesley Peel, 1st Viscount Peel, (3 August 182924 October 1912), was a British Liberal politician, who sat in the House of Commons from 1865 to 1895. He was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1884 until 1895, when he was raised to the peerage.

==Early life==
Peel was the fifth and youngest son of the Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel by his wife, Julia, the daughter of General Sir John Floyd, 1st Baronet. Peel was named after Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.

==Political career==
Peel was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Warwick in the 1865 general election and held the seat until 1885, when it was replaced under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. From 1868 to 1871, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Poor Law Board and then became Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. In 1873 to 1874, he was patronage secretary to the Treasury, and in 1880, he became Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs in William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s second government. On the retirement of Sir Henry Brand, Peel was elected Speaker of the House of Commons on 26 February 1884.
In the 1885 general election, Peel was elected for Warwick and Leamington. Throughout his career as Speaker, as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition noted, &quot;he exhibited conspicuous impartiality, combined with a perfect knowledge of the traditions, usages and forms of the House, soundness of judgment, and readiness of decision upon all occasions&quot;. Though officially impartial, Peel left the Liberal Party over the issue of Home Rule and became a Liberal Unionist. Peel was also an important ally of Charles Bradlaugh, whose campaigns to have the oath of allegiance changed eventually permitted non-Christians, such as agnostics and atheists, to serve in the House of Commons.
Peel retired for health reasons prior to the 1895 general election and was created Viscount Peel, of Sandy in the County of Bedford, with a pension of £4,000 for life by (58 &amp; 59 Vict. c. 10). He was presented with the Freedom of the City of London in July of that year. In 1896, he was chairman of a royal commission into the licensing laws. Other members of the commission disagreed with part of his report, and he resigned the chair, which left Sir Algernon West to complete a majority report. However, the report was published in Peel&#x27;s name and recommended that the number of licensed houses should be greatly reduced. The report was a valuable weapon in the hands of reformers.

A street in Warwick, Peel Road, was named in his honour.
==Family==
Peel married Adelaide Dugdale (14 November 1839 – 5 December 1890), daughter of William Stratford Dugdale, in 1862. She died in December 1890 and Lord Peel remained a widower until his death in October 1912, aged 83. They had seven children: 
* Julia Beatrice Peel (1864–1949) married the Irish Parliamentary Party MP James Rochfort Maguire
* William [Wellesley] Peel (1867–1937) succeeded as 2nd Viscount; created Earl Peel in 1929
* [Arthur] George [Villiers] Peel (1868–1956), politician and author
* Sidney [Cornwallis] Peel (1870–1938), a colonel and, for four years, an MP, created a baronet in 1936
* Agnes [Mary] Peel (1869x71–1959) married the Conservative MP Sydney Goldman.
* Ella [Frances] Peel (1872–1900)
* Maurice Berkeley Peel (1873–1917), Church of England vicar, later a military chaplain, killed in action in the First World War.

<text>An audio filter is a frequency-dependent circuit, working in the audio frequency range, 0 Hz to 20 kHz. Audio filters can amplify (boost), pass or attenuate (cut) some frequency ranges. Many types of filters exist for different audio applications including hi-fi stereo systems, musical synthesizers, effects units, sound reinforcement systems, instrument amplifiers and virtual reality systems.

==Types==
;Low-pass
:Low-pass filters pass through frequencies below their cutoff frequencies, and progressively attenuate frequencies above the cutoff frequency. Low-pass filters are used in audio crossovers to remove high-frequency content from signals being sent to a low-frequency subwoofer system.

;High-pass
:A high-pass filter does the opposite, passing high frequencies above the cutoff frequency, and progressively attenuating frequencies below the cutoff frequency. A high-pass filter can be used in an audio crossover to remove low-frequency content from a signal being sent to a tweeter.

;Band-pass
:A band-pass filter passes frequencies between its two cutoff frequencies while attenuating those outside the range. A band-reject filter attenuates frequencies between its two cutoff frequencies while passing those outside the &#x27;reject&#x27; range.

;All-pass
:An all-pass filter passes all frequencies but affects the phase of any given sinusoidal component according to its frequency.

==Applications==
In some applications, such as in the design of graphic equalizers or CD players, the filters are designed according to a set of objective criteria such as passband, passband attenuation, stopband, and stopband attenuation, where the passbands are the frequency ranges for which audio is attenuated less than a specified maximum, and the stopbands are the frequency ranges for which the audio must be attenuated by a specified minimum. In more complex cases, an audio filter can provide a feedback loop, which introduces resonance (ringing) alongside attenuation. Audio filters can also be designed to provide gain (boost) as well as attenuation.
In other applications, such as with synthesizers or sound effects, the aesthetic of the filter must be evaluated subjectively.

Audio filters can be implemented in analog circuitry as analog filters or in DSP code or computer software as digital filters.

==Self-oscillation==
Self-oscillation occurs when the resonance or Q factor of the cutoff frequency of the filter is set high enough that the internal feedback causes the filter circuitry to become a sine tone sine wave oscillator.

<text>Harlesden () is an interchange station on Acton Lane in north-west London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground, between Stonebridge Park and Willesden Junction stations. The railway line here is the border between the Harlesden and Stonebridge residential area in the east, and the Park Royal industrial estate to the west. The southern end of Willesden Brent Sidings separates the station from the West Coast Main Line.

==History==

The first station at the site was which was opened in 1841 by the London and Birmingham Railway and closed in 1866, replaced by Willesden Junction station, to the south east. In the Watford DC line program of new electrified suburban tracks of the London and North Western Railway, a new station, &quot;Harlesden&quot;, opened on 15 June 1912. Bakerloo line services on the same tracks began on 16 April 1917, via a new junction at Queens Park station. The Watford Junction to modernisation project was completed in 1922.

<text>Stonebridge Park is an interchange station in Tokyngton and Stonebridge, north-west London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground, between Wembley Central and Harlesden stations. The station is located on Argenta Way, and is named after the nearby junction connecting the North Circular Road (A406) with the Harrow Road (A404).

==History==
The line serving the station was opened by the London and North Western Railway as part of their New Line project on 15 June 1912. It closed on 9 January 1917 and reopened for Bakerloo line trains on 1 August 1917. One of the generating stations supplying this network was on the site of the current London Underground depot north west of the station. The carriage shed, now without direct connection to the DC line, between Stonebridge Park station and Stonebridge Park LU depot was originally built to house LNWR stock using the DC line.

The current station platforms and associated buildings were first built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1948 to a design attributed to John Weeks following destruction of the original structures by bombing in World War II, the booking hall at ground level appears to be the original building. The platform-level style of the rebuilding was different from that of the original DC line stations (but not the same as the 1938 South Kenton station on the same line), utilising concrete and steel rather than brick buildings with wood and glass canopies. The 1948 buildings have themselves suffered two major fires which resulted in the rebuilding of the up side platform buildings and later the partial demolition of the down side platform building. Later upgrading and improvement of the platform structures has retained the basic 1940s shape.

From 24 September 1982 to 4 June 1984 it was the northern operational terminus of the Bakerloo line. London Underground&#x27;s Stonebridge Park Depot is to the north-west of the station. The Brent Viaduct, a Grade II listed building built by the London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s, is immediately south of the station.

==Connections==

London Buses routes 18, 79, 112, 440 and night route N18 serve the station front.

<doc id="370166" wikidata="Q2340012" url="?curid=370166" title="Tantulocarida">
<text>Tantulocarida is a highly specialised group of parasitic crustaceans that consists of about 33 species, treated as a class in superclass Multicrustacea. They are typically ectoparasites that infest copepods, isopods, tanaids, amphipods and ostracods.

==Description==
In the Tantulocarida, animals do not ever present eyes.

The tantulus larvae has a head with a ventral oral disc but no appendages, a six-segmented thorax with six pairs of legs, and a limbless abdomen consisting of one to six segments in addition to a telson.

===Body length===
Members of this subclass are minute – less than in length and have a dramatic reduction in body form compared to other crustaceans, with an unsegmented, sac-like thorax and a much reduced abdomen. One tantulocarid species, &quot;Tantulacus dieteri&quot;, is the world&#x27;s smallest arthropod, with a total body length of only .

==Life cycle==

The tantulocarid life cycle is unique among crustaceans. The tantulus larva transforms directly from a non-feeding (lecithotrophic) and free-swimming organism into a parasite without any instars. When entering the parasitic stage much of the body, such as the muscles, degenerates, even if the body itself becomes bigger. As a parasite it is permanently attached to its host, and after piercing its host&#x27;s cuticle with an unpaired stylet, a rootlet system used to absorb nutrients enters through the hole and grow into the host’s tissue. The adult form develops inside the larva, and can become either a sac-like parthenogenetic female, or a fully developed free-living, non-feeding and sexually-reproducing male or female. The eggs inside the parthenogenetic female are eventually released as fully developed tantulus larvae. The finding of what appears to be a benthic non-feeding nauplius larva suggests that eggs produced by sexual females hatch as nauplii instead of tantulus larvae. Both the parthenogenetic and sexual females are semelparous.

==Classification==
Five families are recognised:
Basipodellidae :
*&quot;Basipodella&quot; 
*&quot;Hypertantulus&quot; 
*&quot;Nipponotantulus&quot; 
*&quot;Polynyapodella&quot; 
*&quot;Rimitantulus&quot; 
*&quot;Serratotantulus&quot; 
*&quot;Stygotantulus&quot; 

Doryphallophoridae :
*&quot;Doryphallophora&quot; 
*&quot;Paradoryphallophora&quot; 

Microdajidae :
*&quot;Microdajus&quot; 
*&quot;Xenalytus&quot; 

Cumoniscidae (formerly family Deoterthridae:
*&quot;Amphitantulus&quot;

<doc id="370170" wikidata="Q801594" url="?curid=370170" title="Wembley Central station">
<text>Wembley Central is an interchange station in Wembley, north-west London. It is situated on the east-west High Road and is near to both Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena. The station provides Bakerloo line services of the London Underground, Lioness line services of the London Overground, and National Rail services operated by Southern on the West Coast main line.

==History==
On 20 July 1837, the London and Birmingham Railway line opened, and in 1842 this station opened as &quot;Sudbury&quot;. It was later renamed to &quot;Sudbury and Wembley&quot; in 1882, and then again to &quot;Wembley for Sudbury&quot; in 1910, coinciding with the construction of the LNWR New Line. Bakerloo line services over the New Line began on 16 April 1917. 

In 1936 street level buildings were reconstructed with a shopping arcade, and in 1948, further work took place in preparation for the Olympic Games at Wembley Stadium. The station was renamed again on 5 July 1948, this time to &quot;Wembley Central&quot;, the name that is still in use. Station Square was constructed by Ravenseft Properties Limited in 1965, taking the form of a concrete raft over the station (see also Stratford Centre), providing most of the current station layout. Bakerloo line services were withdrawn on 24 September 1982, but later reinstated on 4 June 1984.

In November 2007, station management transferred from Silverlink to London Underground. The 1936 and 1948 surface buildings were being demolished in June 2008 in preparation for redevelopment. Southern services between Milton Keynes and East Croydon began here in February 2009, with an off-peak service pattern of one train per hour per direction on Monday to Saturday. London Midland services between London Euston and Tring were introduced in December 2014, also with an off-peak service pattern of one train per hour per direction on Monday to Saturday, but this was later withdrawn in December 2022 by London Northwestern Railway.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 13 October 1940, an express passenger train was derailed after it collided with a platform barrow obstructing the line. Several people were killed and many more were injured.
*In 1984, a passenger train overran a signal and collided with a freight train, killing three people.

==Services and operations==
Services at Wembley Central station are operated by London Underground on the Bakerloo line, London Overground on the Lioness line, and Southern on the West London line. The off-peak service at the station in trains per hour is:

London Underground (Bakerloo line)
* 4 tph to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone
* 4 tph to Elephant &amp; Castle

London Overground (Lioness line)
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to 

Southern
* 1 tph to 
* 1 tph to 

Wembley Central has the appearance of an underground station due to the elevated position of the High Road (where the main entrance was until recently behind a 1940s shopping arcade) and the enclosed nature of the platforms below the raft upon which Station Square is built; it is actually generally at or above the local ground level, having been reconstructed by British Rail in its current form during the 1960s electrification of the West Coast Main Line. It is the first station out of Euston to have platforms on all three pairs of tracks and the combination of the confined space and through trains passing at speed on platforms 3-6 (the main line platforms) create a wind tunnel effect which can be dangerous for passengers.

The station was modernised in 2006 by Silverlink with additional safety features.

==Station works==
The passenger footbridge at the London end of the station, completed in late 2006 by civil engineers C Spencer Ltd, carries extra foot traffic to and from the platforms during event days at the nearby Wembley Stadium; the everyday access is at the &quot;country&quot; end of the platforms. In practice, this means the bridge is usually locked and out of use, only being opened when the stadium itself is in use.

Other recent works include the resurfacing of platforms 1 and 2 complete with the installation of curved steel cladding panels also completed by contractor, C Spencer Ltd. The station&#x27;s staff received refurbished messing facilities and new public toilets have also been installed.

In 2011–12, the station was made step-free, in preparation for the Olympics. A step-free route was provided between the station entrance and platforms 1 and 2 for the first time, with the installation of two new lifts and a stair lift. The toilets were refurbished to make them fully accessible. Two platforms were extended as well. This improvement scheme cost £2.5m.

==Redevelopment==

In June 2008, the London Borough of Brent (Local council) planned that the station was going to be demolished for redevelopment, as part of the Wembley Central Square plan, by St. Modwen construction company (although the plan also included new apartments, shops and open space surface).

==Connections==
London Buses routes 18, 79, 83, 92, 182, 204, 223, 297, 483 and H17 and night routes N18 and N83 serve the station.

<text>North Wembley is an interchange station in North Wembley, north-west London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground, between South Kenton and Wembley Central stations. The station is located on the south side of East Lane, part of the London Borough of Brent, serving residents of North Wembley and western parts of Wembley Park.

==History==

The station was first opened by the London and North Western Railway on 15 June 1912 as part of the New Line between Euston and Watford Junction; LER Bakerloo line services began on 16 April 1917. Originally to be called East Lane, after the road passing over the railway at this location, it was named North Wembley from opening. It was built to the same general design as the other new stations on the same line and the layout at North Wembley station makes it almost identical to Kenton two stops to the north. Ticket gates and departure boards were recently installed at this station.

==Services==

Platform 1 for southbound services.
* Services to London Euston operated by London Overground – approximately every 15 minutes (4tph).
* Services to Elephant &amp; Castle operated by London Underground – every 15 minutes (4tph).

Platform 2 for northbound services.
* Services to Watford Junction operated by London Overground – approximately every 15 minutes (4tph).
* Services to Harrow and Wealdstone operated by London Underground – every 15 minutes (4tph).

<text>The Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) was a small loyalist political party in Northern Ireland. It was established in June 1981 as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), to replace the New Ulster Political Research Group. The UDP name had previously been used in the 1930s by an unrelated party, which on one occasion contested Belfast Central.

==History==
The party&#x27;s roots were firmly in the Protestant community of Northern Ireland, but its initial political stance was not the traditional unionist one favoured by that section of society. Instead, it supported independence for Northern Ireland within the European Economic Community and the Commonwealth. These policies had been set out by its predecessors in the New Ulster Political Research Group, in their &quot;Beyond the Religious Divide&quot; policy document. However, this position did not capture the electorate&#x27;s imagination, and the UDP switched to supporting the UDA&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot; position, which suggested an assembly and executive for the region, elected by proportional representation. It also supported a written Bill of Rights and Constitution.

In the early years the party&#x27;s electoral support was limited. Its first foray into electoral politics was deeply disappointing, with the party leader John McMichael polling only 576 votes (1.3%) in the 1982 Belfast South by-election. The party&#x27;s two candidates in the 1982 Assembly election in Belfast North similarly failed to make an impact. It was not until the 1989 local elections that the party made its electoral breakthrough, when Ken Kerr won a seat on Derry City Council, in the Waterside area. Around that time, the UDP dropped the &quot;Loyalist&quot; part of its name. Although Kerr lost his council seat in 1993, Gary McMichael—son of the late John McMichael, who had been assassinated in 1987—won a seat on Lisburn City Council for the party. It increased its number of council seats to four in 1997.

This was due in part to the UDP&#x27;s increased public profile, after it played a role in the loyalist ceasefire of 1994 and contested the 1996 election to the Northern Ireland Forum. Although it failed to win any constituency seats, as one of the ten most successful parties it was awarded two &quot;top-up&quot; seats; these were taken by Gary McMichael and John White. This entitled the party to a place in the all-party talks that led to the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In January 1998 the UDP voluntarily withdrew from the peace talks, before it could be expelled in response to a number of murders committed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a cover name for the UDA.

The party officially supported devolution for Northern Ireland and the creation of an assembly, but in this it was at odds with the UDA and much of the party&#x27;s membership; this led to a split in the party. The UDP failed to win any seats at the 1998 Assembly election. It lost a council seat in the 2001 local elections and saw its support reduce. (The party&#x27;s candidates had been forced to run as independents, after the party forgot to register its name with the Electoral Commission.)

Disagreement over the Belfast Agreement continued between the UDP leadership and the UDA, and within the UDP itself. Gary McMichael declared in July 2001, after the paramilitary group declared itself anti-Agreement, that the UDP could no longer speak for the UDA. As a result of these tensions, the party dissolved in November 2001. Its role has largely been taken over by the Ulster Political Research Group.

<doc id="370178" wikidata="Q801454" url="?curid=370178" title="South Kenton station">
<text>South Kenton is an interchange station in Kenton, north-west London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground, between Kenton and North Wembley stations. It is located between The Link in the Sudbury Court Estate of North Wembley, and Windermere Grove in Kenton, in the Wembley postal area.

==History==

The station opened on 3 July 1933 with access from both sides of the railway via a footbridge to the single island platform serving only the Watford DC line; this footbridge (which started at the bottom of the embankment) was later replaced by a pedestrian tunnel, cutting out a long climb for passengers entering the station. The station designed by the architect William Henry Hamlyn was built in a more modern &quot;concrete and glass&quot; style construction including a &quot;streamlined&quot; waiting room rather than the brick and woodwork LNWR stations elsewhere on the DC line.

==The station today==

The station is an island platform and Bakerloo line train doors are not level with it. Therefore, there is a downward step to the train from the platform. The ticket office is at platform level and occupies the north end of the streamlined 1933 building. It is one of the three stations served by London Underground which has no ticket gates and due to the restrictive layout here there are no plans for these to be installed in the immediate future. There is no wheelchair access.

==Services==

There are four trains per hour on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground heading southbound towards Central London and Elephant &amp; Castle and northbound to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.

There are also four trains per hour on the Lioness line of the London Overground to London Euston southbound and to Watford Junction northbound.

<doc id="370181" wikidata="Q5354778" url="?curid=370181" title="Elections in New Zealand">
<text>New Zealand is a representative democracy in which members of the unicameral New Zealand Parliament gain their seats through elections. General elections are usually held every three years; they may be held at an earlier date (a &quot;snap&quot; election) at the discretion of the prime minister (advising the governor-general), but that usually only happens in the event of a vote of no confidence or other exceptional circumstances. A by-election is held to fill an electorate vacancy arising during a parliamentary term. Election day is always a Saturday, but advance voting is allowed in the lead-up to it. The most recent general election took place on 14 October 2023.

New Zealand has a multi-party system due to proportional representation. The introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system in 1993 was the most significant change to the electoral system in the 20th century. The Electoral Commission is responsible for the administration of parliamentary elections. The introduction of MMP has led to mostly minority or coalition governments, but the first party to win an outright majority since the introduction of MMP was the Labour Party, led by Jacinda Ardern, in 2020.

Local government politicians, including mayors and councillors, are voted in during local elections, held every three years. Most of these elections use the first-past-the-post (FPP) voting system, however, at the last local elections in 2022, 15 councils used the single transferable vote (STV) system, which has increasingly been adopted by councils since the 2000s.

== Overview of elections ==

===History===
The first general and provincial elections in New Zealand took place in 1853, the year after the British Parliament passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in 1893, with New Zealand being the first modern country to do so.

Almost all general elections between and were held under the first-past-the-post voting system. The first election under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system was held in following the 1993 electoral referendum.

=== Electoral roll ===
The electoral roll consists of a register of all enrolled voters, organised (primarily alphabetically by surname) within electorates. All persons who meet the requirements for voting must by law register on the electoral roll, even if they do not intend to vote. Although eligible voters must be enrolled, voting in New Zealand elections is not compulsory.

To be eligible to enrol, a person must be 18 years or older, a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and have lived in New Zealand for one or more years without leaving the country (with some exceptions). People can provisionally enrol to vote once they turn 17, with them being automatically enrolled on their 18th birthday.

The Registrar of Births Deaths and Marriages automatically notifies a person&#x27;s death to the Electoral Commission so they may be removed from the roll. An enrolment update campaign is conducted prior to every local and general election in order to keep the roll up to date, identifying any voters who have failed to update their address or cannot be found.

The roll records the name, address and stated occupation of all voters, although individual electors can apply for &quot;unpublished&quot; status on the roll in special circumstances, such as when having their details printed in the electoral roll could threaten their personal safety. The roll is &quot;public information&quot; meaning it can be used for legitimate purposes such as selecting people for jury service but it can be abused especially by marketing companies who use the electoral roll to send registered voters unsolicited advertising mail. According to Elections New Zealand, &quot;having the printed electoral rolls available for the public to view is a part of the open democratic process of New Zealand&quot;. The Electoral Commission, in their report on the 2017 general election, recommended that roll sales be discontinued for anything other than electoral purposes.

=== Electorates and lists ===
New Zealanders refer to electoral districts as &quot;electorates&quot;, or more colloquially as &quot;seats&quot;. Since the 2020 general election, there are 72 electorates, including seven Māori electorates reserved for people of Māori ethnicity or ancestry who choose to place themselves on a separate electoral roll. All of New Zealand is covered by a general electorate and an overlapping Māori electorate. According to the New Zealand Electoral Commission, &quot;The Representation Commission reviews and adjusts electorate boundaries after each 5-yearly population census and the Māori Electoral Option.&quot;

All electorates have roughly the same number of people in them; the Representation Commission periodically reviews and alters electorate boundaries to preserve this approximate balance. The number of people per electorate depends on the population of the South Island, which as the less populous of the country&#x27;s two main islands has sixteen guaranteed electorates. Hence, the ideal number of people per electorate equals the population of the South Island divided by sixteen. From this, the Commission determines the number of North Island, Māori and list seats, which may fluctuate accordingly. The number of electorates increased by one compared to the 2017 election to account for the North Island&#x27;s higher population growth, creating Takanini; and the boundaries of 30 general electorates and five Māori electorates were adjusted.

Supplementing the geographic electorate seats, the system allows for 48 at-large &quot;list seats&quot;. A nationwide party vote fills these seats from closed lists submitted by political parties; they serve to make a party&#x27;s total share of seats in parliament reflect its share of the party vote. For example, if a party wins 20% of the party vote, but only ten electorate seats, it will win fourteen list-seats, so that it has a total of 24 seats: 20% of the 120 seats in parliament. (See .)

=== Timing of elections ===

==== General elections ====

Unlike some other countries, New Zealand has no fixed election-date for general elections, but rather the prime minister determines the timing of general elections by advising the governor-general when to issue the writ for a general election. The Constitution Act 1986 requires new parliamentary elections every three years. The 1910s, 1930s and 1940s saw three elections delayed due to World War I, the Great Depression and World War II, respectively: the 1919, 1935 and 1943 elections would otherwise have taken place in 1917, 1934 and 1941 (Parliaments passed Acts extending their terms). Also, governments have occasionally called early, or &quot;snap&quot; elections (for example, in 1951 in the midst of an industrial dispute involving striking waterfront workers).

The term of Parliament and the timing of general elections is set out in the Constitution Act 1986 and the Electoral Act 1993. Under section 19 of the Constitution Act, Parliament must meet within six weeks of the return of the writ for a general election, while under section 17, the term of Parliament ends three years after the return of the writ, unless Parliament is dissolved earlier by the governor-general. Section 125 of the Electoral Act requires that whenever Parliament expires or is dissolved, the governor-general must issue a writ of election within seven days. Section 139 of the Electoral Act provides further constraints. The writ must be returned within 50 days of being issued, though the governor-general may appoint an earlier return date in the writ itself. Furthermore, election day must be between 20 and 27 days after the close of nominations. Thus, New Zealand law specifically mandates elections at least once every three years and two months, though elections are often held after three years, traditionally in November. The extra two months allow for some flexibility when returning to a fourth-quarter election after an early election, as happened in 2005 and 2008 after the 2002 snap election.

Snap elections have occurred three times in New Zealand&#x27;s history: in 1951, 1984 and 2002. Early elections often provoke controversy, as they potentially give governing parties an advantage over opposition candidates. Of the three elections in which the government won an increased majority, two were snap elections (1951 and 2002 – the other incumbent-boosting election took place in 1938). The 1984 snap election backfired on the governing party: many believe that Prime Minister Robert Muldoon called it while drunk. The 1996 election took place slightly early (on 12 October) to avoid holding a by-election after the resignation of Michael Laws.

As in other Westminster-style democracies, the prime minister&#x27;s power to determine the election date can give the government some subtle advantages. For example, if the prime minister determines a section of the population will either vote against their government or not at all, they might hold the election at the most advantageous time – as long as it is within three years. Party strategists take the timing of important rugby union matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the election will likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a widespread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the All Blacks (the New Zealand national rugby team) win, and suffer when they lose.

Throughout the late 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, tradition associated elections with November – give or take a few weeks. After disruptions to the 36-month cycle, prime ministers moved to restore it to a November base. In 1950, the legal requirement to hold elections on a Saturday was introduced, and this first applied to the . Beginning with the , a convention was formed to hold general elections on the last Saturday of November. This convention was upset by Muldoon calling a snap election in 1984. It took until the to get back towards the convention, only for Helen Clark to call an early election in . By the , the conventional &quot;last Saturday of November&quot; was achieved again. From the , the trend has been to hold the election in September or October; the , delayed from September to October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, caused the 2023 election to also be held in October.

==== Local elections ====

Unlike general elections, elections for the city, district and regional councils of New Zealand have a fixed election date. Under section 10 of the Local Electoral Act 2001, elections must be held on the &quot;second Saturday in October in every third year&quot; from the date the Act came into effect in 2001. The latest local body elections were held on 8 October 2022.

=== Nomination and deposit of political parties and candidates ===
A party that has more than 500 fee-paying members may register with the Electoral Commission. Registered parties may submit a party list on payment of a $1000 deposit. This deposit is refunded if the party reaches 0.5% of the party votes. Electorate candidates may be nominated by a registered party or by two voters in that electorate. The deposit for an electorate candidate is $300 which is refunded if they reach 5%.

=== Voting ===
Election day for both Māori and general seats has been held on a Saturday since 1951, so as to minimise the effect of work or religious commitments that could inhibit people from voting. The casting of ballots happens at various voting places, generally established in schools, church halls, sports clubs, or other such public places. In some elections, voting booths are also set up in hospitals and rest homes for use by patients (though this did not happen in the 2020 election because of the COVID-19 pandemic). Voters have the flexibility of voting any voting place in the country, regardless of the electorate they live in. Some voting places may have electoral rolls of multiple electorates to assist voters, but if the voting place does not have the correct electoral roll then a voter will have to cast a special vote.

Advance voting is available in the two weeks before election day. A dominating feature of the 2017 election was the increased use of advance voting; 47% of the votes were taken in advance and grew from 24% in the 2014 election. In previous elections, voters were required to provide reasons to vote in advance; from 2011 and beyond, voters could use this service for any reason. The 2018 Northcote by-election was the first parliamentary election where more people voted in advance than on election day. In the 2020 election, 68% of votes were cast in advance – an increase of about 60% compared to the previous general election, likely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s impact on people&#x27;s ability to vote in person.

If voters cannot physically get to a voting place, they may authorise another person to collect their ballot for them. Overseas voters may vote by post, fax, internet, or in person at New Zealand embassies or high commissions. Disabled voters can choose to vote via a telephone dictation service.
Enrolled voters are sent an EasyVote pack by post after nominations close. The pack contains an EasyVote card, which has the voter&#x27;s name, address and location on the electoral roll (electorate, page number and line number), which the voter gives to the issuing officer to assist in finding the voter on the printed electoral roll. The EasyVote Card is optional, and voters can simply state their name and address to the issuing officer. The EasyVote pack also contains a list of candidates in the voter&#x27;s electorate, a copy of the party lists, a list of voting places for the voter&#x27;s electorate and their opening hours, and a brochure on how to vote and the MMP voting system.

After their name is marked off, the voter is issued a voting paper. The voter then goes behind a cardboard screen, where they mark their paper using a supplied orange ink pen. The voter then folds their paper and places in their electorate&#x27;s sealed ballot box. Voters who enrol after the rolls have been printed, voting outside their electorate, or on the unpublished roll casts a special vote which is separated for later counting.

According to a 2008 survey commissioned by the Electoral Commission, 71% of voters voted in less than 5 minutes and 92% in less than 10 minutes. 98% of voters are satisfied with the waiting time.

New Zealand has a strictly enforced election silence. Campaigning is prohibited on election day and all election advertisements must be removed or covered by midnight on the night before the election. Opinion polling is also illegal on election day.

Local elections are held by postal vote. Referendums held in conjunction with elections are held at voting places; those between elections may be done by post or at voting places at the Government&#x27;s discretion.

==== Voting in the MMP system ====
Each voter gets a party vote, where they choose a political party, and an electorate vote, where they vote for a candidate in their electorate. The party vote determines the proportion of seats assigned to each party in Parliament, as long the party meets the electoral threshold. Each elected candidate gets a seat, and the remaining seats are filled by the party from its party list.

For example: a party wins 30% of the party vote. Therefore, it will get 30% of the 120 seats in Parliament (roughly 36 seats). The party won 20 electorates through the electorate vote. Therefore, 20 of the 36 seats will be taken by the MPs that won their electorate, and 16 seats will be left over for the party to fill from their list of politicians.

=== Vote-counting and announcement ===
Voting places close at 7:00 pm on election day and each place counts the votes cast there. The process of counting the votes by hand begins with advance and early votes from 9:00 am. From 7:00 pm, results (at this stage, provisional ones) go to a central office in Wellington, where they are recorded in a spreadsheet and entered into the national election results system. Election results are published on ElectionResults.govt.nz as they arrive, and simultaneously shared with the media, with the goal of having 50% of results available by 10 p.m. and 95% by 11:30 p.m.

All voting papers, counterfoils and electoral rolls are returned to the respective electorate&#x27;s returning officer for a mandatory recount. A master roll is compiled from the booth rolls to ensure no voter has voted more than once. At this stage, special votes, which can be returned up to 10 days after election day, are counted in the electorate they were cast for and included in the official count. The final count, including special votes, can take up to three weeks to be completed and announced. It becomes official when confirmed by the Chief Electoral Officer.

The final results sometimes differ from the preliminary results meaningfully; special votes tend to favour parties on the left, leaving parties on the right with one or two seats fewer than in the preliminary results. In 1999 the provisional result indicated that neither the Greens nor New Zealand First would qualify for Parliament, but both parties qualified on the strength of special votes, and the major parties ended up with fewer list seats than expected.

Candidates and parties have three working days after the release of the official results to apply for a judicial recount, either of individual electorates or of all electorates (a nationwide recount). A judicial recount takes place under the auspices of a District Court judge; a nationwide recount must take place under the auspices of the Chief District Court Judge. At the 2023 election, recounts were requested in the Mount Albert and Tāmaki Makaurau electorates, after the top two candidates in each were separated by fewer than 50 votes.

== Voter turnout ==
Voter turnout has generally declined in New Zealand general elections since the mid-20th century. Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Sir Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia. A system of compulsory voting looks unlikely to manifest in the near future, with former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern arguing that it is an ineffective way to foster citizen engagement.

In its report after the 2014 election, the Electoral Commission stated: Turnout has been in decline in most developed democracies over the last 30 years, but New Zealand&#x27;s decline has been particularly steep and persistent. At the 2011 election, turnout as a percentage of those eligible to enrol dropped to 69.57 per cent, the lowest recorded at a New Zealand Parliamentary election since the adoption of universal suffrage in 1893. The 2014 result, 72.14 per cent, is the second lowest. This small increase, while welcome, is no cause for comfort. New Zealand has a serious problem with declining voter participation. Of particular concern has been the youth vote (referring to the group of voters aged 18–29), which has had significantly lower turnout than other age brackets. A graph published on the Electoral Commission&#x27;s website demonstrates the lower turnout in younger age groups. Those from poorer and less educated demographics also fail to vote at disproportionately high rates.

==Orange Guy==
&quot;Orange Guy&quot; is the mascot used in electoral related advertising by the Electoral Commission. He is an amorphous orange blob who usually takes on a human form, but can transform into any object as the situation warrants. His face is a smiley, and his chest sports the logo of the Electoral Commission. Since 2017 he has been voiced by stand-up comedian David Correos. In the 2020 general election campaign, he was joined by a dog, Pup, who is also orange and resembles a cross between a Jack Russell Terrier and a Dachshund. The Orange Guy icon is trademarked to the Electoral Commission.

==Leaders&#x27; debates==

Leaders&#x27; debates are televised during pre-election periods in New Zealand. Traditionally these were held between the leaders of the two major parties, but since 1996, all leaders of parties with parliamentary representation are invited to a televised debate, still the two main party leaders may debate one-on-one in a separate debate. These events can prove decisive. For instance, at the 2002 election the United Future party boosted its rating in opinion polls following the successful performance of its party leader during a televised debate.

<text>Kenton is an interchange station situated on Kenton Road in Kenton, north-west London. It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground, between Harrow &amp; Wealdstone and South Kenton stations. It also has an out-of-station interchange with Northwick Park station on the London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. 

==History==

The station was one of several built on the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s New Line from Camden to Watford Junction which enabled local services from Watford Junction station to reach Euston station and Broad Street station in London. The New Line was mostly alongside main line of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1837. 

Kenton station was opened on 15 June 1912. It has only ever had platforms on the New Line; parallel main line services call at Harrow and Wealdstone station, one stop to the north, with some also calling at Wembley Central station, three stops to the south. 

Bakerloo line services began on 16 April 1917. On 24 September 1982, Bakerloo line services to Kenton ended when services north of Stonebridge Park were ended. The closure was short-lived, and the Bakerloo line service was reinstated on 4 June 1984.

The station&#x27;s former coal yard on the east side of the railway, no longer needed for the trains, is now occupied by a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket. 

==Services==

*London Overground (Lioness line) four trains per hour in each direction.
*London Underground (Bakerloo line) four trains per hour in each direction.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 114, 183, 223, H9, H10, H18, H19 and SL10 serve the station.

==Access to station==
TfL&#x27;s &quot;Getting Around&quot; map showing disabled access (dated April 2011) does not indicate that level access is available at this station. The nearest stations shown with step-free access are Harrow and Wealdstone, Kingsbury and Wembley Park; some journeys might be more conveniently made by using one of the local buses to Golders Green Station (via route 183) or Pinner Station (via route 183) and continuing from there.

<doc id="370188" wikidata="Q800896" url="?curid=370188" title="Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station">
<text>Harrow &amp; Wealdstone () is an interchange station located in both Harrow and Wealdstone in the London Borough of Harrow. It provides Bakerloo line services of the London Underground, of which it is the northern terminus; Lioness line services of the London Overground; and National Rail services operated by London Northwestern Railway and Southern on the West Coast main line (WCML). 

The station is along the WCML from London Euston station. It is located between The Bridge (which joins the southern end of High Street) and Sandridge Close, with entrances leading to both. It is one of the oldest stations in the London region still in existence. The Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash of 1952, which killed 112 people, occurred at the station and remains the worst peacetime rail disaster in the United Kingdom.

==History==
The station was opened by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) as Harrow on 20 July 1837 in what was then rural Middlesex. At the time the station was built, the area was fields and the nearest large settlement was at Harrow on the Hill about to the south. Wealdstone was a collection of houses at the north end of what is now Wealdstone High Street, about north of the station. The station buildings on the south west (Harrow) side of the station are the older part of the station, located beside what were the fast lines until the platforms were used for the later Euston to Watford DC line and the main line tracks were re-routed through the previous slow line platforms and new platforms (numbers 5 and 6) to the north east; a new, larger, station building was also erected on this Wealdstone side of the station in 1912. The station footbridge was originally constructed with a full-height central barrier with passengers using the &quot;London&quot; side and railway and postal staff using the &quot;country&quot; side to move goods and mail via lifts which were removed in the early 1970s, leaving two parcel elevators serving the DC line platforms for the remaining postal traffic.

On 18 December 1890, a short branch line known as the Stanmore branch line was opened by the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR, successor to the L&amp;BR). It ran north-east from the main line to Stanmore. In 1932 an intermediate halt was constructed as Belmont to serve the developing residential areas locally. The train was known affectionately as the &quot;Belmont Rattler&quot;.

By the end of the 19th century Wealdstone had developed in size and the station was given its current name on 1 May 1897 to reflect more accurately its location.

On 16 April 1917, Bakerloo line services were extended from Willesden Junction to Watford Junction running on the newly electrified local tracks (the New Lines, which were originally steam-worked) and calling at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone from that date.

On 15 September 1952, the passenger service to Stanmore – by then renamed Stanmore Village to avoid confusion with the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s (later Bakerloo, and now Jubilee) station opened in 1934 – was withdrawn. Freight traffic (particularly the storage of bananas) continued sporadically until 1964.

During the early 1960s, as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification, the bridge carrying the A409 road (The Bridge/Station Approach) over the railway was rebuilt easing the previous severe road gradients and offering higher clearance over the tracks to allow for overhead catenary cabling.

On 5 October 1964, all services on the branch line to Belmont were withdrawn as part of the cuts of the Beeching Axe. The permanent way north of Harrow and Wealdstone station was removed but the disused platform 7 on the eastern side of the station was left in place as a siding for a further few years until it too was removed.

On 24 September 1982, Bakerloo line services to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone ended when services north of Stonebridge Park were ended. However the closure was short-lived, and the Bakerloo line to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone was reinstated on 4 June 1984 with the station acting as the terminus.

In the 1990s major reconstruction of local roads made to by-pass High Street, Wealdstone sent a new road (Ellen Webb Drive) through what remained of the station goods yard and part of the forecourt of the eastern entrance (1917) to the station.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 7 August 1838 Thomas Port was fatally injured when he fell from a train and was run over about south of the station.
*In 1870, a mail train was in a rear-end collision with a freight train. Eight people were killed, including the cricketer James Rowley.
*Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash: On 8 October 1952, the station was the site of the worst peacetime railway disaster in British history when 112 people were killed and 340 were injured as a result of a Scottish express train colliding with the rear of a local train standing at platform 4. Seconds later a northbound express hauled by two locomotives collided with the wreckage causing further injury and demolished one span of the footbridge and the northern end of platforms 2 and 3. A memorial plaque was placed above the main entrance on the eastern side of the station to mark the 50th anniversary in 2002.

==Facilities==


The station has undergone several improvements in recent years: removal of the central barrier to allow use of the full width of the footbridge (which links both entrances and all platforms); new lifts for the use of disabled persons; newly painted and brightly-illuminated waiting rooms. When the line was resignalled with standard BR signalling in the 1980s, the two reversing sidings (used for turning Bakerloo line trains and occasionally DC line trains) located between the tracks of the DC line at the northern end side of the station were replaced by a single siding. This allowed the curve at the northern end of platform 2 to be eased using the space vacated by the removed siding. In practice, the remaining siding became unavailable for use by LO trains except when Bakerloo trains are not running as current (2018) service levels means that the siding is not sufficient for the reversing of Bakerloo trains, some trains have to reverse in platform 1 as well. Harrow and Wealdstone (together with Willesden Junction) is one of the two stations on the DC line which can be used for turning or stabling trains clear of the running lines during reduced or disrupted services although trains can be reversed using crossovers at other stations.

Ticket gatelines have been installed at both entrances in addition to the pre-existing booking offices

Trains on the fast lines pass the station through platforms 3 &amp; 4, usually without stopping to serve it; access to these platforms is now by staff-operated gates which are opened when necessary. Southern and London Northwestern Railway stopping services generally use platforms 5 &amp; 6 on the slow lines but all can use either pair of platforms when needed since the four main line platforms were lengthened to take 12-coach trains. Platform 2 on the Up DC line has unusually been maintained at a length of 182m rather than the usual DC line length of around 125m, long enough for an 8-coach train; on rare past occasions in recent years involving total closure of the fast and slow lines, main line trains have been diverted over the DC line between Watford Junction and Euston but without stopping at intermediate stations.

==Services==

===Main line services===
Main line National Rail services at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone are operated by London Northwestern Railway and Southern.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Euston (non-stop)
* 1 tph to via 
* 1 tph to 
* 2 tph to (semi-fast)
* 2 tph to (stopping)

On Sundays, the semi-fast services between London Euston and Tring do not run and the service to East Croydon runs only as far as .

===Local services===

Local services at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone are operated by London Overground on the Lioness line and by London Underground on the Bakerloo line.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Euston (all stations)
* 4 tph to Elephant &amp; Castle (all stations)
* 4 tph to (all stations)

==Future proposals==
===Crossrail===
Network Rail&#x27;s July 2011 London &amp; South East Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) recommended diverting West Coast Main Line (WCML) services from stations between London and away from Euston, to Crossrail via Old Oak Common, to free up capacity at Euston for High Speed 2. This would provide a direct service from the WCML to the Shenfield, Canary Wharf and Abbey Wood, release London Underground capacity at Euston, make better use of Crossrail&#x27;s capacity west of Paddington, and improve access to Heathrow Airport from the north. Under this scheme, all Crossrail trains would continue west of Paddington, instead of some of them terminating there. They would serve Heathrow Airport (10 tph), stations to Maidenhead and Reading (6 tph), and stations to Milton Keynes Central (8 tph).

In August 2014, a statement by the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the extension of Crossrail as far as , with potential Crossrail stops at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone, , , and . The extension would relieve some pressure from London Underground and London Euston station while also increasing connectivity. Conditions to the extension are that any extra services would not affect the planned service pattern for confirmed routes, as well as affordability.

==Access and connections==
The TfL &quot;Getting Around&quot; map shows this station as having disabled access (platform 1 does not involve the use of a lift when entering/leaving the Harrow entrance nor does platform 6 using the Wealdstone entrance).

The station is at the southern end of Wealdstone High Street; it is a short distance from Harrow Civic Centre and less than a mile from Harrow town centre. The station serves these areas as well as Belmont and Harrow Weald, both of which lack stations of their own, and parts of Headstone and Kenton. London Buses routes 140, 182, 186, 258, 340, 640, H9, H10, and night routes N18 and N140 serve the station.

<text>Ll/ll is a digraph that occurs in several languages.

==English==

In English, often represents the same sound as single : . The doubling is used to indicate that the preceding vowel is (historically) short, or that the &quot;l&quot; sound is to be extended longer than a single would provide (etymologically, in latinisms coming from a gemination). Different English language traditions use and in different words: for example the past tense form of &quot;travel&quot; is spelt &quot; in British English but &quot; in American English. See also: Doubled consonants. is also used in syllable-coda position in monosyllabic words or compounds derived from them, such as &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;

==Welsh==
In Welsh, stands for a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative sound (IPA: ). This sound is very common in place names in Wales because it occurs in the word , for example, , where the appears twice, or , where (in the long version of the name) the appears five times – with two instances of and two consecutive in .

In Welsh, is a separate &quot;digraph letter&quot; from (e.g., sorts before ). In modern Welsh this, and other digraph letters, are written with two symbols but count as one letter. In Middle Welsh it was written with a tied ligature; this ligature is included in the Latin Extended Additional Unicode block as and . This ligature is seldom used in Modern Welsh, but equivalent ligatures may be included in modern fonts, for example the three fonts commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2020.

==Romance languages==

===Asturian===

In the standard Asturian orthography published by the Academy of the Asturian Language in 1981, represents the phoneme (palatal lateral approximant).

A variation of this digraph, , is used to separate a verb form that ends in -l and the enclitics , , , or . This is pronounced as a geminated . For example, (&quot;it is worth it&quot;).

Another variation of this digraph, , is used to represent a set of dialectal phonemes used in Western Asturian that correspond to in other dialects: (voiced retroflex plosive), (voiced retroflex affricate), (voiceless retroflex affricate) or (voiceless alveolar affricate). This may also be written as in devices that do not support the Unicode characters and .

===Catalan===
In Catalan, represents the phoneme , as in (language, tongue), (linkage, connection), or (knife).

====L with middle dot====

In order to not confuse with a geminated , Catalan uses a middle dot (interpunct or in Catalan) in between . For example (&quot;excellent&quot;). The first character in the digraph, and , is included in the Latin Extended-A Unicode block at U+013F (uppercase) and U+0140 (lowercase) respectively.

In Catalan typography, is intended to fill two spaces, not three, so the interpunct is placed in the narrow space between the two s: and . However, it is common to write and , occupying three spaces. and , although sometimes seen, are incorrect.

===Galician===
In official Galician spelling the combination stands for the phoneme (palatal lateral approximant, a palatal counterpart of ).

===Spanish===

In Spanish, was considered from 1754 to 2010 the fourteenth letter of the Spanish alphabet because of its representation of a palatal lateral articulation consonant phoneme (as defined by the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language).
* This single letter was called pronounced &quot;elye&quot;, but often losing the /l/ sound and simplifying to &quot;eh-ye&quot;.
* The letter was collated after as a separate entry from 1803 until April 1994 when the X Congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies adopted standard Latin alphabet collation rules. Since then, the digraph has been considered a sequence of two characters. (A similar situation occurred with the Spanish-language digraph ch.)
* Hypercorrection leads some to wrongly capitalize as a single letter, as with the Dutch IJ, for example * instead of . In handwriting, is written as a ligature of two s, with distinct uppercase and lowercase forms.
* Today, most Spanish speakers pronounce and as the same sound, a phenomenon called yeísmo. In much of the Spanish-speaking Americas, and in many regions of Spain, and are pronounced (voiced palatal fricative); speakers in Colombia and Tabasco, Mexico, as well as Rioplatense speakers in both Argentina and Uruguay, pronounce and as (voiced postalveolar fricative) or (voiceless postalveolar fricative). The original pronunciation of —the phoneme (palatal lateral approximant)— still exists in northern Spain (mostly in rural areas) and in Andes Mountains. In parts of Colombia and in the Andean regions of Ecuador, is pronounced but is pronounced .

==Philippine languages==
While Philippine languages like Tagalog and Ilocano write or when spelling Spanish loanwords, still survives in proper nouns. However, the pronunciation of is simply rather than . Hence the surnames &quot;Llamzon&quot;, &quot;Llamas&quot;, &quot;Padilla&quot;, &quot;Bellen&quot;, &quot;Basallote&quot; and &quot;Villanueva&quot; are respectively pronounced /, , , , and /.

Furthermore, in Ilocano represents a geminate alveolar lateral approximant , like in Italian.

==Albanian==
In Albanian, stands for the sound , while is pronounced as the &quot;velarized&quot; sound .

==Icelandic==
In Icelandic, the can represent (similar to a voiceless alveolar lateral affricate), or depending on which letters surround it. appears in (&quot;full&quot;, masculine), appears in (&quot;full&quot;, neuter), and appears in (&quot;full&quot;, neuter genitive). The geographical name Eyjafjallajökull includes the sound twice.

===Broken L===
In Old Icelandic, the broken L ligature appears in some instances, such as (field) and (all). It takes the form of a lowercase with the top half shifted to the left, connected to the lower half with a thin horizontal stroke. This ligature is encoded in the Latin Extended-D Unicode block at U+A746 (uppercase) and U+A747 (lowercase), displaying as Ꝇ and ꝇ respectively.

==Inuit-Yupik languages==

In Central Alaskan Yupʼik and the Greenlandic language, stands for .

==Other languages==
In the Gwoyeu Romatzyh romanization of Mandarin Chinese, final indicates a falling tone on a syllable ending in , which is otherwise spelled .

In Haida (Bringhurst orthography), is glottalized .

<text>Civil Defence centres are administration, communication and logistics command centres built in the United Kingdom by the British Government for use in the event of war or serious emergency. During World War II they were often called [[Air Raid Precautions|Air Raid Precautions (ARP) centres]]. During the Cold War they were also called controls or emergency centres, or popularly [[nuclear bunker]]s.

They should not be confused with air raid shelters or fallout shelters.

<text>During the Cold War every London Borough was obliged to have a Civil Defence centre. These were controversial structures as it was widely believed that planning for the aftermath of nuclear war was both expensive and pointless.

The area of London (extending outwards to the then boundary of the Metropolitan Police District and thus including some areas outside the modern Greater London) was designated Region 5 and had its regional seat of government in a re-used radar station at Kelvedon Hatch in Essex. Below this level it was split into five groups – North, North East, North West, South East and South West. Each group had a control centre. Below this each borough had one as well.

<text>Reading School is a state grammar school for boys with academy status in the English town of Reading, the county of Berkshire. It traces its history back to the school of Reading Abbey and is, thus, one of the oldest schools in England, although it closed for a few years in the 1860s. It is a state boarding school. There are no tuition fees for day pupils, and boarders only pay for food and lodging. Reading is one of the best state schools in the UK according to the GCSE and A-level tables and has consistently ranked in the top ten.

==History==

Reading School was founded as part of Reading Abbey. The date of the Abbey&#x27;s charter, 29 March 1125, is taken as the foundation date, despite the closure of the school in the 1860s. This date makes it the 10th oldest school in England, although there are hints that there may have been a school running in Reading before this.

In 1486, the school was refounded as a &quot;Free Grammar School&quot; (&quot;free&quot; here meaning teaching the free, or liberal, arts, not that no fees were paid) by Henry VII on the urging of the then Abbot, John Thorne. From at least this time, the School was housed in the former Hospitium of St John. The main building of the hospitium still exists, but the refectory, which once housed the schoolroom, was demolished in 1785 and Reading Town Hall now stands on the site.

After the dissolution of Reading Abbey in 1539, the school fell under the control of the corporation of Reading, its status being confirmed by Letters Patent issued by Henry VIII in 1541. This was reconfirmed in the royal charter granted to the Corporation of Reading by Elizabeth I in 1560, which made the corporation liable for the salary of the headmaster and gave them the power of appointing him.

There were interruptions to schooling in 1665, when Parliament, forced out of London by the Great Plague, took over the schoolhouse. The English Civil War also interrupted, with the school being used as a garrison by royalist forces. The school prospered at the start of the nineteenth century; in 1830, when Richard Valpy retired from the post of headmaster, there were 120 pupils. By 1866 disagreements between the town and school and problems with the lease on the school buildings had led to falling numbers. The school closed in the 1860s.


The school re-opened, however, with the (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 5) setting out its administration and funding. The foundation stone for new buildings in Erleigh Road, designed by Alfred Waterhouse (who also designed the Natural History Museum, London), was laid by the Prince of Wales Edward VII in 1870, and in 1871 the school moved in. In 1915 Kendrick Boys&#x27; School (founded in 1875 from the legacy of John Kendrick), which had a large endowment but poor facilities, was taken over by Reading, which was poorly funded but had excellent facilities – this caused considerable controversy at the time but was ultimately seen as successful.

The Education Act 1944 saw the abolition of fees (apart from boarding charges), with the cost of education now being met by the local authority. The 1960s saw the rise of comprehensive education in England and Wales, but Reading was exempted in 1973 (along with the girls&#x27; grammar school in Reading, Kendrick) after a petition of over 30,000 local people (a third of the voters of Reading) was handed to the government.

On 6 July 2007 Reading School was officially designated as the landing site for the Thames Valley and Chiltern Air Ambulance when it needs to transport patients to the nearby Royal Berkshire Hospital. Previously, seriously injured or ill patients from the Reading area had to be flown either to Wexham Park Hospital near Slough, or to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for treatment. The new arrangement means that the school field can now be used for emergency touchdowns. Patients are transported by land ambulance from the school to the hospital&#x27;s accident and emergency department across the road. While this arrangement was only made official in 2007, the school field had been unofficially used on several occasions by the Thames Valley and Chiltern Air Ambulance in previous years.

The school became an academy in 2012.

In 2020, the school was found to have discriminated against a visually-impaired child by not making adjustments to enable him to take the eleven-plus entrance examination.

==School site==

, the Page building, the John Kendrick building, South House, Music School (formerly known as Junior School) and a chapel. The main school building, the chapel, South House and the building to the east of South House have all been designated as Grade II listed buildings by English Heritage.

The chapel is where the school&#x27;s Christmas, Remembrance and Easter services take place, and every student attends once a week. The chapel has four groups of pews, facing towards the central aisle. Above the entrance is the organ, and at the far end is the altar and vestry.

Plans have been developed for improved sports and science facilities as part of the &quot;1125 campaign&quot;. Work on improving science facilities began in 2015 and was completed in Spring 2017 as stated above. Work on the new sports facilities has begun, with a new fitness suite made on the location of the old squash courts next to chapel, and refurbishments on the gym and changing rooms completed. Work to refurbish the Physics block began in 2022, finishing with an official reopening in early 2023.

=== International sites ===

The school established a subsidiary in 2018 to participate in its cooperation with Lunhua Education and Lujiazui Corporation to establish international schools with &quot;fusion&quot; curricula called Suzhou Reading School in China. The first school, located on plot 2 in the town of Xushuguan in Suzhou New District, was planned to have a site area of 35,100 and construction area of 50,772 m2. However, according to a report from Phoenix New Media, after completing construction in 2021, Reading School lost its license to operate there after failing its environmental assessment due to heavy soil pollution. The plot was reclassified as industrial land by the municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau in 2023.

== Sports ==
Reading School hold the boys&#x27; KS4 National Badminton Championship for the 2023/24 season. They also hold the U16 Boys&#x27; VICTOR School Sport Magazine National Badminton Championship for the 2023/24 season.

==Inspections and awards==
An OFSTED report concluded that &quot;examination results place the school in the top five per cent nationally&quot;, &quot;Pupils&#x27; attitudes to learning are outstanding&quot; and &quot;The school goes to exceptional lengths to broaden and enrich the education of all pupils&quot;. The 2005 Key Stage 3 results were both the best in the country for value-added and for the average points score of each student. 

In the 2004 school league tables for England (including fee-paying schools), it came eighth for GCSE-level results (average 602.5 points), 106th for A-level results (average 409.3 points) and 170th for value-added between ages 11 and 16 (score of 1037.7 compared with a baseline of 1000). It has recently become a DFES specialist school for the Humanities, specialising in English, Geography and Classics – the first school to specialise in Classics – despite entry being selected by Mathematics and verbal and non-verbal logic ability.

In 2005 the school was awarded the Sportsmark gold award for a four-year period. In the same year Reading was one of just 35 schools nationally to be made a Microsoft Partner School.

In 2007, the school was identified by the Sutton Trust as one of only 20 state schools among the 100 schools in the UK responsible for a third of admissions to Oxford and Cambridge Universities over the five preceding years. 16.0% of pupils went to Oxbridge and a 62.1% in total went to universities identified by the Sutton Trust as &quot;top universities&quot;.
In July 2011, the school was further identified by the Sutton Trust as the third highest state school, and among the top 30 schools in the country, for proportion of higher education applicants accepted at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The report found that 16.7% of pupils were accepted to Oxbridge and 81.5% were accepted to the highly selective Sutton Trust 30 universities over the previous three years.

Reading School was given the &quot;State School of the Year&quot; award by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in 2010 and 2019, in recognition of the school&#x27;s academic achievements and community orientated ethos.

==Subjects taught== 
1. French, German, Spanish and Latin are compulsory in Year 7, while Mandarin can be chosen to replace a language except Latin. In Year 8 students must take 2 modern languages and Latin.

2. At least one ancient or modern language must be taken for the GCSEs.

3. Additional Maths is taken by the top four sets at the same time as their GCSEs. Further Maths is optional at A Level, with some students being able to take it in one block with Maths.

4. The top half of the year take an externally-assessed AS-level Philosophy exam at the end of Year 11. Those who score a B or higher can either opt-out of the subject, continue onto the A2 or redo the exam the following year. Those who didn&#x27;t score a B or higher can redo the exam the following year.

5. In the sixth form, P.E. can optionally be taken as an examined A-Level. Those that do not do this must still take part in games weekly, though this is not examined or graded in any way, or must take part in Community Service during Games lessons. In Years 10 and 11, certain students are given the option of taking the GCSE as an additional subject. All students must complete Games lessons.

6. Not examined.

<doc id="370201" wikidata="Q3101810" url="?curid=370201" title="George Oppen">
<text>George Oppen (April 24, 1908 – July 7, 1984) was an American poet, best known as one of the members of the Objectivist group of poets. He abandoned poetry in the 1930s for political activism and moved to Mexico in 1950 to avoid the attentions of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He returned to poetry—and to the United States—in 1958, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1969.

==Early life==
Oppen was born in New Rochelle, New York, into a Jewish family. His father, a successful diamond merchant, was George August Oppenheimer (b. Apr. 13, 1881), his mother Elsie Rothfeld. His father changed the family name to Oppen in 1927. Oppen&#x27;s childhood was one of considerable affluence; the family was well-tended to by servants and maids and Oppen enjoyed all the benefits of a wealthy upbringing: horse riding, expensive automobiles, frequent trips to Europe. But his mother committed suicide when he was four, his father remarried three years later and the boy and his stepmother, Seville Shainwald, apparently could not get along. Oppen developed a skill for sailing at a young age and the seascapes around his childhood home left a mark on his later poetry. He was taught carpentry by the family butler; Oppen, as an adult, found work as a carpenter and cabinetmaker.

In 1917, the family moved to San Francisco where Oppen attended Warren Military Academy. It is speculated that during this time Oppen&#x27;s early traumas led to fighting and drinking, so that, while reaching maturity, Oppen was also experiencing a personal crisis. By 1925, this period of personal and psychic transition culminated in a serious car wreck in which George was driver and a young passenger was killed. Ultimately, Oppen was expelled from high school just before he graduated. After this period, he traveled to England and Scotland by himself, visiting his stepmother&#x27;s relative, and attending lectures by C.A. Mace, professor in philosophy at St. Andrews.

In 1926, Oppen started attending Oregon State University. There he met Mary Colby, a fiercely independent young woman from Grants Pass, Oregon in a poetry class. Hearing Carl Sandburg read his poem &quot;Fog&quot; on campus, they took up poetry themselves. On their first date, the couple stayed out all night with the result that she was expelled and he suspended. They left Oregon, married, and started hitch-hiking across the country working at odd jobs along the way. Mary documents these events in her memoir, &quot;Meaning A Life: An Autobiography&quot; (1978).

==Early writing==
While living on the road, Oppen began writing poems and publishing in local magazines. In 1929 and 1930 he and Mary spent some time in New York, where they met Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, musician Tibor Serly, and designer Russel Wright, among others.

In 1929, George came into a small inheritance and relative financial independence. In 1930 George and Mary moved to California and then to France, where, thanks to their financial input, they were able to establish &quot;To Publishers&quot; and act as printer/publishers with Zukofsky as editor. The short-lived publishing venture managed to launch works by William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound. Oppen had begun working on poems for what was to be his first book, &quot;Discrete Series&quot;, a seminal work in early Objectivist history. Some of these appeared in the February 1931 Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; and the subsequent &quot;An &quot;Objectivist&#x27;s&quot; Anthology&quot; published in 1932.

==Oppen the Objectivist==

In 1933, the Oppens returned to New York. George Oppen, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky and Charles Reznikoff set up the Objectivist Press. The press published books by Reznikoff and Williams, as well as Oppen&#x27;s first book &quot;Discrete Series&quot;, which included a preface by Ezra Pound.

==Politics and war==
Faced with the effects of the Depression and the rise of fascism, the Oppens were becoming increasingly involved in political action. Unable to bring himself to write verse propaganda, Oppen abandoned poetry and joined the Communist Party USA, serving as election campaign manager for Brooklyn in 1936, and helping organize the Utica New York Milk Strike. He and Mary were engaged and active in the cause of worker&#x27;s rights, and Oppen was tried and acquitted on a charge of felonious assault on the police.

By 1942, Oppen was deferred from military service while working in the defense industry. Disillusioned by the CPUSA and willing to assist in the fight against fascism, Oppen quit his job, making himself eligible for the draft. Effectively volunteering for duty, Oppen saw active service on the Maginot Line and the Ardennes; he was seriously wounded near Bad Urach Germany. Shortly after Oppen was wounded, Oppen&#x27;s division helped liberate the concentration camp at Landsberg am Lech. He was awarded the Purple Heart and returned to New York in 1946.

==Mexico==

After the war, Oppen worked as a carpenter and cabinet maker. Although now less politically active, the Oppens were aware that their pasts were certain to attract the attention of Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s Senate committee and decided to move to Mexico. During these admittedly bitter years in Mexico, George ran a small furniture making business and was involved in an expatriate intellectual community. They were also kept under surveillance by the Mexican authorities in association with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They were able to re-enter the United States in 1958 when the United States government again allowed them to obtain passports which had been revoked since 1950.

==Return to poetry==
In 1958, the Oppens considered becoming involved in Mexican real estate if their expatriate status was to continue. But they were contemplating a move back to the United States, which caused both of them considerable anxiety, prompting Mary to see a therapist. During one of her visits, George told the therapist about a dream he was having (the Oppens later referred to this incident as the &quot;rust in copper&quot; dream). The therapist persuaded George that the dream had a hidden meaning that would convince Oppen to begin writing poetry again. But Oppen also suggested other factors led to his return to the US and to poetry, including his daughter&#x27;s well-being, because she was beginning college at Sarah Lawrence. 

After a brief trip in 1958 to visit their daughter at university, the Oppens moved to Brooklyn, New York, in early 1960 (although for awhile, returning to Mexico regularly for visits). Back in Brooklyn, Oppen renewed old ties with Louis Zukofksy and Charles Reznikoff and also befriended many younger poets. The poems came in a flurry; within two years Oppen had assembled enough poems for a book and began publishing the poems in &quot;Poetry&quot;, where he had first published, and in his half-sister June Oppen Degnan&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Review&quot;.
 The poems of Oppen&#x27;s first book following his return to poetry, &quot;The Materials&quot;, were poems that, as he told his sister June, should have been written ten years earlier. Oppen published two more collections of poetry during the 1960s, &quot;This In Which&quot; (1965) and &quot;Of Being Numerous&quot; (1968), the latter earning him the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1969.

==Last years==
In 1975, Oppen was able to complete and see into publication his &quot;Collected Poems,&quot; together with a new section &quot;Myth of the Blaze.&quot; In 1977, Mary provided the secretarial help George needed to complete his final volume of poetry &quot;Primitive&quot;. During this time, George&#x27;s final illness, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, began to manifest itself with confusion, failing memory, and other losses. The disease was eventually to make it impossible for him to continue writing. George Oppen, age 76, died of pneumonia with complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in a convalescent home in California on July 7, 1984.

<text>Foundever (previously known as Sitel and Sykes) is a privately owned customer experience 
technology company headquartered in Luxembourg City. It provides outsourced sales, technical support, customer service, and other business processes for large companies. The company has 170,001 employees and $4 billion in revenue.

Foundever started as a subsidiary of United Technologies before being bought by then-President James Lynch in 1985. It grew quickly and became the first telemarketing organization to go public in 1995. It expanded internationally in the 1990s and 2000s. Financial problems prompted layoffs and restructuring in 2001. In 2007, majority owner Onex Corporation de-listed Sitel from NASDAQ. Groupe Acticall SAS, the current owner and operator, acquired Sitel in 2015. As off December 2024 the company laid off a significant number of employees as a result of flawed financial planning and client loss.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Foundever started as a subsidiary of United Technologies called HQ800 and located in Omaha, Nebraska. Its then-President, James F. Lynch, bought the company for $165,000 in 1985. He renamed it &quot;SITEL/Sitel,&quot; which stands for &quot;System International TELemarketing.&quot; At the time, SITEL had about $100 million in annual revenue and 16 employees.

Sitel was listed on NASDAQ in 1995. Afterwards, it expanded internationally by opening new offices and acquiring other call center companies abroad. For example, in 1996 Sitel acquired London-based telemarketing company Mitre PLC for $230 million. Simultaneously, Sitel announced it bought a 69.2 percent interest in Teleaction, a Spanish-focused telemarketing company, for about $24 million. That same year, Sitel acquired Canadian Telephone Corporation.

In the 1990s, Sitel grew about twelve-fold to $600 million in revenues. Sitel had 24,000 employees and 70 call centers but was struggling to turn a profit. It had substantial debt from the cost of acquisitions and expenses related to closing unprofitable call centers it had acquired. In 2001, Sitel was restructured to reduce taxes and hundreds of middle-management positions were cut.

=== Ownership changes ===
By 2005, Sitel had $1 billion in annual revenue. The majority owner of Sitel Group, Onex Corporation, bought-out shareholders for $450 million in 2007, taking Sitel off NASDAQ and making it a privately-owned company. Sitel was merged with Onex Corporation&#x27;s subsidiary ClientLogic Corporation. Onex paid an additional $51 million in 2008 and $60 million in 2014 to buy preferred shares, bringing its ownership of Sitel to 86 percent.

France-based Group Acticall, which was founded in 1995 by Laurent Uberti and Olivier Camino, acquired Sitel in 2015, valuing the company at $850 million.

In June 2021, Sitel acquired a public customer service company Sykes Enterprises for $2.2 billion. In March 2023, Sitel and Sykes fully merged to form Foundever.

===2022 data breach ===

Okta, a large identity and access management company, had a security breach in early 2022 that it blamed on Sykes, one of many companies which provides customer support services for Okta. Documents leaked in May 2022 raised serious questions about Sitel/Sykes&#x27; security defenses, and gaps in Okta&#x27;s response to being notified of the security breach by Sitel.

==Products and services==
Foundever provides out-sourced call center services, as well as consulting, analytics, and support for other business processes. The company operates out of large buildings with employees that speak different languages. Its call centers are used for things like sales, customer service, collections, and back-office work. For example, employees might take a phone order for a consumer product or troubleshoot problems with a bank account. It also operates sub-brands for things like training and IT software. It also develops customer service chatbots.

Initially, Sitel primarily did sales calls for insurance and credit card companies. It started specializing in different industries and services in 1990. Sitel started doing inbound calls in 1990 tech support in 1997 and customer relationship management in 2001.

<doc id="370203" wikidata="Q4677090" url="?curid=370203" title="Always Coming Home">
<text>Always Coming Home is a 1985 science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. It is in parts narrative, pseudo-textbook and pseudo-anthropologist&#x27;s record. It describes the life and society of the Kesh people, a cultural group who live in the distant future long after modern society has collapsed. It is presented by Pandora, who seems to be an anthropologist or ethnographer from the readers&#x27; contemporary culture, or a culture very close to it. Pandora describes the book as a protest against contemporary civilization, which the Kesh call &quot;the Sickness of Man&quot;.

==Setting==
The book&#x27;s setting is a time so post-apocalyptic that no cultural source can remember the apocalypse, though a few folk tales refer to our time. The only signs of our civilization that have lasted into their time are indestructible artefacts such as styrofoam and a self-manufacturing, self-maintaining, solar-system-wide computer network. There has been a great sea level rise since our time, flooding much of northern California, where the story takes place.

The Kesh use technological inventions of civilization such as writing, steel, guns, electricity, trains, and a computer network (see below). However, unlike one of their neighboring societies – the Dayao or Condor People – they do nothing on an industrial scale, reject governance, have no non-laboring caste, do not expand their population or territory, consider disbelief in what we consider “supernatural” absurd, and deplore human domination of the natural environment. Their culture blends millennia of human economic culture by combining aspects of hunter-gatherer, agricultural, and industrial societies, but rejects cities (literal “civilization”). In fact, what they call “towns” would count as villages for the reader – a dozen or a few-dozen multi-family or large family homes. What they call “war” is a minor skirmish over hunting territories, and is considered a ridiculous pastime for youngsters, since an adult person should not throw his life away.

Pandora observes that a key difference between the Kesh and the readers&#x27; [her?] society is the size of their population: &quot;There are not too many of them.&quot;. Their low population density means that they can feed themselves from their land. The Kesh maintain this low population without coercion, which would be antithetical to their loosely organized society. They carry a large accumulation of genetic damage, which leads to fewer successful pregnancies and higher infant mortality. They also have social taboos against multiple siblings and early pregnancies; a third child is considered shameful, and the Dayao&#x27;s practice of large families is referred to as &quot;incontinence&quot;. Abortions are practiced freely.

==Summary==
The book is divided into two parts: The first part consists mostly of Kesh texts and records of oral performances, interspersed with Pandora&#x27;s commentary, accounts of a few aspects of Kesh life, and personal essays. The longest text is a personal history narrated by a woman called &quot;Stone Telling&quot;. Stone Telling&#x27;s autobiography fills less than a third of the book, told in three sections with large gaps filled with other material. The second part, called &quot;The Back of the Book&quot;, contains a few Kesh texts but consists mostly of Pandora&#x27;s accounts of various aspects of Kesh life.

Stone Telling recounts how she spent her childhood with her mother&#x27;s people in the Valley, as a very young woman lived several years with her father&#x27;s people in The City, and escaped from it with her daughter, who was born there. The two societies are contrasted through her narrative: the Kesh are peaceable and self-organized, whereas the Condor people of The City are rigid, patriarchal, hierarchical, militaristic, and expansionist. During the lifetime of Stone Telling, both The City and the Valley change, and for a time one changes the other. There are traces of this arc in other parts of the book.

The next longest piece in the main part, in the section &quot;Eight Life Stories&quot;, is the novelette &quot;The Visionary&quot;, which was published as a stand-alone story in &quot;Omni&quot; in 1984. This part also includes history and legends, myths, plays, a chapter of a novel, and song lyrics and poetry. Some editions of the book were accompanied by a tape of Kesh music and poetry.

A number of these are attributed by Pandora to a Kesh woman named &quot;Little Bear Woman&quot;; these are:
* Shahugoten. &quot;As told by Little Bear Woman of Sinshan to the Editor&quot; pp. 57–59 [a legend]
* Coming Home to Up the Hill House. &quot;By Little Bear Woman&quot; p. 258 [a poem]
* The Writer to the Morning in Up the Hill House in Sinshan. &quot;By Little Bear Woman&quot; p. 258 [a poem]
* A Song to Up the Hill House in Sinshan. &quot;By Little Bear Woman&quot; p. 259 [a poem]
* Some of the paths around Sinshan Creek. A Kesh map of the watershed of Sinshan Creek, &quot;given to the Editor by Little Bear Woman&quot; of Sinshan.

&quot;The Back of the Book&quot;, about a fifth of the number of pages, presents cultural lore, with the format and attributions or annotations that an ethnographic fieldworker might make. It includes discussions of village layout and landscaping, family and professional guilds, recipes, medical care, yearly ritual dances, and language.

==Awards==
The novel received the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize and was a runner up for the National Book Awards.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
It has been noted that &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; underscores Le Guin&#x27;s long-standing anthropological interests. The Valley of the Na [River] is modeled on the landscape of California&#x27;s Napa Valley, where Le Guin spent her childhood when her family was not in Berkeley.

Like much of Le Guin&#x27;s work, &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; follows Native American themes. According to Richard Erlich, &quot;&quot;Always Coming Home&quot; is a fictional retelling of much in A. L. Kroeber&#x27;s [Ursula&#x27;s father] monumental &quot;Handbook of the Indians of California&quot;.&quot; There are also some elements retrieved from her mother&#x27;s &quot;The Inland Whale&quot; (Traditional narratives of Native California), such as the importance of the number nine, and the map of the Na Valley which looks like the Ancient Yurok World. There are also Taoist themes: the heyiya-if looks like the &quot;taijitu&quot;, and its hollow center (the &quot;hinge&quot;) is like the hub of the wheel as described in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. Le Guin had described herself &quot;as an unconsistent Taoist and a consistent un-Christian&quot;.

One of its earliest reviews, by Samuel R. Delany in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a slow, rich read... [Le Guin&#x27;s] most satisfying text among a set of texts that have provided much imaginative pleasure&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #82, and stated that &quot;Among many rich strangenesses it also includes a critique of its own improbabilities (as seen through twentieth-century eyes).&quot;

==Box set and soundtrack==
A box set edition of the book (), comes with an audiocassette entitled &quot;Music and Poetry of the Kesh&quot;, featuring 10 musical pieces and 3 poetry performances by Todd Barton. The book contains 100 original illustrations by Margaret Chodos. As of 2017, the soundtrack can be purchased separately in MP3 format (). A vinyl record was also released, together with a digital album for streaming and download in several formats. That combination sold out, but the digital album by itself remains available, and a second pressing of the vinyl, plus the digital, was scheduled to ship &quot;on or around 25 May 2018&quot;.

==Stage performance==
A stage version of &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; was mounted at Naropa University in 1993 (with Le Guin&#x27;s approval) by Ruth Davis-Fyer. Music for the production was composed and directed by Brian Mac Ian, although it was original music and not directly influenced by Todd Barton&#x27;s work.

==Influence==
John Scalzi, one-time president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, wrote, in his introduction to the 2016 edition, that he discovered the book as a teenager, and calls it &quot;a formative book...sunk deep in [his] bones&quot;, one to endlessly return to, always coming home.

<text>Randall Carlito Simon (born May 25, 1975) is a Curaçaoan former professional baseball first baseman. He has played all or parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), LVBP and one in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) between 1997 and 2006. Simon&#x27;s debut season came with the Atlanta Braves in 1997, for whom he played until 1999. He also played for the Detroit Tigers (2001–2002), Pittsburgh Pirates (2003, 2004), Chicago Cubs (2003), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2004), the NPB&#x27;s Orix Buffaloes (2005), Texas Rangers (2006) Philadelphia Phillies (2006–2007). He also played in the Northern League for the Gary SouthShore RailCats in 2010 and Rockford RiverHawks in 2011.

==Playing career==
Simon was born in Willemstad, Curaçao. Before signing with the Pirates, Simon signed with the Florida Marlins and New York Yankees in the 2000 season, but did not play in the majors for either franchise. In 2003, Simon was traded by Pittsburgh to the Chicago Cubs, where he had a productive postseason, helping the Cubs to the 2003 National League Championship Series. After the season, Simon was released by Chicago.

On February 19, 2004, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Simon as a free agent to secure the team at first base for the upcoming season. After several months into his second tenure with the Pirates, he was released on August 18, 2004. Simon said, &quot;I&#x27;m a fighter,&quot; Simon said. &quot;I promise you&#x27;re going to see me again. You don&#x27;t have to worry about that.&quot;

One day after his release from the Pirates, he was acquired by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. After less than a month with Tampa Bay he was released and signed with the Orix Buffaloes of the Japanese Pacific League.

Randall represented his country in the 2006 World Baseball Classic for Netherlands along with his fellow country man and old teammate Andruw Jones who he played with the Atlanta Braves.

In 2008, Simon played for the independent Newark Bears of the Atlantic League.

In 2009, Simon played in the World Baseball Classic on the team representing the Netherlands.

The Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks of the Northern League signed Simon to a contract for the 2009 season.

Simon played for the Truenos de Tijuana of the Northern Mexican League (Liga Norte de Mexico) in the 2011 season, which ended on July 17, 2011.

==Coaching career==
On March 4, 2024, Simon was hired by the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League to serve as an assistant batting coach.

==Sausage race incident==
On July 9, 2003, while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, during the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; &quot;Sausage Race,&quot; in which four contestants wearing sausage costumes have a footrace on the field, Simon leaned over the dugout railing and hit college student Mandy Block (in the Italian sausage costume) with a bat, causing her to fall into the path of another racer. His bat struck only the top padded part of the costume, well above her head position, causing her to lose her balance. Block suffered only a scraped knee. Simon was questioned by police and later fined $432.10 for disorderly conduct. MLB suspended him for three games and fined him $2,000. He issued an apology to Block and sent her the bat, autographed, from the incident. When Simon returned to Miller Park later that year as a member of the Chicago Cubs, he purchased Italian sausages for an entire section, and during the race, his teammates playfully held him back until all the sausages passed the dugout, while manager Dusty Baker guarded the bat rack.

Mandy Block, who Simon knocked down and by then known by her married name Mandy Wagner, stated in a 2021 interview that she found the incident &quot;hilarious&quot; and avoided most publicity related to it, feeling uncomfortable with the media narrative that she considered to be criminalizing Simon. Block received a complimentary trip for two persons to Curaçao, Simon&#x27;s home island, from the Curaçao Tourism Board; she traveled there with her mother in March 2004.

<text>Region Stockholm (&quot;Swedish: Region Stockholm&quot;) is the regional public body responsible for healthcare, public transport, and regional planning within Stockholm County, Sweden. Established on 1 January 2019, it replaced the former Stockholm County Council (&quot;Stockholms läns landsting&quot;) as part of a nationwide reform.
== History ==
When county councils (&quot;landsting&quot;) were established in 1863, Stockholm Municipality (&quot;Stockholms stad&quot;) was neither part of Stockholm County nor its county council. Instead, it operated as a separate entity managing its own county-related matters.

During the 20th century, the Greater Stockholm area emerged, as an integrated labour and housing market, increasing the need for regional coordination. A proposal for a &quot;Greater County Council&quot; (&quot;storlandsting&quot;) was introduced. In 1966, the Municipal Association for Regional Affairs of Stockholm City and County (&quot;Kommunalförbundet för Stockholms stads och läns regionala frågor&quot;) was established. By 1968, regional affairs of Stockholm Municipality were incorporated into Stockholm County, and in 1971, the Stockholm County Council (&quot;Stockholms läns landsting&quot;) was formed, encompassing the entire county with responsibility primarily for healthcare and public transport. Starting from 2019, Stockholm County Council was replaced by Region Stockholm, expanding its mandate to include regional development.

== Responsibilities ==

* Seven emergency hospitals, including Karolinska University Hospitals, Södersjukhuset, Danderyd Hospital, St. Göran&#x27;s Hospital, Södertälje Hospital and Norrtälje Hospital

* Specialist clinics and psychiatric care facilities
* &quot;Folktandvården&quot; Dental care services in Stockholm County

Region Stockholm is also involved in medical research and education in collaboration with local universities, particularly Karolinska Institute.

=== Public Transport ===
Region Stockholm oversees public transport in the county through its companies SL and Waxholmsbolaget.

The transport network includes:

* Stockholm Metro (&quot;Tunnelbana&quot;): Three lines with a total of 100 stations
* Commuter rail (&quot;Pendeltåg&quot;): Local mainline trains in Stockholm County
* Bus services covering the entire county
* Local and light rail systems: Tvärbanan, Nockebybanan, Lidingöbanan, Saltsjöbanan, Roslagsbanan and Spårväg City

<doc id="370208" wikidata="Q17101881" url="?curid=370208" title="Jedem das Seine">
<text>&quot;&quot; () is the literal German translation of the Latin phrase &quot;suum cuique&quot;, meaning &quot;to each his own&quot; or &quot;to each what he deserves&quot;.

During World War II the phrase was contemptuously used by the Nazis as a motto displayed over the entrance of Buchenwald concentration camp. This has resulted in use of the phrase being considered controversial in modern Germany.

== History ==
&quot;Jedem das Seine&quot; has been an idiomatic German expression for several centuries. For example, it is found in the works of Martin Luther and contemporaries.

It appears in the title of a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, &quot;Nur jedem das Seine&quot; (BWV 163), first performed at Weimar in 1715.

Some nineteenth-century comedies bear the title &quot;Jedem das Seine&quot;, including works by Johann Friedrich Rochlitz and Caroline Bernstein.

An ironic twist on the proverb, &quot;jedem das Seine, mir das Meiste&quot; (&quot;to each his own, to me the most&quot;), has been known in the reservoir of German idioms for a long time, including its inclusion in Carl Zuckmayer&#x27;s 1931 play &quot;The Captain of Köpenick&quot;.

In 1937, the Nazis constructed the Buchenwald concentration camp, 7 km from Weimar, Germany. The motto &quot;Jedem das Seine&quot; was placed in the camp&#x27;s main entrance gate. The gates were designed by Franz Ehrlich, a former student of the Bauhaus art school, who had been imprisoned in the camp because he was a communist.

== Controversies ==
Several modern advertising campaigns in the German language, including ads for Nokia, REWE grocery stores, Burger King, and Merkur Bank, have been marred by controversy after using the phrase &quot;Jedem das Seine&quot; or &quot;Jedem den Seinen&quot;.

An ExxonMobil ad campaign in January 2009 touted Tchibo coffee drinks at the company&#x27;s Esso stores with the slogan &quot;Jedem den Seinen!&quot;. The ads were withdrawn after protest from the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and a company spokesman said its advertising contractor had been unaware of the proverb&#x27;s association with Nazism.

In March 2009, a student group associated with the Christian Democratic Union used the slogan for an education campaign in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), but later withdrew it due to public outcry.

In May 2018, Peek &amp; Cloppenburg started a campaign using the motto and defended its use publicly after much criticism.

<text>Tales from Earthsea is a collection of fantasy stories and essays by American author Ursula K. Le Guin, published by Harcourt in 2001. It serves as an accompaniment to the five novels (1968 to 2001) of the Earthsea cycle, all set in the fictional archipelago Earthsea.

&quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; won the annual Endeavour Award, for the best book by a writer from the Pacific Northwest, and Locus Award, Best Collection, for speculative fiction collections.
Two of the five collected stories were previously published, &quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot; (1999) and &quot;Dragonfly&quot; (1998), and both had been nominated for annual awards.

==Contents==

* Foreword
* &quot;The Finder&quot;. The school of magic is established on Roke island.
* &quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot; (1999). The daughter of a witch and the son of a rich merchant love each other.
* &quot;The Bones of the Earth&quot;. Ogion the Silent helps his wizard master deal with an earthquake.
* &quot;On the High Marsh&quot;. A mysterious healer arrives in a remote village threatened by a livestock epidemic.
* &quot;Dragonfly&quot; (1998). This is a postscript to the novel &quot;Tehanu&quot;.
* &quot;A Description of Earthsea&quot; (reference material)

&quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot; was first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, October 1999. &quot;Dragonfly&quot; was first published in &quot;Legends&quot;, October 1998.

==Themes==

All of the stories reinterpret the world of Earthsea. In the original trilogy, Earthsea society in general and the practice of magic in particular are dominated by men. Women can only be witches, which is the despised lowest rank of the magical world, as expressed in the proverb &quot;Weak as women&#x27;s magic, wicked as women&#x27;s magic&quot;.

The &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; stories try to redress the balance. It is disclosed that the Roke school had been established by women who were later excluded from it; and that Ogion, Ged&#x27;s beloved tutor and mentor, had learned his magic from a master who had learned from an &quot;unauthorised&quot; woman mage. Other stories feature strong and assertive women who in various ways challenge male dominance.

<text>Lichtenfels is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Bayreuth and Bamberg.

==History==

In medieval times the Main river served as the border between the two main states possessing lands in this territory: the Bishopric of Bamberg, and the County of Andechs. The castle of Lichtenfels was property of Andechs, which later fell under the Duchy of Merania. In 1248 the Dukes of Merania became extinct, and the entire region was annexed by the clerical state of Bamberg. In 1803 the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, and the Bishopric of Bamberg fell to Bavaria.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Lichtenfels and Staffelstein.

==Geography==

The district is situated on both banks of the river Main in the hills of the Franconian Jura (&quot;Fränkische Alb&quot;).

==Coat of arms==
Yellow and blue were the colours of Andechs resp. Merania. The bishopric of Bamberg is symbolised by the heraldic lion of Bamberg. On the left side there are the orb and the crown of the Holy Roman Empire.

<doc id="370227" wikidata="Q551477" url="?curid=370227" title="Young Törless">
<text>Young Törless () is a 1966 German drama film directed by Volker Schlöndorff, adapted from the 1906 novel &quot;The Confusions of Young Törless&quot; by Robert Musil. It deals with the violent and sadistic tendencies of a group of boys at an Austrian military academy at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Thomas Törless (Mathieu Carrière) arrives at the academy and learns how Anselm von Basini (Marian Seidowsky) has been caught stealing by fellow student Reiting (Fred Dietz). Basini is obliged to become Reiting&#x27;s &quot;slave&quot;, bowing to Reiting&#x27;s sadistic rituals. Törless follows their relationship with intellectual interest but without emotional involvement.

Also partaking in these sessions is Beineberg (Bernd Tischer), with whom Törless visits Bozena (Barbara Steele), the local prostitute. Again, Törless is aloof and more intrigued than excited by the woman.

He is however very eager to understand imaginary numbers, which are mentioned in his maths lesson. The maths teacher is unwilling or unable to explain what these are, stating that in life, emotion is what rules everything – even mathematics.

After Basini is humiliated and suspended upside down in the school gym because of one of Reiting&#x27;s intrigues, Törless realises intellectually that the other boys are simply cruel. He seems no more or less emotionally moved by this than by the revelation that he cannot understand imaginary numbers. He decides that he does not want to partake in cruelty, so decides to leave the academy. His teachers think that he is too &quot;highly strung&quot; for his own good, and do not want him to stay anyway – they are part of the system which can allow such terrible things to be done to the weak and vulnerable.

At the end of the film, Törless is dismissed from the school and leaves with his mother, smiling.

==Cast==
* Mathieu Carrière – Thomas Törless
* Marian Seidowsky – Anselm von Basini
* Bernd Tischer – Beineberg
* Fred Dietz – Reiting
* Lotte Ledl – Gastwirtin / Innkeeper
* Jean Launay – Mathematiklehrer / Maths Teacher
* Barbara Steele – Bozena

==Music==
The film&#x27;s significance as a cultural artifact of German post-World War II introspection is enhanced by the fact that its haunting medieval-sounding score was written by Hans Werner Henze, the German modernist composer. Henze, who came of age during the war, was prominent enough in this introspection by virtue of his left-political activism in the arts to feel driven to expatriation from Germany. Hans Werner Henze later arranged a suite from the original score, which was entitled &quot;Fantasia for Strings&quot;.

==Release and awards==
&quot;Young Törless&quot; was screened on 9 May 1966 at the Cannes Film Festival. The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. It was also selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==In popular culture==
Footage from the film was used in the 2023 music video for the song &quot;The Lost Room&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys.
