<text>The Ross rifle is a straight-pull bolt action rifle chambered in .303 British that was produced in Canada from 1903 until 1918.

The Ross Mk.II (or &quot;model 1905&quot;) rifle was highly successful in target shooting before World War I, but the close chamber tolerances, lack of primary extraction and length made the Mk.III (or &quot;1910&quot;) Ross rifle unsuitable for the conditions of trench warfare, exacerbated by the often poor quality ammunition issued.

By 1916, the rifle had been withdrawn from front line service but continued to be used by many snipers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force until the end of the war due to its exceptional accuracy.

The Ross Rifle Co. made sporting rifles from early in its production, most notably chambered in .280 Ross, introduced in 1907. This cartridge is recorded as the first to achieve over muzzle velocity and the cartridge acquired a very considerable international reputation among target shooters and hunters.

==History==

During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), a minor diplomatic fight broke out between Canada and the United Kingdom, after the latter refused to license the Lee–Enfield SMLE design for production in Canada. Sir Charles Ross offered to finance the construction of a factory in Canada to produce his newly designed straight-pull rifle for Canadian service. This offer was accepted by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Ross was awarded his first contract in 1903 for 12,000 &quot;Mark I Ross&quot; rifles.

It is generally accepted that Ross&#x27; design was inspired by the straight-pull Austrian Mannlicher M1895 Rifle introduced into Austro-Hungarian service in the 1890s and used throughout World War I, and as secondary weapons into World War II. Ross&#x27; earliest rifles unmistakably borrowed a number of mechanical details directly from the Mannlicher which was a relatively new design at the time Ross was producing his first rifles in the late 1890s.

The operating principle of the straight-pull bolt action comprises a bolt &quot;sleeve&quot; to which the bolt lever or handle is attached. The sleeve is hollow and has spiral grooves or &quot;teeth&quot; cut into its inner surface in which slide corresponding projections or &quot;teeth&quot; on the outside of the bolt head or &quot;body&quot;. As the bolt lever and sleeve are moved, the bolt head is forced to rotate through about 90°, locking or unlocking it in the receiver of the rifle. The bolt handle and sleeve thus need only be pushed backwards or forwards to open or close the action of the rifle.

In conventional bolt-action rifles such as the Mauser, Mosin–Nagant or Lee–Enfield, the bolt is unlocked or locked by the raising or lowering of the bolt handle, before the bolt is drawn back and after it is pushed forward. The single motion required to open or close the bolt of a straight-pull-action rifle is theoretically faster and easier for soldiers to learn, thus perhaps offering a higher rate of fire. Unlike the Lee–Enfield, the bolt of the Ross rifle could be taken apart without special tools, although this was not necessarily an advantage as it encouraged unauthorized disassembly by soldiers.

==Service==
The first 1,000 rifles were given to the Royal North-West Mounted Police (RNWMP) for testing. Routine inspection before operational testing found 113 defects bad enough to warrant rejection. One of these was a poorly designed bolt lock that enabled the bolt to fall right out of the rifle. Another was poorly tempered component springs that were described as being as &quot;soft as copper&quot;. In 1906, the RNWMP reverted to their Model 1894 Winchesters and Lee–Metfords. The Ross rifle was modified to correct these faults and became the Mark II Ross (Model 05 (1905)). In 1907, the Mk II was modified to handle the higher pressure of newly designed .280 Ross, this variant was called Mk II**. The Model 10 (1910) was a completely new design, made to correct the shortcomings of the 1905. None of the major parts are interchangeable between the 1905 and the 1910 models.
Although the British were now encouraging standardization across the Empire on the Lee–Enfield, Canada stayed with the Ross. The Model 10 was the standard infantry weapon of the First Canadian Contingent of the Canadian Expeditionary Force when it first arrived in France in February 1915.
The shortcomings of the rifle were made apparent before the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915. Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry was the first unit to voice its objections about the rifle, the regiment replaced the Ross rifle with the more familiar and rugged Lee-Enfield and later persuaded the 3rd Division to switch to the Lee-Enfield. The rifle showed poor tolerance of dirt when used in field conditions, particularly the screw threads operating the bolt lugs, jamming the weapon open or closed; it also had problems when British-made ammunition was used, which was produced with lower tolerances than Canadian-made ammunition. Another part of the jamming problem came from the bolt&#x27;s outer face hitting the bolt stop, then deforming the thread shape. The bolt could also be disassembled for routine cleaning and inadvertently reassembled in a manner that would fail to lock but still allow a round to be fired, leading to serious injury or death of the operator as the bolt flew back into his face. However, reports of such incidents with regard to this specific failing were relatively minor. Still another deficiency was the tendency for an affixed bayonet to become dislodged and fall off during discharge of the rifle. Many Canadians of the First Contingent (now renamed the 1st Canadian Division) at Ypres purposefully retrieved Lee–Enfield rifles from fallen British soldiers to replace their own inferior Ross rifles. Lieutenant Chris Scriven of the 10th Battalion, CEF, commented that it sometimes took five men just to keep one rifle firing. Major T.V. Scudamore of the British Columbia Regiment, having been captured at Ypres after being wounded, wrote of the &quot;contemptible&quot; Ross rifle, &quot;Those in the front line with that rifle will never forget... what it is like to be charged by the flower of the German army... and be unable to fire a shot in return.&quot;

Complaints rapidly reached the rifle&#x27;s chief sponsor, the Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes. He nevertheless continued to believe in its strengths despite the professional opinion of Sir Edwin Alderson, the British Army officer who was commander of the First Canadian Division. The rifle became an element in political issues within Canada and between Canada and the British. Hughes responded to Alderson&#x27;s criticism by accusing Alderson of ignorance and copied the letter to many officers in the corps. The effect was to undermine confidence in Alderson and the rifle. Hughes also made accusations that Canadian officers were induced to produce adverse reports on the rifle. After negative reports regarding the rifle were published through the Ottawa &quot;Citizen&quot;, it became increasingly clear that his own claims before the House of Commons that all the faults of the rifle had been cured were patently false, and Hughes&#x27; defence of the rifle could no longer be supported by the Prime Minister.

In particular, the Ross was more accurate at long range than the SMLE, and this potentially overcame the serious problem British and Canadian troops had faced during the Boer War, with the accurate long-range fire from the 7×57mm Mauser chambered Mauser Model 1895 rifle. In all, approximately 420,000 Ross service rifles were produced, 342,040 of which were purchased by the British.

==Replacement==

Canadians retained the Ross even as additional contingents arrived in France. On 12 June 1915, the 1st Canadian Division replaced all its Ross rifles with Enfields. By the time of the Somme battles of July 1916, Sir Douglas Haig, the new Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, had ordered the replacement of all Ross rifles in the three Canadian Divisions by the Pattern 1914 Enfield, which was finally available in quantity. Hughes refused to accept that there were problems with the Ross, and it took the intervention of many influential people to persuade him otherwise. In November 1916, Hughes resigned after Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s decision to appoint a Minister of Overseas Forces. Ross rifles were then used in training roles, both in Canada and the UK, to free up more Lee–Enfields for the front. After the United States entered the war in 1917, Ross rifles were shipped to the U.S. for the same reasons, freeing up supplies of the M1903 Springfield rifle. Hughes&#x27; reputation was inevitably tarnished, but Sir Charles Ross had already made a considerable fortune from his rifle design and manufacturing contracts despite its reputation. At around the same time, the Dominion Rifle Factory (Quebec City) converted a number of Rosses into the Huot automatic rifle, under the guidance of designer Joseph Alphonse Huot. It was an effective design, feeding from a drum magazine, and cheaper than a Lewis Gun. Despite successful trials, it was never adopted for service.

==Military variants==
;Rifle, Ross Mk I
This was the first production military model Ross Rifle. The first few hundred were fitted with the full-length folding &quot;Sight, Ross Mk I.&quot; Before any were delivered, the sight was replaced with a shorter version graduated to 2,200 yards rather than 2,500 yards. Years later, this sight would be designated &quot;Sight, Ross Mk I*&quot;. Many weapons would have this replaced with the &quot;Sight, Ross Mk II&quot;, a curved sliding &quot;Lange Vizier&quot; type. The barrel was 28 inch long, and the fore-stock ended 4 inches short of the muzzle. The front band had a bayonet lug. The safety was a sliding flat plate on the back of the bolt handle operated by pushing a square button on the plate. The magazine cut-off was on the lower right of the magazine protruding through the stock, and pressing it down engaged the cut-off. The magazine cut-off release was inside the front of the trigger guard, and depressing it would disengage the cut-off. A large lever was on the right side which was used to depress the magazine follower for &quot;dump loading&quot; all five rounds at once. The weapon was a straight-pull cock-on-close design. There was a sliding trap in the butt-stock for cleaning tools. A total of 10,500 were manufactured. A number of the original 500 were re-purposed as training rifles and fitted with longer front barrel bands as used on later production Rifle, Ross Mk II. This was done so they could more easily endure the stress of constant bayonet practice.

;Carbine, Ross Mk I
The RNWMP purchased 1,000 shorter versions of the Ross Mk I. The main difference was the barrel length of 26 inches. The full stock of the rifle was retained, and the barrel projected only 2 inches past the forestock. As presented for inspection, the carbines used the shorter version of the Sight, Ross Mk I. However, at the inspector&#x27;s request, the weapons were delivered fitted with the Sight, Ross Mk II.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II
This designation was a 1909 re-designation of those Mk I rifles that had been fitted with the Sight, Ross Mk II.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II / Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk II
After various complaints had been received, the weapon was re-designed to address the issues. The 28 inch barrel length was retained, and the &quot;Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; was used. The most noticeable change was the replacement of the side-mounted magazine cut-off control and trigger-guard mounted cut-off release with a single hook shaped control inside the front trigger guard that performed both functions. The action was also changed to cock-on-open. The safety was similar to the earlier model&#x27;s, but the slider was more solid and inside the bolt handle, moved by pushing a round button on the back of the bolt handle. Changes were introduced in production without change in designation until the introduction of the &quot;Sight, Ross Mk III&quot; when the nomenclature of the earlier rifles was expanded to &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk II&quot;.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III
The &quot;Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; proved more fragile than desired, and it was replaced with a simpler version, the &quot;Sight, Ross Mk III&quot;. Instead of a curved bend to the slider, they employed a straight slider with curve-cut sides bent down. The official nomenclature for this model was &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot;. The 28 inch barrel was retained, the sight change being the difference. Further improvements would be introduced to production without changing the designation.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II*
In early 1909 it was decided to adapt the &quot;Rifle Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; for cadet use, doing full maintenance and upgrading components to later production changes. The &quot;Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; was retained, however. 5,800 weapons were so converted from late 1909 to mid 1910. The weapons were designated &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II*&quot;. This designation identified specific conversions of older weapons and did not reflect any changes to new production.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II**
Development of this weapon began in the spring of 1908, and the planned designation was &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk III&quot;. This model was intended as a major improvement over the previous &quot;Rifle, Ross Mark II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot;. The barrel length was extended to 30.5 inches, the rear hand-guard was simplified, the safety was replaced by a completely new flag-type safety, and the rear sight was changed to the third-party &quot;Sight, Sutherland Mk I&quot;. The magazine cut-off was dispensed with entirely. By the time it was ready to be produced in numbers, an even more radical design change was in the works to become the Mk III, and this model was designated &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II**&quot; instead. In May 1909, it was decided to convert some 500 of the &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II, with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot; to the new design for field trials. This was increased to 700. While these weapons were being trialed, production of the shorter &quot;Mk II&quot; continued, with some of the &quot;Mk II**&quot; changes being introduced. In 1911, the &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II**&quot; became the standard Canadian issue, and production began. Some 13,000 were newly manufactured before this model was superseded by the &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk III&quot; in 1912.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II3*
This rifle was an adaptation of the &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II&quot; to use the &quot;Sight, Sutherland Mk II&quot;. Some internal improvements were made as well. The original sliding button safety and the magazine cut-off were retained, along with the 28 inch barrel and the stylish older rear hand-guard. None of this model were newly manufactured. All were converted from &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot; or the later &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II4*&quot;. Some 26,000 were converted from 1910 to 1912. 20,000 were sold to the United States in Nov, 1917. In 1911, the shorter variants were replaced by the longer &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II**&quot; as standard Canadian issue.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II4*
This rifle was a simple upgrade of the last 4,000 manufactured &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot; to include the new larger extractor introduced with the Mk II**. The 28 inch barrel, stylish rear hand-guard, sliding button safety, and magazine cut-off were retained. They were completed in the early summer of 1910, then all 4,000 were immediately converted into the Rifle, Ross Mk II3*.

;Rifle, Ross Mk II5*
The last of the shorter (28 inch barrel) Mk II line would be produced using the &quot;Sight, Sutherland Mk I&quot; and simplified rear hand-guard of the Mk II**. The 28 inch barrel, sliding button safety, and magazine cut-off were retained. Starting in 1910, some 15,000 were manufactured. In 1911, the shorter variants were replaced by the longer Mk II** as standard Canadian issue.

;Rifle, Ross Mk III
For all practical purposes, the Mk III was an entirely new design. It incorporated the 30.5 inch barrel and flag safety of the Mk II**, taking that re-design much further. The internal double-stack magazine was replaced with an exposed single-stack magazine. The &quot;dump loading&quot; lever was gone, and a charger guide was added for loading with stripper clips. A magazine cut-off was employed, but the design that lowered the magazine shell was discarded and replaced by one that restricted the rearward travel of the bolt. The bolt-stop plunger was replaced by a flag lever with three positions (cut-off enabled, bolt release, cut-off disabled). The bolt was far sturdier and had multi-thread locking lugs. A new rear sight designated the &quot;Ross Battle Aperture&quot; was installed on the bridge of the receiver rather than on top of the barrel. World War I increased demand, and at least 235,540 were produced for Canadian forces.

;Rifle, Ross Mk IIIB
The British government chose to purchase a version of the Mk III with a far simpler rear sight known as the &quot;War Office Pattern Sight&quot;. The stock was also strengthened. Some 66,590 were produced.

A &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk III*&quot; may have existed, employing a strengthened action, new front barrel band, and different front sight. The one source mentioning it considers the designation dubious.

==Military name changes==
In 1907, &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; and &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot;.

In 1912, all military variants were redesignated as follows:
* &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk I&quot; and &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk I*&quot; became &quot;Rifle, G.P. Ross&quot; (G.P. meaning general purpose).
*&quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk II&quot; and &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II*&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Cadet, Ross&quot;.
* &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II with Sight, Ross Mk III&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Short, Ross Mk I&quot;.
* &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II3*&quot; and &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II5*&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Short, Ross Mk II&quot;.
* &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk II**&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Long, Ross Mk II&quot;.
* &quot;Rifle, Ross Mk III&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III&quot;.
In 1918, &quot;Rifle, G.P. Ross&quot;, &quot;Rifle, Cadet, Ross&quot;, &quot;Rifle, Short, Ross Mk I&quot;, and &quot;Rifle, Short, Ross Mk II&quot; became &quot;Rifle, Ross, .303&quot;, Cadet D.P.&quot; (D.P. meaning Drill Purpose).

==Sniper rifles==
Because of its long range accuracy, the Ross rifle continued in use among Allied snipers after it was withdrawn from normal front-line use in Europe. British snipers found the rifle accurate out to 600 yards and more, with only one inherent disadvantage: the Ross accepted only perfectly clean ammunition, totally free of mud and grit, or else it invariably jammed.

Two types of Mark III sniper rifles are identified by different telescopic sights. Five hundred rifles were fitted with 5.2× Warner &amp; Swasey Company Model 1913 prismatic telescopic sights manufactured in Cleveland, Ohio. Serial numbers for rifles manufactured in 1915 have a FK prefix; while those manufactured in 1917 have a LU prefix. Another 907 rifles were fitted with Winchester Repeating Arms Company A5 telescopic sights. Both telescopic sights were mounted offset so the iron sights were usable and the rifle could still be loaded from charging strips.

==Sporting variant==
Ross settled a gun factory in Hartford, Connecticut, with machinist J. A. Bennett, to produce a sporting rifle called Model 1897 Magazine Sporting Rifle a hinged hammer type rifle. By the same time, he made a commercial agreement with the famous gunmaker firm Charles William Lancaster, inventor of the oval bore, to be his exclusive UK agent.

Early 1900, he brought out the Model 1900 Sporter, still made in Bennett&#x27;s factory. This action used a coil spring to activate the firing pin, instead of the hinged-hammer of the M1897. Very few of these sporting rifles are known to exist. The militarized Pattern 1900 was also the first to be offered for trial to Canada.

Following was Model 1903 Sporter some of these rifles were made in Hartford, Connecticut, but most (200 units, made from spare parts) were assembled at the brand new fabricating plant in Quebec City. Some of the Pattern 1903 Sporting Rifles were made in the .370 Express calibre, while some prototype chambered for .450/.500 Nitro is known to exist. Models .303 Brit. are common, .256 Mannlicher rare, and .370 Express are rare.

Some sporterised M1905 (Mk II) military rifles were made available to general public in 1906. This model was called Model M. In 1907, Ross brought out the Model E, his first entirely Canadian-made rifle, based on the 1905 military action, chambered for .303 British and .35 WCF. Following was Model R, which was a plain looking rifle, no checkering, in .303 British only. In November 1906, Ross while in the process of developing a new and very powerful .280 caliber sporting cartridge, made some experimental tests with a necked-down version of the new .30-06 Springfield case which he called the .28-1906 (one rifle is known to exist). This led to the design of the .280 Ross. The new high-pressure round required some strengthening of the bolt and action receiver, but the rifle was otherwise only slightly different from the .303 Mark II. This design, called MK II**, was a transitional step between Mk II and Mk III actions.

*Model M (1905 Mk II action); .303 Brit
*Model R (1905 Mk II action); .303 Brit.
*Model E (1907 Mk II** action heavy barrel); .303 Brit., 35 WCF
*Model 1907 &#x27;Scotch Deer Stalking Pattern&#x27;; .280 Ross 

Model 1910 (Mk III) was made with a totally different bolt head; instead of having the solid bolt lugs travel in a vertical position and lock in a horizontal position, like for the Mk II and Mk II** (see illustration), Ross turned it 90 degrees so it travels in a horizontal position and locks vertically. Then, he used screw threads on the lugs outside which are locking into the matching threaded receiver. Some very scarce Mk II** with the same threaded lugs and receiver are known to exist. He also used the same shape of heavy barrel as used on the Mk II**. The M-10, in .280 Ross, is considered by many as being the finest rifle ever made by the Ross Rifle Co.

*Model R-10; .303 Brit.

Model E-10; .303 Brit and .35 WCF

Model M-10; .280 Ross

1912 saw the introduction of the .22 rimfire sporting rifle. While using a simpler mechanism, it was still a straight-pull action. This model was very popular in Canada.
*Model 1912 Cadet Commercial.
*Model 1912 Cadet &quot;Leftover&quot; (no serial numbers or any other markings)

The problems with the Ross in combat were that it was really a sporting design of rifle asked to do the work of a military rifle under trench warfare conditions. However, as a sporting rifle, the Ross became quite popular after the war. The new .280 Ross cartridge gained it a fine reputation for medium-sized game, and for a time after 1918 it was a fairly common rifle on safari. It also proved itself as being an outstanding Match Rifle, building a strong reputation for accuracy.

;Match rifles
Ross Mark II** Commercial Target Model in .303 British, with a heavy barrel, was a real success in the Match Ranges from 1908 to 1913. This rifle was looking like the military Mk II**, using the same bolt, except having the sight bridge mounted on the receiver. A scarce Presentation Target Rifle was also available. Unlike its military counterpart, it had the serial number stamped on the barrel.

Model 1907 and 1905/1910 Match Target Rifle These very important single-shot rifles (two rifles are known to exist) are bearing special feature that would make the M1910 so different; the threaded locking lugs and receiver.

Military Match Target Rifle unlike the military Mk III this rifle was using a box type magazine with flat floorplate. It was using the Ross Mk III military sight modified to fit the .280 Ross ammunitions. Barrel was 26 inches long.

==Developments==
After the rejection of the Ross as a battlefield rifle, the Dominion Rifle Factory adapted the action to a light machinegun, the Huot, using surplus rifles. These were cheaper than the Lewis guns then in use. They were subjected to extensive trials, but the war ended before they entered service.

==Other users==
British Coast guard units in Ireland were armed with Ross rifles during 1920 to 1921.

After the First World War, the British Empire supplied several models of .303 cal rifles, including Rosses to Estonia, Latvia and White Russian anti-communist forces. In the course of gaining control of the country, the Soviets captured large numbers of non Soviet origin rifles. In the 1930s Stalin approved aid shipments to the Spanish Civil War Republicans, disposals actually, of American Winchester Muskets, German Mauser 98s, British Lee Enfields, Austrian Mannlichers, and several French types. One shipment from the Baltic Sea port of Memel on 6 Nov 1936, included 18,000-odd Pattern &#x27;14s and 2310 Canadian .303 M10 Rosses. Reports suggest few of donated rifles were militarily effective due to insufficient ammunition supplies.

Ross rifles were issued once again in the Second World War. The Mark 3 Ross rifle was supplied to the Royal Canadian Navy, the Veteran&#x27;s Guard of Canada, coastal defence units, training depots, the British Home Guard, Metropolitan Police, London Fire Brigade, Port of London Authority Police and the Soviets.

Ross Rifles were collected hurriedly from stocks held in the Shetland Islands in May 1942 to re-equip the survivors of Operation Fritham in Spitsbergen who had lost everything when their ship was sunk. The Ross rifles and equipment being delivered by Catalina 210/P captained by Flying Officer Tim Healy.

In the 1950s straight-pull Rosses were well known in European sport shooting for biathlon and running deer disciplines. During the World Shooting Championships in Moscow, visiting shooters were allowed to sign for Ross rifles converted to 7.62x54R to try out the competitions. Before biathlon switched to .22LR rifles, it was fired with full-bore cartridge rifles. While various models of Swedish Carl-Gustav rifle were popular, Soviet biathletes had success with Ross rifles outfitted with slings, target sights and 3-position stocks.

In 1967, , grandson of the founder Konrad and son of Emil, who was a businessman, became managing director of the company. As alpine recreation rapidly expanded around the world during the last half of the 20th century, Artur led and established the Vorarlberg cable car company as the world leader. In 1996, Doppelmayr Holding AG acquired Von Roll Seilbahnen AG, a Swiss manufacturer of gondola lifts, chairlifts, and cable cars. In 2002, Doppelmayr acquired CWA, a Swiss maker of gondola and cable car cabins. The merger of Doppelmayr and Garaventa was announced in 2001 and completed in 2002. In 2016 they broke two world records in Vietnam: Called the Ha Long Queen Cable Car, the largest cable car cabins (produced by Swiss company CWA) travel on the tallest ropeway support of the world. In 2017, produced by Garaventa and CWA, the steepest funicular railway came into effect in Stoos, Switzerland.

== Divisions ==
Doppelmayr Garaventa Group operates subsidiaries in 50 countries manufacturing ropeways under the Doppelmayr and Garaventa brands. Seven of these are responsible for manufacturing parts, namely Doppelmayr Seilbahnen GmbH (Austria), Garaventa AG (Switzerland), Doppelmayr Canada Ltd., Sanhe Doppelmayr Transport Systems Co., Ltd. (China), Doppelmayr France SAS, Doppelmayr Italia Srl, and Doppelmayr USA, Inc.

The company&#x27;s core ropeway products include cable cars, funiculars, gondola lifts, detachable chairlifts, fixed grip chairlifts, and surface lifts. The company developed the &quot;3S&quot; tricable gondola lift, having acquired the technology from Von Roll Seilbahnen, and built lifts including those located in Kitzbühel (Austria), Koblenz (Germany) and Whistler-Blackcomb (Canada). 
=== Doppelmayr Cable Car ===

Doppelmayr Cable Car GmbH manufactures automated people movers. Their main product is the rope-propelled Cable Liner system, used in airports, city centres, intermodal passenger transport connections, park and ride facilities, campuses, resorts, and amusement parks. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, having been established by Doppelmayr in 1996. Up until 2019, the subsidiary was referred to as DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car.

The first installation was completed at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas in 1999. In 2003, after the world&#x27;s first maglev transport system (opened in 1984 at Birmingham International Airport) fell into disrepair, DCC installed the &quot;AirRail Link&quot; to replace the maglev and temporary replacement bus-service that had been operating since 1995. The company is contracted to operate some of the systems it builds. A newer system is Luton DART, opened in March 2023.


=== Doppelmayr Transport Technology ===
Doppelmayr Transport Technology GmbH develops and sells material-handling ropeway systems. Initially, these systems were similar to cable cars and chairlifts designed for people, but fitted with specially designed carriers. In the early 2000s, Doppelmayr developed a cable-driven material-handling ropeway called RopeCon. RopeCon is a conveyor system that can transport materials over long distances with little ground disturbance. Such installations can be found in Papua New Guinea, Jamaica, Sudan, Switzerland, and Austria.

=== CWA Constructions ===
CWA Constructions SA of Olten, Switzerland, was acquired by Doppelmayr in 2001. The subsidiary manufactures cabins, such as gondola and people mover cabins, for most Doppelmayr Garaventa Group installations as well as for systems built by other manufacturers.

=== Frey AG Stans ===
Frey AG Stans was founded in 1966 and was acquired by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in April 2017. The subsidiary manufactures various electrical components and control systems for ropeways.

=== Gassner Stahlbau ===
Gassner Stahlbau GmbH is a subsidiary based in Bürs, Austria, that manufactures steel for pylons, chairs, and suspension, as well as various plastic parts. Gassner Stahlbau has manufactured parts for Doppelmayr since 1969, and was later acquired by Doppelmayr.

=== Input Projektentwicklungs GmbH ===
The Input Projektentwicklungs GmbH division produces mountain systems and amusement rides, such as the experimental Mountain Glider roller coaster in Walibi, Belgium. This project was plagued with problems and the ride was eventually removed.

=== Liftbyggarna ===
In December 2013, the company&#x27;s Swedish division, Doppelmayr Scandinavia AB, acquired Swedish lift manufacturer Liftbyggarna AB, which has retained its own separate branding. The company was originally founded in 1952.

=== LTW Intralogistics ===
LTW Intralogistics produces automated warehouse technology.

<text>In mathematics, a functional equation
 is, in the broadest meaning, an equation in which one or several functions appear as unknowns. So, differential equations and integral equations are functional equations. However, a more restricted meaning is often used, where a &quot;functional equation&quot; is an equation that relates several values of the same function. For example, the logarithm functions are essentially characterized by the &quot;logarithmic functional equation&quot; formula_1

If the domain of the unknown function is supposed to be the natural numbers, the function is generally viewed as a sequence, and, in this case, a functional equation (in the narrower meaning) is called a recurrence relation. Thus the term &quot;functional equation&quot; is used mainly for real functions and complex functions. Moreover a smoothness condition is often assumed for the solutions, since without such a condition, most functional equations have very irregular solutions. For example, the gamma function is a function that satisfies the functional equation formula_2 and the initial value formula_3 There are many functions that satisfy these conditions, but the gamma function is the unique one that is meromorphic in the whole complex plane, and logarithmically convex for real and positive (Bohr–Mollerup theorem).

==Examples==
*Recurrence relations can be seen as functional equations in functions over the integers or natural numbers, in which the differences between terms&#x27; indexes can be seen as an application of the shift operator. For example, the recurrence relation defining the Fibonacci numbers, formula_4, where formula_5 and formula_6

*formula_7, which characterizes the periodic functions

*formula_8, which characterizes the even functions, and likewise formula_9, which characterizes the odd functions

*formula_10, which characterizes the functional square roots of the function g

*formula_11 (Cauchy&#x27;s functional equation), satisfied by linear maps. The equation may, contingent on the axiom of choice, also have other pathological nonlinear solutions, whose existence can be proven with a Hamel basis for the real numbers
*formula_12 satisfied by all exponential functions. Like Cauchy&#x27;s additive functional equation, this too may have pathological, discontinuous solutions
*formula_13, satisfied by all logarithmic functions and, over coprime integer arguments, additive functions
*formula_14, satisfied by all power functions and, over coprime integer arguments, multiplicative functions
*formula_15 (quadratic equation or parallelogram law)
*formula_16 (Jensen&#x27;s functional equation)
*formula_17 (d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s functional equation)
*formula_18 (Abel equation)
*formula_19 (Schröder&#x27;s equation).
*formula_20 (Böttcher&#x27;s equation).
*formula_21 (Julia&#x27;s equation).
*formula_22 (Levi-Civita),
*formula_23 (sine addition formula and hyperbolic sine addition formula),
*formula_24 (cosine addition formula),
*formula_25 (hyperbolic cosine addition formula).
*The commutative and associative laws are functional equations. In its familiar form, the associative law is expressed by writing the binary operation in infix notation, formula_26 but if we write &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) instead of then the associative law looks more like a conventional functional equation, formula_27

* The functional equation formula_28 is satisfied by the Riemann zeta function, as proved here. The capital denotes the gamma function.

* The gamma function is the unique solution of the following system of three equations:
**formula_29
**formula_30
**formula_31(Euler&#x27;s reflection formula)
* The functional equation formula_32 where are integers satisfying formula_33, i.e. formula_34 = 1, defines to be a modular form of order .

One feature that all of the examples listed above have in common is that, in each case, two or more known functions (sometimes multiplication by a constant, sometimes addition of two variables, sometimes the identity function) are inside the argument of the unknown functions to be solved for.

When it comes to asking for &quot;all&quot; solutions, it may be the case that conditions from mathematical analysis should be applied; for example, in the case of the &quot;Cauchy equation&quot; mentioned above, the solutions that are continuous functions are the &#x27;reasonable&#x27; ones, while other solutions that are not likely to have practical application can be constructed (by using a Hamel basis for the real numbers as vector space over the rational numbers). The Bohr–Mollerup theorem is another well-known example.

===Involutions===

The involutions are characterized by the functional equation formula_35. These appear in Babbage&#x27;s functional equation (1820),
: formula_36

Other involutions, and solutions of the equation, include

*formula_37
*formula_38 and 
*formula_39
which includes the previous three as special cases or limits.

==Solution==
One method of solving elementary functional equations is substitution.

Some solutions to functional equations have exploited surjectivity, injectivity, oddness, and evenness.

Some functional equations have been solved with the use of ansatzes, mathematical induction.

Some classes of functional equations can be solved by computer-assisted techniques.

In dynamic programming a variety of successive approximation methods are used to solve Bellman&#x27;s functional equation, including methods based on fixed point iterations.

<text>Montafon ( in local dialect: &quot;Muntafu&quot;) is a 39 km long valley in the westernmost Austrian federal state of Vorarlberg. 

It is traversed by the river Ill (Vorarlberg) and extends from the city of Bludenz and the Verwall Alps in the north, to the Silvretta and Rätikon mountain range in the south. Piz Buin, at 3,312 meters, is the highest peak within the Silvretta mountain range and the highest peak in Vorarlberg. The Montafon region has a population of 16,421(2021).

== Geography ==

The Montafon is an association of ten communities (&quot;Stand Montafon&quot;), all of which belong to the Bludenz district. The main town is Schruns. Regional tourism is marketed by the Tourist Association Montafon, run by the municipalities, the Vorarlberger Illwerke and the regional mountain cableways.

The municipalities: 
* Bartholomäberg (1,100 m)
* Gaschurn (1,000m)
* Lorüns (583 m)
* St. Anton im Montafon (650 m)
* Sankt Gallenkirch (900m)
* Schruns (700 m)
* Silbertal (890 m)
* Stallehr (600 m)
* Tschagguns (700 m)
* Vandans (660 m) 
The route from Bludenz into the valley: The state road B188 leads past an old cement plant and through the town of Lorüns. Then one drives through the Alma woods and past the Tränabächle (Brook of Tears). The valley unfolds its full splendor beginning at St. Anton (in the local dialect: &quot;Santatöni&quot;) on the left, with Vens and Vandans on the right. St. Anton should not be confused with the more well-known ski resort of St. Anton am Arlberg.

Passing on to Rodund the main electrohydric plant of the Vorarlberger Illwerke comes into view. Continue on through Gantschier and Kaltenbrunnen to Schruns and Tschagguns (in the local dialect: &quot;Schru und Tschaggu&quot;). Above Schruns is the mountain town of Bartholomäberg, with its outlying areas Jetzmunt and Lutt overlooking St. Anton, and its southeastern precincts Kristberg and Innerberg overlooking the Silbertal Valley. This valley stretches southeast from Schruns towards the Arlberg mountain range, passing the outpost of the Fellamendli. The hamlet of Latschau, with its hydroelectric power station and the main base of the Golm ski resort, projecting up over Tschagguns, and opposite Bartholomäberg.

From Schruns and Tschagguns form the midpoint of the Montafon; this divides the outer valley (&quot;Außerfratte&quot;) from the inner valley (&quot;Innerfratte&quot;). Continuing up to St. Gallenkirch, the road branches off at Galgenul towards Gargellen, another rugged branch valley that ends at the ski resort of Gargellen. Continuing up the main Montafon valley, the road passes through Gortipohl and on to Gaschurn (in the local dialect: &quot;Gaschorra&quot;), then to Partenen. Here the road snakes up to the Silvretta mountain pass.
== Economy ==
The economy in the Montafon is dominated by a mixture of traditional rural activities like forestry, hydroelectric energy production, agricultural products, as well as tourism-related services and products.
=== Agriculture and Farming ===
Farming and agriculture are part of traditional Alpine transhumance. This is a three-phase seasonal droving of grazing livestock between the valleys in winter and the high mountain pastures in summer, ensuring a sufficient food supply for the cattle throughout the year. While tourism and other industries contribute more to the economy, seasonal migration to high pastures is still an important economic factor for parts of the population. In the autumn, if no animals have died and there have not been any accidents up in the mountains, the farmers decorate the cattle and bring them down from the mountain pastures in a festive parade, a highlight of regional culture.

=== Tourism ===

==== Sports ====

Tourism plays a vital role and the Montafon is well-known for its skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. The Silvretta high alpine road (German: Hochalpenstraße) gives access to remote ski areas that are located altitudes of 650 to 1,430 meters. The construction of the Montafon Railway in 1905 also helped develop the seasonal tourist industries.

There are five ski regions: Silvretta Montafon, Golm, Gargellen, Silbertal-Kristberg and Silvretta-Bielerhöhe, with a total of 60 ski lifts and 225 kilometers of ski slopes in the region. Freeriding is a popular sport and there are various fun parks with half-pipes. For cross-country skiing there are 121 kilometers of classic routes, as well as 33 kilometers of skating-routes.

Ski mountaineering has become more and more popular and can be pursued on every mountain in the Montafon.

During the summers and autumns the vast hiking trails along all of the mountain ranges are very popular, among locals and tourists alike. There are even trails that can be accessed via pushchairs (&quot;Muntafuner Gagla Weg“). Nine of the ski lifts are also open during the summer and autumn seasons and allow for quick and convenient ascents or descents in the mountains. All hiking and biking trails are well-marked. Many areas are protected and biking is not always allowed. 26 alpine huts are open during the summer, and special buses for hikers operate in the area.

Mountain hiking and climbing are possible on a great variety of trails, with a broad range of difficulties. For beginners, there are eight climbing parks and 15 fixed rope routes.

There are also two 9-hole golf courses in Tschagguns and in Partenen.
==== Annual events ====
Montafoner Resonanzen is a music festival consisting of a series of events in the Montafon region. It is held annually on weekends in August and September. Each weekend is dedicated to another genre (classical, jazz, Austrian folk musik, organ, cross-over). The locations vary each year. Guests may combine hiking and eating out with the concerts, considering the musical performances are held at extraordinary locations like the Tübinger Hütte at 2,191 m (Gaschurn) or the Panoramagasthof Kristberg.

== Sports ==
In the 2012/13 season, the first SBX World Cup Montafon was held as part of the FIS Snowboard World Cup. The World Cup takes place annually in December, with races carried out in the Silvretta Montafon ski area, starting below the Hochjoch summit and finishing near the cable car&#x27;s mountain station. The difference in altitude between start and finish is around 200 meters. During the World Cup, visitors can watch the snowboarders and skiers during the day time and enjoy concerts in Schruns in the nighttime.

The Montafon-Arlberg Marathon is a mountain marathon taking place since 2003. It encomprises 42,195 meters and 1,500 meters in altitude in two federal states (Vorarlberg and Tyrol).

== Culture ==
=== Customs and Traditions ===
Alpine Transhumance plays a vital role in traditional Alpine culture, just as do Yodeling, Alphorn, Schwingen, and cheese production.

=== Tracht ===
The Montafon festive costume for women consists of a black dress (Juppa), whose bodice (Miadr) is laced at the front. An apron (Schoß) in pastel colors is tied over it. The embroidery is particularly valuable on this costume: the &quot;Brosttuach&quot; is tied in the front of the bodice (ibresa), the apron straps (Schoßbänder) are tied over the apron. Nowadays, the &quot;Libli&quot; (actually part of the younger girls&#x27; costume) is mainly worn by dance groups instead of outerwear. In this case, a white blouse is also part of the costume. The picture is rounded off by a red petticoat, red stockings, shoes with buckles and a bow tied around the neck.

The most striking feature of the Montafon festive costume is the embroidery. This consists of two or more parts, depending on the occasion and the outer clothing of the costume. All embroidery is handmade, embroidered with silk on black velvet. A skilled embroiderer needs around 500 working hours to produce a complete embroidery.

Today, the traditional garment is still being manufactured at the Juppenwerkstatt Riefensberg.

==== Outer wear ====

* Glöggli-Tschopa: The curly cut Glögglitschopa, so named after the red or green lined frill on the back, has long, narrow sleeves with lapels made of embroidered silk atlas. A characteristic of a well-fitting Glögglitschopa is the Benkli, a fold running from the middle of the breast cloth to the Glöggli.
* Schlutta: The Schlutta, originally the warden chopa, is a brocade jacket. The collar has a delicate white tip.

==== Headpieces ====

* Pelzkappa: a heavy otter skin hat
* Mäßli: a headgear with the shape of a cylinder that widens upwards without a brim
* Sanderhut: The sander hat is a headgear introduced around 1900 for the Montafon costume.
* Schäppel: a silver or gold crown worn by young girls

=== Architecture ===
The Montafonerhaus is a house type in the Montafon valley from the 15th to the 20th century. It is a striking feature of the Montafon cultural landscape and is a characteristic of the valley. The classic Montafoner house mixes stone and wood elements.
=== Cuisine ===
The Montafoner Sauerkäse or Montafon cheese (dialect: &quot;Sura Kees&quot; or &quot;Sura Käs&quot;, referring to a type of sour cream/curdled milk cheese) is a sour cream cheese made in the Montafon since the 12th century. Montafon has one of the oldest traditions of cheese production in the Alpine region, and this is still an important dairy product. It has very little fat (1-10% fat in dry matter) and is a local speciality, similar to the Tyrolean grey cheese.

=== Gauertaler Alpkultur ===
The LEADER programme &quot;Gauertaler Alpkultur&quot; was created to inform guests and locals in the Gauertal valley about the cultural landscape. Knowledge of this cultural landscape is slowly being lost. Therefore, this path was created to present the Gauertal as a good example of local alpine culture and alpine transhumances. As the trails in the Gauertal are quite popular, the hikers had to be routed in such a way that the sensitive alpine areas were no longer seriously affected. At 13 stations, objects were created by artists who devoted themselves to various cultural areas. Panels and info-brochures tell the stories about the land, the people and the culture.

The following artistic interventions have been created in the Gauertaler landscape:
# Entrance gate
# Tree of Myths (alpine myths)
# Note 1: water &amp; alpine pastures
# Watcher (shepherd&#x27;s life)
# Alpine regions &amp; tourism (no sculpture)
# Note 2 (forest challenges)
# Tribune (life in the Maisäß)
# Cloakroom (changes of culture)
# Avalanche tree (natural hazards)
# Battlefield (history in the Alps)
# Alpinism (no sculpture)
# Cheese harp (life and work)
# Antler tree (alp and hunting)

There are three different paths and each tells a different story:
* Main tour: Gauertaler Alpkultur: Grüneck (1,890 meters) - Obere Latschätzalpe - Obere Sporaalpe - Lindauer Hütte - untere Sporaalpe - untere Latschätzalpe - Wachters Dieja - Plazadels - Matschwitz. Length: 12.7 km; duration: approx. four ours
* Alptour: Grüneck (1,890 meters) - Obere Latschätzalpe - Obere Sporaalpe - Lindauer Hütte - untere Sporaalpe - untere Latschätzalpe - Gauen - Latschau. Length: 11,3 km; duration: approx. 3.5 hours
* Maisäßtour (tour of alpine transhumance): Grüneck (1,890 meters) - Obere Latschätzalpe - Wachters Dieja - Plazadels - Matschwitz. Length: 6,7 km; duration: approx 2.5 hours
=== Museums ===
In the Montafon valley, there are four museums:

* Heimatmuseum Schruns (Schruns Museum of Local History)
* Alpin- und Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn (Gaschurn Alpine and Tourism Museum)
* Bergbaumuseum Silbertal (Mining Museum Silbertal)
* Museum Frühmesshaus Bartholomäberg

== Trivia ==
A number of celebrities including Alfred Dassler have stayed in the Montafon valley. Some of the older folks still talk about the long nights in Schruns playing cards and drinking with Ernest Hemingway and John dos Passos. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Snows of the Kilimanjaro&quot; (1936) and several other novels and short stories were written in, or they contain material about, the Montafon and the Silvretta glaciers. The famous German novelist and poet Erich Kästner also repeatedly visited the valley, as did the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl. The noted opera singer Elisabeth Schwarzkopf spent her last years in Schruns, where she died on 2 August 2006.

<text>Quantum foam (or spacetime foam, or spacetime bubble) is a theoretical quantum fluctuation of spacetime on very small scales due to quantum mechanics. The theory predicts that at this small scale, particles of matter and antimatter are constantly created and destroyed. These subatomic objects are called virtual particles. The idea was devised by John Wheeler in 1955.

==Background==

With an incomplete theory of quantum gravity, it is impossible to be certain what spacetime looks like at small scales. However, there is no definitive reason that spacetime needs to be fundamentally smooth. It is possible that instead, in a quantum theory of gravity, spacetime would consist of many small, ever-changing regions in which space and time are not definite, but fluctuate in a foam-like manner.

Wheeler suggested that the uncertainty principle might imply that over sufficiently small distances and sufficiently brief intervals of time, the &quot;very geometry of spacetime fluctuates&quot;. These fluctuations could be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth spacetime seen at macroscopic scales, giving spacetime a &quot;foamy&quot; character.

== Experimental results ==

The experimental proof of the Casimir effect, which is possibly caused by virtual particles, is strong evidence for the existence of virtual particles. The g-2 experiment, which predicts the strength of magnets formed by muons and electrons, also supports their existence.

In 2005, during observations of gamma-ray photons arriving from the blazar Markarian 501, MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes detected that some of the photons at different energy levels arrived at different times, suggesting that some of the photons had moved more slowly and thus were in violation of special relativity&#x27;s notion that the speed of light is constant, a discrepancy which could be explained by the irregularity of quantum foam. Subsequent experiments were, however, unable to confirm the supposed variation on the speed of light due to graininess of space.

Other experiments involving the polarization of light from distant gamma ray bursts have also produced contradictory results. More Earth-based experiments are ongoing or proposed.

===Constraints on the size of quantum fluctuations===

The fluctuations characteristic of a spacetime foam would be expected to occur on a length scale on the order of the Planck length (≈ 10−35 m), but some models of quantum gravity predict much larger fluctuations.

Photons should be slowed by quantum foam, with the rate depending on the wavelength of the photons. This would violate Lorentz invariance. But observations of radiation from nearby quasars by Floyd Stecker of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center failed to find evidence of violation of Lorentz invariance.

A foamy spacetime also sets limits on the accuracy with which distances can be measured because photons should diffuse randomly through a spacetime foam, similar to light diffusing by passing through fog. This should cause the image quality of very distant objects observed through telescopes to degrade. X-ray and gamma-ray observations of quasars using NASA&#x27;s Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and ground-based gamma-ray observations from the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array (VERITAS) showed no detectable degradation at the farthest observed distances, implying that spacetime is smooth at least down to distances 1000 times smaller than the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, setting a bound on the size of quantum fluctuations of spacetime.

==Relation to other theories==
The vacuum fluctuations provide vacuum with a non-zero energy known as vacuum energy.

Spin foam theory is a modern attempt to make Wheeler&#x27;s idea quantitative.

<doc id="364381" wikidata="Q603733" url="?curid=364381" title="Schruns">
<text>Schruns is a municipality in the Montafon valley (altitude 690 meters), in the Bludenz district of the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg.

To the west is the famous Zimba mountain, often called the &quot;Vorarlberger Matterhorn,&quot; which is very popular among climbers and hikers. 
== Geography ==
The Litz river, a tributary of the Ill river, flows through the town. A side valley, the Silbertal, stretches to the east of Schruns. The area has a high mountain massif accessible by train and ski-lifts.

To the north is the Bartholomäberg, to the south St. Gallenkirch, and to the west Tschagguns. The nearest larger municipality is Bludenz.

About 45.2 percent of the area is forested, with 18.1 percent mountainous.

== Transport ==
Schruns railway station is the southern terminus of the Bludenz–Schruns railway line (&quot;Montafonerbahn&quot;). Two other stations, and , are also located within the municipality of Schruns. All stations are served by the S4 regional train service of the Vorarlberg S-Bahn.

== Sports ==
Since 2012/13, Schruns has been part of the FIS Snowboard World Cup, which takes place annually in December. During the daytime, visitors can watch snowboard cross races up on the Hochjoch of the Silvretta Montafon ski area. In the evening, concerts are held in Schruns.

Schruns is a hotspot for mountain biking and trail running. For more than ten years, Schruns has hosted the M3 Montafon Bike Marathon with over 500 bikers. 

==Notable people==

In the early 1920s Schruns was the favorite ski resort of Ernest Hemingway. He wintered there with his first wife, Hadley, and oldest son, who was then just an infant; a chapter in his book A Moveable Feast includes several pages describing lodging and skiing there in the 1920s. It was there that he revised the manuscript of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. In Hemingway&#x27;s classic story &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; the third scene in the first flashback sequence recounts memories of Schruns. These images of snow and glacier skiing stand in stark contrast to the description of the Serengeti Plain in the main story and anticipate the coming journey to the snows of Kilimanjaro.

*Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi died there in 1972
*Elisabeth Schwarzkopf lived in the village in her last years and died there in 2006
*Georg Margreitter, footballer for Grasshopper Club Zürich, born in 1988

<doc id="364393" wikidata="Q956239" url="?curid=364393" title="Stefano Casiraghi">
<text>Stefano Casiraghi (8 September 1960 – 3 October 1990) was an Italian offshore powerboat racer, socialite, and businessman. He was the second husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco; he died during a racing accident defending his 1990 Class 1 World Powerboat Championship title.

==Early life and education==
The son of Giancarlo Casiraghi (1925–1998), a wealthy businessman, and Fernanda Biffi (1925-2024), Stefano Casiraghi grew up in the Casiraghi family&#x27;s estate, Villa Cigogne, in Fino Mornasco. He had two brothers, Marco and Daniele (1956–2016), and one sister, Rosalba. He also developed an early passion for the speedboat races on Lake Como. He followed in the footsteps of his brothers by enrolling at Milan&#x27;s Bocconi University, but left without obtaining a degree. He began to work for his father and his oldest brother, Marco.

==Business==
Casiraghi was involved in the real estate and retail export enterprises of the family business that his father had built up. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as a financier and Chairman of Cogefar France (a construction subsidiary of Fiat). The same source said he had a majority interest in Engeco, a Monaco-based construction company which he founded in 1984. At the time of his first child&#x27;s birth, he was the director of the Christian Dior boutique in Monte Carlo.

== Speedboat racing ==

A throttle man, a role that requires control of the trim tab while observing water conditions to reach optimum speed, Casiraghi participated in eighty offshore races during his lifetime. Over a 20-year career, he won a dozen of those competitions and, at the time of his death, was the world champion of offshore speedboat racing, including the World Championship held off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA, in 1989. Casiraghi had set the record (since broken) for 277 km/h on Lake Como in 1984.

==Marriage and family==
On 29 December 1983 in Monaco, he and Princess Caroline married in a civil ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors of the Monegasque Princely Palace. They were not able to have a Catholic ceremony because Caroline had been divorced from Philippe Junot, and an annulment had not yet been obtained. However, as Caroline was over three months pregnant, the couple did not want to wait any longer.

The couple had three children: Andrea (born 8 June 1984), Charlotte (born 3 August 1986), and Pierre (born 5 September 1987). The children were born at Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco, respectively, fourth, eleventh and eighth in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, after their twin cousins and their mother. Although their parents had not married in the Church, as required for legitimacy under church law, they were legitimized by Pope John Paul II in February 1993, eight months after their mother&#x27;s marriage to Junot was annulled in June 1992.

==Death==
Casiraghi was killed in an offshore powerboat racing accident off the coast of Monaco near Cap Ferrat on 3 October 1990 while defending his world offshore title. He was 30 years old and had planned to retire after the race. Only weeks earlier, he had survived an accident when his boat blew up off the coast of Guernsey.

There were three to four-foot wave conditions on the race course, which caused Casiraghi&#x27;s 42-foot catamaran, &quot;Pinot di Pinot&quot;, to flip. Traveling at ca. 150 km/h, it did not have a full canopy, and experts who studied the accident have said that Casiraghi would most likely have survived the accident had the boat been equipped with one. As a result of his death, safety laws became more stringent; a safety harness and closed hull became compulsory, as was a twin hull design for boats. Races now take place close to the harbour where waves are gentler, which is policed off for safety reasons as boats are no longer allowed to drive near the course.

Of the accident, Anne Edwards wrote that Casiraghi and his copilot, Patrice Innocenti, had been &quot;trying to make up for time they had lost earlier in the race when they had stopped to rescue a pilot whose vessel had caught fire.&quot; Innocenti survived the accident. He was pulled from the water and taken to Monaco&#x27;s Princess Grace Hospital.

Casiraghi&#x27;s funeral was held in Monaco&#x27;s Cathedral of St. Nicholas eight years after Princess Grace&#x27;s funeral in the same place. Casiraghi is buried in the Chapelle de la Paix in Monaco, which is also the resting place of his wife&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Prince Pierre of Monaco.

<text>Francis Pegahmagabow MM &amp; two bars ( ; March 9, 1891 – August 5, 1952) was an Ojibwe soldier, politician and activist in Canada. He was the most highly decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian military history and the most effective sniper of the First World War. Three times awarded the Military Medal and seriously wounded, he was an expert marksman and scout, credited with killing 378 Germans and capturing 300 more. Later in life, he served as chief and a councillor for the Wasauksing First Nation, and as an activist and leader in several First Nations organizations. He corresponded with and met other noted aboriginal figures including Fred Loft, Jules Sioui, Andrew Paull and John Tootoosis.

==Early life==

Francis Pegahmagabow was born on March 9, 1891, on what is now the Shawanaga First Nation reserve in Nobel, Ontario. In Ojibwe his name was Binaaswi (&quot;the wind that blows off&quot;). When Francis was three years old, his father died and his mother subsequently left him to return to her home in the Henvey Inlet First Nation. He was raised by elder Noah Nebimanyquod and grew up in Shawanaga, where he learned traditional skills such as hunting, fishing, and traditional medicine. Pegahmagabow practiced a mix of Catholicism and Anishinaabe spirituality. 
In January 1912 Pegahmagabow received financial aid for room and board to complete his public school education with the help of the Parry Sound crown attorney Walter Lockwood Haight. He had left school at the age of 12 and worked at lumber camps and fishing camps; he eventually became a marine firefighter.

==Military career==

Following the outbreak of World War I, Pegahmagabow volunteered for service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in August 1914, despite Canadian government discrimination that initially excluded minorities. He was posted to the 23rd Canadian Regiment (Northern Pioneers). After joining the Canadian force he was based at CFB Valcartier. While there he decorated his army tent with traditional symbols including a Caribou, the symbol of his clan. In early October 1914 he was deployed overseas with the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion of the 1st Canadian Division—the first contingent of Canadian troops sent to fight in Europe. His companions there nicknamed him &quot;Peggy&quot;.

In April 1915, Pegahmagabow fought in the Second Battle of Ypres, where the Germans used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front; it was during this battle that he began to establish a reputation as a sniper and scout. Following the battle he was promoted to lance corporal. His battalion took part in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, during which he was wounded in the left leg. He recovered in time to return to the 1st Battalion as they moved to Belgium. He received the Military Medal for carrying messages along the lines during these two battles. Initially, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Albert Creighton, had nominated him for the Distinguished Conduct Medal, citing his disregard for danger and &quot;faithfulness to duty&quot;, but it was downgraded.

On November 6/7, 1917, Pegahmagabow earned a Bar to his Military Medal for his actions in the Second Battle of Passchendaele. During the fighting, Pegahmagabow&#x27;s battalion was given the task of launching an attack at Passchendaele. By this time, he had been promoted to the rank of corporal and during the battle he was recorded playing an important role as a link between the units on the 1st Battalion&#x27;s flank. When the battalion&#x27;s reinforcements became lost, Pegahmagabow was instrumental in guiding them and ensuring that they reached their allocated spot in the line.

On August 30, 1918, during the Battle of the Scarpe, Pegahmagabow was involved in fighting off a German attack at Orix Trench near Upton Wood. His company was almost out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded. Pegahmagabow braved heavy machine gun and rifle fire by going into no man&#x27;s land and brought back enough ammunition to enable his post to carry on and assist in repulsing heavy enemy counter-attacks. For these efforts he received a second Bar to his Military Medal, becoming one of only 39 Canadians to receive this honour.

The war ended in November 1918 and in 1919 Pegahmagabow was invalided back to Canada. He had served for almost the whole war, and had built a reputation as a skilled marksman. Using the much-maligned Ross rifle, he was credited with killing 378 Germans and capturing 300 more. By the time of his discharge, he had served in the appointment of sergeant-major and had been awarded the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal.

==Political life==

Upon his return to Canada he continued to serve in the Canadian Militia as a member of The Northern Pioneers (known today as the Algonquin Regiment) as a non-permanent active member. Following in his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s footsteps, he was elected chief of the Parry Island Band from February 1921. Once in office he caused a schism in the band after he wrote a letter calling for certain individuals and those of mixed race to be expelled from the reserve. He was re-elected in 1924 and served until he was deposed via an internal power struggle in April 1925. Before the motion could go through, Pegahmagabow resigned. A decade later, he was appointed councillor from 1933 to 1936. In 1933 the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA. They directed that all correspondence, as of the spring of 1933, go through the Indian agent. This gave huge power to the agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow as he did not get along with his own agent, John Daly. First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists. They had travelled the world, earned the respect of the comrades in the trenches, and refused to be sidelined by the newly empowered Indian agent. Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates &quot;returned soldier chiefs&quot;, and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active. This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief. Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from &quot;white slavery&quot;. The Indian agents labelled him a &quot;mental case&quot; and strove to sideline him and his supporters.

In addition to the power struggle between the Indian council and the DIA with which Pegahmagabow took issue, he was a constant agitator over the islands in Georgian Bay of the Huron. The Regional First Nation governments claimed the islands as their own and Pegahmagabow and other chiefs tried in vain to get recognition of their status.

During World War II Pegahmagabow worked as a guard at a munitions plant near Nobel, Ontario, and was a Sergeant-major in the local militia. In 1943, he became the Supreme Chief of the Native Independent Government, an early First Nations organization.

==Family==

A married father of six children, Pegahmagabow died on the Parry Island reserve in 1952 at the age of 61. He is a member of the Indian Hall of Fame at the Woodland Centre in Brantford, Ontario, and his memory is also commemorated on a plaque honoring him and his regiment on the Rotary and Algonquin Regiment Fitness Trail in Parry Sound. He was honored by the Canadian Forces by naming the 3rd Canadian Ranger Patrol Group HQ Building at CFB Borden after him.

==Legacy==
Canadian journalist Adrian Hayes wrote a biography of Pegahmagabow titled &quot;Pegahmagabow: Legendary Warrior, Forgotten Hero&quot;, published in 2003, and another titled &quot;Pegahmagabow: Life-Long Warrior&quot;, published in 2009. Canadian novelist Joseph Boyden&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Three Day Road&quot; was inspired in part by Pegahmagabow. The novel&#x27;s protagonist is a fictional character who, like Pegahmagabow, serves as a military sniper during World War I, although Pegahmagabow also appears as a minor character.

A life-sized bronze statue of Pegahmagabow was erected in his honour on National Aboriginal Day, June 21, 2016, in Parry Sound, near Georgian Bay. The figure has an eagle on one arm, a Ross rifle slung from its shoulder, and a caribou at its feet, representing the Caribou Clan that Pegahmagabow belonged to. The Eagle was his spirit animal. The artist Tyler Fauvelle spent eight months sculpting the statue, which spent a further year in casting. Fauvelle chose to erect it in Parry Sound rather than Wasauksing to reach a larger public and educate them on the contributions of First Nations people to Canada.

&quot;Sounding Thunder, The Song of Francis Pegahmagabow&quot; is a musical that has been touring Canada since 2018.

In 2019, the history-themed power metal band Sabaton released a song dedicated to Pegahmagabow, titled &quot;A Ghost in the Trenches&quot;, on their album &quot;The Great War&quot;.

Binaaswi was one of eight 2020 finalists for the $5 bill in Canada&#x27;s eighth series of banknotes.

Pegahmagabow was portrayed by Keenan Keeshig in the 2022 movie &quot;The Ace and the Scout&quot; (also known as &quot;Battle for the Western Front&quot;).

&quot;The Two Battles of Francis Pegahmagabow&quot; is a play launched in 2024 by Edmonton&#x27;s Shadow Theatre. 

===Awards===

* He was first awarded the Military Medal while fighting at the second battle of Ypres, Festubert and Givenchy, for courage above fire in getting important messages through to the rear.
* Earned his first bar to the Military Medal at the Battle of Passchendaele.
* His second bar to the Military Medal came at the battle of The Scarpe, in 1918. Only 38 other Canadian men received the honour of two bars.
* The 1914–15 Star
* The British War Medal
* The Victory Medal

In 2003 the Pegahmagabow family donated his medals and chief head dress to the Canadian War Museum where they can be seen as of 2010 as part of the World War I display. While researching his 2005 novel &quot;Three Day Road&quot;, Boyden was asked about why he thought that Pegahmagabow had not received a higher award like the Distinguished Conduct Medal or the Victoria Cross. Boyden speculated it was due to Pegahmagabow being a First Nations soldier, and that there may have been jealousy on the part of some officers who he felt might have been suspicious of the number of Germans Pegahmagabow claimed to have shot because he did not use an observer while sniping.

<doc id="364407" wikidata="Q1521359" url="?curid=364407" title="Daqin">
<text>Daqin (; alternative transliterations include Tachin, Tai-Ch&#x27;in) is the ancient Chinese name for the Roman Empire or, depending on context, the Near East, especially Syria. It literally means &quot;Great Qin&quot;; Qin () being the name of the founding dynasty of the Chinese Empire. Historian John Foster defined it as &quot;the Roman Empire, or rather that part of it which alone was known to the Chinese, Syria&quot;. Its basic facets such as laws, customs, dress, and currency were explained in Chinese sources. Its medieval incarnation was described in histories during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) onwards as &quot;Fulin&quot; (), which Friedrich Hirth and other scholars have identified as the Byzantine Empire. Daqin was also commonly associated with the Syriac-speaking Nestorian Christians who lived in China during the Tang dynasty.

Chinese sources describe several ancient Roman embassies arriving in China, beginning in 166 AD and lasting into the 3rd century. These early embassies were said to arrive by a maritime route via the South China Sea in the Chinese province of Jiaozhi (now northern Vietnam). Archaeological evidence such as Roman coins points to the presence of Roman commercial activity in Southeast Asia. Later recorded embassies arriving from the Byzantine Empire, lasting from the 7th to 11th centuries, ostensibly took an overland route following the Silk Road, alongside other Europeans in Medieval China. Byzantine Greeks are recorded as being present in the court of Kublai Khan (1260–1294), the Mongol ruler of the Yuan dynasty in Khanbaliq (Beijing), while the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368–1398), founder of the Ming dynasty, sent a letter of correspondence to Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos.

==Etymology==
===Daqin===
The term &quot;Daqin&quot; (, Middle Chinese: /dɑiH d͡ziɪn/), meaning &quot;Great Qin&quot;, is derived from the dynasty founded by Qin Shi Huang, ruler of the State of Qin and China&#x27;s first emperor who unified China&#x27;s Warring States by 221 BC. The prefix &quot;da&quot; (大) or &quot;great&quot; signified that the Roman Empire was on par with the might of the Qin dynasty and was viewed as a utopian land located to the northwest of the Parthian Empire. The title &quot;Daqin&quot; does not seem to have any phonetic derivation from Latin &quot;Roma&quot; or Greek &quot;Romaikē&quot;. On the other hand, it is possible that the Latin term used for China, &quot;Serica&quot; (derived from Greek &quot;Serikon&quot;, commonly understood as &quot;Land of Silk&quot;, from Chinese &quot;si&quot; , meaning silk), originated from the name Qin using Early Middle Chinese pronunciation (with the final consonant pronounced with an &quot;-r&quot; sound).

===Fulin===
The term &quot;Daqin&quot; was used from the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) onwards, but by the beginning of the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) a new name emerged in Chinese historical records for distinguishing the Eastern Roman Empire: &quot;Fulin&quot; (). Friedrich Hirth surmised that Fulin may have been based on the accusative form of &quot;Konstantinoupolis&quot;, the Greek name of Constantinople, or rather its paraphrase &quot;hē Pólis&quot; (&quot;the City&quot;), giving (in the accusative) &quot;(tḕn) Pólin&quot;. Using historical phonetic pronunciations of Cantonese and Japanese, Hirth also speculated that &quot;Fulin&quot; in Middle Chinese was pronounced &quot;Butlim&quot; or &quot;Butlam&quot; and thus might have also come from the Syriac pronunciation for Bethlehem. While some scholars of the 20th century believed that Fulin was a transliteration of Ephraim, a reference to the Biblical Northern Kingdom, Samuel N. C. Lieu highlights how more recent scholarship has deduced that Fulin is most likely derived from the Persianate word for the Roman Empire shared by several contemporaneous Iranian languages (Middle Persian: ; Parthian: ; Sogdian: βr&#x27;wm-; Bactrian: &quot;φρομο&quot;).

==History==


===Early descriptions by Gan Ying===
Following the opening of the Silk Road in the 2nd century BC, the Chinese thought of the Roman Empire as a civilized counterpart to the Chinese Empire. The Romans occupied one extreme position on the trade route, with the Chinese located on the other.

China never managed to reach the Roman Empire directly in antiquity, although general Ban Chao sent Gan Ying as an envoy to &quot;Daqin&quot; in 97 AD. Gan Ying did not reach Daqin: he stopped at the coast of a large sea, because &quot;sailor(s) of the Parthian west border&quot; told him that the voyage to cross the sea might take a long time and be dangerous. Gan Ying left a detailed account of the Roman Empire, but it is generally considered to have been based on second-hand information from Parthians:

Gan Ying gives a very idealistic view of Roman governance which is likely the result of some story he was told while visiting the Persian Gulf in 97 AD. He also described, less fancifully, Roman products:
===Geographical descriptions in the Weilüe===

In the &quot;Weilüe&quot; written by Yu Huan (–265), a text that is preserved in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Pei Songzhi (published in 429), a more detailed description of the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire is given, particularly the province of Roman Egypt. The 19th-century sinologist Friedrich Hirth translated the passages and identified the places named in them, which have been edited by Jerome S. Arkenberg in 2000 (with Wade-Giles spelling):

The &quot;Weilüe&quot; also noted that the Daqin had small &quot;dependent&quot; vassal states, too many to list as the text claims, yet it mentions some as being the Alexandria-Euphrates or Charax Spasinu (&quot;Ala-san&quot;), Nikephorium (&quot;Lu-fen&quot;), Palmyra (&quot;Ch&#x27;ieh-lan&quot;), Damascus (&quot;Hsien-tu&quot;), Emesa (&quot;Si-fu&quot;), and Hira (&quot;Ho-lat&quot;). Perhaps some of these are in reference to certain states that were temporarily conquered during the Roman–Parthian Wars (66 BC – 217 AD) when, for instance, the army of Roman Emperor Trajan reached the Persian Gulf and captured Characene, the capital of which was Charax Spasinu. The &quot;Weilüe&quot; provides the traveling directions and approximate distances between each of these cities, counted in ancient Chinese miles (&quot;li&quot;), and along with the &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; even mentions the pontoon bridge (&quot;flying bridge&quot;) across the Euphrates at the Roman city of Zeugma, Commagene (in modern-day Turkey).

Hirth and Arkenberg identified Si-fu (Chinese: 汜復) with Emesa. However, John E. Hill provides evidence that it was most likely Petra (in the Nabataean Kingdom), given the directions and distance from &quot;Yuluo&quot; (i.e. Al Karak) and the fact that it fell under Roman dominion in 106 AD when it was annexed by Trajan. Even more convincing for Hill is the fact that Si-fu in Chinese means &quot;an arm of a river which rejoins the main stream&quot; or more aptly &quot;rejoined water courses&quot;. He believes this is directly related to the reservoir and cistern flood-control system harnessing the many streams running through the settlement and nearby canyons, or wadis, such as the Wadi Musa (&quot;Valley of Moses&quot;).

===Christianity===


In later eras, starting in AD 550, as Syriac Christians settled along the Silk Road and founded mission churches, Daqin or Tai-Ch&#x27;in is also used to refer to these Christian populations rather than to Rome or the Roman church. So, for example, when the Taoist Emperor Wuzong of Tang closed Christian monasteries in the mid-9th century, the imperial edict commanded:
The name &quot;Daqin&quot; for Rome was used on Chinese maps as late as the 16th century, such as the Sihai Huayi Zongtu. The identification of &quot;Daqin&quot; with the Western Roman Empire, Eastern Roman Empire, or the Church of the East varies with the era and context of the document. The Nestorian Stele erected in 781 in the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an contains an inscription that briefly summarizes the knowledge about Daqin in the Chinese histories written up to that point and notes how only the &quot;luminous&quot; religion (i.e. Christianity) was practiced there.

===Capital cities===

In the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot; and the &quot;Weilüe&quot;, the chief city of Daqin is said to be more than 100 &quot;li&quot; around. It is described as being located near a river and having five palaces, with the king travelling to one of these palaces each day. Some scholars have identified in this description the city of Rome, the Tiber river and the Imperial residences of the Palatine hill. However, other scholars, including Hirth and Hoppál, identify it with Antioch. It has also been suggested that the capital of Daqin described in those works is a conflation of multiple cities, chiefly Rome, Antioch and Alexandria.

In Gan Ying&#x27;s report the capital of Daqin is &quot;An-tu&quot;, Antioch. However, the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, which identified Daqin and &quot;Fulin&quot; (拂菻; i.e. &quot;Primus&quot;, the Byzantine Empire) as the same countries, noted a different capital city (Constantinople), one that had walls of &quot;enormous height&quot; and was eventually besieged by the commander &quot;Móyì&quot; (Chinese: 摩拽伐之; Pinyin: &quot;Móyì fá zhī&quot;) of the &quot;Da shi&quot; (大食; i.e. the Arabs). Friedrich Hirth identifies this commander as Mu&#x27;awiyah I, who was first governor of Syria before becoming caliph and founder of the Umayyad Caliphate.

=== Characteristics attributed from the Book of Jin to the Romans ===
The encyclopedic part of the Book of Jin classified the appearance of the Romans as being genuinely Xirong, a barbaric people who lived west of the Zhou dynasty, however, the characteristics attributed to Daqin tend to be more positive than the others, saying that their people when they reached adulthood looked like the Chinese, they used glass on the walls of their houses (considered a luxury item in the Tang dynasty), their tiles were covered with coral, their &quot;king&quot; had 5 palaces, all huge, and all far from each other, just as what was heard in one palace took time to reach another and so on.

===Embassies===
Starting in the 1st century BC with Virgil, Horace, and Strabo, Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk-producing &quot;Seres&quot; of the distant east. The 2nd-century historian Florus seems to have conflated the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived &quot;beneath another sky&quot; than the Romans. The 1st-century geographer Pomponius Mela noted that their lands formed the center of the coast of an eastern ocean, flanked by India to the south and the Scythians of the northern steppe, while the historian Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 330 – c. 400) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called Bautis, perhaps the Yellow River. In his &quot;Geography&quot;, Ptolemy also provided a rough sketch of the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, with a port city called Cattigara lying beyond the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula) visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander. Among the proposed sites for Ptolemy&#x27;s Cattigara are Oc Eo, Vietnam, where Roman artefacts have been found.

In contrast, Chinese histories offer an abundance of source material about their interactions with alleged Roman embassies and descriptions of their country. The first of these embassies is recorded in the &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; as having arrived by sea in 166 AD and came by way of Jiaozhou, later known as Annam (northern Vietnam), as would later embassies. Its members claimed to be representatives of the Daqin ruler &quot;Andun&quot; (安敦), either Antoninus Pius or more likely his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and offered gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han. Other embassies arrived sporadically afterwards. The &quot;Book of Liang&quot; mentions a Daqin embassy to Sun Quan of Eastern Wu in 226, while the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; records a Daqin embassy to Emperor Wu of Jin in 284.

Although Emperor Yang of Sui (r. 604–618) had desired to send an embassy to Daqin, this never came to fruition. Instead, an embassy from a country that was now called &quot;Fulin&quot; (拂菻, i.e. the Byzantine Empire), which the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; identified as being the same as Daqin, arrived in 643 at the court of Emperor Taizong of Tang and claimed to represent their king &quot;Bo duoli&quot; (波多力; i.e. Kōnstantinos Pogonatos, &quot;Constantine the Bearded&quot;, the nickname of Constans II). Several other &quot;Fulin&quot; (i.e. Byzantium) embassies during the Tang dynasty are mentioned for the years 667, 701, and 719.

The &quot;Wenxian Tongkao&quot; written by Ma Duanlin (1245–1322) and the &quot;History of Song&quot; record that the Byzantine emperor Michael VII Parapinakēs Caesar (&quot;Mie li sha ling kai sa&quot; 滅力沙靈改撒) of &quot;Fulin&quot; (i.e. Byzantium) sent an embassy to China that arrived in 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085). During the subsequent Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), an unprecedented number of Europeans started to visit and live in China, such as Marco Polo and Katarina Vilioni, and papal missionaries such as John of Montecorvino and Giovanni de Marignolli. The &quot;History of Yuan&quot; recounts how a man of &quot;Fulin&quot; named Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph), initially in the service of Güyük Khan, was well-versed in Western languages and had expertise in the fields of medicine and astronomy. This convinced Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, to offer him a position as the director of medical and astronomical boards, eventually honoring him with the title of Prince of Fulin (Chinese: 拂菻王; &quot;Fú lǐn wáng&quot;). His biography in the &quot;History of Yuan&quot; lists his children by their Chinese names, which are similar to the Christian names Elias (&quot;Ye-li-ah&quot;), Luke (&quot;Lu-ko&quot;), and Antony (&quot;An-tun&quot;), with a daughter named &quot;A-na-si-sz&quot;.

The History of Ming explains how the founder of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the Hongwu Emperor, sent a merchant of &quot;Fulin&quot; named &quot;Nieh-ku-lun&quot; (捏古倫) back to his home country with a letter announcing the founding of a new dynasty. It is speculated that this &quot;merchant&quot; was actually a former bishop of Khanbaliq named Nicolaus de Bentra. The &quot;History of Ming&quot; goes on to explain that contacts between China and &quot;Fulin&quot; ceased thereafter, whereas an envoy of the great western sea (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea) did not arrive again until the 16th century, with the Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci.

==Currency and coinage==

Although the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) claimed that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC–284 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. Yet this assumption has been overturned; Warwick Ball (2016) notes the discovery of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi&#x27;an, China (site of the Han capital Chang&#x27;an) minted during the reign of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold &quot;solidus&quot; coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. However, Roman golden medallions from the reign of Antoninus Pius, and possibly his successor Marcus Aurelius, have been discovered at Óc Eo in southern Vietnam, which was then part of the Kingdom of Funan bordering the Chinese province of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam. This was the same region where Chinese historical texts claim the Romans first landed before venturing further into China to conduct diplomacy.

Chinese histories offer descriptions of Byzantine coins. In discussing trade with India, the Parthian Empire and the Roman Empire, the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, as well as the later &quot;Wenxian Tongkao&quot;, noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin. With fluctuations, the Roman golden &quot;aureus&quot; was worth about twenty-five silver &quot;denarii&quot;. The &quot;History of Song&quot; notes how the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, without holes in the middle yet with an inscription of the king&#x27;s name.

==Law and order==

The &quot;History of Song&quot; described forms of punishment in criminal law as they were carried out in &quot;Daqin&quot; (Roman Empire) and &quot;Fulin&quot; (Byzantine Empire). It states that they made a distinction between minor and major offenses, with 200 strikes from a bamboo rod being reserved for major crimes. It described their form of capital punishment as having the guilty person being stuffed into a &quot;feather bag&quot; and thrown into the sea. This seems to correspond with the Romano-Byzantine punishment of &quot;poena cullei&quot; (from Latin &quot;punishment of the sack&quot;), where those who committed parricide (i.e. murder of a father or mother) were sewn up into a sack, sometimes with wild animals, and thrown into either a river or sea. The &quot;History of Song&quot; also mentioned how it was forbidden by law to counterfeit the coins minted by &quot;Fulin&quot;. These descriptions from the &quot;History of Song&quot; are also found in the &quot;Wenxian Tongkao&quot;.

==Naming conventions==
In the Chinese histories, the names of Romans and Byzantines were often transliterated into Chinese as they were heard, yet occasionally the surname stemmed from their country of origin, Daqin (大秦). For instance, the Roman merchant Qin Lun (秦論), who visited the Eastern Wu court of Sun Quan in 226 AD, bears the surname derived from the name for his homeland, while having a given name that is perhaps derived from the Greek name Leon (e.g. Leon of Sparta). In the Han-era stage of the spoken language intermediate between Old Chinese and Middle Chinese, the pronunciation for his given name &quot;Lun&quot; (論) would have sounded quite different from modern spoken Mandarin: K. 470b *li̯wən / li̯uĕn or *lwən / luən; EMC lwən or lwənh.

Granting Roman individuals the surname &quot;Qin&quot; followed a common Chinese naming convention for foreign peoples. For instance, people from the Parthian Empire of ancient Persia such as An Shigao were often given the surname &quot;An&quot; (安) derived from &quot;Anxi&quot; (安息), the Arsacid dynasty. The Sogdians, an Eastern Iranian people from Central Asia, were also frequently given the surname &quot;An&quot; (e.g. An Chongzhang), especially those from Bukhara, while Sogdians from Samarkand were surnamed &quot;Kang&quot; (康; e.g. Kang Senghui), derived from &quot;Kangju&quot;, the Chinese term for Transoxiana. The name given for either Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus in the Chinese histories was &quot;An Dun&quot; (安敦).

<text>The Xi&#x27;an Stele or the Jingjiao Stele (), sometimes translated as the &quot;Nestorian Stele,&quot; is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a limestone block high with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Church of the East had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635. According to the stele, Alopen and his fellow Syriac missionaries came to China from Daqin (the Eastern Roman Empire) in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong (Tai Tsung) (635), bringing sacred books and images. The Church of the East monk Adam (Jingjing in Chinese) composed the text on the stele. Buried in 845, probably during the Huichang persecution of Buddhism, the stele was not rediscovered until 1625. It is now in the Stele Forest in Xi&#x27;an.

==Discovery==
The stele is thought to have been buried in 845, during the Huichang persecution, which also affected Christians.

The stele was unearthed in the late Ming dynasty (between 1623 and 1625) beside Chongren Temple () outside of Xi&#x27;an.
According to the account by the Jesuit Alvaro Semedo, the workers who found the stele immediately reported the find to the governor, who soon visited the monument, and had it installed on a pedestal, under a protective roof, requesting the nearby Buddhist monastery to care for it.

The newly discovered stele attracted attention of local intellectuals. It was Zhang Gengyou (Wade-Giles: Chang Keng-yu) who first identified the text as Christian in content. Zhang, who had been aware of Christianity through Matteo Ricci, and who himself may have been Christian, sent a copy of the stele&#x27;s Chinese text to his Christian friend, Leon Li Zhizao in Hangzhou, who in his turn published the text and told the locally based Jesuits about it.

Alvaro Semedo was the first European to visit the stele (some time between 1625 and 1628). Nicolas Trigault&#x27;s Latin translation of the monument&#x27;s inscription soon made its way in Europe, and was apparently first published in a French translation, in 1628. Portuguese and Italian translations, and a Latin re-translation, were soon published as well. Semedo&#x27;s account of the monument&#x27;s discovery was published in 1641, in his &quot;Imperio de la China&quot;.

Early Jesuits attempted to claim that the stele was erected by a historical community of Roman Catholics in China, called Nestorianism a heresy, and claimed that it was Catholics who first brought Christianity to China. But later historians and writers admitted that it was indeed from the Church of the East and not the Roman Catholic Church.

The first publication of the original Chinese and Syriac text of the inscription in Europe is attributed to Athanasius Kircher. &quot;China Illustrata&quot; edited by Kircher (1667) included a reproduction of the original inscription in Chinese characters,
romanization of the text, and a Latin translation. This was perhaps the first sizeable Chinese text made available in its original form to the European public. A sophisticated romanization system, reflecting Chinese tones, used to transcribe the text, was the one developed earlier by Matteo Ricci&#x27;s collaborator Lazzaro Cattaneo (1560–1640).

The work of the transcription and translation was carried out by Michał Boym and two young Chinese Christians who visited Rome in the 1650s and 1660s: Boym&#x27;s traveling companion Andreas Zheng () and, later, another person who signed in Latin as &quot;Matthaeus Sina&quot;. D.E. Mungello suggests that Matthaeus Sina may have been the person who traveled overland from China to Europe with Johann Grueber.

==Content==

The heading on the stone, Chinese for Memorial of the Propagation in China of the Luminous Religion from Daqin (, abbreviated ). An even more abbreviated version of the title, (Jǐngjiào bēi, &quot;The Stele of the Luminous Religion&quot;), in its Wade-Giles form, Ching-chiao-pei or Chingchiaopei, was used by some Western writers to refer to the stele as well.

The name of the stele can also be translated as &quot;A Monument Commemorating the Propagation of the Ta-Chin Luminous Religion in the Middle Kingdom&quot; (the church referred to itself as &quot;The Luminous Religion of Daqin&quot;, Daqin being the Chinese language term for the Roman Empire in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and in later eras also used to refer to the Syriac Christian churches).

===Authorship===
The stele was erected on January 7, 781 (&quot;Year of the Greeks 1092&quot; in the inscription), at the imperial capital city of Chang&#x27;an (modern-day Xi&#x27;an), or at nearby Zhouzhi County. The calligraphy was by Lü Xiuyan (), and the content was composed by the Church of the East monk Jingjing in the four- and six-character euphemistic style (大秦寺僧㬌淨述, &quot;Related by Jingjing, monk of the Daqin Temple&quot;). A gloss in Syriac identifies Jingjing with &quot;Adam, priest, chorepiscopus and &quot;papash&quot; of Sinistan&quot; (ܐܕܡ ܩܫܝܫܐ ܘܟܘܪܐܦܝܣܩܘܦܐ ܘܦܐܦܫܝ ܕܨܝܢܝܣܬܐܢ, &quot;Adam qshisha w&#x27;kurapisqupa w&#x27;papash d&#x27;Sinistan&quot;). Although the term &quot;papash&quot; (literally &quot;pope&quot;) is unusual and the normal Syriac name for China is Beth Sinaye, not Sinistan, there is no reason to doubt that Adam was the metropolitan of the Church of the East ecclesiastical province of Beth Sinaye, created a half-century earlier during the reign of Patriarch Sliba-zkha (714–28). A Syriac dating formula refers to the Church of the East patriarch II (773–780), news of whose death several months earlier had evidently not yet reached the Church of the East of Chang&#x27;an. In fact, the reigning Church of the East patriarch in January 781 was Timothy I (780–823), who had been consecrated in Baghdad on 7 May 780. The names of several higher clergy (one bishop, two chorepiscopi and two archdeacons) and around seventy monks or priests are listed. The names of the higher clergy appear on the front of the stone while those of the priests and monks are inscribed in rows along the narrow sides of the stone, in both Syriac and Chinese. In some cases, the Chinese names are phonetically close to the Syriac originals, but in many other cases, they bear little resemblance to them. Some of the Church of the East monks had distinctive Persian names (such as Isadsafas, Gushnasap), suggesting that they might have come from Fars or elsewhere in Persia, but most of them had common Christian names or the kind of compound Syriac name (such as , &#x27;servant of Jesus&#x27;) much in vogue among all Church of the East Christians. In such cases, it is impossible to guess at their place of origin.

===Content===
On top of the tablet, there is a cross. Below this headpiece is a long Chinese inscription, consisting of around 1,900 Chinese characters, sometimes glossed in Syriac (several sentences amounting to about 50 Syriac words). Calling God &quot;Veritable Majesty&quot;, the text refers to Genesis, the cross, and baptism. It also pays tribute to missionaries and benefactors of the church, who are known to have arrived in China by 640. The text contains the name of an early missionary, Alopen. The tablet describes the &quot;Illustrious Religion&quot; and emphasizes the Trinity and the Incarnation, but there is nothing about Christ&#x27;s crucifixion or resurrection. Other Chinese elements referred to include a wooden bell, beard, tonsure, and renunciation. The Syriac proper names for God, Christ and Satan (&quot;Allaha&quot;, &quot;Mshiha&quot; and &quot;Satana&quot;) were rendered phonetically into Chinese. Chinese transliterations were also made of one or two words of Sanskrit origin such as &quot;Sphatica&quot; and &quot;Dasa&quot;. There is also a Persian word denoting Sunday.

Yazedbuzid (Yisi in Chinese) helped the Tang dynasty general Guo Ziyi militarily crush the Sogdian-Turk led An Lushan rebellion, with Yisi personally acting as a military commander and Yisi and the Church of the East were rewarded by the Tang dynasty with titles and positions as described in the Xi&#x27;an Stele.

==Debate==
The Xi&#x27;an Stele attracted the attention of some anti-Christian, Protestant anti-Catholic, or Catholic anti-Jesuit groups in the 17th century, who argued that the stone was a fake or that the inscriptions had been modified by the Jesuits who served in the Ming Court. The three most prominent early skeptics were the German-Dutch Presbyterian scholar Georg Horn (1620–1670) (&quot;De originibus Americanis&quot;, 1652), the German historian Gottlieb Spitzel (1639–1691) (&quot;De re literaria Sinensium commentarius&quot;, 1660), and the Dominican missionary Domingo Navarrete (1618–1686) (&quot;Tratados historicos, politicos, ethicos, y religiosos de la monarchia de China&quot;, 1676). Later, Navarrete&#x27;s point of view was taken up by French Jansenists and Voltaire.

By the 19th century, the debate had become less sectarian and more scholarly. Notable skeptics included Karl Friedrich Neumann, Stanislas Julien, Edward E. Salisbury and Charles Wall. Ernest Renan initially had &quot;grave doubts&quot;, but eventually changed his mind in the light of later scholarship, in favor of the stele&#x27;s genuineness. The defenders included some non-Jesuit scholars, such as Alexander Wylie, James Legge, and Jean-Pierre-Guillaume Pauthier, although the most substantive work in defense of the stele&#x27;s authenticity – the three-volume &quot;La stèle chrétienne de Si-ngan-fou&quot; (1895 to 1902) was authored by the Jesuit scholar Henri Havret (1848–1902).

Paul Pelliot (1878–1945) did an extensive amount of research on the stele, which, however, was only published posthumously, in 1984 (a second edition, revised by Forte was then published in 1996). His and Havret&#x27;s works are still regarded as the two &quot;standard books&quot; on the subject.

==Modern location, and replicas==

Since the late 19th century a number of European scholars opined in favor of somehow getting the stele out of China and into the British Museum or some other &quot;suitable&quot; location (e.g., Frederic H. Balfour in his letter published in &quot;The Times&quot; in early 1886). The Danish scholar and adventurer Frits Holm came to Xi&#x27;an in 1907 planning to take the monument for himself to Europe. Local authorities prevented him and moved the stele, complete with its tortoise, from its location near Chongren Temple to Xi&#x27;an&#x27;s Beilin Museum (Forest of Steles Museum).

Holm had an exact copy of the stele made for him and had the replica stele shipped to New York, planning to sell it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum&#x27;s director Caspar Purdon Clarke, however, was less than enthusiastic about purchasing &quot;so large a stone ... of no artistic value&quot;. Nonetheless, the replica stele was exhibited in the museum (&quot;on loan&quot; from Mr. Holm) for about 10 years. Eventually, in 1917 some Mrs. George Leary, a wealthy New Yorker, purchased the replica stele from Holm and sent it to Rome, as a gift to the Pope. Another full-sized replica cast from that replica, gifted by Mrs. George Leary in 1919, is on permanent display in the Bunn Intercultural Center on the campus of Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.).

The original Xi&#x27;an Stele remains in the Forest of Steles. It is now exhibited in the museum&#x27;s Room Number 2, and is the first stele on the left after the entry. When the official list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad was promulgated in 2003, the stele was included into this short list of particularly valuable and important items.

Other copies of the stele and its tortoise can be found near Xi&#x27;an Daqin Pagoda, on Mount Kōya in Japan, and, in Tianhe Church, Guangzhou.

==Other early Christian monuments in China==
Numerous Christian gravestones have also been found in China in the Xinjiang region, Quanzhou and elsewhere from a somewhat later period. There are also two much later stelae (from 960 and 1365) presenting a curious mix of Christian and Buddhist aspects, which are preserved at the site of the former Monastery of the Cross in the Fangshan District, near Beijing.

In 2006, a mortuary stone pillar with Church of the East inscriptions was discovered in Luoyang, the Nestorian pillar of Luoyang. Erected and engraved in 815, the inscriptions give partial details surrounding the background of a Sogdian Christian community living in Luoyang.

== In popular culture ==
* In the 20th episode of &quot;The Longest Day in Chang&#x27;an&quot;, the Monk Jingde () hands a missionary leaflet to Tan Qi (Rayzha Alimjan), which contains text taken from the inscription of the Xi&#x27;an Stele.

<text>Genetic variation is the difference in DNA among individuals or the differences between populations among the same species. The multiple sources of genetic variation include mutation and genetic recombination. Mutations are the ultimate sources of genetic variation, but other mechanisms, such as genetic drift, contribute to it, as well.

== Among individuals within a population ==

Genetic variation can be identified at many levels. Identifying genetic variation is possible from observations of phenotypic variation in either quantitative traits (traits that vary continuously and are coded for by many genes, e.g., leg length in dogs) or discrete traits (traits that fall into discrete categories and are coded for by one or a few genes, e.g., white, pink, or red petal color in certain flowers).

Genetic variation can also be identified by examining variation at the level of enzymes using the process of protein electrophoresis. Polymorphic genes have more than one allele at each locus. Half of the genes that code for enzymes in insects and plants may be polymorphic, whereas polymorphisms are less common among vertebrates.

Ultimately, genetic variation is caused by variation in the order of bases in the nucleotides in genes. New technology now allows scientists to directly sequence DNA, which has identified even more genetic variation than was previously detected by protein electrophoresis. Examination of DNA has shown genetic variation in both coding regions and in the noncoding intron region of genes.

Genetic variation will result in phenotypic variation if variation in the order of nucleotides in the DNA sequence results in a difference in the order of amino acids in proteins coded by that DNA sequence, and if the resultant differences in amino-acid sequence influence the shape, and thus the function of the enzyme.

== Between populations ==
Differences between populations resulting from geographic separation is known as geographic variation. Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow can all contribute to geographic variation.

== Measurement ==
Genetic variation within a population is commonly measured as the percentage of polymorphic gene loci or the percentage of gene loci in heterozygous individuals. The results can be very useful in understanding the process of adaption to the environment of each individual in the population.

== Sources ==
Random mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation. Mutations are likely to be rare, and most mutations are neutral or deleterious, but in some instances, the new alleles can be favored by natural selection. Polyploidy is an example of chromosomal mutation. Polyploidy is a condition wherein organisms have three or more sets of genetic variation (3n or more).

Crossing over (genetic recombination) and random segregation during meiosis can result in the production of new alleles or new combinations of alleles. Furthermore, random fertilization also contributes to variation. Variation and recombination can be facilitated by transposable genetic elements, endogenous retroviruses, LINEs, SINEs, etc. For a given genome of a multicellular organism, genetic variation may be acquired in somatic cells or inherited through the germline.

== Forms ==
Genetic variation can be divided into different forms according to the size and type of genomic variation underpinning genetic change.
Small-scale sequence variation (&lt;1 kilobase, kb) includes base-pair substitution and indels.
Large-scale structural variation (&gt;1 kb) can be either copy number variation (loss or gain), or chromosomal rearrangement (translocation, inversion, or Segmental acquired uniparental disomy). Genetic variation and recombination by transposable elements and endogenous retroviruses sometimes is supplemented by a variety of persistent viruses and their defectives which generate genetic novelty in host genomes.
Numerical variation in whole chromosomes or genomes can be either polyploidy or aneuploidy.

== Maintenance in populations ==
A variety of factors maintain genetic variation in populations. Potentially harmful recessive alleles can be hidden from selection in the heterozygous individuals in populations of diploid organisms (recessive alleles are only expressed in the less common homozygous individuals). Natural selection can also maintain genetic variation in balanced polymorphisms. Balanced polymorphisms may occur when heterozygotes are favored or when selection is frequency dependent.

==RNA viruses==

A high mutation rate caused by the lack of a proofreading mechanism appears to be a major source of the genetic variation that contributes to RNA virus evolution. Genetic recombination also has been shown to play a key role in generating the genetic variation that underlies RNA virus evolution. Numerous RNA viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. poliovirus). In the &quot;Retroviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA)(e.g. HIV), damage in the RNA genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcription by strand switching, a form of genetic recombination. Recombination also occurs in the &quot;Coronaviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. SARS). Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage. Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages. The resulting recombinant viruses may sometimes cause an outbreak of infection in humans.

== History of genetic variation ==
Evolutionary biologists are often concerned with genetic variation, a term which in modern times has come to refer to differences in DNA sequences among individuals. However, quantifying and understanding genetic variation has been a central aim of those interested in understanding the varied life on earth since long before the sequencing of the first full genome, and even before the discovery of DNA as the molecule responsible for heredity. 

While today&#x27;s definition of genetic variation relies on contemporary molecular genetics, the idea of heritable variation was of central importance to those interested in the substance and development of life even before the writings of Charles Darwin. The concept of heritable variation—the presence of innate differences between life forms that are passed from parents to offspring, especially within categories such as species—does not rely on modern ideas of genetics, which were unavailable to 18th- and 19th-century minds.

=== Pre-Darwinian concepts of heritable variation ===
In the mid-1700s, Pierre Louis Maupertuis, a French scholar now known primarily for his work in mathematics and physics, posited that while species have a true, original form, accidents during the development of nascent offspring could introduce variations that could accumulate over time. In his 1750 &quot;Essaie de Cosmologie&quot;, he proposed that the species we see today are only a small fraction of the many variations produced by &quot;a blind destiny&quot;, and that many of these variations did not &quot;conform&quot; to their needs, thus did not survive. In fact, some historians even suggest that his ideas anticipated the laws of inheritance further developed by Gregor Mendel.

Simultaneously, French philosopher Denis Diderot proposed a different framework for the generation of heritable variation. Diderot borrowed Maupertuis&#x27; idea that variation could be introduced during reproduction and the subsequent growth of offspring, and thought that production of a &quot;normal&quot; organism was no more probable than production of a &quot;monstrous&quot; one. However, Diderot also believed that matter itself had lifelike properties and could self-assemble into structures with the potential for life. Diderot&#x27;s ideas on biological transformation, introduced in his 1749 work &quot;Letter on the Blind&quot;, were thus focused on variability of spontaneously generated forms, not variability within existing species.

Both Maupertuis and Diderot built on the ideas of Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius, who wrote in &quot;De rerum natura&quot; that all the universe was created by random chance, and only the beings that were not self-contradictory survived. Maupertuis&#x27; work is distinguished from the work of both Lucretius and Diderot in his use of the concept of conformity in explaining differential survival of beings, a new idea among those who believed that life changed over time.

Like Diderot, two other influential minds of the 18th century—Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck—believed that only very simple organisms could be generated by spontaneous generation, so another mechanism was necessary to generate the great variability of complex life observed on earth. Erasmus Darwin proposed that changes acquired during an animal&#x27;s life could be passed to its offspring, and that these changes seemed to be produced by the animal&#x27;s endeavors to meet its basic needs. Similarly, Lamarck&#x27;s theory of the variability among living things was rooted in patterns of use and disuse, which he believed led to heritable physiological changes. Both Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck believed that variation, whether it arose during development or during the animal&#x27;s life, was heritable, a key step in theories of change over time extending from individuals to populations.

In the subsequent century, William Herschel&#x27;s telescopic observations of diverse nebulae across the night sky suggested to him that different nebulae could each be in different stages in the process of condensation. This idea, which came to be known as the nebular hypothesis, suggested that natural processes could both create order out of matter and introduce variation, and that these processes could be observed over time. While it may seem to the modern reader that astronomical theories are irrelevant to theories of organic variation, these ideas became significantly conflated with ideas of biological transformation—what we now know as evolution—in the mid-19th century, laying important groundwork for the work of subsequent thinkers such as Charles Darwin. 

=== Darwin&#x27;s concept of heritable variation ===
Charles Darwin&#x27;s ideas of heritable variation were shaped by both his own scientific work and the ideas of his contemporaries and predecessors. Darwin ascribed heritable variation to many factors, but particularly emphasized environmental forces acting on the body. His theory of inheritance was rooted in the (now disproven) idea of gemmules - small, hypothetical particles, which capture the essence of an organism and travel from all over the body to the reproductive organs, from which they are passed to offspring. Darwin believed that the causal relationship between the environment and the body was so complex that the variation this relationship produced was inherently unpredictable. However, like Lamarck, he acknowledged that variability could also be introduced by patterns of use and disuse of organs. Darwin was fascinated by variation in both natural and domesticated populations, and his realization that individuals in a population exhibited seemingly purposeless variation was largely driven by his experiences working with animal breeders. Darwin believed that species changed gradually, through the accumulation of small, continuous variations, a concept that would remain hotly contested into the 20th century.

=== Post-Darwinian concepts of heritable variation ===
In the 20th century, a field that came to be known as population genetics developed. This field seeks to understand and quantify genetic variation. The section below consists of a timeline of selected developments in population genetics, with a focus on methods for quantifying genetic variation.

* 1866 - Heterozygosity: Gregor Mendel&#x27;s hybridization experiments introduced the concept that in the 1950s came to be recognized as heterozygosity. In a diploid species, one that contains two copies of DNA within each cell (one from each parent), an individual is said to be a heterozygote at a particular location in the genome if its two copies of DNA differ at that site. Heterozygosity, the average frequency of heterozygotes in a population, became a fundamental measure of the genetic variation in a population by the mid-20th century. If the heterozygosity of a population is zero, every individual is homozygous; that is, every individual has two copies of the same allele at the locus of interest and no genetic variation exists. 
* 1918 - Variance: In a seminal paper entitled &quot;The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance&quot;, R.A. Fisher introduced the statistical concept of variance; the average of squared deviations of a collection of observations from their mean (formula_1), where formula_2 is the variance and formula_3 is the mean of the population from which the observations formula_4 are drawn). R.A. Fisher&#x27;s work in population genetics was not just important to population genetics; these ideas would also form the foundations of modern statistics.
* 1918, 1921 - Additive and dominant genetic variance: R.A. Fisher subsequently subdivided his general definition of variance into two components relevant to population genetics: additive and dominant genetic variance. An additive genetic model assumes that genes do not interact if the number of the genes affecting the phenotype is small and that a trait value can be estimated simply by summing the effect of each gene on the trait. Under Fisher&#x27;s model, the total genetic variance is the sum of the additive genetic variance (the variance in a trait due to these additive effects) and the dominant genetic variance (which accounts for interactions between genes).
* 1948 - Entropy: Unlike variance, which was developed with the purpose of quantifying genetic variance, Claude Shannon&#x27;s measure of diversity, now known as Shannon entropy, was developed as part of his work in communication theory as a way to quantify the amount of information contained in a message. However, the method quickly found use in population genetics, and was the central method used to quantify genetic diversity in a seminal paper by Richard Lewontin, &quot;The Apportionment of Human Genetic Diversity&quot;.
* 1951&quot; - &quot;F-statistics: F-statistics, also known as fixation indices, were developed by population geneticist Sewall Wright to quantify differences in genetic variation within and between populations. The most common of these statistics, FST, considers in its simplest definition two different versions of a gene, or alleles, and two populations that contain one or both of these two alleles. FST quantifies the genetic variability among these two populations by computing the average frequency of heterozygotes across the two populations relative to the frequency of heterozygotes if the two populations were pooled. F-statistics introduced the idea of quantifying hierarchical concepts of variance and would become the foundation of many important population genetic methods, including a set of methods that tests for evidence of natural selection in the genome.

<doc id="364438" wikidata="Q61927" url="?curid=364438" title="Hellmuth Walter">
<text>Hellmuth Walter (26 August 1900 – 16 December 1980) was a German engineer who pioneered research into rocket engines and gas turbines. His most noteworthy contributions were rocket motors for the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Bachem Ba 349 interceptor aircraft, so-called &quot;Starthilfe&quot; jettisonable rocket propulsion units used for a variety of Luftwaffe aircraft during World War II, and a revolutionary new propulsion system for submarines known as air-independent propulsion (AIP).

== Early life ==

Walter began training as a machinist in 1917 in Hamburg and in 1921 commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). He left before completing these studies, however, in order to take up a position at the Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan, a major shipyard. Walter&#x27;s experience with marine engines here led him to become interested in overcoming some of the limitations of the internal combustion engine. He reasoned that an engine powered by a fuel source already rich with oxygen would not require an external supply of oxygen (from the atmosphere or from tanks). This would have obvious advantages for powering submarines and torpedoes.

Research suggested that hydrogen peroxide was a suitable monopropellant fuel—in the presence of a suitable catalyst it would break down into oxygen and steam at high temperature. The heat of the reaction would cause the oxygen and steam to expand, and this could be used as a source of pressure. Walter also realised that another fuel could be injected into this hot mixture of gases to provide combustion and therefore more power. He patented this idea in 1925.

== Entrepreneur ==
After working for some time at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, Walter branched out on his own in 1934 to form his own company, Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft (&quot;HWK&quot;, or &quot;Walter-Werke&quot;), to further research and development of his ideas. That same year, he made a proposal to the &quot;Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine&quot; (OKM – Naval High Command) suggesting that a submarine powered by one of these engines would have considerable speed advantages over the conventional combination of diesel engine(s) for surface running and electric motor(s) while submerged. The proposal was met with much scepticism, but Walter persisted, and in 1937 showed his plans to Karl Dönitz, who was able to assist in obtaining a contract to produce a prototype. Construction started in 1939 on a small research submarine designated the V-80. When it was launched in 1940, the submarine demonstrated a top speed of 23 knots submerged, twice that of any submarine in the world at the time. Despite these spectacular results, problems with the production, supply, and safe handling of hydrogen peroxide prevented wide-scale implementation of Walter&#x27;s revolutionary engine. In the end, only a handful of German Type XVII submarines were built using this engine, and none saw combat.

== Rocket engines ==

At the same time that Walter was developing submarine engines, he was also applying his ideas to rocketry. The high-pressure gas mixture created by the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide could not only be used in a turbine, but if simply directed out of a nozzle, created considerable thrust. Wernher von Braun&#x27;s rocketry team working at Peenemünde expressed interest in Walter&#x27;s ideas, and in 1936 began a programme of installing Walter rockets into aircraft. The experimental results obtained by von Braun created interest among Germany&#x27;s aircraft manufacturers, including Heinkel and Messerschmitt, and in 1939, the Heinkel He 176 became the first aircraft to fly on liquid-fuelled rocket power alone. This type of engine went on to become the cornerstone of the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered fighter, when married to Alexander Lippisch&#x27;s revolutionary airframe design. Throughout the course of World War II, Walter&#x27;s aircraft engines became increasingly powerful and refined. The original design of simply decomposing hydrogen peroxide was soon changed to its use as an oxidizer (much like dinitrogen tetroxide would be used later) when combined with a hydrazine/methanol true rocket fuel designated C-Stoff, into the hot, high-pressure gases, and in later, never-deployed developments, a second, 400 kg (880 lb) thrust &quot;cruising&quot; combustion chamber, nicknamed a &quot;Marschofen&quot;, was added below the main chamber to allow for more precise control of the engine. Versions of this engine were intended to power a variety of aircraft design proposals and missile projects and was also licence-built in Japan (see HWK 109-509).

Another Walter engine was used to assist heavily laden aircraft to take off (JATO or RATO). When the rockets&#x27; fuel had run out, they would separate from the aircraft and return to the ground by parachute for refurbishment and re-use (see Walther HWK 109-500).

In 1945, Walter was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross for his wartime service. Walter was captured by a British Army unit named T-Force following a 60-mile advance behind German lines to prevent his research falling into the hands of the advancing Russians. His factory was then investigated by 30 Assault Unit, a unit of Royal Marines which had been established by &quot;James Bond&quot; author Ian Fleming.

== Post-war career ==

The end of the war saw all of his research materials confiscated by the British military and Walter and his colleagues taken to the UK to work for the Royal Navy. With Walter&#x27;s co-operation, one of the German submarines using his drive, the U-1407 was raised from where it had been scuttled and re-commissioned as HMS &quot;Meteorite&quot;. The Royal Navy constructed two more submarines using AIP engines before abandoning research in this direction in favour of nuclear power.

Allowed to return to Germany in 1948, Walter worked for the Paul Seifert Engine Works. In 1950 he emigrated to the United States and joined the Worthington Pump Corporation of Harrison, New Jersey, eventually becoming vice president of research and development. In 1956 he founded the company Hellmuth Walter GmbH in Kiel, and in 1967 constructed a civilian submarine, STINT, with Walter propulsion.

<text>Walter Seymour Allward (18 November 1874 – 24 April 1955) was a Canadian monumental sculptor best known for the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. Featuring expressive classical figures within modern compositions, Allward&#x27;s monuments evoke themes of memory, sacrifice, and redemption. He has been widely praised for his &quot;original sense of spatial composition, his mastery of the classical form and his brilliant craftsmanship&quot;.

Allward&#x27;s 1917 heroic monument, the Bell Telephone Memorial, has been seen as the finest example of his early works. It brought the sculptor fame and led to Allward later creating the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France, his most renowned work. Some of the sculptor&#x27;s works have also been acquired by the National Gallery in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In addition to his sculptural works, Allward produced a series of approximately one hundred allegorical drawings exploring the subject of war at the onset of the Second World War.

Allward has been described as &quot;probably Canada&#x27;s most important monumental sculptor in the first third of [the 20th] century&quot;. However, his name was largely forgotten following his death in 1955 until 2001, when he was portrayed as a fictional character in Jane Urquhart&#x27;s celebrated novel &quot;The Stone Carvers&quot;.

== Early life ==

Allward was born in Toronto, the son of John A. Allward and Emma Pittman of Newfoundland. Educated in Toronto public schools, his first job was at the age of 14 as an assistant to his carpenter father. Allward first served an apprenticeship with the architectural firm Gibson and Simpson before working at the Don Valley Brick Works, where he modelled architectural ornaments. There he showed skill in clay mold making. This early training, supplemented by modelling classes at the New Technical School, prepared Allward for his lifelong career as a monumental sculptor.

== Body of works ==

=== Early work ===

Allward&#x27;s first commission was for the figure of &quot;Peace&quot; on the Memorial of the Battles in the North-West (1895) in Queen&#x27;s Park, Toronto. He won this competition at the age of nineteen, despite possessing minimal training as a sculptor. Other early works included a life-sized figure of Dr Oronhyatekha commissioned by the Independent Order of Foresters for the opening of the Temple Building in Toronto (1899), and the &quot;Old Soldier&quot;, commemorating the War of 1812 in Toronto&#x27;s Portland Square (now Victoria Memorial Square) (1903). Also in 1903, he was elected an associate of the Royal Canadian Academy and in 1918 became a full academician. Now well established he received commissions to do busts of Lord Tennyson, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and others. On the grounds of Queen&#x27;s Park are statues of General John Graves Simcoe and Sir Oliver Mowat, completed in 1903 and 1905 respectively.

=== Heroic monuments ===
Allward&#x27;s true talent lay in his heroic monuments. These included the design work for the &quot;Boer War Memorial Fountain&quot; in Windsor, Ontario (1906), the &quot;South African War Memorial&quot; in Toronto (1910), The Baldwin-Lafontaine Monument on Parliament Hill in Ottawa (1914) and the Bell Memorial commemorating Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s invention of telephone in Brantford, Ontario (1917). Allward had also completed design work on a memorial to King Edward VII but the onset of the World War I prevented its completion. The figures of &quot;Veritas&quot; (Truth) and &quot;Iustitia&quot; (Justice) were cast in bronze for the memorial. They were found in their crates in 1969 buried under a parking lot, and in 1970 were installed outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. Allward also designed numerous municipal cenotaphs around the country, including the &quot;Stratford Memorial&quot; (1922), the &quot;Peterborough Memorial&quot; (1929) and the Brant War Memorial (1933).

=== Bell Memorial ===

In 1906 the citizens of the Brantford and Brant County areas formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in July 1874 at his parents&#x27; home, Melville House, in Brantford, Ontario. Allward&#x27;s design was the unanimous choice from among 10 submitted models, winning the competition. The memorial was originally to be completed by 1912 but Allward did not finish it until five years later. The Governor General of Canada, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, ceremoniously unveiled the memorial on 24 October 1917.

Allward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone&#x27;s ability to overcome distances. A series of steps lead to the main section where the allegorical figures of &quot;Inspiration&quot; appears over a reclining male figure representing &quot;Man, the inventor&quot;, and also pointing to the floating figures of &quot;Knowledge&quot;, &quot;Joy&quot;, and &quot;Sorrow&quot;, positioned at the other end of the tableau. At each end of the memorial there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing &quot;Humanity&quot;, one sending and the other receiving a message.

The Bell Telephone Memorial&#x27;s grandeur has been described as the finest example of Allward&#x27;s early work, propelling the sculptor to fame. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford&#x27;s history, helping the city style itself as &quot;The Telephone City&quot;.

=== Vimy Memorial ===
The most important and famous commission Allward received was for the monument to commemorate Canadians killed in the First World War, a project which would occupy him from 1921 till the memorial&#x27;s unveiling, by King Edward VIII, on 26 July 1936. There was a huge crowd of approximately 100,000 people present at the ceremony
including over 50,000 Canadian and French veterans and their families. The Vimy Memorial was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996. After a $30 million restoration, the monument was re-dedicated on 9 April 2007.

Allward had made 150 design sketches before submitting the final plan which won the commission from the Canadian federal government. The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission eventually selected Vimy Ridge as the location for the memorial, due largely to its elevation above the plain below, as the preferred site of Allward&#x27;s design. The site (Hill 145) was donated by France in perpetuity. In June 1922, Allward set up a studio in London, England and toured for more almost two years to find a stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity for the memorial. He eventually found it in the ruins of Diocletian&#x27;s Palace. Known as Seget limestone, it was a stone that came from an ancient Roman quarry located in Croatia. The stone had to be first quarried then shipped by boat to France and then transported to Vimy Ridge by truck and by rail.

Allward chose a relatively new construction method, a cast concrete frame to which the limestone was bonded. The memorial base and twin pylons contain almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone on a bed of about 15,000 tonnes of concrete. The 20 sculptured symbolic figures, representing Christian and universal virtues, were actually carved where they now stand, from the huge blocks of stone. The professional carvers used life-size plaster models produced by Allward in his London studio and an enlarging instrument called a pantograph to make calculations that allowed for reproducing the figures at double life-size. All this work was carried out inside temporary studios built around each figure, including those at the top of the pylons. The first figure to be completed was &quot;Canada Bereft&quot;, which stands at the top of the front wall of the Vimy Memorial and recalls traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary in mourning. &quot;Canada Bereft&quot; is now one of the most well-known sculptures in Canadian art. The figures atop the pylons represent the universal virtues of charity, faith, honour, hope, justice, knowledge, peace, and truth. &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Knowledge&quot; have the wings of angels—an attribute usually associated with representations of Victory, which is not included in this monument to grief.

Most of the original plaster figures are stored at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.
The final step called for carving the names of 11,285 Canadians who were killed in France and are buried in unknown sites on the memorial&#x27;s walls. The time required to build the massive concrete and steel base, to obtain some 6,000 tons of stone from Croatia, to build roads and clear the site of mines and graves, as well as other issues, led to significant delays. In 1930, Prime Minister R. B. Bennett insisted that the project be completed by 1932 but that deadline was missed by four years. The total cost was approximately $1.5 million.

== Works ==
== Honours ==
In 1944, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George &quot;for distinguished service to Canadian Art&quot;. He was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. On 30 June 1938, he was recognized by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in a motion before the House of Commons of Canada which stated &quot;that this house desires particularly to express its appreciation of the services of Mr. Walter S. Allward, who, as the designer and Canadian War Memorials architect of the memorial at Vimy, has given to the world, a work of art of outstanding beauty and character. Through the years to come the Vimy Memorial will remain the symbol of Canada&#x27;s efforts in the war, and its tribute to those who, on the field of battle, sought to preserve the free institutions of mankind.&quot;

Allward has been designated as an Historic Person in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations.

== Legacy ==

The art of Walter Allward lives on in numerous substantial monument and designs in Canada and abroad. He was first elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1903, and his bronze diploma work of 1920, &quot;The Storm&quot;, was acquired for the National Gallery of Canada. He is a character in Jane Urquhart&#x27;s book The Stone Carvers.

<doc id="364442" wikidata="Q3348135" url="?curid=364442" title="Objectivism (poetry)">
<text>The Objectivists were a loose-knit group of second-generation Modernist poets who emerged in the 1930s, members of a poetic movement within the broader movement of literary Modernism known as Objectivism. The group consisted primarily of American nationals and was influenced by Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams, among other contemporaneous writers. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics, as defined by Louis Zukofsky, were to treat the poem as an object and to emphasize sincerity, intelligence, and the poet&#x27;s ability to look clearly at the world. While the name of the movement is the same as that of Ayn Rand&#x27;s school of philosophy, the two movements are not affiliated.

The core group consisted of the Americans Zukofsky, Williams, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi, and the British poet Basil Bunting. Later, another American poet, Lorine Niedecker, became associated with the group. A number of other poets were included in early publications under the Objectivist rubric without actually sharing the attitudes and approaches to poetry of this core group. Although these poets generally suffered critical neglect, especially in their early careers, and a number of them abandoned the practice of writing and/or publishing poetry for a time, they were to prove highly influential for later generations of writers working in the tradition of modernist poetry in English.

==Roots==
The period 1909 to 1913 saw the emergence of Imagism, the first consciously &quot;avant garde&quot; movement in 20th century English-language poetry. Pound, who was Imagism&#x27;s prime mover, served as foreign editor of Harriet Monroe&#x27;s magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;. In October 1912, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Richard Aldington under the label &quot;Imagiste&quot;. Aldington&#x27;s poems were printed in the November issue, and H.D.&#x27;s appeared in the January 1913 issue. The March 1913 issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; also contained Pound&#x27;s &quot;A Few Don&#x27;ts by an Imagiste&quot; and F. S. Flint&#x27;s essay &quot;Imagisme&quot;. This publication history meant that this London-based movement had its first readership in the United States. It also meant that Imagism was available as a model for American Modernist poets of the next generation.

Zukofsky was one such poet. He published a poem in &quot;Poetry&quot; in 1924 and introduced himself to Pound in 1927, when he sent the older poet his &quot;Poem beginning &#x27;The,&#x27;&quot;. Pound published the poem in his magazine &quot;The Exile&quot;, and a long correspondence and friendship between the two began. This relationship was strengthened by Zukofsky&#x27;s 1929 essay on Pound&#x27;s long work in progress &quot;The Cantos&quot;. Pound also provided an introduction to William Carlos Williams, a physician and poet who had been a classmate of Pound&#x27;s while at the University of Pennsylvania and who lived in Rutherford, New Jersey, not far from Zukofsky. Zukofsky and Williams quickly became close friends and were to be literary collaborators for the rest of Williams&#x27;s life.
Another of Zukofsky&#x27;s literary mentors at this period was Charles Reznikoff, a New York City poet whose early work was also influenced by Imagism. By 1928, the young American poet George Oppen and his wife Mary Oppen had become friendly with Zukofsky and Reznikoff. Another young American poet, Carl Rakosi, started corresponding with Pound around this time, and the older poet again recommended him to Zukofsky. The final member of the core group, Basil Bunting, was an English poet who came from a Quaker background and who had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector during World War I. In 1923, Bunting met Pound in Paris and the two men developed a close literary friendship, with Bunting living near Pound at Rapallo from 1931 to 1933. In 1930, Bunting published his first collection of poetry, &quot;Redimiculum Matellarum&quot;, and Pound introduced him to Zukofsky.

The term &#x27;Objectivist&#x27; developed because Harriet Monroe insisted on a group name for the February 1931 issue of &quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot;, which Monroe had allowed Zukofsky to guest edit, at Pound&#x27;s urging. Zukofsky recounts the occasion with Monroe in &quot;Prepositions&quot;: &quot;Harriet Monroe at the time insisted, we&#x27;d better have a title for it, call it something. I said, I don&#x27;t want to. She insisted; so, I said, alright, if I can define it in an essay, and I used two words, sincerity and objectification, and I was sorry immediately. But it&#x27;s gone down into the history books; they forgot the founder, thank heavens, and kept the terms, and, of course, I said objectivist, and they said objectivism and that makes all the difference. Well, that was pretty bad, so then I spent the next thirty years trying to make it simple.&quot; It also seems that the core group did not see themselves as a coherent movement but rather as a group of individual poets with some shared approach to their art. As well as the matters covered in Zukofsky&#x27;s essays, the elements of this approach included: a respect for Imagist achievement in the areas of &quot;vers libre&quot; and highly concentrated language and imagery; a rejection of the Imagists&#x27; interest in classicism and mythology; for Reznikoff, Zukofsky, Rakosi and Oppen, a shared Jewish heritage (which, for all but Oppen included an early childhood in which English was not their first language); generally left-wing, and, in the cases of Zukofsky, Rakosi, and Oppen at least, Marxist politics.

==Early publications==
The first appearance of the group was in a special issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine in February 1931; this was arranged for by Pound and edited by Zukofsky (Vol. 37, No. 5). In addition to poems by Rakosi, Zukofsky, Reznikoff, George Oppen, Basil Bunting and William Carlos Williams, Zukofsky included work by a number of poets who would have little or no further association with the group: Howard Weeks, Robert McAlmon, Joyce Hopkins, Norman Macleod, Kenneth Rexroth, S. Theodore Hecht, Harry Roskolenkier, Henry Zolinsky, Whittaker Chambers, Jesse Lowenthal, Emanuel Carnevali (as translator of Arthur Rimbaud), John Wheelwright, Richard Johns and Martha Champion. An appendix (&quot;Symposium&quot;) featured texts by Parker Tyler and Charles Henri Ford, with a &quot;note&quot; by Zukofsky, a text by Samuel Putnam and Zukofsky&#x27;s translation of a short essay on the poetry of André Salmon by his friend René Taupin.

The issue also contained Zukofsky&#x27;s essays &quot;Program: &#x27;Objectivists&#x27; 1931&quot; and &quot;Sincerity and Objectification: With Special Reference to the Work of Charles Reznikoff&quot;, a reworking of a study of Reznikoff&#x27;s work originally written some time earlier. In this second essay, Zukofsky expands on the basic tenets of Objectivist poetics, stating that in sincerity &quot;Writing occurs which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody&quot;, and that objectification relates to &quot;the appearance of the art form as an object.&quot; This position echoes Pound&#x27;s 1918 dictum (in an essay, &quot;A Retrospective&quot;, in which he is looking back at Imagism) &quot;I believe in technique as the test of a man&#x27;s sincerity&quot;.

===Some example poems===

As an example, Zukofsky cites the following short section from &quot;A Group of Verse&quot;, a long poem sequence that was Reznikoff&#x27;s contribution to the issue:

:Among the heaps of brick and plaster lies
:a girder, still itself among the rubbish.

In which the girder among the rubbish represents –for Zukofsky– the poem as object, sincere in itself. Oppen continued to refer to these lines as a poetic touchstone as late as 1976, though he would often misremember them as &quot;a girder, still itself among the &quot;rubble&quot;.&quot;

Oppen&#x27;s own contribution was a poem titled &quot;1930s&quot;, later collected 
(without the title) as the opening section of Oppen&#x27;s first collection 
called &quot;Discrete Series&quot;, a book-length poem sequence.
&lt;poem&gt;
:The knowledge not of sorrow, you were
::saying, but of boredom
:Is — aside from reading speaking
::smoking —
:Of what, Maude Blessingbourne it was,
::wished to know when, having risen,
:“approached the window as if to see
::what really was going on”;
:And saw rain falling, in the distance
::more slowly,
:The road clear from her past the window-
::glass —
:Of the world, weather-swept, with which
::one shares the century.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Of his own poetry, Zukofsky chose to include &quot;A&quot; — Seventh Movement, the first part of a six-page section from what was to become an 800-page poem. This extract takes as its subject a set of roadworks in the street outside his New York home:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Horses: who will do it? out of manes? Words
:Will do it, out of manes, out of airs, but
:They have no manes, so there are no airs, birds
:Of words, from me to them no singing gut.
:For they have no eyes, for their legs are wood,
:For their stomachs are logs with print on them;
:Blood red, red lamps hang from necks or where could
:Be necks, two legs stand A, four together M.
:&quot;Street Closed&quot; is what print says on their stomachs;
:That cuts out everybody but the diggers;
:You&#x27;re cut out, and she&#x27;s cut out, and the jiggers
:Are cut out. No! we can&#x27;t have such nor bucks
::As won&#x27;t, tho they&#x27;re not here, pass thru a hoop
::Strayed on a manhole — me? Am on a stoop.
extract from &quot;A&quot;-&quot;7&quot; by Louis Zukofsky
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Language and poetry===
Another aspect of Objectivist poetics that is not explicitly addressed in these essays is an interest in exploiting the resonances of small, everyday words. As Zukofsky was to write some time later (in 1946), &quot;a case can be made for the poet giving some of his life to the use of the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot;: both of which are weighted with as much epos and historical destiny as one man can perhaps resolve. Those who do not believe this are too sure that the little words mean nothing among so many other words.&quot; This concern is also reflected in Oppen&#x27;s statement &quot;if we still possessed the word &#x27;is&#x27;, there would be no need to write poems&quot;.

===Reaction===
Reaction to the issue was not uniformly welcoming, and the March 1931 issue of the magazine contained a hostile response by the editor herself under the title &quot;The Arrogance of Youth&quot;. Monroe was particularly angered by Zukofsky&#x27;s rejection of Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, Edgar Lee Masters, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, all of whom were regular contributors to the magazine. However, not all reactions were so unfavorable; Niedecker read the issue at her local public library in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, and wrote to Zukofsky shortly thereafter, beginning a friendship and frequent literary correspondence that would last until her death 40 years later.

The &quot;Poetry&quot; issue was followed in 1932 by the Zukofsky-edited &quot;An &#x27;Objectivist&#x27; Anthology&quot;. This anthology featured far fewer contributors: Basil Bunting, Mary Butts, Frances Fletcher, Robert McAlmon, George Oppen, Ezra Pound, Carl Rakosi, Kenneth Rexroth, Charles Reznikoff, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky and Forest Anderson, T. S. Eliot, R. B. N. Warriston and Jerry Reisman. The anthology served to highlight the differences between these poets as much as their shared attitudes to writing. Much of the difference stemmed from Zukofsky&#x27;s insistence on form over content, which conflicted with many of the other poets&#x27; concern with the real world. As Rakosi would later write: &quot;if Reznikoff was an Objectivist, Zukofsky is not and never was one.&quot;

&quot;An Objectivist Anthology&quot; was published by &quot;To, Publishers,&quot; a small press organized by Zukofsky, Reznikoff and George and Mary Oppen, and funded from Oppen&#x27;s small private income. Zukofsky acted as general editor from New York City, for which he drew a small monthly salary, and the Oppen&#x27;s arranged for the books&#x27; typesetting and printing from Le Beausset, a small village in the south of France where the were living. The press also published &quot;A Novelette and Other Prose&quot; (1932) by Williams and &quot;Prolegomena 1&quot; (1932) by Ezra Pound. This was a reprint of two of Pound&#x27;s prose books, &quot;How to Read&quot; and &quot;The Spirit of Romance&quot;, bound in one volume. While the press had ambitious plans, planning to print Williams&#x27; uncollected prose, Pound&#x27;s complete critical works, Bunting&#x27;s translation of Italian poet Federigo Tozzi, Zukofsky&#x27;s &quot;55 Poems&quot;, and at least one book by Reznikoff, the press ran into several problems, and folded late in 1932 before any more volumes appeared.

The returned to the United States in 1932 and, together with Zukofsky, Williams, and Reznikoff, went on to form the Objectivist Press to publish more books of Objectivist work. The first titles to appear were Williams&#x27; &quot;Collected Poems 1921–31&quot; (1934), with an introduction by Wallace Stevens, Oppen&#x27;s &quot;Discrete Series,&quot; with an introduction by Ezra Pound, followed by Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem the Golden,&quot; (1934, poetry), his &quot;Testimony,&quot; (1934, prose), with an introduction by Kenneth Burke and his &quot;In Memoriam: 1933&quot; (1934, poetry). Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Separate Way&quot; (1936) was the last publication of The Objectivist Press, not counting Zukofsky&#x27;s &quot;A Test of Poetry&quot; (1948), which was published under its imprint twelve years later.

==Aftermath of Objectivism==
In 1935, the joined the Communist Party of America, and George abandoned poetry in favor of political activism. In 1950, the couple moved to Mexico to escape the strongly anti-Communist political atmosphere of the times. It would be 1958 before Oppen wrote any further poetry. The returned to New York in 1960, and George went on to publish six books of poetry between 1962 and 1978, by which time he was finding it increasingly difficult to write—he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for &quot;Of Being Numerous&quot;. Mary Oppen published an account of their life, including a close-up view of the Objectivist period, in her 1978 memoir &quot;Meaning a Life&quot;. George Oppen died in 1984, and Mary died in 1990.

After publishing his 1941 &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, Carl Rakosi also abandoned poetry, dedicating himself to a career as a social worker. Shortly after turning 21, Rakosi had legally changed his name to Callman Rawley under which name he served as the head of the Minneapolis Jewish Children&#x27;s and Family Service from 1945 until his retirement in 1968. An unexpected letter received from the English poet Andrew Crozier in 1965 about his early poetry encouraged Rakosi to start writing and publishing poetry again. A collection, &quot;Amulet&quot;, was published by New Directions Publishers in 1967, and a number of other volumes were to appear over the following 46 years. These included his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1986. Rakosi died in 2004, aged 100.

After &quot;Redimiculum Matellarum&quot;, Bunting&#x27;s next book publication was &quot;Poems: 1950&quot;. After a lively decade spent largely working in Iran for the British foreign service and The Times of London, Bunting returned to live in his native Northumbria after his expulsion from Iran in 1952 by Mossadeq, and the 1960s were to prove to be a very productive decade for him. Publications from this time include possibly his best-known work, the long poem &quot;Briggflatts&quot; (1966), described by critic Cyril Connolly as &quot;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;&quot;, and &quot; Collected Poems&quot; (1968, revised editions 1978 and 1985). An &quot;Uncollected Poems&quot; appeared in 1991 and his &quot;Complete Poems&quot; in 2000.

In 1933, Niedecker visited Zukofsky in New York, where she and Zukofsky were rumored to have had a brief affair. She soon returned to her home in rural Wisconsin, a landscape that was to influence much of her later writing. Her first book, &quot;New Goose&quot;, was published by the James A. Decker Press in 1946. As was the case for many of the other Objectivists, a combination of critical neglect and personal circumstances meant that this early publication was followed by a longish period of poetic silence during which she was unable to find a publisher for her work. Although she continued writing for much of the intervening period, her next book, &quot;My Friend Tree&quot;, did not appear until 1961. She published relatively frequently after that, and her &quot;Collected Works&quot; appeared in 2002.

In 1941, Reznikoff published a collection of poems called &quot;Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down&quot;. After that, although he continued to write and to publish in periodicals, his poetry had no further book publication until the 1959 &quot;Inscriptions: 1944–1956&quot;. In 1962, New Directions published a selection of poems called &quot;By the Waters of Manhattan&quot;. Three years later, they brought out &quot; Testimony: The United States, 1885–1890: Recitative&quot;, the first installment of a long work based on court records covering the period 1855 to 1915. The book was a commercial and critical flop, and New Directions dropped him. In the 1970s, Black Sparrow Press started publishing Reznikoff, bringing out the complete &quot;Testimony&quot; as well as a similar work, &quot;Holocaust&quot;, based on courtroom accounts of Nazi concentration camps. In the years after Reznikoff&#x27;s death in 1976, Black Sparrow brought all his major works back into print.

Zukofsky had begun work on a long poem in 24 parts called &quot;A&quot; in 1927. The first seven &quot;movements&quot; of this work appeared in the &quot;Objectivist Anthology&quot;, having previously appeared in magazines. These early sections show the influence of &quot;The Cantos&quot;, though Zukofsky was to further develop his own style and voice as &quot;A&quot; progressed. The 1930s also saw him continue his involvement in Marxist politics, an interest that went back to his college friendship with Whittaker Chambers.

Although he would continue to write short poems and prose works, notably the 1963 &quot;Bottom: On Shakespeare&quot;, the completion of &quot;A&quot; was to be the major concern of the remainder of Zukofsky&#x27;s writing life. As the poem progressed, formal considerations tended to be foregrounded more and more, with Zukofsky applying a wide range of devices and approaches, from the sonnet to aleatory or random composition. The final complete edition was going to press as the poet lay on his deathbed in 1978. His final written work was the index to this volume.

==Legacy==
The early critical reception of the Objectivists was generally hostile, particularly in reviews by Morris Schappes and Yvor Winters, as well as Harriet Monroe&#x27;s already-mentioned unfavorable reaction to the &quot;Poetry&quot; special issue. However, they did have an immediate impact, especially on the work of their two Imagist mentors, Williams and Pound. Williams and Zukofsky were to maintain a lifelong personal and creative relationship which was to prove important for both men. For Zukofsky, the example of Williams helped to keep him focused on external realities and things. For Williams, Zukofsky served as a reminder of the importance of form. As Mark Scroggins writes, &quot;from Zukofsky, Williams learned to shape his often amorphous verse into more sharply chiselled measures.&quot;

Pound, too, was influenced by the Objectivist sense of form, their focus on everyday vocabulary, and their interests in politics, economics and specifically American subject matter. The critic Hugh Kenner has argued that these influences helped shape the sections of &quot;The Cantos&quot; published during the 1930s, writing &quot;Pound was reading them, and they him&quot;.

The poets of the Beat Generation, a group of American bohemian writers to emerge at the end of the 1940s that included Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder and Jack Kerouac, owed much to Pound and Williams, and were led, through them, to the Objectivists. In the 1950s and 1960s, Zukofsky was sought out by younger poets including Paul Blackburn, Jerome Rothenberg, Jonathan Williams, Denise Levertov, Gilbert Sorrentino and Allen Ginsberg. His work was also well known to the Black Mountain poets, especially Robert Creeley and Cid Corman, whose &quot;Origin&quot; magazine and press were to serve as valuable publishing outlets for the older poet.

Zukofsky&#x27;s formal procedures, especially his interest in aleatory writing, were a key influence on Jackson Mac Low and John Cage, amongst others, and through them on the Language School, an &quot;avant garde&quot; group of poets who started publishing in the 1970s and who included Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, Bob Perelman, Michael Palmer, Rae Armantrout, Carla Harryman, Barrett Watten, Clark Coolidge, Hannah Weiner, Susan Howe, Tina Darragh and Fanny Howe.

Oppen and Reznikoff influenced subsequent generations of poets, most notably, Theodore Enslin, Harvey Shapiro, Michael Heller, Norman Finkelstein, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, John Taggart, and Armand Schwerner to name a few. Their poetry continues the Objectivist obsession with language, ethics, and world and often addresses modern, urban, Jewish life, both secular and religious. DuPlessis, on first glance, seems an exception to this list. Her poetry seems not to immediately possess the so-called themes of an Objectivist aesthetic as practiced in the work of a Reznikoff, a Niedecker or an Oppen.

As a young woman and university student, DuPlessis began a lifelong correspondence with Oppen and was deeply influenced by Oppen&#x27;s integrity, sincerity, and courage. Though establishing herself as a poet with tendencies and obsessions at some remove from an Objectivist ethos (or so it may be argued at a first reading) DuPlessis has played a crucial role in the dissemination and survival of Objectivist poetry and poetics well into the 21st century. The life of a man such as Oppen made a lasting impression on DuPlessis. DuPlessis gained Oppen&#x27;s trust as well and she was given the opportunity of editing Oppen&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot;, which were published posthumously.

Bunting&#x27;s physical presence in Newcastle in the 1960s, together with his close relationships with a number of younger poets (including Tom Pickard, Thomas A. Clark, Richard Caddel and Barry MacSweeney), meant that he was a major father figure for the poets of the British Poetry Revival. This younger generation were also drawn to the works of the other Objectivists, and their writings began to be more widely known in Britain. For example, it was a letter from the Revival poet Andrew Crozier which prompted Rakosi&#x27;s return to poetry.

Amidst the continuous reappraisals, critical and otherwise, of the legacy and literary formation of the Objectivists, a well known mapping of the territory continues to be one put forth by poet Ron Silliman: &quot;three-phase Objectivism&quot;. Though unclear, precisely, who coined the phrase, this rubric offers a useful way of dealing with the intercession of the Objectivist poets into our consciousness. Writes Silliman:

<text>A feet first (FF) motorcycle is a class of motorcycle design which positions the rider with their feet ahead, like a car, rather than below and astride, as with conventional bikes. As there are other types of motorcycle (e.g. choppers) that have a &#x27;feet forward&#x27; position, an alternative term sometimes used is advanced single track vehicle. The name &quot;feet first&quot; (also referred to as &quot;feet forward&quot;) was first used by Royce Creasey.

==History==

Designers have experimented with the feet forward riding position since the early days of motorcycling.

In 1909 P.G Tacchi designed a four-cylinder machine with a 700 cc &#x27;L&#x27; head air-cooled engine, an enclosed shaft drive and a bucket seat. The machine was known as a TAC-Wilkinson, and was manufactured by the Wilkinson Sword Company

Ten years later in America Carl A. Neracher designed the Ner-a-Car It had a feet-forward riding position, a pressed steel frame and hub centre steering but in other respects was somewhat similar to a conventional motorcycle.

Designed by Sir Alliot Verdon Roe in 1926, the Ro-Monocar used a 250 cc Villiers two-stroke engine, and featured a high degree of enclosure for the rider and a bucket seat. This seating position provided a high degree of comfort for the rider

The Fred Wood designed Whitwood monocar used OEC duplex steering, retractable outriggers, and tandem bucket seats, and was offered with engine sizes ranging from 250 to 996 cc between 1933 and 1935.
In the 1950s NSU produced the feet forward fully enclosed monocoque constructions by Gustav Adolf Baumm (1920–1955). The &quot;Flying Hammock&quot; riding position allowed an exceptionally small frontal area. The consequent low wind resistance made it possible for H.P. &quot;Happy&quot; Mueller to achieve from a 125cc engine at the Utah Salt flats in 1956.
The first recognisably modern design was the 1975 Quasar, built by Malcolm Newell and Ken Leaman. The design was not a great commercial success - just 22 examples were sold up until 1982 - but it generated a great deal of interest, and started others thinking about the FF concept. Thomas Engelbach&#x27;s own design of a feet forward motorcycle came in 1980, with the innovative patent for an automatic stabilizing system that incorporated outrigger wheels. The design was successfully tested but proved that the market was not ready for this model.

Since 1985 Swiss manufacturer Peraves has produced a small series of feet forward cabin motorcycles; 89 &quot;Ecomobile&quot; were built from 1985 to 2005. The restyled Peraves Monotracer appeared in prototype form in 2006 and went into production in 2007. Following the outstanding successes of the all-electric E-Tracer, X-Tracers and Zerotracer the MonoTracer-E MTE-150 went into production in 2012 and the company ceased making the petrol driven MTI-1200. The company website said they would make a maximum of 36 vehicles per year from 2013 but sadly, production ceased with no more than some ten all-electric machines built.

In 1989 the Royce Creasey designed Voyager achieved a pre-production run of five prototypes made by SCL Ltd in Powys South Wales

===21st century===
In 2002, Dan Gurney&#x27;s All American Racers produced a limited run of 36 Alligator models.

The early 2000s saw enclosed scooters like the Benelli Adiva and BMW C1.

In 2008, the Buddfab Streamliner set the speed record for a 50cc engine at 145 mph (233 km/h) with 20+ hp, then in 2009 the 125cc speed record at 186 mph (299 km/h). The Honda RS125 engine used produces 44 ps.

In 2010, Dutchman Allert Jacobs, creator of the Quest velomobile, streamlined a Honda Innova underbone motorcycle to more than double the fuel economy from 1 liter per 48 km (113 mpg) to 1 per 101 (237mpg).

In 2013, Suprine Machinery, Inc and designer John Chelen, introduced the EXODUS, a 1200cc BMW flat four with five speeds and reverse, where the rider is safely surrounded by a roll cage and a skid plate. Only weighing 680 pounds, with a full 8 gallon gas tank, the EXODUS exceeds speeds of 155 MPH with over 80 MPG at 55MPH.

In March 2014 Honda unveiled the Honda NM4 model at the Osaka Motorcycle Show and it was on sale worldwide by the end of the year. In the United States it uses the original 700cc engine, whereas in Europe it has a 750cc engine. All versions use Honda&#x27;s Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) system to provide both automatic and semi-automatic control.

==Rationale==

Modern motorcycles are simply well-developed motorized bicycles, and as such have drawbacks. Chief among these are:

* Safety - riders involved in an accident are at significantly higher risk of injury or death compared with car drivers.
* Weather - motorcycles do not offer the advantages of an enclosed car in poor weather.
* Convenience - conventional motorcycle riders need to wear a helmet and protective clothing.
* Efficiency - motorcycles have a relatively tall profile that reduces aerodynamic performance. &quot;A feet-forward sitting position is easier to streamline&quot; according to inventor Craig Vetter.
* Skill - motorcycles riders need training and practice to become skilled at riding.

Likewise, in dense urban environments, the car has a number of drawbacks:

* Road occupancy - a car takes up much more space than a single person, and most cars transport only one person. Similarly the area occupied when parked consumes considerable space.
* Environment - a car uses more fuel than a motorcycle for the same journey. It is also more expensive in terms of resources to build in the first place.
* Performance - Journey times - a car is generally a lot slower than a motorcycle for city journeys due to congestion. A greater percentage of weight redistribution to counter directional momentum is available.

The FF motorcycle is an attempt to marry the advantages of bikes and cars, while avoiding the drawbacks of either. However any FF STV has no roll stability so actual benefits are overstated by some proponents when comparing a FF motorcycle with a motorcar. In addressing these issues, most FF designs arrive at a low-slung faired body, with the rider in a reclining position.
A number of FF concepts have been tried, but so far a commercially successful design has not appeared. There has been a revival of interest in the motor scooter as a means of personal transportation, and in some respects these vehicles have some features in common with FF motorcycles.

==Problems faced==

The problems faced by the designer or marketer of an FF motorcycle are many. Some of these are perceptual. Experienced motorcyclists tend to be resistant to the idea, arguing that it&#x27;s not a &quot;proper&quot; bike, and there is nothing wrong with the standard motorcycle. To car drivers, many of the disadvantages of the car are either not recognised or simply put up with and the overall convenience is hard to give up. Many car drivers would not consider a conventional motorcycle or scooter as an alternative, seeing it as a far less convenient and less safe option. To these people, an FF motorcycle needs to be seen (and hence marketed) as a two-wheeled car rather than an enclosed motorcycle. As the FF design moves the rider from an upright or Head First (HF) posture to a recumbent position (as in the Quasar and Dan Gurney&#x27;s Alligator), the machine becomes lower and may make it harder to see in traffic. However, most FFs have seat which is no lower than the average car, and much higher than many sports cars. Those who ride them regularly say that the problems of having a seat at this height are largely in the minds of those who have never tried one.

There are some engineering issues too, which some designs can overcome. Designs such as the Quasar require the rider/driver to use one foot to stabilise the machine when stationary, by putting his foot out of the open side onto the road. This approach precludes the use of a fully enclosed body. The fully enclosed Peraves Ecomobiles and MonoTracers use stabiliser wheels deployed by the rider when the machine is travelling very slowly or stopped. Redesigning the motorcycle is necessary as a contributor in the autonomous vehicle arena and the FF design with the power plant moved to the back of the rider better distributes the weight and increases potential to lower the center of gravity.

<text>A lagniappe ( , ) is &quot;a small gift given to a customer by a merchant at the time of a purchase&quot; (such as a 13th doughnut on purchase of a dozen), or more broadly, &quot;something given or obtained gratuitously or by way of good measure.&quot; It can be used more generally as meaning any extra or unexpected benefit.

The word entered English from the Louisiana French adapting a Quechua word brought in to New Orleans by the Spanish Creoles.

== Etymology ==
After the Spanish conquered the Inca Empire, some Quechua words entered the Spanish language. The Spanish Empire for a time also included Louisiana, so there was a Spanish presence in New Orleans. In his book &quot;Creoles of Louisiana&quot;, George Washington Cable comments on the effects of the Spanish presence on Louisiana Creole French:
The Spanish occupation never became more than a conquest. The Spanish tongue, enforced in the courts and principal public offices, never superseded the French in the mouths of the people and left but a few words naturalized in the corrupt French of the slaves. The terrors of the calabozo, with its chains and whips and branding irons, were condensed into the French tri-syllabic calaboose; while the pleasant institution of ñapa—the petty gratuity added, by the retailer, to anything bought—grew the pleasanter, drawn out into [the] Gallicized lagniappe [emphasis added].

Lagniappe is derived from the South American Spanish phrase &quot;la yapa&quot; or &quot;ñapa&quot; (referring to a free extra item, usually a very cheap one). &quot;La&quot; is the definite article in Spanish as well as in French (&quot;la ñapa&quot; or &quot;la gniappe&quot; = the ñapa/gniappe). The term has been traced back to the Quechua word &quot;yapay&quot; (&#x27;to increase; to add&#x27;). In Andean markets it is still customary to ask for a &quot;yapa&quot; (translates as &quot;a little extra&quot;) when making a purchase. The seller usually responds by throwing in a little extra.

Although this is an old custom, it is still widely practiced in Louisiana. Street vendors, especially vegetable vendors, are expected to throw in a few green chili peppers or a small bunch of cilantro with a purchase. The word is used in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and in other places with historic links to French Creole culture, such as in Trinidad and Tobago. The concept is practiced in many more places however, such as the Spanish-speaking world, Southeast Asia, North Africa, rural France, Australia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

Though the word is included in English dictionaries it is used primarily in the region influenced by New Orleans (and therefore Louisiana French) culture and so may be thought of as being more Cajun French or Louisiana Creole French than English. This is especially so since the spelling has been influenced by French.

Mark Twain writes about the word in a chapter on New Orleans in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883). He called it &quot;a word worth traveling to New Orleans to get&quot;:

We picked up one excellent word—a word worth travelling to New Orleans to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy word—&quot;lagniappe.&quot; They pronounce it &quot;lanny-yap&quot;. It is Spanish—so they said. We discovered it at the head of a column of odds and ends in the &quot;Picayune&quot;, the first day; heard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it meant the third; adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a restricted meaning, but I think the people spread it out a little when they choose. It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a &quot;baker&#x27;s dozen.&quot; It is something thrown in, &quot;gratis&quot;, for good measure. The custom originated in the Spanish quarter of the city. When a child or a servant buys something in a shop—or even the mayor or the governor, for aught I know—he finishes the operation by saying—&quot;Give me something for lagniappe.&quot;

The shopman always responds; gives the child a bit of licorice-root, gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of thread, gives the governor—I don&#x27;t know what he gives the governor; support, likely.

When you are invited to drink, and this does occur now and then in New Orleans—and you say, &quot;What, again?—no, I&#x27;ve had enough;&quot; the other party says, &quot;But just this one time more—this is for lagniappe.&quot; When the beau perceives that he is stacking his compliments a trifle too high, and sees by the young lady&#x27;s countenance that the edifice would have been better with the top compliment left off, he puts his &quot;I beg pardon—no harm intended,&quot; into the briefer form of &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s for lagniappe.&quot;

In Ireland, the term &quot;luck penny&quot; (or &quot;luckpenny&quot;) denotes a lagniappe.

<text>Vedic Sanskrit, also simply referred as the Vedic language, is an ancient language of the Indo-Aryan subgroup of the Indo-European language family. It is attested in the Vedas and related literature compiled over the period of the mid-2nd to mid-1st millennium BCE. It is orally preserved, predating the advent of writing by several centuries.

Extensive ancient literature in the Vedic Sanskrit language has survived into the modern era, and this has been a major source of information for reconstructing Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Indo-Iranian history.

==History==

===Prehistoric derivation===
The separation of Proto-Indo-Iranian language into Proto-Iranian and Proto-Indo-Aryan is estimated, on linguistic grounds, to have occurred around or before 1800 BCE. 
The date of composition of the oldest hymns of the Rigveda is vague at best, generally estimated to roughly 1500 BCE. Both Asko Parpola (1988) and J. P. Mallory (1998) place the locus of the division of Indo-Aryan from Iranian in the Bronze Age culture of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). Parpola (1999) elaborates the model and has &quot;Proto-Rigvedic&quot; Indo-Aryans intrude the BMAC around 1700 BCE. He assumes early Indo-Aryan presence in the Late Harappan horizon from about 1900 BCE, and &quot;Proto-Rigvedic&quot; (Proto-Dardic) intrusion to Punjab as corresponding to the Gandhara grave culture from about 1700 BCE. According to this model, Rigvedic within the larger Indo-Aryan group is the direct ancestor of the Dardic languages.

The early Vedic Sanskrit language was far less homogeneous compared to the language described by Pāṇini, that is, Classical Sanskrit. The language in the early Upanishads of Hinduism and the late Vedic literature approaches Classical Sanskrit. The formalization of the late form of Vedic Sanskrit language into the Classical Sanskrit form is credited to Pāṇini&#x27;s &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot;, along with Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Mahabhasya&quot; and Katyayana&#x27;s commentary that preceded Patanjali&#x27;s work. The earliest epigraphic records of the indigenous rulers of India are written in the Prakrit language. Originally the epigraphic language of the whole of India was mainly Prakrit and Sanskrit is first noticed in the inscriptions of North India from about the second half of the 1st century BCE. Sanskrit gradually ousted Prakrit from the field of Indian epigraphy in all parts of the country.

===Chronology===
Five chronologically distinct strata can be identified within the Vedic language:

# Ṛg-vedic
# Mantra
# Saṃhitā prose
# Brāhmaṇa prose
# Sūtras

The first three are commonly grouped together, as the Saṃhitās comprising the four Vedas: ṛg, atharvan, yajus, sāman, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the canonical foundation both of the Vedic religion, and the later religion known as Hinduism.

====Ṛg-vedic==== 
Many words in the Vedic Sanskrit of the &quot;Ṛg·veda&quot; have cognates or direct correspondences with the ancient Avestan language, but these do not appear in post-Rigvedic Indian texts. The text of the &quot;Ṛg·veda&quot; must have been essentially complete by around the 12th century BCE. The pre-1200 BCE layers mark a gradual change in Vedic Sanskrit, but there is disappearance of these archaic correspondences and linguistics in the post-Rigvedic period.

====Mantra language==== 
This period includes both the mantra and prose language of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; (Paippalada and Shaunakiya), the &quot;Ṛg·veda&quot; Khilani, the &quot;Samaveda&quot; Saṃhitā, and the mantras of the Yajurveda. These texts are largely derived from the Ṛg·veda, but have undergone certain changes, both by linguistic change and by reinterpretation. For example, the more ancient injunctive verb system is no longer in use.

====Sanhitā==== 
An important linguistic change is the disappearance of the injunctive, subjunctive, optative, imperative (the aorist). New innovations in Vedic Sanskrit appear such as the development of periphrastic aorist forms. This must have occurred before the time of Pāṇini because Panini makes a list of those from the northwestern region of India who knew these older rules of Vedic Sanskrit.

====Brāhmaṇa prose==== 
In this layer of Vedic literature, the archaic Vedic Sanskrit verb system has been abandoned, and a prototype of pre-Panini Vedic Sanskrit structure emerges. The &quot;Yajñagāthās&quot; texts provide a probable link between Vedic Sanskrit, Classical Sanskrit and languages of the Epics. Complex meters such as &quot;Anuṣṭubh&quot; and rules of Sanskrit prosody had been or were being innovated by this time, but parts of the Brāhmaṇa layers show the language is still close to Vedic Sanskrit.

====Sūtra language==== 
This is the last stratum of Vedic literature, comprising the bulk of the Śrautasūtras and Gṛhyasūtras and some &quot;Upaniṣad&quot;s such as the &quot;Kaṭha Upaniṣad&quot; and &quot;Maitrāyaṇiya Upaniṣad&quot;. These texts elucidate the state of the language which formed the basis of Pāṇini&#x27;s codification into Classical Sanskrit.

==Phonology==
Vedic differs from Classical Sanskrit to an extent comparable to the difference between Homeric Greek and Classical Greek.

The following differences may be observed in the phonology:

* Vedic had a voiced retroflex lateral approximant () as well as its breathy-voiced counterpart (), which are not found in classical Sanskrit; Macdonell suggests these were allophones of the corresponding plosives &quot;ḍ&quot; () and &quot;ḍh&quot; (); these units could also function metrically as a cluster, suggesting Proto-Indo-Aryan pronunciations of and (see Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni) before the loss of voiced sibilants, which occurred after the split of Proto-Indo-Iranian.
* The vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; were realized in Vedic as diphthongs &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot;, but they became monophthongs in later Sanskrit, such as &#x27; &gt; &#x27;and &#x27;&gt;&#x27;. However, the diphthongal quality still resurfaces in sandhi.
* The vowels &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; were correspondingly realized in Vedic as long diphthongs &quot;āi&quot; and &quot;āu&quot;, but they became correspondingly short in Classical Sanskrit: &#x27; &gt; &#x27;.
* The Prātiśākhyas claim that the &quot;dental&quot; consonants were articulated from the teeth ridge (&quot;dantamūlīya&quot;, alveolar), but they became dentals later, whereas most other authorities including Pāṇini designate them as dentals. 
* The Prātiśākhyas are inconsistent about but generally claim that it was also a &quot;dantamūlīya&quot;. According to Pāṇini it is a retroflex consonant.
* The &quot;pluti&quot; (trimoraic) vowels were on the verge of becoming phonemicized during middle Vedic, but disappeared again.
* Vedic often allowed two like vowels in certain cases to come together in hiatus without merger during sandhi, which has been reconstructed as the influence of an old laryngeal still present in the Proto-Indo-Iranian stage of the language: PIE → &quot;va·ata-&quot;.

===Accent===

Vedic had a pitch accent which could even change the meaning of the words, and was still in use in Pāṇini&#x27;s time, as can be inferred by his use of devices to indicate its position. At some latter time, this was replaced by a stress accent limited to the second to fourth syllables from the end.

Since a small number of words in the late pronunciation of Vedic carry the so-called &quot;independent &quot;svarita&quot;&quot; on a short vowel, one can argue that &quot;late&quot; Vedic was &quot;marginally&quot; a tonal language. Note however that in the metrically-restored versions of the &quot;Rig Veda &quot;almost all of the syllables carrying an independent &quot;svarita&quot; must revert to a sequence of two syllables, the first of which carries an &quot;udātta&quot; and the second a so-called dependent &quot;svarita&quot;. Early Vedic was thus definitely not a tonal language like Chinese but a pitch accent language like Japanese, which was inherited from the Proto-Indo-European accent.

Pitch accent was not restricted to Vedic. Early Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini gives accent rules for both the spoken language of his post-Vedic time as well as the differences of Vedic accent. However, no extant post-Vedic text with accents are found.

=== Pluti ===

Pluti, or &quot;prolation&quot;, is the term for the phenomenon of protracted or overlong vowels in Sanskrit; the overlong or &quot;prolated&quot; vowels are themselves called pluta. Pluta vowels are usually noted with a numeral &quot;3&quot; () indicating a length of three morae ().

A diphthong is prolated by prolongation of its first vowel. Pāṇinian grammarians recognise the phonetic occurrence of diphthongs measuring more than three morae in duration, but classify them all as prolated (i.e. trimoraic) to preserve a strict tripartite division of vocalic length between (short, 1 mora), (long, 2 morae) and (prolated, 3+ morae).
Pluta vowels are recorded a total of 3 times in the Rigveda and 15 times in the Atharvaveda, typically in cases of questioning and particularly where two options are being compared. For example:
: &quot;Was it above? Was it below?&quot;
: Rigveda 10.129.5d
: &quot;Is this larger? Or this?&quot;
: Atharvaveda 9.6.18

The attained the peak of their popularity in the Brahmana period of late Vedic Sanskrit (roughly 8th century BC), with some 40 instances in the Shatapatha Brahmana alone.

<text>A single-track vehicle is a vehicle that leaves a single ground track as it moves forward. Single-track vehicles usually have little or no lateral stability when stationary but develop it when moving forward or controlled. In the case of wheeled vehicles, the front and rear wheel usually follow slightly different paths when turning or when out of alignment.

Single-track vehicles have unique dynamics that, in the case of wheeled vehicles, are discussed at length in bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, that usually require leaning into a turn, and that usually include countersteering. Single-track vehicles can roll on wheels, slide, float, or hydroplane.

<text>PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add) is a digital signal processing technique used for speech processing and more specifically speech synthesis. It can be used to modify the pitch and duration of a speech signal. It was invented around 1986.

PSOLA works by dividing the speech waveform in small overlapping segments. To change the pitch of the signal, the segments are moved further apart (to decrease the pitch) or closer together (to increase the pitch). To change the duration of the signal, the segments are then repeated multiple times (to increase the duration) or some are eliminated (to decrease the duration). The segments are then combined using the overlap add technique.

PSOLA can be used to change the prosody of a speech signal.

<doc id="364458" wikidata="Q1763459" url="?curid=364458" title="Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff">
<text>The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) is the presiding officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The chairman is the highest-ranking and most senior military officer in the United States Armed Forces and the principal military advisor to the president, the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the secretary of defense. While the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outranks all other commissioned officers, the chairman is prohibited by law from having operational command authority over the armed forces; however, the chairman assists the president and the secretary of defense in exercising their command functions.

The chairman convenes the meetings and coordinates the efforts of the Joint Chiefs, an advisory body within the Department of Defense comprising the chairman, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of staff of the Army, the commandant of the Marine Corps, the chief of naval operations, the chief of staff of the Air Force, the chief of space operations, and the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The post of a statutory and permanent Joint Chiefs of Staff chair was created by the 1949 amendments to the National Security Act of 1947. The 1986 Goldwater–Nichols Act elevated the chairman from the first among equals to becoming the &quot;principal military advisor&quot; to the president and the secretary of defense.

The Joint Staff, managed by the director of the Joint Staff and consisting of military personnel from all the services, assists the chairman in fulfilling his duties to the president and secretary of defense, and functions as a conduit and collector of information between the chairman and the combatant commanders. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is part of the Joint Staff operations directorate (J-3).

Although the office of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is considered very important and highly prestigious, neither the chairman, the vice chairman, nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a body has any command authority over combatant forces. The Goldwater–Nichols Act places the operational chain of command from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the commanders of the unified combatant commands. However the service chiefs do have authority over personnel assignments and oversight over resources and personnel allocated to the combatant commands within their respective services (derived from the service secretaries).

The chairman may also transmit communications to the combatant commanders from the president and secretary of defense as well as allocate additional funding to the combatant commanders if necessary. The chairman also performs all other functions prescribed under or allocates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in the joint staff.

The position has been vacant since 21 February 2025, when President Donald Trump dismissed General Charles Q. Brown Jr. Later that day, Trump nominated Lieutenant General Dan Caine as Brown&#x27;s successor. Admiral Christopher W. Grady, who is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is currently serving as acting chairman.

==Organization and assistants==
The principal deputy to the chairman is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS), another four-star general or admiral, who, among many duties, chairs the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is assisted by the Joint Staff, led by the director of the Joint Staff, a three-star general or admiral. The Joint Staff is an organization composed of approximately equal numbers of officers contributed by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force who have been assigned to assist the chairman with the unified strategic direction, operation, and integration of the combatant land, naval, air, and space forces. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is part of the Joint Staff operations directorate (J-3).

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is also advised on enlisted personnel matters by the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman, who serves as a communication conduit between the chairman and the senior enlisted advisors (command sergeants major, command master chief petty officers, and command chief master sergeants) of the combatant commands.

== Establishment of the CJCS position ==
The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) was established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff Act of 1942, which was signed into law on July 1, 1942. This act formalized the advisory body consisting of the senior military leaders of the Army, Navy, and later the Air Force, to assist the president and the secretary of war (later the secretary of defense) with coordinating military strategy during World War II.

Before the establishment of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), military leadership was more decentralized, with the service chiefs coordinating independently. The JCS existed as a body of senior military leaders, but no single officer held the position of chairman. Instead, leadership was shared, and the group advised the president and the secretary of defense on military matters.

Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy served as Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy from July 20, 1942, to March 21, 1949. In this role, he presided over meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, helping to unify military strategy during World War II. Leahy&#x27;s office is considered a precursor to the position of CJCS, as it began to centralize military leadership and coordination.

The position of CJCS was formally established by an August 10, 1949 amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 (), which restructured the U.S. military after World War II. The first individual to hold the title of Chairman was General Omar Bradley, who was appointed in 1949.

==Appointment and rank==


The chairman is nominated by the president for appointment from any of the regular components of the armed forces, and must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. The chairman and vice chairman may not be members of the same armed force service branch. However, the president may waive that restriction for a limited period of time in order to provide for the orderly transition of officers appointed to serve in those positions. The chairman serves a single four-year term of office at the pleasure of the president, with reappointment to additional terms only possible during times of war or national emergency. 

Historically, the chairman served two two-year terms, until the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 amended the chairman&#x27;s term of office to a single four-year term. By statute, the chairman is appointed as a four-star general or admiral while holding office and assumes office on 1 October of odd-numbered years.

Although the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Omar Bradley, was eventually awarded a fifth star, the CJCS does not receive one by right, and Bradley&#x27;s award was so that his subordinate, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, would not outrank him. In the 1990s, there were proposals in Department of Defense academic circles to bestow on the chairman a five-star rank.

Previously, during the presidencies of Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff position was rotated in accordance with the incumbent chairman&#x27;s armed force service branch. As such, the incoming chairman would be from a different service branch. For example, in 1957, following the retirement of Admiral Arthur Radford as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Eisenhower nominated Air Force general Nathan Twining as Radford&#x27;s successor. When General Twining retired, Eisenhower nominated Army general Lyman Lemnitzer to succeed Twining as chairman. 

In October 1962, President Kennedy appointed Army General Maxwell Taylor to succeed General Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This decision — replacing an Army general with another Army general — broke the longstanding tradition of rotating the position between the Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Army. Tradition would have dictated that Kennedy appoint either Air Force chief of staff General Curtis LeMay, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George Anderson Jr., or Commandant of the Marine Corps General David Shoup to the position. Following Maxwell&#x27;s appointment, the tradition of rotating the chairmanship was discontinued.

==Pay==
Effective January 1, 2025, according to the Monthly Rates of Basic Pay for commissioned officers, basic pay is limited to the rate of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule in effect during calendar year 2025, which is $18,808.20 per month for officers at pay grades O-7 through O-10. This includes officers serving as chairman or vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chief of staff of the Army, chief of naval operations, chief of staff of the Air Force, commandant of the Marine Corps, chief of space operations, commandant of the Coast Guard, chief of the National Guard Bureau, or the commanders of the unified combatant commands. In addition, according to , the CJCS receives an additional $4,000 a year to cover expenses related to performing official duties.

<text>The , also known as the in Japan and China for certain generations, is a series of automobiles manufactured by Honda since 1976, best known for its four-door sedan variant, which has been one of the best-selling cars in the United States since 1989. The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including coupes, station wagons, hatchbacks and a Honda Crosstour crossover.

Since its initiation, Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976, as a compact hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan, coupe, and wagon. By the sixth-generation Accord at the end of the 1990s, it evolved into an intermediate vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets. For the eighth-generation Accord released for the North American market in 2007, Honda had again chosen to move the model further upscale and increase its size. This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car, with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car. In 2012, the ninth-generation Accord sedan, with smaller exterior dimensions, was once again classified as a mid-size car at , falling just shy of the &quot;Large Car&quot; classification. However, the tenth-generation Accord sedan, with similar exterior dimensions, returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of ; the coupe was discontinued in 2017.

In 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville, Ohio at Honda&#x27;s Marysville Auto Plant. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years (1982–97), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold. Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world&#x27;s most reliable vehicles. The Accord has been on the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best list a record 38 times.

In 1989, the Accord was the first vehicle sold under an import brand to become the best-selling car in the United States. As of 2020, the Accord has sold more than 18 million units. In 2023, Honda announced that Accord production would be moved to the factory in Greensburg, Indiana, to make way for electric vehicle production at the Marysville, Ohio, plant.

==Background==
Honda, after establishing itself as a leading manufacturer of motorcycles during the 1950s, began production of cars in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;S360/T360&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Honda introduced its N360 minicar, compliant with Kei car specifications for the Japanese market, for the 1967 model year. The car had a transverse-mounted front engine, front-wheel drive layout, which would be adopted for the later N600 (1969), H1300 (1970) and Civic (1972) models. Occupying a size niche between mini cars and compact sedans, the Civic offered a combination of economy and practicality with its space-efficient design that had immediate appeal. The Civic gave Honda their first market success competing with manufacturers of standard compact cars, which were the growth segment as sales of mini cars plateaued and waned in the early 1970s, and their first major impact in the export market. Honda&#x27;s CVCC engine technology, which had been under development since 1970, was added to the Civic in December 1973. It had the advantages of not requiring a catalytic converter or unleaded fuel to meet the emissions requirements of the 1970s and early 1980s.

After the well-received launch of the Civic, Honda started development of an upscale model. Honda&#x27;s original concept for a larger, quieter, more powerful and comfortable car was a four-door sedan powered by a 2000 cc inline-six engine, designated Project 653. According to initial interpreted information, Project 653 was to be a V6 powered competitor to the Ford Mustang, however this was dismissed as a confused interpretation of the design concept. In order to manage development costs, leverage the technology of the Civic, and to adapt the production facilities to the new model, Honda changed their focus to building upon the Civic&#x27;s successful formula in a larger package. With these new goals, the project was re-designated as Project 671. The body design of the new model was finalised in the fall of 1973, as reported in the December 1975 issue of Motor Trend magazine, which suggests that work under Project 671 had been advancing in the months prior. However, one account of the timeline reports that mechanical engineering for Project 671 got underway in 1974. Until production of the new model, intensive engineering efforts were carried out to make the CVCC engine quieter and more suited to higher cruising speeds, to refine the suspension for better ride and handling, to develop a power steering system suitable for a lightweight compact car, and to improve noise damping in the body and frame. Extensive pre-production testing was performed under a wide variety of conditions, to ensure the Accord&#x27;s suitability for use under different driving conditions.

For the new model, Honda chose the name &quot;Accord&quot;, reflecting &quot;Honda&#x27;s desire for accord and harmony between people, society and the automobile.&quot; German manufacturer Opel unsuccessfully sued Honda, claiming that the name was too similar to their Rekord.

The Accord&#x27;s final design, with an extended nose and extended coupe cabin with a sloping hatchback rear, was a logical derivation of the hatchback design of the Civic and provided ample leeway for use of Civic-derived components. It showed similarity to the Volkswagen Scirocco, which had been introduced in January 1974, leading to speculation that the design was copied from the Scirocco. However, the Accord&#x27;s design had been finalised months prior to the Scirocco&#x27;s introduction.

== First generation (1976) ==

The first-generation Honda Accord was launched on 7 May 1976, as a three-door hatchback with JIS (similar to SAE Gross), a wheelbase, and a weight of about . North American market cars claimed , while European and other export markets received a model without emissions control equipment; it claimed as well but according to the stricter DIN norm. It was a platform expansion of the earlier Honda Civic at long. The engine was a long-stroke derivative of the Civic&#x27;s 1.2 and 1.5-liter engines. To comply with gradually tightening emission regulations enacted in Japan, the engine was fitted with Honda&#x27;s CVCC technology.

The Accord sold well due to its moderate size and great fuel economy. It was one of the first Japanese sedans with features like cloth seats, a tachometer, intermittent wipers, and an AM/FM radio as standard equipment. In 1978 an LX version of the hatchback was added which came with air conditioning, a digital clock, and power steering. Until the Accord, and the closely related Prelude, power steering had not been available to cars under two litres. Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual road tax over the smaller Civic, which had a smaller engine.

On 14 October 1977 (a year later in the U.S. market), a four-door sedan was added to the lineup, and power went to when the EF1 engine was supplemented and in certain markets replaced by the an EK1 unit, producing with the GK-5 5-speed transaxle, or with the 2-speed Hondamatic. Technically, the sedan was not changed from the hatchback, and the wheelbase remained the same as well. This did result in a rather long rear overhang to fit a full-sized boot. The roof was a bit taller so as to provide more interior comfort, and the Accord Sedan was the first Honda in Japan to be offered with typically Japanese middle-class extras such as ornate hubcaps and lace seat covers.

In the U.S. market, the sedan was available in three colours: Livorno Beige with beige cloth interior, Silver with maroon cloth interior, or dark red with maroon cloth interior. In 1980 the optional two-speed semi-automatic &quot;Hondamatic&quot; transmission of previous years became a three-speed fully automatic gearbox (a four-speed automatic transaxle was not used in the Accord until the 1983 model year). The North American versions had slightly redesigned bumper trim. Other changes included new grilles and taillamps and remote mirrors added on the four-door (chrome) and the LX (black plastic) models. The CVCC badges were deleted, but the CVCC induction system remained. At the same time, California-specification engines received a four-port exhaust valve head and a catalytic converter. This version of the EK1 engine was equivalent to the 1981 49-state High Altitude engine, omitting the air jet controller device that helped maintain the proper mixture at higher altitudes (above 4000 feet). The horsepower increased from for 5-speed cars and for automatic cars with the two-port 49-state engine to , like the 1981-83 versions.

In North America, the 1981 model year only brought detail changes such as new fabrics and some new colour combinations. Livorno Beige (code No. Y-39) was replaced by Oslo Ivory (No. YR-43). Dark brown was discontinued, as was the bronze metallic. A bit later in 1981, and SE 4-door model was added for the first time, with Novillo leather seats and power windows. The paint colour was NH-77M Glacier Gray with a gray interior. Base model hatchbacks, along with the four-door, LX, and SE four-door, all received the same smaller black plastic remote mirror. The instrument cluster was revised with mostly pictograms which replaced the worded warning lights and gauge markings. The shifter was redesigned to have a stronger spring to prevent unintentional engagement of reverse, replacing the spring-loaded shift knob of the 1976 to 1980 model year cars. The shift lever was also shortened by a couple of inches, with a larger thread diameter, allowing usage of later Honda shift knobs, including the rectangular knob used on all 1986 and newer Accords.

== Second generation (1981) ==


Debuted on 22 September 1981, in Japan, Europe, and North America, this generation of the Accord being produced in Japan, also became the first to be built in the United States, at Honda&#x27;s plant in Marysville, Ohio. Since its first year in the American market, it also became the best-selling Japanese nameplate in the United States, retaining that position for about 15 years. In Japan, a sister model called the Honda Vigor was launched simultaneously with the new Accord. This allowed Honda to sell the product at different sales channels called &quot;Honda Clio&quot;, which sold the Accord, and &quot;Honda Verno&quot;, that sold the Vigor.

Modernizing the interior and exterior, the second-generation Accord was mechanically very similar to the original, using the same EK-1 CVCC engine in the Japanese market. Vehicles with a manual transmission and the CVCC carburetor earned based on Japanese Government emissions tests using 10 different modes of scenario standards, and , and with consistently maintained speeds at 60 km/h. European market cars received the tested 1.6-litre EL1 engine with DIN at 5000 rpm.

This car included popular features of the time such as shag carpet, velour cabin trim, and chrome accents. An optional extra on the 1981 Accord was an Electro Gyrocator, the world&#x27;s first automatic in-car navigation system. Japanese market cars were available in Silver, Sky Blue, and Beige. The LX hatchback offered a digital clock and slightly higher fuel economy (due to its lighter weight). In Europe, the Accord was available as a fairly well equipped (for the time) standard version, as well as a very luxurious EX model at a modest upcharge.

In the United States, Federal lighting regulations required headlamps of sealed beam construction and standard size and shape on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they offered adjustable ride height control and side-view mirrors installed on the mid-forward wings.

In November 1982, Honda made a fully four-speed automatic available with the 1.8-litre engine, a major improvement over the earlier, three-speed semi-automatic &quot;Hondamatic&quot; transmission. This quickly filtered through to export markets, where the outdated Hondamatic was soon superseded entirely. The manual five-speed transmission remained unchanged. A new 120 mph speedometer replaced the earlier 88 mph unit. The Special Edition (SE) featured Novillo leather seating, power windows, a power sunroof, and door locks. Gray was added as a colour option. A slightly modified EK-2 engine was introduced, replacing the earlier EK-1, albeit still carbureted.

=== 1983 facelift ===
By 1983, Accords sold in the eastern United States were produced at the new Marysville plant, with quality considered equal to those produced in Japan. In June 1983, for the 1984 model year, the Accord body was restyled with a slightly downward beveled nose and a new series of 12-valve CVCC powerplants. Globally there was a 1.6 (EY) and also the slightly more powerful ES2 , yielding in federal trim. Honda integrated rear side marker lights and reflectors into the side of the tail light units. European Accords now included a side turn signal repeater just behind each front wheel well. The U.S. requirement for standardised headlamps was rescinded in late 1983, but North American Accords continued to use sealed beams until the fourth-generation models were released in 1989.

The LX offered velour upholstery, auto-reverse cassette stereo, air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power door locks (sedan only), a digital clock, roof pillar antenna, along with thick black belt moldings, integrated bumpers and flush plastic mock-alloy style wheels covers that resembled the trend-setting Audi 5000. Supplies were tight, as in the Eastern states, the wait was months for a Graphite Gray sedan, a then-popular colour. The LX hatchback was the only 1984 version of the Accord to include dual side-view mirrors.

The 1983 Accord SE Sedan carried over features of the 1981 SE Sedan, including leather interior, power windows, power antenna, and aluminum alloy wheels. Some new features included a 7-band graphic equaliser, power booster and Dolby music sensor for the AM/FM cassette stereo system, and a power glass moonroof. Only one colour was offered in the SE trim: Dove Gray.

The 1984 sedan was available in four exterior colours, Greek White and three metallic options: Columbus Gray, Regency Red (burgundy), and Stratos Blue (steel). The regular hatchback was available in Greek White, Dominican Red, and the metallic Stratos Blue. The 1984 LX hatchback came in three metallic colours only: Graphite Gray, Regency Red, and Copper Brown.

It was one of the first Japanese engineered vehicles to offer computer controlled, fuel-injection with one injector per cylinder, also known as multiple port fuel injection. This arrived on 24 May 1984 on the ES series 1.8 L engine, and was known as Honda&#x27;s Programmed Fuel Injection, or PGM-FI. This option was not offered until 1985 in the United States market. Vehicles with PGM-FI (ES3 series engine) earned based on Japanese Government emissions tests using 10 different modes of scenario standards, with , and with consistently maintained speeds at .

In 1985, the Special Edition returned as the SE-i, capitalizing on the final year of the second generation&#x27;s production. A fuel-injected, non-CVCC ES3 engine was exclusive to this model. The moniker, SE-i, was adapted from the SE trim, but included the &quot;-i&quot; to signify the higher trim level&#x27;s fuel-injected engine. This 12-valve, engine was the first non-CVCC engine used in an Accord and was the same basic engine design used by Honda until 1989. Like the previous SE trim in 1983, the SE-i featured Novillo leather seating, power moonroof, bronze-tinted glass, a premium sound system with cassette, and 13-inch alloy wheels. The luxury equipment features on the SE-i paralleled the same features offered on the Honda Vigor VTL-i, which was only sold in Japan. Two colours were offered: Graphite Gray Metallic and Barley Brown Metallic.

Available options differed from market to market. The 1.8-litre engine, updated four-speed automatic transmission, and &#x27;EX&#x27; trim level options were first made available in New Zealand during the 1984 model year refresh alongside the 1.6-litre &#x27;LX&#x27; model.

Japan generally received more options earlier than the rest of the world. In 1981, the Accord offered an adjustable ride height air suspension in the Japanese market. From 1983 in Japan and 1984 in Europe, the second-generation Accord was available with anti-lock brakes (called ALB) as an option. This braking system was the first time that an Accord used four-wheel disc brakes. Fuel injection became available in 1984 in the Japanese market with the earlier introduction of the ES3 engine in the SE-i. Models took a year to arrive in North American and European markets with less stringent emissions laws continuing, using carburetors throughout second-generation production.

== Third generation (1985) ==



The third-generation Accord was introduced in Japan on 4 June 1985 and in Europe and North America later that year. It had a very striking exterior design styled by Toshi Oshika in 1983, that resonated well with buyers internationally. One notable feature was the hidden headlamps. Because this generation was also sold as the Honda Vigor, the Accord received the hidden headlamps. Honda&#x27;s Japanese dealership channel called &quot;Honda Verno&quot; all had styling elements that helped identify products only available at &quot;Honda Verno&quot;. As a result, Japanese market Accords had a &quot;Honda Verno&quot; styling feature but were sold at newly established Japanese dealerships &quot;Honda Clio&quot; with the all-new, luxury Honda Legend sedan, and international Accords were now visually aligned with the Prelude, the CR-X, and the new Integra.

The retractable headlamps of the third generation Accord sedan were in Japan, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, KY region (Arabian countries), and on cars in Taiwan that were imported from the United States. In other countries, the Accord sedan had conventional headlamps, including in Japan from July 1987, on &quot;Accord CA&quot;, with CA standing for &quot;Continental Accord&quot;. Accords in all other bodies (hatchback, AeroDeck, coupe) had only retractable headlamps worldwide.

At its introduction in 1985, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.

The third-generation Accord became the first Honda to employ double wishbones at both the front and rear ends. While more expensive than competitors&#x27; MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small all-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (available on the Japanese-market all 2.0-Si models and since May 1987 on other trim levels with optional 4-wheel Anti-Lock Brake System), larger all-wheel discs with single-piston calipers or a front disc/rear drum system. 4-wheel Anti-Lock Brake System was available as an option in Japan and Europe. Base model Accords rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels.

The Accord&#x27;s available engines varied depending on its market: Japan received the A18A, A20A, B18A, B20A and A20A3 (US imported cars); Europe received the A16A1, A20A1, A20A2, A20A3, A20A4, B20A2, and B20A8; Australia and New Zealand received A20A2 and A20A4; other regions received A20A2 and/or A16A1; while United States and Taiwan (US imported cars) received the A20A1 and A20A3; Canada received A20A2 and A20A4 in 1987, A20A1 and A20A3 since 1988. On Accord 1986 model year engine block was marked as BS and BT in the United States, BS1 and BT1 in Canada, these cars had chassis code BA. Since 1987 the engine block in Indonesia was marked as NA instead of A20A2. The engine block in Thailand was marked as A.

The Accord&#x27;s trim levels ranged from spartan to luxurious. In the Japanese home market, the Accord was available with a full power package, heated mirrors (optional), a digital instrument cluster (optional), sunroof (optional), cruise control, and climate control (which was also optional). Some North European export models also had heated front seats and headlight washers. North American and Australian Accords were not available with many of these options, particularly in the US because Honda was seen as a builder of economy cars, and not to cannibalise sales from the recently introduced (1986) Acura line.

Throughout the different markets, in addition to the sedan model, the Accord was available with different body styles which included a three-door hatchback, a three-door shooting-brake called Accord AeroDeck, and a two-door coupe which was added in 1987 for the 1988 model year. The coupe, which was built exclusively in Honda&#x27;s Marysville, Ohio factory, was &quot;reverse exported&quot; back to Japan where it was known as the US-coupe CA6.

In 1989, the last year of production for the third generation, the SE-i trim returned again to the American market in sedan and coupe models. Standard features in the SE-i included leather-trimmed seats and door panel inserts, alloy wheels, power-assisted 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted glass, air conditioning, power steering, power windows, power moonroof (sedan only), dual-outlet exhaust, dual body-coloured power mirrors, and a Bose audio system with steering wheel-mounted controls. Additional standard features included cruise control, fold-down rear seat backs, adjustable steering column, quartz digital clock, remote boot release, rear window defroster and intermittent wipers. Two colour combinations were available for the sedan: Charcoal Granite Metallic with gray leather interior trim or Tuscany Taupe Metallic with beige leather interior trim. For the coupe, two different colour combinations were available: Asturias Gray Metallic with gray leather interior trim and Brittany Blue-Green Metallic with beige leather interior trim.

=== Accord AeroDeck ===

The third-generation Accord was sold in Japan, Europe, and New Zealand as a three-door hatchback with a flat roof over the rear seats, known in Europe as a shooting-brake. The body style of a flat roof hatchback was also used on the third-generation Honda Civic subcompact, the second-generation Honda City supermini and the first-generation Honda Today &quot;kei car&quot;. The Honda CR-X was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch &quot;kammback&quot; appearance, demonstrating a performance car appearance identified with &quot;Honda Verno&quot; products during the mid-1980s.

In North America, the Accord coupe and hatchback models were offered instead. The &quot;AeroDeck&quot; name was reused on the Honda Civic 5-door station wagon, sold in the UK from 1996 to 2000. In parts of Continental Europe, the Accord five-door station wagon was also called the Accord AeroDeck from 1990 until 2008, when the name of the station wagon was renamed the &quot;Accord Tourer&quot;. The AeroDeck was only available in Japan at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships as a variation of the Accord.

The cargo handling abilities of the AeroDeck were ceded to the fourth-generation Accord station wagon in 1990. The AeroDeck was unique to the Accord model line, as the AeroDeck was not available as a Honda Vigor, as the Accord and Vigor were mechanically identical. The AeroDeck returned an aerodynamic value of .34, and the wheelbase returned a spacious interior for both front and rear passengers, on par with a mid-size sedan. Unfortunately, the appearance was not well received in Japan, as the introduction of the Accord Coupe was more well-liked. The appearance was more popular in the United Kingdom.

The AeroDeck was equipped with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension, which gave both a comfortable ride and cornering performance. In addition, speed-sensitive power steering is included, which gives the car easy turning assistance at speeds below during operation, such as parallel parking. Note that the top model in Japan &quot;2.0Si&quot; is to 4w-ALB (4-wheel ABS) is standard equipment (with an option to upgrade in other trim packages).

Visibility from the driver&#x27;s seat and the passenger seat was better due to the lower instrument panel design of the front window and a large windscreen. And switches are arranged efficiently and at the time was the driving position can be fine-tuned adjustments.

Because of the shape of the vehicle and the flat roof that continued to the rear of the vehicle, opening the rear hatch had some drawbacks in low clearance environments. The lower part of the hatch was not like one used on the station wagon that went all the way down to the rear bumper, so loading cargo into the back wasn&#x27;t as convenient as a conventional station wagon with a one-piece hatchback. The rear hatch also wrapped into the rear roof, similar to a gull wing door so that the rear glass was in two pieces, one for the back window, and another part on the rear roof. When open, the hatch rose above the roof at a right angle, providing additional overhead clearance when the hatch was open.

Moreover, because of the emphasis on aiding rear-seat passenger entry, a longer front door was installed, and because power windows were not installed on the lower trim packages &quot;LX&quot;, &quot;LX-S&quot; and as such, the window regulator opening felt heavy.

=== Chassis code configurations ===

== Fourth generation (1989) ==

The fourth-generation Accord, introduced on the &quot;CB&quot; chassis, was unveiled in 1989 for the 1990 model year. Although much larger than its predecessor, the sedan&#x27;s styling was evolutionary, featuring the same low-slung design and wraparound rear window as the third-generation. For the first time, a 3-door hatchback was no longer available internationally.

This was one of the first U.S. production cars to feature optic reflectors with completely clear lenses on the headlamps. The styling reflected influences from the flagship Legend (sold in North America as an Acura), as Japanese Accords were now sold at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships, where the Legend, and the Inspire, were sold. The growing popularity of the Accord internationally was evident in the ever-increasing dimensions, which now matched almost exactly with the first-generation Legend introduced in 1985.

For the fourth-generation model, Honda made significant engineering design improvements. All cars sold in North America came with a completely new all-aluminum 2.2-litre 16-valve electronic fuel-injected engine as standard, replacing the previous 2.0-litre 12-valve unit from the past generation. Cars equipped with automatic transmissions used an electronically controlled rear engine mount to reduce low-frequency noise and vibration. The mount contained two fluid-filled chambers separated by a computer-controlled valve. At low engine speeds, fluid is routed through the valve damping vibration. Above 850 rpm, fluid is routed around the valve making the engine mount stiffer.

In the U.S., the LX-i and SE-i designations were dropped, being replaced with the DX, LX, and EX trim levels. The Canadian trim levels varied slightly from the U.S. models with LX, EX, and EX-R roughly corresponding to the American DX, LX, and EX, respectively. Fourth-generation Japanese-assembled caes sold in Australia offered the same 4-wheel steering technology as was available optionally on the US market Prelude, but was not included on the New Zealand-assembled versions. The four-wheel steering system was also available on the Accord&#x27;s Japanese platform-mate, called the Ascot FTBi. US Accord Coupes were available in the same DX, LX and EX trims as the US Accord Saloon (LX, EX, and EX-R in Canada).

A 4-cylinder engine was offered in the DX and LX models (F22A1), while the 1990 and 1991 model year EX received a version (F22A4). Cruise control was dropped from the DX sedan, with air conditioning remaining a dealer-installed option. The LX kept the same features as the previous generation including air conditioning, power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The 1991 EX had an increase of 5 hp due to a different exhaust manifold design, slightly larger exhaust piping, and a twin outlet muffler. 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels, sunroof, upgraded upholstery, rear stabiliser bar, and a high-power 4-speaker stereo cassette were standard on all EX models. Some models were special ordered with an anti-lock braking system (at that time abbreviated as ALB, now all automakers refer to it as ABS). A redesigned manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch was standard equipment in all trims while an all-new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission was optional for all models.

Some new dealer-installed accessories were now offered including a single-disc in-dash CD player or boot-mounted 6-disc CD changer, stereo equaliser, fog lights, security system, rear wing spoiler, boot lip spoiler, luggage rack, full and half nose mask, center armrest, window visors, sunroof visor, car cover, and a cockpit cover.

Because of tightening auto safety regulations from the NHTSA, all 1990 and 1991 model year Accords sold in the United States came equipped with motorised shoulder belts for front passengers to comply with passive restraint mandates. These semi-automatic restraints were a two-component system; a motorised shoulder belt along with a non-integrated and manually operated seatbelt. The shoulder belts automatically raced around each window frame encircling both the driver and front-seat passenger whenever the front door closed. The process reversed to release them when opened. The lap belts, however, still required manual fastening.

In early 1990 for the 1991 model year, Honda unveiled the Accord wagon, to be manufactured at the Marysville, Ohio plant. Production began in late November, 1990. The Ohio plant exported right-hand drive wagons and coupes to Europe and Japan. In Europe, the station wagon was called the &quot;Aerodeck&quot; in reference to the 1985–1989 three-door vehicle. All station wagons sold outside the United States were affixed with a small badge on the &quot;C&quot; pillar denoting the vehicle was built at the Ohio facility. European and Japanese vehicles had options not available within the U.S. including automatic climate control systems, power seats, and several other minor features. The Accord Wagons were available from November 1990, only in LX and EX trim in North America or just 2.2i in Japan. They had larger front brakes to compensate for the added weight and unlike other U.S. Accords, including a driver&#x27;s side airbag as standard equipment. Other than a retractable tonneau cover in the rear cargo area and keyless entry on EX models, the wagons were equipped the same as their coupe and sedan counterparts.

=== Return of the SE (1991) ===

Honda reintroduced the SE (previously SE-i) sedan for 1991. It returned to the lineup without the traditional Bose high-powered audio system but with an AM/FM stereo cassette 4x20 watt EX audio system; leather-trimmed steering wheel, leather seats and door panels, a fuel-injected engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, and 4-wheel disc brakes w/ ABS as standard equipment. For the first time, a manual transmission was not offered in the SE. Two colours were available: Solaris Silver Metallic with Graphite Black interior and Brittany Blue Metallic with Ivory interior. Unlike previous editions, the 1991 SE was not equipped with uniquely styled alloy wheels but instead carried the EX model wheels.

=== Facelift (1991) ===
Accords received a minor facelift in 1991 for the 1992 model year. The SE trim was dropped again but left behind its F22A6 engine for use in the EX models. This engine added 15 hp over the DX and LX trims and 10 hp over the 90–91 EX trim due to a further revised exhaust system. The system used the same EX-SE twin-outlet muffler, a revised air intake tract, a revised camshaft, and a revised intake manifold using IAB butterfly valves which open at 4,600 rpm to increase air intake breathing at high rpm. It was similar in design to the 92–96 Prelude Si and VTEC models. For the 1992 and 1993 model years, the motorised shoulder belt system was replaced with a standard driver-side airbag and conventional shoulder/seatbelt arrangement for all but the center rear passenger. Anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes became standard on the EX. The front and rear facias received a more rounded and updated look. Coupe and sedan models received a new grille, new headlamps, amber parking lights, slightly thinner body side molding, updated wheel designs and for the first time, the EX coupe used wheels different from the EX sedan. The sedans received restyled shortened taillamps with an inverted amber turn signal and backup light positions. The wagon taillamps though still resembled those from the 1990–1991 Accord. The US-market coupe used the new revised inverted positioning of the signal and backup lights, but the shape of the taillamps still resembled those of the 1990–1991 models. EX trim levels included a radio anti-theft function to deter stereo theft. A front driver&#x27;s seat armrest was now standard on LX and EX models. Some dealer-installed accessories were dropped including the luggage rack, boot-lip spoiler, and cockpit cover. A gold finish kit was added.

=== 10th Anniversary Edition and return of the SE (1993) ===
In 1992, Honda introduced the 10th Anniversary Edition sedan to commemorate the 10th year of U.S. Accord production. The 10th Anniversary Edition was based on the Accord LX sedan but came equipped with several features not available in the LX trim. The upgrades included ABS, 4-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch EX coupe six-spoke alloy wheels, body-coloured side moldings, chin spoiler, and standard automatic transmission. Three colours were offered for the 10th Anniversary Edition: Frost White, Granada Black Pearl, and Arcadia Green Pearl. The 10th Anniversary models also included the same premium seat fabric found in EX models. The Frost White and Arcadia Green cars were paired with the same interior colour as their LX/EX counterparts, Blue and Ivory, respectively. The Granada Black cars were paired with Gray interior, while the Granada Black EX had an Ivory interior.

The SE returned in late 1992 as both a sedan and for the first time since the 1989 SE-i, as a coupe. The SE sedan featured standard dual front airbags; the first Accord to do so. An 8-button, 4-speaker Honda-Bose audio system, automatic transmission, leather trim, body-coloured bumper, and body side moldings were standard. The SE coupe included a factory rear wing spoiler which differed slightly in design from the already available dealer-installed accessory rear wing spoiler. In Canada, the SE came with heated front seats and heated side-view mirrors. Both the sedan and coupe received distinctive 15-inch alloy wheels as well. All SE sedans during 1990–1991 (1991 MY) and 1992–1993 (1993 MY) were manufactured in Japan, while all SE coupes were produced in the U.S. The 1993 MY sedan was available in two colours: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Geneva Green Pearl, both with Ivory interior. The coupe was offered with two colours as well: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Atlantis Blue Pearl, both again with Ivory interior. 1993 would be the swan song for the SE as exclusive, high content, limited edition Accord model. Later generations would use a &quot;Special Edition&quot; designation rather than the previously used &quot;SE&quot; designation. These models were a combination of an Accord LX with several EX features similar to the 1993 10th Anniversary Edition LX.

At the end of the model life of the CB Accord, a &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; model called the Honda Ascot Innova was launched in Japan, based on the CB Accord chassis, but with a different, much more modern-styled body, taking cues from the 1992 Honda Prelude.
=== Honda Ascot ===

The fourth-generation Accord spawned a sister model in 1989, called the Honda Ascot which, while mechanically identical to the Accord, featured unique sedan bodywork, although it bore a resemblance to the Accord. The Ascot was sold through the &quot;Honda Primo&quot; network in Japan while the Accord was distributed through the &quot;Honda Clio&quot; network.
=== Honda Vigor and Honda Inspire ===

Unlike previous generations of the Honda Vigor, which were simply upmarket versions of the Accord, the third generation &#x27;CB5&#x27; model was spun off as a model in its own right and was based on a different platform which featured a longitudinal engine layout compared to the transverse set-up of the Accord. A sister model to the Vigor, the Honda Inspire, was also unveiled in 1989 and, bar a different front grille, front and rear lights, and bumpers, sported identical bodywork. The Vigor was available in the United States and Canada under the Acura brand.
== Fifth generation (1993) ==

For the first time in the model&#x27;s history, Honda developed two distinct versions of the Accord when the fifth-generation model was launched in the fall of 1993; one version for the European market and one for the North American and Japanese market. Honda and the Rover Group created the European Accord and the Rover 600, a reflection of the past success they had with the Honda Legend and the Rover 800. This generation Accord was also sold in Japan as the Isuzu Aska, while some Isuzu products were sold as Honda products there also.

At its introduction in 1993, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the second time.

=== North America, Japan and Asia Pacific ===


The fifth-generation North American Accord was launched on 9 September 1993, for the 1994 model year and was based on the new &#x27;CD&#x27; chassis. Larger than its predecessor, primarily to better suit the requirements of the North American market, the new model grew in width but shrunk in length, leaving it classified as a mid-size car in North America. It thus became too wide to fit within the favorable tax bracket in Japan, where its role was to be partially taken over by the slightly narrower second-generation Honda Ascot (sold at &quot;Honda Primo&quot; Japanese dealerships) and Honda Rafaga (sold at &quot;Honda Verno&quot;). Previous generations of the Accord sold in Japan were limited to a width dimension of while international models were slightly wider, however, this generation no longer complied. The engines offered with the Accord also exceeded the maximum limit of 2000cc to remain in the favorable &quot;compact&quot; tax bracket. The installation of a 2.0-litre engine in Japanese models made buyers liable for more annual road tax over the smaller 1.8-litre engine, which affected sales.

Development began in September 1989, along with the design process in June 1990. The final design was selected by an early date of 18 December 1990 and frozen by mid-1991. Design inconsistencies in early 1992, caused several alterations to be made until April 1992, when a secondary design freeze took place, ahead of scheduled 1993 production. Design patents were later filed in the United States on 16 December 1992 for the &quot;CD&quot;. Production later began at Marysville assembly on 24 August 1993.

Honda of Japan marketed four different size engines in the Japanese-spec Accord sedan: 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 VTEC and 2.2 DOHC VTEC. The Japanese-spec Accord models were marketed as the following: EF, EX, 2.0EX, 2.0EXL, 2.2VTE, 2.2VTL, 2.2VTS and SiR. All Accord versions were sold at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; locations in Japan.

The fifth-generation Accord became the first Accord to be built and sold in the Philippines.

The DX, LX and EX models remained the American trim lines, while Canada retained the LX, EX and EX-R. The 5-speed manual transmission remained mostly unchanged, while the 4-speed automatic noted for its hard shifts, now included Honda&#x27;s &quot;Grade-Logic&quot; shift program, which would prevent &quot;gear-hunting&quot; by holding the current gear while driving on a sloped incline. All Accord models received a more ergonomic interior with standard safety features such as dual airbags and reinforced side-impact beams. Exclusive to the EX was the F22B1 SOHC VTEC version of previous-generation 2.2-litre 4-cylinder (making up from on the previous generation EX), anti-lock brakes (now an option for the LX), 4-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a rear stabiliser bar. Leather was an option in the EX trim with leather-equipped models now being referred to as EX-L. DX and LX models came equipped similarly to the previous generation and were fitted with a revised version of the previous generation&#x27;s 2.2-litre non-VTEC 4-cylinder engine. This F22B2 engine was rated at up from the previous generation. The Accord was again named &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Import Car of the Year for 1994. The Accord coupe as in the previous generation looked almost exactly like the sedan and was the last generation of the Accord to offer a wagon variant in North America until the introduction of the Accord Crosstour in 2009.

In 1994, the 1995 Accord debuted a V6 engine, the 2.7 L &quot;C27&quot; borrowed from the first-generation Acura Legend, in the U.S. market. The V6 was offered in both the LX and EX versions of the sedan, LX models being referred to as LX-V6 and EX models as EX-V6. EX-V6 models came equipped similarly to the EX-L with leather seats being the only option in the EX-V6. The addition of the taller C27 engine required substantial alterations to the CD platform, with V6 models sporting a redesigned engine layout, taller front bumpers, and a different bonnet than I4 models; however, these differences are difficult to spot without both models parked side by side. Both versions of the V6 received a dual-outlet exhaust, a 4-speed automatic transmission, 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels on the EX-V6, and 15-inch steel wheels with full covers on the LX-V6, and a slightly updated front grille (which would be later used in all 96–97 Accords). The Accord saw very few other changes for 1995 with the exception of a few different exterior and interior colour combinations.

In 1995, the Accord underwent the usual mid-generation facelift for 1996. More rounded bumpers, a slightly modified front fascia (which was originally exclusive in the V6 models in 1995) with new signal lights and rear taillamps gave the Accord a softer look. All Hondas now complied with the federal government&#x27;s requirement of OBD II engine diagnostics though all three engine choices remained the same. In order to increase the Accord&#x27;s competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets, Honda CEO Nobuhiko Kawamoto decided on one basic platform for the sixth-generation Accord, but with different bodies and proportions for local markets. In the U.S., the 1996 model lineup included the 25th Anniversary Edition, a model positioned between the DX and LX. The Special Edition trim package was introduced.

In 1996, for the 1997 model year, Honda released the &quot;Special Edition&quot; version of the Accord (not to be confused with the SE). It was offered in three colours: Heather Mist Metallic, San Marino Red, and Dark Currant Pearl. The Special Edition received a factory-installed security system with keyless entry, single-disc CD player, body-coloured side molding, distinctive alloy wheels, and a sunroof. It was offered in automatic transmission only and was fitted with the same engine as the LX. Acclaimed for its handling, the 1996 Accord has been known as one of the best-handling Japanese mid-size sedans of all time, posting impressive lateral g figures of up to .89 g&#x27;s.

In New Zealand, the fifth-generation Accord was assembled at Honda&#x27;s manufacturing site in Nelson and was released in March 1994. It was available in LXi, EXi and EXi-S trim levels. A facelift was released in December 1995, which coincided with the release of VTEC engines in the upper-spec models. Trim levels were LXi, VTi, and VTi-S. These were the first NZ-market Accords to have airbags – two in the VTi-S, one in the VTi.

U.S.- and Japan-built coupe and wagon models of this generation were shipped to Europe with both left and right-hand-drive but there was no V6 option.

This generation of the Accord is one of the most frequently stolen cars in the U.S.

The 1994 Honda Accord was named &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot;.

==== Honda Accord SiR ====

Honda of Japan produced three high-performance models of the Accord for the Japanese domestic market referred to as the SiR, which was available for sale at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships in Japan. The sports car approach to the Accord SiR was aimed at aligning the Accord with the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; sports sedan that replaced the Vigor, called the Honda Saber a platform-mate shared with the Honda Inspire. The compact sedan role the Accord previously filled was now relegated to the Honda Rafaga and Ascot. The Accord SiR models came equipped with the Japan-spec 2.2-litre DOHC VTEC (H22A) 4-cylinder engine instead of the 2.2-litre SOHC VTEC (F22B1) 4-cylinder engine found in the EX. The Japan-spec H22A engine specs were at 6,800 rpm; peak torque at 5,500 rpm with a compression ratio of 10.6:1. The Japan-spec H22A engine was similar to the H22A1 engine found in the North American market used in the 1993-1996 Prelude VTEC.

The Japan-built SiR sedan (94–97) was available with a 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment or an optional &quot;Grade-Logic&quot; 4-speed automatic transmission. The Honda of America-built (HAM) Accord SiR coupe and then the 1997 SiR wagon had the &quot;Grade-Logic&quot; four-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment (5-speed manual transmission were not available for these two models). It came with cloth sport seats styled similar to the Prelude or optional leather seats, both exclusive to the SiR. The SiR also had some power options found on the Accord EX. The Accord SiR coupe (94–97) and the Accord SiR wagon (1997) were exclusively available for the Japanese market. SiR chassis codes for the sedan were the CD6, the coupe-CD8, and the 1997 wagon-CF2 (production began in September 1996 for the 1997 SiR wagons which lasted for almost one year). The Accord SiR Coupe and the Accord SiR wagon (1997), which were exclusively built in the United States at Honda&#x27;s Marysville Ohio plant (HAM) but were marketed for Japan export only for this particular model, was not offered in North America.

The Accord SiR Coupe and then Accord SiR wagon was built with the Japan-spec H22A powertrains which were shipped from Japan and were installed into the HAM-built Accord SiR models. The 1994–1997 &quot;CD&quot; Accord chassis was designed for the H22A powertrain to be installed; because the firewall was curved at the top to allow more space for the tilting backward of the H22A engine near the middle of the firewall. The H22A 4-cylinder engine was the most powerful inline 4-cylinder engine Honda built for the Prelude and the Accord before the 1995 U.S.-spec V6 sedan. The Accord SiR suspension was improved with a stiffer front sway bar (27.2 mm x 4.0 mm), stiffer rear sway bar (16 mm), stiffer front and rear coil springs.

Features for the 94–95 Accord SiR models (sedans and coupes) included the following items: cruise control, automatic climate control (Similar to the first-generation Acura CL), Bose stereo system, 7,400 redline tachometer, optional electronic traction control, and optional limited-slip differential for automatic transmission, optional SRS and airbags, factory-installed driving lights, optional factory-installed &quot;pop up&quot; navigation radio head unit, sound insulation liner under front bonnet, black-housing headlamps, no side molding was available on the Accord SiR sedan, optional rear sunscreen, optional sunroof, and power-retractable outside mirrors. Features for the 96–97 Accord SiR models (sedans, coupes, and wagons) included the same as above while adding; optional cruise control, rear window wiper on the sedan, optional leather interior, and a coloured side molding for the sedan as well.

=== European model ===
The fifth-generation Accord for the European market was unveiled in 1993 and was completely different from the global model (&#x27;CD&#x27;). It was in fact the Japanese-market Honda Ascot Innova which was based on the previous fourth-generation &#x27;CB&#x27; Accord. It was the result of a joint effort with the Rover Group that provided Rover with the 600 series. The exterior was designed by Shigeo Ueno, was finalised in 1989. The styling of the European Accord differed dramatically from the larger North American variant which featured a more conventional sedan styling compared to the European model&#x27;s low slung, fastback-inspired look which also incorporated rear quarter windows.

In 1996, the European Accord received a minor facelift and was given a new front end and slightly different taillamps. The styling of the facelifted Accord remained identical to the styling of the Ascot Innova (although the frameless doors were replaced with conventional items) and featured the design language first introduced on the fifth-generation Honda Civic. The facelifted Accord was also equipped with two airbags as standard.

However, the European Accord did not spawn a station wagon nor a coupé version. Instead, Honda opted to import the coupé and station wagon (Aerodeck) versions of the global Accord.

The diesel model of the Accord was fitted with the direct injection Rover L-series diesel engine, as also fitted in the Rover 600.

==== Rover 600 ====

As part of the tie-up with the Rover Group the European Accord spawned Rover&#x27;s replacement for the Austin Montego in 1993. Called the 600, the car shared its platform with the European Accord and, with the exception of the front doors, lower rear doors, and windscreen, sported unique styling which dispensed with the rear quarter windows. The interior design of the 600 was very similar to the Accord&#x27;s however, while the dashboard design was identical.

== Sixth generation (1997) ==

For the sixth generation, Honda split the Accord into three separate models, designed for the Japanese, North American, and European markets. However, the wagon was discontinued in North America while the coupé was discontinued in Japan. This generation also spawned two distinctively branded performance versions for European and Japanese domestic markets, dubbed Type R, and Euro R, respectively.

== Seventh generation (2002) ==

The seventh generation of the Accord was launched in 2002 for the 2003 model year, and consists of two separate models; one for the Japanese and European markets, and the other for North America (CM5), with the Japanese and European model being sold in North America as the Acura TSX. However, both were in fact sold in many other markets, fueled by the popular Cog advertisement for the Accord. Euro R trim continued into this generation as a performance model for the Japanese market, making use of K20 engine producing , however, European performance model was renamed Type S and used a larger K24 engine tuned to produce .

=== Japan and Europe ===


The European and Japanese Accords were integrated on the previous Japanese Accord&#x27;s chassis, but with a new body. No longer made in Swindon, those Accords were made in Japan, and came in both sedan and station wagon form.

At its introduction in 2003, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for a record third time. In Europe, the car featured a 2.0 i-VTEC with , a 2.4 i-VTEC with , and an &quot;exceptional&quot; 2.2 i-CTDi turbo-diesel N22A1 engine, initially with and of torque, while doing 51 mpg on the EU combined cycle.

This model was sold in certain markets such as Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand as the &quot;Accord Euro&quot; and in North America as the Acura TSX, with a significant distinction being that the TSX featured the interior of the contemporary Honda Inspire instead.
==== Accord Euro R (CL7) ====
The Honda Accord Euro R (CL7) was launched in October 2002, succeeding the previous Euro R (CL1). A lightened and more sports-focused variant of the Japanese car the Accord Euro R was powered by the K20A 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC engine producing at 8000 rpm and of torque at 7000 rpm through the only option of a lightweight 6-speed manual transmission. A similar engine can be found in the JDM Integra Type R (DC5). The Accord Euro-R was only available to the Japanese Domestic Market. Some features that distinguish it are the Recaro seats, the body kit, a MOMO steering wheel, lightweight 17-inch alloys, and a special aluminum gear knob found only in Honda&#x27;s Type R variants.

=== North America and Asia Pacific ===


The North American Accord grew in size yet again, becoming a vastly different car than its Japanese and European counterparts. This generation was available in both coupe and sedan forms, while a hybrid model was introduced in early 2005. For 2006, it was significantly updated.

This Accord was the first to use wheels with five lug nuts instead of the traditional four on 4-cylinder models. The 4-cylinder version came with and ( and for 2005–2007 models) K24A1 2397 cc 4-cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed automatic or 5-speed manual. The 4-cylinder engine also used a timing chain instead of a timing belt.

For 2003, Honda began to offer a more aggressive Accord Coupe, equipped with the and ( and for 2006–2007 models) J30A4 2997cc V6 mated to a 6-speed manual transmission borrowed from the Acura TL Type S (without a limited-slip differential). This coupe came with 17-inch wheels (that varied between the 03-05 and 06-07 models), a strut tower bar, perforated leather seating, carbon fiber dash pieces, and an upgraded 180-watt stereo system. Because of the ability to maintain activation of the VTEC system all the way through hard acceleration, the Accord EX V6 6-speed ran from 0–60 mph in 5.9 seconds according to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, more than a second faster than the automatic version.

This model was also sold in Japan as the Honda Inspire from 2003 to 2008. In China, the model got the name &quot;Guangzhou-Honda Accord&quot; and was sold from 2003 up to December 2009.

== Eighth generation (2007) ==

=== Accord in Japan and Spirior in Europe and China ===


The updated Accord for the Japanese and European markets went on sale in mid 2008. It is also sold as the Accord Euro in the Australia and New Zealand markets, and as the Acura TSX in North America. It is available as both a sedan and a station wagon. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a version of the sedan is sold as the Honda Spirior which later on developed an independent second generation. Production began in August 2009 in China, by Dongfeng Honda. Production ended at the end of February 2015 for Australia and New Zealand spec models, although sales continued in Australia until the beginning of 2016.

In Europe, the car maintained the 2.0 and 2.4 i-VTEC petrol (upped to 156 and 198 bhp respectively), whilst a new 2.2 i-DTEC diesel engine provided with in standard trim levels, and with in Type-S sports trim level. This allowed the Accord to go 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 8.5 seconds, and still do 50 mpg on the EU Combined cycle. Sales in Europe were discontinued in 2015.
=== Accord in North America and China and Inspire in Japan ===


The North American version of the Accord has a different body from its Japanese counterpart. The Accord in this form was sold as the Inspire in Japan and was not sold in Europe, Turkey, Israel and North Africa. It was discontinued in Japan in September 2012. Larger than the previous model, the sedan was classified as a full-size car by EPA standards, though American Honda executive vice president John Mendel said in 2011 that Honda did not intend to build a full-size car since the trend was for smaller cars having better fuel consumption. A coupe version was available, as well as a Crosstour fastback model, which was introduced in the U.S. in 2009 for the 2010 model year. Engines include a 2.4 L 4-cylinder rated at 177 bhp (132 kW) with for LX and SE sedans and 190 bhp (142 kW) with for EX, EX-L and LX-S sedans and coupes; as well as a 3.5 L V6 rated at 272 bhp (203 kW) with .

In Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore, this car which was assembled in Thailand, was sold as the Accord in left or right-hand-drive forms. In Malaysia and India, this Accord model was locally assembled. In Hong Kong, this car was made in Japan and sold as the Accord, and in Taiwan, the Accord was locally assembled. In China, Guangqi Honda also makes this vehicle with 2.0 L, 2.4 L and 3.5 L engines. Guangqi began making the Accord Crosstour in 2010.

In Malaysia, the eighth-generation was also rebadged as the Proton Perdana from December 2013 and was used by government officials. It was assembled at the Honda-DRB plant in HICOM Industrial Park Pegoh, Alor Gajah, Melaka.

== Ninth generation (2012) ==


For the ninth-generation Accord, Honda appointed Shoji Matsui, who served as an engineer on the Accord platform from 1985 to 1996, as the lead project manager. It is the first Honda vehicle to be completely developed under the administration of Honda CEO Takanobu Ito.

Honda revealed the Accord Coupe Concept at the January 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. In August 2012, the company released initial details pertaining to the 2013 Accord sedan, and production versions of both the sedan and coupe were fully unveiled in early September 2012. The Accord sedan went on sale on 19 September 2012, in the United States, with the coupe following on 15 October 2012. Corresponding release dates in Canada for the sedan and coupe models are 24 September 2012, and 1 November 2012, respectively. In February 2013, the Accord was scheduled to enter the Russian market. In June 2013, the Accord hybrid and plug-in hybrid were introduced to the Japanese market, with the discontinuation of the Honda Inspire, serving as Honda&#x27;s large sedan and one level below the Honda Legend.

From 2014, Honda began exporting the Accord from China to the Middle East, Africa, members of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and others. However, from 2017 onwards, Accords that are sold in the Middle Eastern markets are now sourced from the Marysville Auto Plant in Ohio.

While replaced by the tenth-generation in late 2017, the ninth-generation Accord continued to be built in Thailand until 2019 in most right-hand-drive markets.

The Accord Hybrid went on sale in March 2018. The 1.3 kWh lithium-ion battery was reduced in physical size and moved from the boot to under the rear seat. The generator and propulsion motor permanent magnets no longer contain rare-earth heavy metals.

To save weight, the front subframe, front control arms, bonnet, front and rear bumpers are constructed of aluminum, which were previously reserved for past hybrid models. Approximately 57% of the body was made from high strength steel including 29% ultra-high-strength hot stamped 980-1500 MPa grades. Structural adhesives are employed for the first time on the Accord with 115 ft of adhesive bonding applied to the body. The body in white (BIW) is lighter, with improved structural rigidity.

<doc id="364460" wikidata="Q17102788" url="?curid=364460" title="Ring of symmetric functions">
<text>In algebra and in particular in algebraic combinatorics, the ring of symmetric functions is a specific limit of the rings of symmetric polynomials in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates, as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between symmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number &quot;n&quot; of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other things, this ring plays an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric group.

The ring of symmetric functions can be given a coproduct and a bilinear form making it into a positive selfadjoint graded Hopf algebra that is both commutative and cocommutative.

== Symmetric polynomials ==

The study of symmetric functions is based on that of symmetric polynomials. In a polynomial ring in some finite set of indeterminates, a polynomial is called &quot;symmetric&quot; if it stays the same whenever the indeterminates are permuted in any way. More formally, there is an action by ring automorphisms of the symmetric group &quot;Sn&quot; on the polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates, where a permutation acts on a polynomial by simultaneously substituting each of the indeterminates for another according to the permutation used. The invariants for this action form the subring of symmetric polynomials. If the indeterminates are &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then examples of such symmetric polynomials are

: formula_1
: formula_2

and

:formula_3

A somewhat more complicated example is
&quot;X&quot;13&quot;X&quot;2&quot;X&quot;3 + &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;23&quot;X&quot;3 + &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;2&quot;X&quot;33 + &quot;X&quot;13&quot;X&quot;2&quot;X&quot;4 + &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;23&quot;X&quot;4 + &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;2&quot;X&quot;43 + ...
where the summation goes on to include all products of the third power of some variable and two other variables. There are many specific kinds of symmetric polynomials, such as elementary symmetric polynomials, power sum symmetric polynomials, monomial symmetric polynomials, complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials, and Schur polynomials.

== The ring of symmetric functions ==
Most relations between symmetric polynomials do not depend on the number &quot;n&quot; of indeterminates, other than that some polynomials in the relation might require &quot;n&quot; to be large enough in order to be defined. For instance the Newton&#x27;s identity for the third power sum polynomial &quot;p3&quot; leads to
:formula_4
where the formula_5 denote elementary symmetric polynomials; this formula is valid for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, and the only notable dependency on it is that &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = 0 whenever &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot;. One would like to write this as an identity 
:formula_6
that does not depend on &quot;n&quot; at all, and this can be done in the ring of symmetric functions. In that ring there are nonzero elements &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot; for all integers &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, and any element of the ring can be given by a polynomial expression in the elements &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

=== Definitions ===

A ring of symmetric functions can be defined over any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, and will be denoted Λ&quot;R&quot;; the basic case is for &quot;R&quot; = Z. The ring Λ&quot;R&quot; is in fact a graded &quot;R&quot;-algebra. There are two main constructions for it; the first one given below can be found in (Stanley, 1999), and the second is essentially the one given in (Macdonald, 1979).

==== As a ring of formal power series ====

The easiest (though somewhat heavy) construction starts with the ring of formal power series formula_7 over &quot;R&quot; in infinitely (countably) many indeterminates; the elements of this power series ring are formal infinite sums of terms, each of which consists of a coefficient from &quot;R&quot; multiplied by a monomial, where each monomial is a product of finitely many finite powers of indeterminates. One defines Λ&quot;R&quot; as its subring consisting of those power series &quot;S&quot; that satisfy 
#&quot;S&quot; is invariant under any permutation of the indeterminates, and
#the degrees of the monomials occurring in &quot;S&quot; are bounded.
Note that because of the second condition, power series are used here only to allow infinitely many terms of a fixed degree, rather than to sum terms of all possible degrees. Allowing this is necessary because an element that contains for instance a term &quot;X&quot;1 should also contain a term &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; for every &quot;i&quot; &gt; 1 in order to be symmetric. Unlike the whole power series ring, the subring Λ&quot;R&quot; is graded by the total degree of monomials: due to condition 2, every element of Λ&quot;R&quot; is a finite sum of homogeneous elements of Λ&quot;R&quot; (which are themselves infinite sums of terms of equal degree). For every &quot;k&quot; ≥ 0, the element &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot; ∈ Λ&quot;R&quot; is defined as the formal sum of all products of &quot;k&quot; distinct indeterminates, which is clearly homogeneous of degree &quot;k&quot;.

==== As an algebraic limit ====

Another construction of Λ&quot;R&quot; takes somewhat longer to describe, but better indicates the relationship with the rings &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;]S&quot;n&quot; of symmetric polynomials in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates. For every &quot;n&quot; there is a surjective ring homomorphism &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot; from the analogous ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1]S&quot;n&quot;+1 with one more indeterminate onto &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;]S&quot;n&quot;, defined by setting the last indeterminate &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 to 0. Although &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot; has a non-trivial kernel, the nonzero elements of that kernel have degree at least formula_8 (they are multiples of &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;2...&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1). This means that the restriction of &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot; to elements of degree at most &quot;n&quot; is a bijective linear map, and &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1)) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. The inverse of this restriction can be extended uniquely to a ring homomorphism &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot; from &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;]S&quot;n&quot; to &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1]S&quot;n&quot;+1, as follows for instance from the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials. Since the images &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) for &quot;k&quot; = 1...,&quot;n&quot; are still algebraically independent over &quot;R&quot;, the homomorphism &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot; is injective and can be viewed as a (somewhat unusual) inclusion of rings; applying &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot; to a polynomial amounts to adding all monomials containing the new indeterminate obtained by symmetry from monomials already present. The ring Λ&quot;R&quot; is then the &quot;union&quot; (direct limit) of all these rings subject to these inclusions. Since all &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot; are compatible with the grading by total degree of the rings involved, Λ&quot;R&quot; obtains the structure of a graded ring.

This construction differs slightly from the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot; without mentioning the injective morphisms &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot;: it constructs the homogeneous components of Λ&quot;R&quot; separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot;. It is also observed that the result can be described as an inverse limit in the category of &quot;graded&quot; rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a &quot;direct&quot; limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot;]S&quot;d&quot;. It suffices to take for &quot;d&quot; the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree &quot;d&quot; of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;d&quot;. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.

=== Defining individual symmetric functions ===

The name &quot;symmetric function&quot; for elements of Λ&quot;R&quot; is a misnomer: in neither construction are the elements functions, and in fact, unlike symmetric polynomials, no function of independent variables can be associated to such elements (for instance &quot;e&quot;1 would be the sum of all infinitely many variables, which is not defined unless restrictions are imposed on the variables). However the name is traditional and well established; it can be found both in (Macdonald, 1979), which says (footnote on p. 12)
The elements of Λ (unlike those of Λ&quot;n&quot;) are no longer polynomials: they are formal infinite sums of monomials. We have therefore reverted to the older terminology of symmetric functions.
(here Λ&quot;n&quot; denotes the ring of symmetric polynomials in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates), and also in (Stanley, 1999).

To define a symmetric function one must either indicate directly a power series as in the first construction, or give a symmetric polynomial in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates for every natural number &quot;n&quot; in a way compatible with the second construction. An expression in an unspecified number of indeterminates may do both, for instance
:formula_9
can be taken as the definition of an elementary symmetric function if the number of indeterminates is infinite, or as the definition of an elementary symmetric polynomial in any finite number of indeterminates. Symmetric polynomials for the same symmetric function should be compatible with the homomorphisms &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot; (decreasing the number of indeterminates is obtained by setting some of them to zero, so that the coefficients of any monomial in the remaining indeterminates is unchanged), and their degree should remain bounded. (An example of a family of symmetric polynomials that fails both conditions is formula_10; the family formula_11 fails only the second condition.) Any symmetric polynomial in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates can be used to construct a compatible family of symmetric polynomials, using the homomorphisms &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; to decrease the number of indeterminates, and &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot; to increase the number of indeterminates (which amounts to adding all monomials in new indeterminates obtained by symmetry from monomials already present).

The following are fundamental examples of symmetric functions.
* The monomial symmetric functions &quot;m&quot;α. Suppose α = (α1,α2...) is a sequence of non-negative integers, only finitely many of which are non-zero. Then we can consider the monomial defined by α: &quot;X&quot;α = &quot;X&quot;1α1&quot;X&quot;2α2&quot;X&quot;3α3... Then &quot;m&quot;α is the symmetric function determined by &quot;X&quot;α, i.e. the sum of all monomials obtained from &quot;X&quot;α by symmetry. For a formal definition, define β ~ α to mean that the sequence β is a permutation of the sequence α and set
::formula_12
:This symmetric function corresponds to the monomial symmetric polynomial &quot;m&quot;α(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for any &quot;n&quot; large enough to have the monomial &quot;X&quot;α. The distinct monomial symmetric functions are parametrized by the integer partitions (each &quot;m&quot;α has a unique representative monomial &quot;X&quot;λ with the parts λ&quot;i&quot; in weakly decreasing order). Since any symmetric function containing any of the monomials of some &quot;m&quot;α must contain all of them with the same coefficient, each symmetric function can be written as an &quot;R&quot;-linear combination of monomial symmetric functions, and the distinct monomial symmetric functions therefore form a basis of Λ&quot;R&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module.
* The elementary symmetric functions &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for any natural number &quot;k&quot;; one has &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;m&quot;α where formula_13. As a power series, this is the sum of all distinct products of &quot;k&quot; distinct indeterminates. This symmetric function corresponds to the elementary symmetric polynomial &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot;.
* The power sum symmetric functions &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for any positive integer &quot;k&quot;; one has &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;m&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), the monomial symmetric function for the monomial &quot;X&quot;1&quot;k&quot;. This symmetric function corresponds to the power sum symmetric polynomial &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;X&quot;1&quot;k&quot; + ... + &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1.
* The complete homogeneous symmetric functions &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for any natural number &quot;k&quot;; &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the sum of all monomial symmetric functions &quot;m&quot;α where α is a partition of &quot;k&quot;. As a power series, this is the sum of &quot;all&quot; monomials of degree &quot;k&quot;, which is what motivates its name. This symmetric function corresponds to the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot;.
* The Schur functions &quot;s&quot;λ for any partition λ, which corresponds to the Schur polynomial &quot;s&quot;λ(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for any &quot;n&quot; large enough to have the monomial &quot;X&quot;λ.

There is no power sum symmetric function &quot;p&quot;0: although it is possible (and in some contexts natural) to define formula_14 as a symmetric &quot;polynomial&quot; in &quot;n&quot; variables, these values are not compatible with the morphisms &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The &quot;discriminant&quot; formula_15 is another example of an expression giving a symmetric polynomial for all &quot;n&quot;, but not defining any symmetric function. The expressions defining Schur polynomials as a quotient of alternating polynomials are somewhat similar to that for the discriminant, but the polynomials &quot;s&quot;λ(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) turn out to be compatible for varying &quot;n&quot;, and therefore do define a symmetric function.

=== A principle relating symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions ===

For any symmetric function &quot;P&quot;, the corresponding symmetric polynomials in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates for any natural number &quot;n&quot; may be designated by &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;). The second definition of the ring of symmetric functions implies the following fundamental principle:

:If &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are symmetric functions of degree &quot;d&quot;, then one has the identity formula_16 of symmetric functions if and only if one has the identity &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot;) of symmetric polynomials in &quot;d&quot; indeterminates. In this case one has in fact &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for &quot;any&quot; number &quot;n&quot; of indeterminates.

This is because one can always reduce the number of variables by substituting zero for some variables, and one can increase the number of variables by applying the homomorphisms &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot;; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) = &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) (and similarly for &quot;Q&quot;) whenever &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;d&quot;. See a proof of Newton&#x27;s identities for an effective application of this principle.

== Properties of the ring of symmetric functions ==

=== Identities ===

The ring of symmetric functions is a convenient tool for writing identities between symmetric polynomials that are independent of the number of indeterminates: in Λ&quot;R&quot; there is no such number, yet by the above principle any identity in Λ&quot;R&quot; automatically gives identities the rings of symmetric polynomials over &quot;R&quot; in any number of indeterminates. Some fundamental identities are
:formula_17
which shows a symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions; these relations are explained under complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial.
:formula_18
the Newton identities, which also have a variant for complete homogeneous symmetric functions:
:formula_19

=== Structural properties of Λ&quot;R&quot; ===
Important properties of Λ&quot;R&quot; include the following.

# The set of monomial symmetric functions parametrized by partitions form a basis of Λ&quot;R&quot; as a graded &quot;R&quot;-module, those parametrized by partitions of &quot;d&quot; being homogeneous of degree &quot;d&quot;; the same is true for the set of Schur functions (also parametrized by partitions).
# Λ&quot;R&quot; is isomorphic as a graded &quot;R&quot;-algebra to a polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;Y&quot;1,&quot;Y&quot;2, ...] in infinitely many variables, where &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is given degree &quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0, one isomorphism being the one that sends &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∈ Λ&quot;R&quot; for every &quot;i&quot;.
# There is an involutory automorphism ω of Λ&quot;R&quot; that interchanges the elementary symmetric functions &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; and the complete homogeneous symmetric function &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;. It also sends each power sum symmetric function &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; to (−1)&quot;i&quot;−1&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and it permutes the Schur functions among each other, interchanging &quot;s&quot;λ and &quot;s&quot;λt where λt is the transpose partition of λ.

Property 2 is the essence of the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials. It immediately implies some other properties:
* The subring of Λ&quot;R&quot; generated by its elements of degree at most &quot;n&quot; is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials over &quot;R&quot; in &quot;n&quot; variables;
* The Hilbert–Poincaré series of Λ&quot;R&quot; is formula_20, the generating function of the integer partitions (this also follows from property 1);
* For every &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, the &quot;R&quot;-module formed by the homogeneous part of Λ&quot;R&quot; of degree &quot;n&quot;, modulo its intersection with the subring generated by its elements of degree strictly less than &quot;n&quot;, is free of rank 1, and (the image of) &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a generator of this &quot;R&quot;-module;
* For every family of symmetric functions (&quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;i&quot;&gt;0 in which &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; is homogeneous of degree &quot;i&quot; and gives a generator of the free &quot;R&quot;-module of the previous point (for all &quot;i&quot;), there is an alternative isomorphism of graded &quot;R&quot;-algebras from &quot;R&quot;[&quot;Y&quot;1,&quot;Y&quot;2, ...] as above to Λ&quot;R&quot; that sends &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;; in other words, the family (&quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;i&quot;&gt;0 forms a set of free polynomial generators of Λ&quot;R&quot;.

This final point applies in particular to the family (&quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;i&quot;&gt;0 of complete homogeneous symmetric functions. 
If &quot;R&quot; contains the field formula_21 of rational numbers, it applies also to the family (&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;i&quot;&gt;0 of power sum symmetric functions. This explains why the first &quot;n&quot; elements of each of these families define sets of symmetric polynomials in &quot;n&quot; variables that are free polynomial generators of that ring of symmetric polynomials.

The fact that the complete homogeneous symmetric functions form a set of free polynomial generators of Λ&quot;R&quot; already shows the existence of an automorphism ω sending the elementary symmetric functions to the complete homogeneous ones, as mentioned in property 3. The fact that ω is an involution of Λ&quot;R&quot; follows from the symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions expressed by the first set of relations given above.

The ring of symmetric functions ΛZ is the Exp ring of the integers Z. It is also a lambda-ring in a natural fashion; in fact it is the universal lambda-ring in one generator.

=== Generating functions ===

The first definition of Λ&quot;R&quot; as a subring of formula_22 allows the generating functions of several sequences of symmetric functions to be elegantly expressed. Contrary to the relations mentioned earlier, which are internal to Λ&quot;R&quot;, these expressions involve operations taking place in &quot;R&quot;&quot;X&quot;1,&quot;X&quot;2...;&quot;t&quot; but outside its subring Λ&quot;R&quot;&quot;t&quot;, so they are meaningful only if symmetric functions are viewed as formal power series in indeterminates &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;. We shall write &quot;(&quot;X&quot;)&quot; after the symmetric functions to stress this interpretation.

The generating function for the elementary symmetric functions is
:formula_23
Similarly one has for complete homogeneous symmetric functions
:formula_24
The obvious fact that formula_25 explains the symmetry between elementary and complete homogeneous symmetric functions.
The generating function for the power sum symmetric functions can be expressed as
:formula_26
((Macdonald, 1979) defines &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as Σ&quot;k&quot;&gt;0 &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)&quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1, and its expressions therefore lack a factor &quot;t&quot; with respect to those given here). The two final expressions, involving the formal derivatives of the generating functions &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;H&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), imply Newton&#x27;s identities and their variants for the complete homogeneous symmetric functions. These expressions are sometimes written as
:formula_27
which amounts to the same, but requires that &quot;R&quot; contain the rational numbers, so that the logarithm of power series with constant term 1 is defined (by formula_28).

== Specializations ==
Let formula_29 be the ring of symmetric functions and formula_30 a commutative algebra with unit element. An algebra homomorphism formula_31 is called a &quot;specialization&quot;.

Example:
* Given some real numbers formula_32 and formula_33, then the substitution formula_34 and formula_35 is a specialization.
* Let formula_36, then formula_37 is called &quot;principal specialization&quot;.

<text>Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, 1st Baronet (19 February 1792 – 22 October 1871) was a Scottish geologist who served as director-general of the British Geological Survey from 1855 until his death in 1871. He is noted for investigating and describing the Silurian, Devonian and Permian systems.

==Early life and work==
Murchison was born at Tarradale House, Muir of Ord, Ross-shire, the son of Barbara and Kenneth Murchison. His wealthy father died in 1796, when Roderick was four years old, and he was sent to Durham School three years later and then to the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, to be trained for the army. In 1808 he landed with Wellesley in Portugal, and was present at the actions of Roliça and Vimeiro in the Peninsular War as an ensign in the 36th Regt of Foot. Subsequently, under Sir John Moore, he took part in the retreat to Corunna and the final battle there.

After eight years of service Murchison left the army and married Charlotte Hugonin (1788–1869), the only daughter of General Hugonin of Nursted House, Hampshire. Murchison and his wife spent two years in mainland Europe, particularly in Italy. They then settled in Barnard Castle, County Durham, England, in 1818, where Murchison made the acquaintance of Sir Humphry Davy. Davy urged Murchison to turn his energy to science, after hearing that he wasted his time riding to hounds and shooting. With encouragement from his wife Charlotte, Murchison became fascinated by the young science of geology and joined the Geological Society of London, soon becoming one of its most active members. His colleagues there included Adam Sedgwick, William Conybeare, William Buckland, William Fitton, Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin.

Exploring with his wife, Murchison studied the geology of the south of England, devoting special attention to the rocks of the north-west of Sussex and the adjoining parts of Hampshire and Surrey, on which, aided by Fitton, he wrote his first scientific paper, read to the Geological Society of London in 1825. Turning his attention to Continental geology, he and Lyell explored the volcanic region of Auvergne, parts of southern France, northern Italy, Tyrol and Switzerland. A little later, with Sedgwick as his companion, Murchison attacked the difficult problem of the geological structure of the Alps. Their joint paper giving the results of their study is a classic in the literature of Alpine geology.

Murchison was an opponent of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. He opposed the transmutation of species and supported successive creation.

==Silurian system==
In 1831 he went to the England–Wales border, to attempt to discover whether the greywacke rocks underlying the Old Red Sandstone could be grouped into a definite order of succession. The result was the establishment of the Silurian system under which were grouped, for the first time, a remarkable series of formations, each replete with distinctive organic remains other than and very different from those of the other rocks of England. These researches, together with descriptions of the coalfields and overlying formations in South Wales and the English border counties, were embodied in &quot;The Silurian System&quot; (1839). The English naturalist, geologist, and palaeontologist John William Salter assisted Murchison in his work on Siluria (1854 and later editions).

The establishment of the Silurian system was followed by that of the Devonian system, an investigation in which Murchison assisted, both in the south-west of England and in the Rhineland. Soon afterwards Murchison projected an important geological campaign in Russia with the view of extending to that part of the Continent the classification he had succeeded in elaborating for the older rocks of western Europe. He was accompanied by Édouard de Verneuil (1805–1873) and Count Alexander von Keyserling (1815–1891), in conjunction with whom he produced a work on Russia and the Ural Mountains. The publication of this monograph in 1845 completes the first and most active half of Murchison&#x27;s scientific career. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1840.

In 1846 he was knighted, and in the same year he presided over the meeting of the British Association at Southampton. During the later years of his life, a large part of his time was devoted to the affairs of the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was in 1830 one of the founders, and he was president 1843–1845, 1851–1853, 1856–1859 and 1862–1871. He served on the Royal Commission on the British Museum (1847–1849).

Murchison also announced the Permian system to geology in 1841, based on explorations in Perm Krai undertaken with Édouard de Verneuil.

Murchison was responsible for establishing much of the international prestige of British geology, and he viewed the spread of his stratigraphic systems on maps around the world &quot;as a scientific form of imperial expansion&quot;. He frequently described geological excursions (such those he made abroad) as &quot;invasions&quot; or &quot;conquests&quot; and enjoyed being dubbed the &quot;King of Siluria&quot;. According to the scholar Robert A. Stafford, &quot;Murchinson&#x27;s tendencies towards militarism, imperialism, and ran through his career and finally found full expression his simultaneous leadership of the Royal Geographical Society and the British Geological Survey.&quot;

==Scotland==

The chief geological investigation of the last decade of his life was devoted to the Highlands of Scotland, where he wrongly believed he had succeeded in showing that the vast masses of crystalline schists, previously supposed to be part of what used to be termed the Primitive formations, were really not older than the Silurian period, since underneath them lay beds of limestone and quartzite containing Lower Silurian (Cambrian) fossils. This started off what became known as the Highlands Controversy. James Nicol recognised the fallacy in Murchison&#x27;s theory and propounded his own ideas; in the 1880s these were superseded by the correct theory of Charles Lapworth, which was corroborated by Benjamin Peach and John Horne. Their subsequent research showed that the infraposition of the fossiliferous rocks is not their original place, but had been brought about by a gigantic system of dislocations, whereby successive masses of the oldest gneisses, have been exhumed from below and thrust over the younger formations.

In 1855 Murchison was appointed director-general of the British Geological Survey and director of the Royal School of Mines and the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, London, in succession to Sir Henry De la Beche, who had been the first to hold these offices. Official routine now occupied much of his time, but he found opportunity for the Highland researches just alluded to, and also for preparing successive editions of his work &quot;Siluria&quot; (1854, ed. 5, 1872), which was meant to present the main features of the original Silurian System together with a digest of subsequent discoveries, particularly of those that showed the extension of the Silurian classification into other countries.

==Later life==

In 1845, whilst visiting Carclew in Cornwall, he met several Cornish miners who were going to Australia. Believing that there might be gold there, he asked them to send back likely samples. They did this, and thus Murchison knew of the existence of gold in Australia before Edward Hargraves&#x27; discovery.
In 1857, Murchison was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. Three years later, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1863 he was made a KCB, and three years later he was created a baronet. The learned societies of his own country bestowed their highest rewards upon him: the Royal Society gave him the Copley Medal, the Geological Society its Wollaston medal, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh its Brisbane Medal. There was hardly a foreign scientific society of note without his name among its honorary members. The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the prix Cuvier, and elected him one of its eight foreign members in succession to Michael Faraday. In 1855 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and in 1871 awarded the Founders&#x27; Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

One of the closing public acts of Murchison&#x27;s life was the founding of a chair of geology and mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh. Under his will there was established the Murchison Medal and a geological fund (The Murchison Fund) to be awarded annually by the council of the Geological Society in London.

Murchison died in 1871 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London, near the north end of the arcade on the west side of the central path.

==Legacy==
The crater Murchison on the Moon and at least fifteen geographical locations on Earth are named after him.

These include: the Murchison Range, part of the Stauning Alps, and the Murchison Sound in Greenland; Mount Murchison in Banff National Park, Canada; Mount Murchison in the Mountaineer Range, Antarctica; Mount Murchison, just west of Squamish, British Columbia, Canada; tiny Murchison Island in Haida Gwaii in the same province; the Murchison Falls in Uganda; the Murchison River in Western Australia. Murchison has two other rivers named after him in Western Australia: the Roderick River and the Impey River, both tributaries of the Murchison. The town of Murchison in the Tasman District of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island was also named after him. Other New Zealand places named after him include Mount Murchison in Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park, Murchison Glacier in Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, and the Murchison Mountains in Fiordland National Park.

Murchison Road is one of the streets in east London, and there is a Murchison Avenue in Old Bexley, southeast London. Scarborough in North Yorkshire has a Murchison Street.

Murchison&#x27;s View is named after him. The viewpoint within the Wren&#x27;s Nest area of Dudley gives a panoramic view over much of Birmingham and the Black Country. Murchinson&#x27;s visits to the limestone hills of Dudley helped him to develop his understanding of the Silurian System. When he returned to the area in 1849 he was greeted by 15,000 locals who declared him the King of Siluria.

===Memorials===

A memorial tablet was installed on 3 November 2005 in front of School #9 in Perm in Russia. It consists of a stone base, irregular in form, about two metres long, and bearing a dark stone plate with the following inscription (in Russian):

The decision to perpetuate the explorer&#x27;s name was accepted by the school administration and pupils in connection with a discussion to establish in Perm a pillar or an arch devoted to Roderick Murchison.

In 2009, the Ural-Scottish Society erected a memorial to Murchison on the banks of the Chusovaya River. There is a commemorative blue plaque on his residence at 21 Galgate in Barnard Castle (County Durham).

A fictionalised version of Murchison appears in the 2020 film Ammonite. He is played by James McArdle.

<doc id="364464" wikidata="Q2916001" url="?curid=364464" title="Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff">
<text>The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VJCS) is, by U.S. law, the second highest-ranking military officer in the United States Armed Forces, ranking just below the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vice chairman outranks all respective heads of each service branch, with the exception of the chairman, but does not have operational command authority over their service branches. The vice chairman assists the chairman in exercising their duties. In the absence of the chairman, the vice chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and performs all other duties prescribed under and may also perform other duties that the president, the chairman, or the secretary of defense prescribes.

The 12th and current vice chairman is Admiral Christopher W. Grady, who assumed office on December 20, 2021.

==Responsibilities==
Although the office of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is considered to be very important and highly prestigious, neither the vice chairman nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a body have any command authority over combatant forces. The operational chain of command runs from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the commanders of the unified combatant commands. The vice chairman&#x27;s primary duties include: &quot;overseeing joint military requirements, representing the military in National Security Council deputies meetings, and performing other duties as directed by the chairman.&quot;

==Appointment and term limitations==
The vice chairman is nominated by the president for appointment from any of the regular components of the armed forces, and must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. The chairman and vice chairman may not be members of the same armed force service branch. However, the president may waive that restriction for a limited period of time in order to provide for the orderly transition of officers appointed to serve in those positions. The vice chairman serves a single four-year term of office at the pleasure of the president, and cannot be reappointed to serve additional terms unless in times of war or national emergency, in which case there is no limit to how many times an officer can be reappointed.

The vice chairman is also not eligible to be appointed for promotion to chairman, or any other four-star position in the armed forces, unless the president determines that it is necessary in the interest of the nation. The vice chairman assumes office on October 1 of every odd-number year, except the assumption of that term may not begin in the same year as the term of the chairman. By statute, the vice chairman is appointed as a four-star general or admiral.

==History==
The position of vice chairman was created by the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986 in order to centralize the military advisory chain of command to the president, the secretary of defense, and to the National Security Council. Originally the vice chairman was not included as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, until the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1992 made him a full voting member. Historically, the vice chairman has served two, two-year terms before the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 amended the vice chairman&#x27;s term length, beginning on January 1, 2021. The same act also set a statutory beginning term date. Prior to that, the position was filled whenever the previous holder left office.

==List of vice chairman==
General Richard B. Myers and General Peter Pace were later appointed to serve as chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2001 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2007, respectively.

==Positional color ==
The positional color (flag) of the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is white with a diagonal medium blue strip from upper hoist to lower fly. Centered on the flag is an American bald eagle with wings spread horizontally, in proper colors. The talons grasp three crossed arrows. A shield with blue chief and thirteen red and white stripes is on the eagle&#x27;s breast. Diagonally, from upper fly to lower hoist are four five-pointed stars, medium blue on the white, two above the eagle, and two below. The fringe is yellow; the cord and tassels are medium blue and white. The design was approved by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger on 20 January 1987.

<text>Absorption spectroscopy is spectroscopy that involves techniques that measure the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Absorption spectroscopy is employed as an analytical chemistry tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and, in many cases, to quantify the amount of the substance present. Infrared and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy are particularly common in analytical applications. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in studies of molecular and atomic physics, astronomical spectroscopy and remote sensing.

There is a wide range of experimental approaches for measuring absorption spectra. The most common arrangement is to direct a generated beam of radiation at a sample and detect the intensity of the radiation that passes through it. The transmitted energy can be used to calculate the absorption. The source, sample arrangement and detection technique vary significantly depending on the frequency range and the purpose of the experiment.

Following are the major types of absorption spectroscopy:
==Absorption spectrum==
A material&#x27;s absorption spectrum is the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the material over a range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. The absorption spectrum is primarily determined by the atomic and molecular composition of the material. Radiation is more likely to be absorbed at frequencies that match the energy difference between two quantum mechanical states of the molecules . The absorption that occurs due to a transition between two states is referred to as an absorption line and a spectrum is typically composed of many lines.

The frequencies at which absorption lines occur, as well as their relative intensities, primarily depend on the electronic and molecular structure of the sample. The frequencies will also depend on the interactions between molecules in the sample, the crystal structure in solids, and on several environmental factors (e.g., temperature, pressure, electric field, magnetic field). The lines will also have a width and shape that are primarily determined by the spectral density or the density of states of the system.

===Theory===
It is a branch of atomic spectra where, Absorption lines are typically classified by the nature of the quantum mechanical change induced in the molecule or atom. Rotational lines, for instance, occur when the rotational state of a molecule is changed. Rotational lines are typically found in the microwave spectral region. Vibrational lines correspond to changes in the vibrational state of the molecule and are typically found in the infrared region. Electronic lines correspond to a change in the electronic state of an atom or molecule and are typically found in the visible and ultraviolet region. X-ray absorptions are associated with the excitation of inner shell electrons in atoms. These changes can also be combined (e.g. rotation–vibration transitions), leading to new absorption lines at the combined energy of the two changes.

The energy associated with the quantum mechanical change primarily determines the frequency of the absorption line but the frequency can be shifted by several types of interactions. Electric and magnetic fields can cause a shift. Interactions with neighboring molecules can cause shifts. For instance, absorption lines of the gas phase molecule can shift significantly when that molecule is in a liquid or solid phase and interacting more strongly with neighboring molecules.

The width and shape of absorption lines are determined by the instrument used for the observation, the material absorbing the radiation and the physical environment of that material. It is common for lines to have the shape of a Gaussian or Lorentzian distribution. It is also common for a line to be described solely by its intensity and width instead of the entire shape being characterized.

The integrated intensity—obtained by integrating the area under the absorption line—is proportional to the amount of the absorbing substance present. The intensity is also related to the temperature of the substance and the quantum mechanical interaction between the radiation and the absorber. This interaction is quantified by the transition moment and depends on the particular lower state the transition starts from, and the upper state it is connected to.

The width of absorption lines may be determined by the spectrometer used to record it. A spectrometer has an inherent limit on how narrow a line it can resolve and so the observed width may be at this limit. If the width is larger than the resolution limit, then it is primarily determined by the environment of the absorber. A liquid or solid absorber, in which neighboring molecules strongly interact with one another, tends to have broader absorption lines than a gas. Increasing the temperature or pressure of the absorbing material will also tend to increase the line width. It is also common for several neighboring transitions to be close enough to one another that their lines overlap and the resulting overall line is therefore broader yet.

===Relation to transmission spectrum===
Absorption and transmission spectra represent equivalent information and one can be calculated from the other through a mathematical transformation. A transmission spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is weakest because more light is transmitted through the sample. An absorption spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is strongest.

===Relation to emission spectrum===
Emission is a process by which a substance releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Emission can occur at any frequency at which absorption can occur, and this allows the absorption lines to be determined from an emission spectrum. The emission spectrum will typically have a quite different intensity pattern from the absorption spectrum, though, so the two are not equivalent. The absorption spectrum can be calculated from the emission spectrum using Einstein coefficients.

===Relation to scattering and reflection spectra===
The scattering and reflection spectra of a material are influenced by both its refractive index and its absorption spectrum. In an optical context, the absorption spectrum is typically quantified by the extinction coefficient, and the extinction and index coefficients are quantitatively related through the Kramers–Kronig relations. Therefore, the absorption spectrum can be derived from a scattering or reflection spectrum. This typically requires simplifying assumptions or models, and so the derived absorption spectrum is an approximation.

==Applications==
Absorption spectroscopy is useful in chemical analysis because of its specificity and its quantitative nature. The specificity of absorption spectra allows compounds to be distinguished from one another in a mixture, making absorption spectroscopy useful in wide variety of applications. For instance, Infrared gas analyzers can be used to identify the presence of pollutants in the air, distinguishing the pollutant from nitrogen, oxygen, water, and other expected constituents.

The specificity also allows unknown samples to be identified by comparing a measured spectrum with a library of reference spectra. In many cases, it is possible to determine qualitative information about a sample even if it is not in a library. Infrared spectra, for instance, have characteristics absorption bands that indicate if carbon-hydrogen or carbon-oxygen bonds are present.

An absorption spectrum can be quantitatively related to the amount of material present using the Beer–Lambert law. Determining the absolute concentration of a compound requires knowledge of the compound&#x27;s absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient for some compounds is available from reference sources, and it can also be determined by measuring the spectrum of a calibration standard with a known concentration of the target.

===Remote sensing===
One of the unique advantages of spectroscopy as an analytical technique is that measurements can be made without bringing the instrument and sample into contact. Radiation that travels between a sample and an instrument will contain the spectral information, so the measurement can be made remotely. Remote spectral sensing is valuable in many situations. For example, measurements can be made in toxic or hazardous environments without placing an operator or instrument at risk. Also, sample material does not have to be brought into contact with the instrument—preventing possible cross contamination.

Remote spectral measurements present several challenges compared to laboratory measurements. The space in between the sample of interest and the instrument may also have spectral absorptions. These absorptions can mask or confound the absorption spectrum of the sample. These background interferences may also vary over time. The source of radiation in remote measurements is often an environmental source, such as sunlight or the thermal radiation from a warm object, and this makes it necessary to distinguish spectral absorption from changes in the source spectrum.

To simplify these challenges, differential optical absorption spectroscopy has gained some popularity, as it focusses on differential absorption features and omits broad-band absorption such as aerosol extinction and extinction due to rayleigh scattering. This method is applied to ground-based, airborne, and satellite-based measurements. Some ground-based methods provide the possibility to retrieve tropospheric and stratospheric trace gas profiles.

===Astronomy===
Astronomical spectroscopy is a particularly significant type of remote spectral sensing. In this case, the objects and samples of interest are so distant from earth that electromagnetic radiation is the only means available to measure them. Astronomical spectra contain both absorption and emission spectral information. Absorption spectroscopy has been particularly important for understanding interstellar clouds and determining that some of them contain molecules. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in the study of extrasolar planets. Detection of extrasolar planets by transit photometry also measures their absorption spectrum and allows for the determination of the planet&#x27;s atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and scale height, and hence allows also for the determination of the planet&#x27;s mass.

===Atomic and molecular physics===
Theoretical models, principally quantum mechanical models, allow for the absorption spectra of atoms and molecules to be related to other physical properties such as electronic structure, atomic or molecular mass, and molecular geometry. Therefore, measurements of the absorption spectrum are used to determine these other properties. Microwave spectroscopy, for example, allows for the determination of bond lengths and angles with high precision.

In addition, spectral measurements can be used to determine the accuracy of theoretical predictions. For example, the Lamb shift measured in the hydrogen atomic absorption spectrum was not expected to exist at the time it was measured. Its discovery spurred and guided the development of quantum electrodynamics, and measurements of the Lamb shift are now used to determine the fine-structure constant.

==Experimental methods==

===Basic approach===
The most straightforward approach to absorption spectroscopy is to generate radiation with a source, measure a reference spectrum of that radiation with a detector and then re-measure the sample spectrum after placing the material of interest in between the source and detector. The two measured spectra can then be combined to determine the material&#x27;s absorption spectrum. The sample spectrum alone is not sufficient to determine the absorption spectrum because it will be affected by the experimental conditions—the spectrum of the source, the absorption spectra of other materials between the source and detector, and the wavelength dependent characteristics of the detector. The reference spectrum will be affected in the same way, though, by these experimental conditions and therefore the combination yields the absorption spectrum of the material alone.

A wide variety of radiation sources are employed in order to cover the electromagnetic spectrum. For spectroscopy, it is generally desirable for a source to cover a broad swath of wavelengths in order to measure a broad region of the absorption spectrum. Some sources inherently emit a broad spectrum. Examples of these include globars or other black body sources in the infrared, mercury lamps in the visible and ultraviolet, and X-ray tubes. One recently developed, novel source of broad spectrum radiation is synchrotron radiation, which covers all of these spectral regions. Other radiation sources generate a narrow spectrum, but the emission wavelength can be tuned to cover a spectral range. Examples of these include klystrons in the microwave region and lasers across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet region (though not all lasers have tunable wavelengths).

The detector employed to measure the radiation power will also depend on the wavelength range of interest. Most detectors are sensitive to a fairly broad spectral range and the sensor selected will often depend more on the sensitivity and noise requirements of a given measurement. Examples of detectors common in spectroscopy include heterodyne receivers in the microwave, bolometers in the millimeter-wave and infrared, mercury cadmium telluride and other cooled semiconductor detectors in the infrared, and photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes in the visible and ultraviolet.

If both the source and the detector cover a broad spectral region, then it is also necessary to introduce a means of resolving the wavelength of the radiation in order to determine the spectrum. Often a spectrograph is used to spatially separate the wavelengths of radiation so that the power at each wavelength can be measured independently. It is also common to employ interferometry to determine the spectrum—Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a widely used implementation of this technique.

Two other issues that must be considered in setting up an absorption spectroscopy experiment include the optics used to direct the radiation and the means of holding or containing the sample material (called a cuvette or cell). For most UV, visible, and NIR measurements the use of precision quartz cuvettes are necessary. In both cases, it is important to select materials that have relatively little absorption of their own in the wavelength range of interest. The absorption of other materials could interfere with or mask the absorption from the sample. For instance, in several wavelength ranges it is necessary to measure the sample under vacuum or in a noble gas environment because gases in the atmosphere have interfering absorption features.

<text>Basil Cheesman Bunting (1 March 1900 – 17 April 1985) was a British modernist poet whose reputation was established with the publication of &quot;Briggflatts&quot; in 1966, generally regarded as one of the major achievements of the modernist tradition in English. He had a lifelong interest in music that led him to emphasise the sonic qualities of poetry, particularly the importance of reading poetry aloud: he was an accomplished reader of his own work.

==Life and career==
Born into a Quaker family in Scotswood-on-Tyne, near Newcastle upon Tyne, he studied at two Quaker schools: from 1912 to 1916 at Ackworth School in the West Riding of Yorkshire and from 1916 to 1918 at Leighton Park School in Berkshire. His Quaker education strongly influenced his pacifist opposition to the First World War, and in 1918 he was arrested as a conscientious objector having been refused recognition by the tribunals and refusing to comply with a notice of call-up. Handed over to the military, he was court-martialled for refusing to obey orders, and served a sentence of more than a year in Wormwood Scrubs and Winchester prisons. Bunting&#x27;s friend Louis Zukofsky described him as a &quot;conservative/anti-fascist/imperialist&quot;, though Bunting himself listed the major influences on his artistic and personal outlook somewhat differently as &quot;Jails and the sea, Quaker mysticism and socialist politics, a lasting unlucky passion, the slums of Lambeth and Hoxton ...&quot; 
These events were to have an important role in his first major poem, &quot;Villon&quot; (1925). &quot;Villon&quot; was one of a rather rare set of complex structured poems that Bunting labelled &quot;sonatas&quot;, thus underlining the sonic qualities of his verse and recalling his love of music. Other &quot;sonatas&quot; include &quot;Attis: or, Something Missing&quot;, &quot;Aus Dem Zweiten Reich&quot;, &quot;The Well of Lycopolis&quot;, &quot;The Spoils&quot; and, finally, &quot;Briggflatts&quot;. After his release from prison in 1919, traumatised by the time spent there, Bunting went to London, where he enrolled in the London School of Economics, and had his first contacts with journalists, social activists and Bohemia. Bunting was introduced to the works of Ezra Pound by Nina Hamnett who lent him a copy of &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot;. The glamour of the cosmopolitan modernist examples of Nina Hamnett and Mina Loy seems to have influenced Bunting in his later move from London to Paris.

After travelling in Northern Europe, Bunting left the London School of Economics without a degree and went to France. There, in 1923, he became friendly with Ezra Pound, who years later would dedicate his &quot;Guide to Kulchur&quot; (1938) to both Bunting and Louis Zukofsky, &quot;strugglers in the desert&quot;. Between February and October 1927, Bunting wrote articles and reviews for &quot;The Outlook&quot;, and then became its music critic until the magazine ceased publication in 1928. Bunting&#x27;s poetry began to show the influence of the friendship with Pound, whom he visited in Rapallo, Italy, and later settled there with his family from 1931 to 1933. He was published in the Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, in the &quot;Objectivist Anthology&quot;, and in Pound&#x27;s &quot;Active Anthology&quot;.

In the 1930s, Bunting became interested in medieval Persian literature, studied the language to some degree, and began publishing adaptations of Persian poems by Ferdowsi, Manuchehri, Sa’di, Hafez, and Obayd Zakani; their use of sound patterning seems to have influenced his own. During the Second World War, Bunting served in British Military Intelligence in Persia. After the war, in 1948, he left government service to become the correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;. in Iran. He married a Kurdish woman, Sima Alladadian, who was thirty years his junior. Because of his marriage to the underage girl, Bunting was fired from the British embassy.

Back in Newcastle, he worked as a sub-editor (US copy editor) on the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; until his rediscovery during the 1960s by young poets, notably Tom Pickard and Jonathan Williams, who were interested in working in the modernist tradition. In 1966, he published his major long poem, &quot;Briggflatts&quot;, named after the village in Cumbria where he is now buried in the Quaker graveyard.

In later life, he published &quot;Advice to Young Poets&quot;, beginning &quot;I SUGGEST / 1. Compose aloud; poetry is a sound.&quot;

Bunting died in 1985 in Hexham, Northumberland.

The Basil Bunting Poetry Award and Young Person&#x27;s Prize, administered by Newcastle University, are open internationally to any poet writing in English.

===Briggflatts===

Divided into five parts and noted for its intricate use of sound and resonances with medieval literature, &quot;Briggflatts&quot; is an autobiographical long poem, looking back on teenage love and on Bunting&#x27;s involvement in the high modernist period. In addition, &quot;Briggflatts&quot; can be read as a meditation on the limits of life and a celebration of Northumbrian culture and dialect, as symbolised by events and figures like the doomed Viking King Eric Bloodaxe. The critic Cyril Connolly was among the first to recognise the poem&#x27;s value, describing it as &quot;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;&quot;.

===Portrait bust of Basil Bunting===

Basil Bunting sat in Northumberland for sculptor Alan Thornhill, with a resulting terracotta (for bronze) in existence. The correspondence file relating to the Bunting portrait bust is held as part of the Thornhill Papers (2006:56) in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation&#x27;s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist. The 1973 portrait is displayed in the Burton (2014) biography of Bunting.

<doc id="364488" wikidata="Q942423" url="?curid=364488" title="Projective module">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebra, the class of projective modules enlarges the class of free modules (that is, modules with basis vectors) over a ring, keeping some of the main properties of free modules. Various equivalent characterizations of these modules appear below.

Every free module is a projective module, but the converse fails to hold over some rings, such as Dedekind rings that are not principal ideal domains. However, every projective module is a free module if the ring is a principal ideal domain such as the integers, or a (multivariate) polynomial ring over a field (this is the Quillen–Suslin theorem).

Projective modules were first introduced in 1956 in the influential book &quot;Homological Algebra&quot; by Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg.

== Definitions ==

=== Lifting property ===

The usual category theoretical definition is in terms of the property of &quot;lifting&quot; that carries over from free to projective modules: a module &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if for every surjective module homomorphism and every module homomorphism , there exists a module homomorphism such that . (We don&#x27;t require the lifting homomorphism &quot;h&quot; to be unique; this is not a universal property.)

The advantage of this definition of &quot;projective&quot; is that it can be carried out in categories more general than module categories: we don&#x27;t need a notion of &quot;free object&quot;. It can also be dualized, leading to injective modules. The lifting property may also be rephrased as &quot;every morphism from formula_1 to formula_2 factors through every epimorphism to formula_2&quot;. Thus, by definition, projective modules are precisely the projective objects in the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules.

=== Split-exact sequences ===
A module &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if every short exact sequence of modules of the form

:formula_4

is a split exact sequence. That is, for every surjective module homomorphism there exists a section map, that is, a module homomorphism such that &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;h&quot; = id&quot;P&quot;&amp;hairsp;. In that case, is a direct summand of &quot;B&quot;, &quot;h&quot; is an isomorphism from &quot;P&quot; to , and is a projection on the summand . Equivalently,

:formula_5

=== Direct summands of free modules ===

A module &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if there is another module &quot;Q&quot; such that the direct sum of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is a free module.

=== Exactness ===

An &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if the covariant functor is an exact functor, where is the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and Ab is the category of abelian groups. When the ring &quot;R&quot; is commutative, Ab is advantageously replaced by in the preceding characterization. This functor is always left exact, but, when &quot;P&quot; is projective, it is also right exact. This means that &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if this functor preserves epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms), or if it preserves finite colimits.

===Dual basis===
A module &quot;P&quot; is projective if and only if there exists a set formula_6 and a set formula_7 such that for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) is only nonzero for finitely many &quot;i&quot;, and formula_8.

== Elementary examples and properties ==
The following properties of projective modules are quickly deduced from any of the above (equivalent) definitions of projective modules:
* Direct sums and direct summands of projective modules are projective.
* If is an idempotent in the ring , then is a projective left module over &quot;R&quot;.

Let formula_9 be the direct product of two rings formula_10 and formula_11 which is a ring for the componentwise operations. Let formula_12 and formula_13 Then formula_14 and formula_15 are idempotents, and belong to the centre of formula_16 The two-sided ideals formula_17 and formula_18 are projective modules, since their direct sum (as -modules) equals the free -module . However, if formula_10 and formula_20 are nontrivial, then they are not free as modules over formula_21. For instance formula_22 is projective but not free over formula_23.

==Relation to other module-theoretic properties==

The relation of projective modules to free and flat modules is subsumed in the following diagram of module properties:

The left-to-right implications are true over any ring, although some authors define torsion-free modules only over a domain. The right-to-left implications are true over the rings labeling them. There may be other rings over which they are true. For example, the implication labeled &quot;local ring or PID&quot; is also true for (multivariate) polynomial rings over a field: this is the Quillen–Suslin theorem.

===Projective vs. free modules===
Any free module is projective. The converse is true in the following cases:
* if &quot;R&quot; is a field or skew field: &quot;any&quot; module is free in this case.
* if the ring &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain. For example, this applies to (the integers), so an abelian group is projective if and only if it is a free abelian group. The reason is that any submodule of a free module over a principal ideal domain is free.
* if the ring &quot;R&quot; is a local ring. This fact is the basis of the intuition of &quot;locally free = projective&quot;. This fact is easy to prove for finitely generated projective modules. In general, it is due to ; see Kaplansky&#x27;s theorem on projective modules.

In general though, projective modules need not be free:
* Over a direct product of rings where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are nonzero rings, both and are non-free projective modules.
* Over a Dedekind domain a non-principal ideal is always a projective module that is not a free module.
* Over a matrix ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), the natural module &quot;R&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;n&quot; is projective but is not free when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.
* Over a semisimple ring, &quot;every&quot; module is projective, but a nonzero proper left (or right) ideal is not a free module. Thus the only semisimple rings for which all projectives are free are division rings.
The difference between free and projective modules is, in a sense, measured by the algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory group &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;R&quot;); see below.

===Projective vs. flat modules===
Every projective module is flat. The converse is in general not true: the abelian group Q is a Z-module that is flat, but not projective.

Conversely, a finitely related flat module is projective.

 and proved that a module &quot;M&quot; is flat if and only if it is a direct limit of finitely-generated free modules.

In general, the precise relation between flatness and projectivity was established by (see also and ) who showed that a module &quot;M&quot; is projective if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:
*&quot;M&quot; is flat,
*&quot;M&quot; is a direct sum of countably generated modules,
*&quot;M&quot; satisfies a certain Mittag-Leffler-type condition.
This characterization can be used to show that if formula_24 is a faithfully flat map of commutative rings and formula_2 is an formula_21-module, then formula_2 is projective if and only if formula_28 is projective. In other words, the property of being projective satisfies faithfully flat descent.

==The category of projective modules==
Submodules of projective modules need not be projective; a ring &quot;R&quot; for which every submodule of a projective left module is projective is called left hereditary.

Quotients of projective modules also need not be projective, for example Z/&quot;n&quot; is a quotient of Z, but not torsion-free, hence not flat, and therefore not projective.

The category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is an exact category. (See also algebraic K-theory).

== Projective resolutions ==

Given a module, &quot;M&quot;, a projective resolution of &quot;M&quot; is an infinite exact sequence of modules
:⋅⋅⋅ → &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; → ⋅⋅⋅ → &quot;P&quot;2 → &quot;P&quot;1 → &quot;P&quot;0 → &quot;M&quot; → 0,
with all the &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; s projective. Every module possesses a projective resolution. In fact a free resolution (resolution by free modules) exists. The exact sequence of projective modules may sometimes be abbreviated to or . A classic example of a projective resolution is given by the Koszul complex of a regular sequence, which is a free resolution of the ideal generated by the sequence.

The &quot;length&quot; of a finite resolution is the index &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nonzero and for &quot;i&quot; greater than &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; admits a finite projective resolution, the minimal length among all finite projective resolutions of &quot;M&quot; is called its projective dimension and denoted pd(&quot;M&quot;). If &quot;M&quot; does not admit a finite projective resolution, then by convention the projective dimension is said to be infinite. As an example, consider a module &quot;M&quot; such that . In this situation, the exactness of the sequence 0 → &quot;P&quot;0 → &quot;M&quot; → 0 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence &quot;M&quot; itself is projective.

== Projective modules over commutative rings ==
Projective modules over commutative rings have nice properties.

The localization of a projective module is a projective module over the localized ring.
A projective module over a local ring is free. Thus a projective module is &quot;locally free&quot; (in the sense that its localization at every prime ideal is free over the corresponding localization of the ring).

The converse is true for finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings: a finitely generated module over a commutative Noetherian ring is locally free if and only if it is projective.

However, there are examples of finitely generated modules over a non-Noetherian ring that are locally free and not projective. For instance, 
a Boolean ring has all of its localizations isomorphic to F2, the field of two elements, so any module over a Boolean ring is locally free, but 
there are some non-projective modules over Boolean rings. One example is &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; where 
&quot;R&quot; is a direct product of countably many copies of F2 and &quot;I&quot; is the direct sum of countably many copies of F2 inside of &quot;R&quot;.
The &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is locally free since &quot;R&quot; is Boolean (and it is finitely generated as an &quot;R&quot;-module too, with a spanning set of size 1), but &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is not projective because 
&quot;I&quot; is not a principal ideal. (If a quotient module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;, for any commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and ideal &quot;I&quot;, is a projective &quot;R&quot;-module then &quot;I&quot; is principal.)

However, it is true that for finitely presented modules &quot;M&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; (in particular if &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian), the following are equivalent.
#formula_2 is flat.
#formula_2 is projective.
#formula_31 is free as formula_32-module for every maximal ideal formula_33 of &quot;R&quot;.
#formula_34 is free as formula_35-module for every prime ideal formula_36 of &quot;R&quot;.
#There exist formula_37 generating the unit ideal such that formula_38 is free as formula_39-module for each &quot;i&quot;. 
#formula_40 is a locally free sheaf on formula_41 (where formula_40 is the sheaf associated to &quot;M&quot;.)
Moreover, if &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian integral domain, then, by Nakayama&#x27;s lemma, these conditions are equivalent to
*The dimension of the formula_43-vector space formula_44 is the same for all prime ideals formula_36 of &quot;R,&quot; where formula_43 is the residue field at formula_36. That is to say, &quot;M&quot; has constant rank (as defined below).

Let &quot;A&quot; be a commutative ring. If &quot;B&quot; is a (possibly non-commutative) &quot;A&quot;-algebra that is a finitely generated projective &quot;A&quot;-module containing &quot;A&quot; as a subring, then &quot;A&quot; is a direct factor of &quot;B&quot;.

=== Rank ===

Let &quot;P&quot; be a finitely generated projective module over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and &quot;X&quot; be the spectrum of &quot;R&quot;. The &quot;rank&quot; of &quot;P&quot; at a prime ideal formula_36 in &quot;X&quot; is the rank of the free formula_49-module formula_50. It is a locally constant function on &quot;X&quot;. In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is connected (that is if &quot;R&quot; has no other idempotents than 0 and 1), then &quot;P&quot; has constant rank.

== Vector bundles and locally free modules ==
A basic motivation of the theory is that projective modules (at least over certain commutative rings) are analogues of vector bundles. This can be made precise for the ring of continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space, as well as for the ring of smooth functions on a smooth manifold (see Serre–Swan theorem that says a finitely generated projective module over the space of smooth functions on a compact manifold is the space of smooth sections of a smooth vector bundle).

Vector bundles are &quot;locally free&quot;. If there is some notion of &quot;localization&quot; that can be carried over to modules, such as the usual localization of a ring, one can define locally free modules, and the projective modules then typically coincide with the locally free modules.

== Projective modules over a polynomial ring ==
The Quillen–Suslin theorem, which solves Serre&#x27;s problem, is another deep result: if &quot;K&quot; is a field, or more generally a principal ideal domain, and is a polynomial ring over &quot;K&quot;, then every projective module over &quot;R&quot; is free.
This problem was first raised by Serre with &quot;K&quot; a field (and the modules being finitely generated). Bass settled it for non-finitely generated modules, and Quillen and Suslin independently and simultaneously treated the case of finitely generated modules.

Since every projective module over a principal ideal domain is free, one might ask this question: if &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring such that every (finitely generated) projective &quot;R&quot;-module is free, then is every (finitely generated) projective &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-module free? The answer is &quot;no&quot;. A counterexample occurs with &quot;R&quot; equal to the local ring of the curve at the origin. Thus the Quillen–Suslin theorem could never be proved by a simple induction on the number of variables.

<text>Romuva is a neo-pagan movement derived from the traditional mythology of the Lithuanians, attempting to reconstruct the religious rituals of the Lithuanians before their Christianization in 1387. Practitioners of Romuva claim to continue Baltic pagan traditions which survived in folklore, customs and superstition. Romuva is a polytheistic pagan faith which asserts the sanctity of nature and ancestor worship. Practicing the Romuva faith is seen by many adherents as a form of cultural pride, along with celebrating traditional forms of art, retelling Baltic folklore, practicing traditional holidays, playing traditional Baltic music, singing traditional (songs), as well as ecological activism and stewarding sacred places.

Romuva primarily exists in Lithuania but there are also congregations of adherents in Australia, Canada, Russia, the United States, and England. There are believers of Baltic pagan faiths in other nations, including Dievturība in Latvia. According to the 2001 census, there were approximately 1,200 people in Lithuania identifying with Romuva. That number jumped to around 5,100 in the 2011 census.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;Romuva&quot;, &quot;Romovė&quot;, and &quot;Ruomuva&quot; came from medieval written sources in East Prussia mentioning the pagan Baltic temple Romowe. The word has meanings of &quot;temple&quot; and &quot;sanctuary&quot;, but, further, also &quot;abode of inner peace&quot;. The Baltic root &quot;ram-/rām-&quot;, from which &quot;Romuva&quot; derives, has the meaning of &#x27;calm, serene, quiet&#x27;, stemming from the Proto-Indo-European .

==History==
===Ancient and medieval Lithuanian faith===

Whatever religion the original inhabitants of the Baltic region had predates recorded history. Mesolithic hunters, gatherers, and anglers of the region practised a religion focused on their occupations. Marija Gimbutas controversially suggested that agrarian settlers of around 3500–2500 BCE were examples of Earth-worshipping Old Europeans. After this, Indo-Europeans entered the area and brought with them their Proto-Indo-European religion. This religion, including elements from the religious past of the region, evolved into the paganism which is attested in the Middle Ages and later.

The adherents of this Baltic religion prospered relatively unhindered until the 9th century when they began to come under pressure from outside Christian forces. The Annals of Quedlinburg mention a missionary, Bruno of Querfurt, who was killed along with 18 men by Yotvingians while attempting to convert the pagans in the area of Lithuania and Prussia in 1009 CE. This was the first time the name of Lithuania was mentioned in written sources. Other sources suggest Bruno had been killed for violating The Holy Forest and destroying statues of gods.

Beginning in 1199, the Roman Catholic Church declared crusades against Baltic pagans. Grand Duke Mindaugas was Christianized with his family and warriors in 1251 so that the Crusades might be ended by the Church. But Mindaugas still worshiped pagan deities as the Hypatian chronicle mentions. He sacrificed to the pagan Supreme god (*Andajus, later Dievas), Perkūnas, Teliavelis (god of smiths), and *Žvorūna (goddess of forests and hunters). Despite any insincerity and realpolitik in his Christian faith, some subsidiary states of Mindaugas&#x27; Grand Duchy rebelled in protest. In 1261 Mindaugas renounced his Christian faith as his official conversion failed to placate the Crusaders.

Even in the face of Crusaders, by the time of Grand Duke Gediminas, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded its influence until it formed the political centre of a vast and prosperous &quot;pagan Empire&quot;. Lithuanians thus survived late into history as appreciable representatives of ancient European paganism, preserving this tradition as the official, state religion until the late 14th and early 15th centuries when Christianity was finally accepted by the states of the Grand Duchy, again for political reasons. Thus, for a time, Lithuanians were the last-known non-nomadic people in Europe practicing a European ethnic religion until the resurgence of paganism in Europe in the 20th and 21st centuries. Unofficially, Lithuanians continued in their adherence to traditional paganism.

===Revival===
The Romantic epoch started in the 19th century. This led Lithuanians to look back to their past for both intellectual and spiritual inspiration. The national revival started and Lithuanian intelligentsia idealised ancient paganism and folklore. Some historians wanted to prove the beauty of ancient polytheism and even started creating new aspects of Lithuanian mythology. One of the most famous of these was Theodor Narbutt who edited Ancient Greek myths and created new Lithuanian ones.

In the beginning of the 20th century, ancient pagan traditions were still continued in folklore and customs. People were celebrating ancient pagan festivals mixed with Christian traditions. Such festivals include Vėlinės (day of dead souls, similar to Celtic Halloween), Užgavėnės (festival when winter ends and spring begins), and Rasa or Joninės. For Užgavėnės, people in Samogitia may dress in costumes including masks and burn an idol of an old lady, called Morė or Giltine, goddess of death.

===Modern folk religion===

The philosopher Vydūnas is taken as a sort of founding father of Romuva. He actively promoted awareness of and participation in pagan festivals. Vydūnas saw Christianity as foreign to Lithuanians, and instead he brought his attention to what he saw as the spiritual vision of the adherents of the traditional Baltic religion. He ascribed to this a sense of awe in their cosmology, as they saw the universe as a great mystery, and respect for every living being as well as the earth in their morality, as they saw the whole world and every individual as a symbol of life as a whole. The Divine was represented by fire, which was as such used ritually to worship the divine and itself held sacred. Vydūnas had given special treatment to this religion of the Lithuanians in his drama &quot;Amžina ugnis&quot; (&quot;An Eternal Flame&quot;). Among this and other works, Vydūnas exalted the faith as being on the highest level of spiritual expression, along with other forms which he recognized.

Domas Šidlauskas-Visuomis (1878–1944) began to create Vaidevutybė (Baltic paganism) in 1911. In the 1920s the Latvian folk religion movement Dievturība was started by Ernests Brastiņš. The main problem was that the first movements were based on limited folklore sources and influenced by Far Eastern traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. Even so, the idea of Romuva did not die during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania.

===Soviet suppression===
The Lithuanian pagan movement was stopped by Soviet occupation in 1940. Due to the nationalist nature of Romuva, the faith was suppressed during the Soviet occupation and many practitioners were executed or deported to forced labor camps in Siberia. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death the cultural life became more free.

A clandestine Romuva group is known to have existed within a labor camp in Inta, Russia. After the members were released and returned to Lithuania around 1960, some of these practitioners, along with Jonas Trinkūnas, formed the &quot;Vilnius Ethnological Ramuva&quot; and began organizing public celebrations of traditional Lithuanian religious holidays, starting with Rasa in 1967. In 1971 the Soviets expelled the members from the university they attended and exiled the leaders. By 1988, when the power of the Soviet Union was waning and Lithuanian independence was on the horizon, Romuva groups began reorganizing in the Baltic nations and practicing their religion in the open.

===Independence===

After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, Romuva was recognised as an Ancient Baltic faith community in 1992. Under the auspices of the &quot;Law on Religious Communities and Associations&quot; which was passed in Lithuania in 1995, Romuva gained recognition as a &quot;non-traditional&quot; religion. The law requires a minimum of 25 years of existence before such a religion can receive the state support reserved for &quot;traditional&quot; religions.

In 1990, Trinkūnas created Kūlgrinda, a band that performs in many Romuva festivals. The community was organized and led by &quot;krivių krivaitis&quot; (high priest) Jonas Trinkūnas until his death in 2014. He was buried according to the old Baltic traditions. His wife Inija Trinkūnienė was chosen as the new &quot;krivė&quot; (high priestess) and her ordination was held on 31 May 2015, in Vilnius on the Gediminas Hill. She is the first woman to become &quot;krivė&quot; in the long pagan history.

On 24 May 2018, Seimas passed a proposal for granting state recognition to Romuva and began discussing it in the parliamentary committees. In June 2019, Seimas voted to reject Romuva&#x27;s petition to be recognized as a &quot;traditional&quot; religion. The law provides that the petition could be resubmitted in ten years. The proposal was opposed mainly by the members of the Homeland Union, particularly by Žygimantas Pavilionis. Romuva sued Lithuania in the European Court of Human Rights and won an unanimous decision in June 2021 that the Seimas did not remain &quot;neutral and impartial in exercising their regulatory powers&quot;. Romuva was allowed to reapply for recognition after three months of the ruling. State recognition was granted in 2024.

==Religious practices==

The Baltic or &quot;fire altar&quot; is a stone altar in which a fire is ritually lit. Participants wash their hands and face before approaching the , and then they sing or ritual hymns as the fire is lit. Food, drink, grasses, and flowers are offered to the flame as the group sings the . After the primary offering, participants offer their own verbal or silent prayers which are carried to the Gods with the smoke and sparks of the flame.

A Romuva priest is known as a &quot;vaidila&quot; (plural &quot;vaidilos&quot;), and a Romuva priestess is known as a &quot;vaidilutė&quot; (plural &quot;vaidilutės&quot;). As a recognised figure of authority in his or her community, the priest must have the proper skills and knowledge he or she needs to conduct religious ceremonies to honour the Gods.

A Romuva shrine is a field with one or several idols in front of a sacred fire where sacrifices are burned, known as an &quot;alka&quot;.

==Romuva centres==
Samogitian Sanctuary was originally planned to be rebuilt on Birutė hill in Palanga but was not agreed to by the mayor of Palanga. Instead, it was built on a hill near Šventoji which also has 11 sculptures of pagan gods. There are four main festivals in a year:
* 23 March – Vernal equinox
* 22 June – Summer solstice
* 23 September – Autumnal equinox
* 20 December – Winter solstice

==Relation with Hinduism==

The Romuva religion shares similarities with Hinduism. For example, in Lithuanian, the word &quot;darna&quot; means harmony and coherence, and for Lithuanian pagans, that is a religious tenet as well – the balance of the world. It also superficially resembles the word dharma, Hinduism&#x27;s cosmic order. The linguistic similarity between darna and dharma is likely a coincidence – some scholars say the two do not necessarily share an etymology, while others point to a common Indo-European connection. But for Lithuania&#x27;s Romuva community, which traces its traditions back to ancient folklore, it is evidence of a connection to India, Hinduism and Sanskrit that has become a part of their Romuva identity, along with its pantheon of gods and fairly standard pagan rituals. Some believe that the connection between Hinduism and Romuva made Romuva to be more than a &quot;primitive, shamanic religious tradition&quot;.
Jonas Trinkūnas, a leading founder and priest of modern-day Romuva, performed marriages in the same manner as Hindu Vedic weddings. Mantras and chants were recited and the couple took vows after doing rounds of the fire. Trinkūnas further claimed that Rajputs were the ancestors of a Romuva tribe that once ruled Lithuania for many years and some of their ancient practices are practiced today.

Similarly Ašvieniai are divine twins in the Lithuanian mythology, counterparts of Vedic Ashvins. The Ašvieniai are represented as pulling a carriage of Saulė (the Sun) through the sky. Ašvieniai, depicted as &quot;žirgeliai&quot; or little horses, are common motifs on Lithuanian rooftops,
Romuva and Hindu groups have come together on numerous occasions to share prayers and participate in dialogue. These events have taken place in Lithuania, Atlantic City, New Jersey, Boston, Massachusetts, Epping, New Hampshire, and elsewhere.

<text>openMSX is a free software emulator for the MSX architecture. It is available for multiple platforms, including Microsoft Windows and POSIX systems such as Linux

For copyright reasons, the emulator cannot be distributed with original MSX-BIOS ROM images. Instead, openMSX includes C-BIOS, a minimal implementation of the MSX BIOS, allowing some games to be played without the original ROM image. It is possible for the user to replace C-BIOS by native BIOS if they prefer.

OpenMSX emulates a large amount of MSX systems and MSX related hardware, including:

*MSXturboR
*Moonsound
*IDE Controller by Sunrise
*GFX9000
*Pioneer Palcom LaserDisc

Also some computer systems similar to MSX are emulated, like the SpectraVideo SVI-318/328, ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000.

Notable features include:
*Scalers
*Debugging including visual debugging of graphics
*Tcl Script Support
*Cheat Finder
*Game Trainers
*Audio/Video recording
*Reverse support (go back in emulated time to correct mistakes or debug what happened)

OpenMSX has an open communication protocol to communicate with the openMSX emulator. Utilizing this communication protocol enables to write versatile add-ons for openMSX. Projects making use of this protocol include the following applications:
*openMSX Catapult (by the openMSX team; obsoleted by the new graphical user interface introduced with openMSX 20.0)
*openMSX Debugger (by the openMSX team; obsoleted by the built-in debugger introduced with openMSX 20.0))
*openMSXControl plugin
*NekoLauncher openMSX
*openMSX Peashooter
*openMSX Control Plugin for Gedit

There is a dead subproject to redevelop Catapult, a GUI developed for the emulator that is part of the project, utilizing Python and the Qt toolkit.

The separate openMSX Debugger, written in C++ and utilizing the Qt Toolkit is not in development anymore, as efforts are now focused on the built-in debugger.

So, as of release 20.0, a GUI was integrated that replaces almost all functionality of the Catapult and separate Debugger programs. Both these sub-projects will not be developed further, in favour of the built-in functionality. The new GUI is using the Dear ImGUI toolkit.

<doc id="364498" wikidata="Q8042669" url="?curid=364498" title="XY (magazine)">
<text>XY is a gay men&#x27;s magazine which has been published in the United States since 1996. XY started as a gay male youth-oriented magazine and social network. Its name is a reference to the XY chromosome pair found in males.

&quot;XY&quot; published issue 50 in October 2016 (with its original staff) after an eight-year hiatus since 2008, during which most of its staff published as &quot;B Magazine&quot;.

== Background ==
&quot;XY&quot; was founded by Peter Ian Cummings in San Francisco in 1996, and moved its operations to San Diego, California in 2001, and West Hollywood, California in 2004. It published roughly four editions a year until 2008; the Fall 2016 is Issue 50, the Wonderland Issue. The magazine contains political and cultural articles, pictures, and submissions by readers. Featured photographers included Steven Underhill (cover of issue 1, 1996), Bradford Noble, James Dawson, and many others. Featured comic series included Tough Love by Abby Denson (who still appears in Issue 50) and &quot;Joe Boy&quot; by Joe Phillips. Issue 50, “Wonderland,” which looks at the future of the U.S., includes well-known writers Douglas Rushkoff, Scott Santens writing about Basic Income, David Leddick, and Mark Simpson.

From its inception in 1996 through 2007, 49 issues were published. In issue 49 of &quot;XY&quot; (the winter 2008 issue), founding editor Peter Ian Cummings announced that he would be leaving the magazine for personal reasons; that he and his investors were looking for a new team to take it over.

When an exhaustive search produced no suitable buyers, the magazine remained in limbo until 2010, when Cummings filed for bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings, Cummings, seeking to protect users&#x27; privacy, complained to the Privacy Division of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a Federal Regulatory Agency, who warned the investors; the xy.com profile data and XY mailing addresses were ordered destroyed to protect users&#x27; privacy (more below).

XY&#x27;s investors then sold the valuable XY.Com domain name to a Chinese game developer. After six more years of limbo, Cummings and the original team relaunched XY in 2016 after reforming XY as XY Magazine Foundation, a public-interest L3C Foundation.

== Special editions and other publications ==
As well as its regular issues, the magazine has published a series of specials:
*Two editions of the &quot;Survival Guide&quot; have been produced. They were more serious than usual editions with articles on everything from coming out to age of consent laws to suicide. The cover was illustrated by Abby Denson.
*&quot;The Best of XY&quot; contained the best of the magazine&#x27;s articles, as selected by editors, contributors, and readers.
*&quot;XY: The Photos&quot; contained the best photos from the magazine.
*&quot;XY: The Photos 1996+2007&quot; contained additional photos

===&quot;XYFoto&quot;===
A bimonthly companion magazine &quot;XYFoto&quot; was launched in 2003 containing only photographs. This magazine was printed on matte paper and contains erotic but non-pornographic images of young men. Most issues are centered on a different city or state. Eight issues have been published, each by a different photographer, including Jevpic (&quot;Palm Springs,&quot; 2016, which was announced in XY #50), Sean Bentz, Adam Raphael, Steven Underhill, Christopher Makos, James Patrick Dawson and Peter Ian Cummings.

=== Website ===
&quot;XY&quot; operated the website &quot;xy.com&quot;, which featured magazine content as well as an online dating service &quot;for young gay men.&quot; The publisher notes that XY.Com was the world&#x27;s largest social network for young gay men &quot;before Facebook and Grindr, with an estimated 500,000 members.&quot; XY&#x27;s new website is at xymag.org.

== Reader demographic ==
When &quot;XY&quot; launched in 1996, according to the publisher, the average age of its readers was 22. By 2001 this had lowered to 18, a demographic shift largely attributable to an increase in under-18 readers, &quot;because people were coming out at younger ages.&quot; The publisher states that the new XY is aimed at &quot;all ages and planets.&quot;

== Controversy ==
As a publication for young gay and bisexual men, &quot;XY&quot; has sometimes had a difficult time attracting advertisers, and often ran editorials on the topic.

Another controversy involved &quot;XY&quot;&#x27;s longtime Managing Editor, Michael Glatze, who left the magazine in 2001, co-edited the &quot;XY Survival Guide&quot; in 2003, and in 2007 announced that he no longer identified as a homosexual, and denounced homosexuality. He is now a conservative Christian who opposes gay rights.

In July 2010, the Bureau of Consumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission denied a request by &quot;XY&quot;&#x27;s investors to obtain the customer database for the old &quot;XY&quot; magazine and profile files on the &quot;xy.com&quot; web site, which list about 100,000 and 1 million subscribers, respectively. Conforming with Cummings&#x27;s and his staff&#x27;s privacy policy of the magazine and site, which stated that they would &quot;never sell its list to anybody&quot;, was found to take precedence over the desire of these investors to obtain the data for unspecified use. Many of those customers would still be underage and would not be out to their families yet, thus making their privacy of particular concern. As a result of this FTC warning, the names, addresses, and online profiles were ordered destroyed.

<text>The Golden Oecumene is a science fiction trilogy by the American writer John C. Wright. It consists of three books, &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, &quot;The Phoenix Exultant&quot; and &quot;The Golden Transcendence&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
The author&#x27;s first novel, it revolves around the protagonist Phaethon (full name Phaethon Prime Rhadamanth Humodified (augment) Uncomposed, Indepconsciousness, Base Neuroformed, Silver-Gray Manorial Schola, Era 7043). The novel concerns Phaethon&#x27;s discovery that parts of his past have been edited out of his mind—apparently by himself.

==Books==
===Book 1: &quot;The Golden Age&quot;===

The novel is set tens of thousands of years in the future, 100 centuries after the start of a new era, in a voluntary anarchistic society spanning the Solar System called the Golden Oecumene. Technology makes nearly everyone immortal and tremendously wealthy, except those exiled from society or living outside by choice. The protagonist, Phaethon, is a member of a group, called the Manorials, for whom telepresence has completely replaced the phone and video-phone, as the Manorials travel and communicate as virtual projections on the physical world. The Manorial elites rarely go anywhere in person and live almost always connected to the Mentality, their version of the Internet. The Sophotechs, a superior line of computer intelligences, do most of the work, research, and simulations required by the society. There is only one remaining court, the Curia, and they rarely hear cases since everything can be solved externally by superior Sophotech intelligence and simulation. The entire military is made up of one man, Atkins, who most of the society has forgotten. The most powerful groups are the Hortators and the Peers, although about 90 percent of the society&#x27;s wealth is controlled by the Sophotechs. The Hortators serve to convince people to act in a way beneficial to society. The Peers are the most wealthy and powerful humans ever to have lived, and they include Phaethon&#x27;s &quot;father&quot; Helion, who created the Solar Array, a means of mixing the Sun&#x27;s mass in order to extend the main-sequence hydrogen-burning lifetime of our star.

Phaethon becomes convinced that there is an enemy presence originating from an ancient failed colonization-attempt on another star, and becomes constantly dogged by clandestine enemies. The peaceful Utopian society does not believe in Phaethon&#x27;s hostile experiences and discoveries, because of the enemy&#x27;s superior subterfuge and technology. Phaethon must face his memories, the reasons for their loss, and his original dream of space exploration, risk, and enterprise in the face of a powerful, mysterious enemy and his Utopian society that treasures its present safety and stability above all else.


===Book 2: &quot;The Phoenix Exultant&quot;===
Phaethon is in exile where he must learn to cope without access to the Mentality, as he believes that there is a virus infecting it that is targeting him. He eventually travels to the island of Ceylon where many exiles are living out their remaining lives. Phaethon finds that not everyone in the solar system agrees with his exile and comes up with a plan to return to his ship the &quot;Phoenix Exultant&quot;.

A copy of his wife, Daphne tracks him down and between her and the only soldier left in the solar system, we discover the truth about how Phaethon was tricked into exile.


===Book 3: &quot;The Golden Transcendence&quot;===
In the final book of the series, Phaethon must confront the Nothing Sophotech, understand its history in the distortions of an anarchistic society with older roots than his own, and discover how to either liberate it or destroy it—before it destroys or absorbs him and all that he loves.
==Reception==
Publishers Weekly in their review said &quot;Wright&#x27;s ornate and conceptually dense prose will not be to everyone&#x27;s taste but, for those willing to be challenged, this is a rare and mind-blowing treat.&quot; Kirkus Reviews had this recommendation in their review saying &quot;this extraordinary feat of invention and plotting would be all the more impressive had the book not ended with the central mystery unresolved, leaving readers dazzled and annoyed in equal measure.&quot; Jackie Cassada in her review for Library Journal praised the novel saying it was &quot;bursting with kaleidoscopic imagery, Wright&#x27;s first novel chronicles the quest of a far-future everyman in his journey of self-discovery. Reminiscent of the panoramic novels of Arthur C. Clarke, Iain Banks, and Jack Vance&quot;.

==Allusions==
The novel includes many classical literary references. Phaethon&#x27;s name and character as well as his father Helion are direct references to the Greek myth of Phaëton who stole his father&#x27;s (the sun god Helios) chariot and rode it too close to the Sun, not unlike the tale of Icarus, who committed a similar error. There are also references to works of the science fiction canon: the title and characters conform to the mold established by Robert A. Heinlein in the 1940s and 50s that constituted the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of science fiction. The book&#x27;s subtitle also describes itself as a &quot;Romance of the far future,&quot; a reply to Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s Last and First Men.

<text>Richard Kingsley Morgan, (born 24 September 1965 in Norwich) is a British science fiction and fantasy author of books, short stories, and graphic novels. He is the winner of the Philip K. Dick Award for his 2003 book &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, which was adapted into a Netflix series released in 2018. His third book, &quot;Market Forces&quot;, won the John W. Campbell Award in 2005, while his 2008 work &quot;Thirteen&quot; garnered him the Arthur C. Clarke Award.

== Early life and education ==

Morgan was born in Norfolk, and brought up in the village of Hethersett, near Norwich, and had a semi-rural upbringing. He attended private school and later studied modern languages and history at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. After graduating he started teaching English to travel the world. After 14 years and a post at the University of Strathclyde, his first novel was published and he became a full-time writer. He lived in Glasgow until 2015, when he moved to Saxlingham Nethergate with his wife Virginia and their son Daniel.

==Literary career==

In 2002, Morgan&#x27;s first novel &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; was published, combining elements of cyberpunk and hardboiled detective fiction and featuring the antihero Takeshi Kovacs. In 2003 the U.S. edition of Altered Carbon received the Philip K. Dick Award and the film rights were sold for a reported figure of $1,000,000 to film producer Joel Silver, enabling Morgan to become a full-time writer. The film rights were later acquired by Laeta Kalogridis, but production was trapped in development hell for a decade, eventually gaining release in 2018 as a Netflix series.

In 2003, &quot;Broken Angels&quot; was published, the sequel to &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, again featuring Takeshi Kovacs and blending science fiction and war fiction in a similar way to his cross-genre début. The success of this book solidified his literary reputation.

&quot;Market Forces&quot;, Morgan&#x27;s first non-Kovacs novel, is set in the near future. It was originally written as a short story, then as a screenplay (both unpublished). After the success of his first two works, it was released as a novel and optioned as a film.

Morgan&#x27;s third Kovacs novel, intended as the final novel in the series, &quot;Woken Furies&quot;, was released in the UK in March 2005 and in the U.S. in September 2005. In this novel, the Takeshi Kovacs character comes into his own as a hero, not merely a long-black-coat clad, boilerplate antihero.

Morgan wrote two six-issue miniseries for Marvel Comics under the Marvel Knights imprint. His first story, &quot;Black Widow: Homecoming&quot; published monthly in 2004 was followed by a second, &quot;Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her&quot; published monthly in 2005; both are available in collected editions. According to Morgan&#x27;s official website the series was &quot;an artefact of limited appeal&quot; and is unlikely to be continued, although he has other comic projects in development.

&quot;Black Man&quot; was released in May 2007 in the UK and in June 2007 in the United States (as &quot;Thirteen&quot; or &quot;Th1rte3n&quot;). Later UK editions were published with the &quot;Thirteen&quot; title. According to the author, the book is about the constraints of physicality and the idea that people are locked into who they are. These are things he could not deal with in the Kovacs universe, because for Kovacs and people like him mortality is avoidable: they just skip into a new body. The novel won the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award.

Morgan wrote a fantasy trilogy with a gay protagonist, &quot;A Land Fit for Heroes&quot;, the first volume of which has the title &quot;The Steel Remains&quot; and was published in August 2008 in the UK and on 20 January 2009 in the United States. The second volume, titled &quot;The Cold Commands&quot; was published in 2011. The third book in the series is called &quot;The Dark Defiles&quot; and was published on 17 August 2014.

Liber Primus Games is creating a gamebook series based on the &quot;A Land Fit For Heroes&quot; trilogy. The first game was published for Android, Apple and Amazon Kindle Fire devices on 4 November 2015. The release of the PC game was announced in May 2016.

In 2008, he worked with Starbreeze as a writer for &quot;Syndicate&quot;, the 2012 re-imagining of the 1992 video game. Additionally, Morgan worked with Electronic Arts and Crytek as lead writer for their 2011 video game, &quot;Crysis 2&quot;.

In October 2018, Morgan&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;Thin Air&quot;, was published in the UK by Gollancz.

In an interview before the launch of &quot;Thin Air&quot;, Morgan described a common feature of his works:

A graphic novel titled &quot;Altered Carbon: Download Blues&quot;, which continues to follow the character Takeshi Kovacs, was released in July 2019.

An animated feature entitled &quot;Altered Carbon: Resleeved&quot; was released in 2020 on Netflix.

Morgan&#x27;s books are generally set in a post-extropianist dystopian world. Morgan described his &quot;takeaway&quot; of one of his books as:

<text>Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the districts Eichsfeld, Kyffhäuserkreis, Sömmerda, Gotha, Wartburgkreis and the district Werra-Meißner in Hesse.

==History==
The district was created on 1 July 1994 by merging the two previous districts of Mühlhausen and Bad Langensalza.

==Partnerships==
The district has a partnership with the Wetteraukreis in Hesse dating back to the German reunification of 1990. The district also has a partnership with the Lithuanian districts Ukmerge and Raseiniai.

==Geography==
The district is named after the river Unstrut and a hill chain, the Hainich. The Hainich became the 13th national park of Germany in 1997.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combines the symbols of the historical territories which make up the area of the district. In the top left is the eagle of the city Mühlhausen, in the top right the lion as the symbol of the dukes of Thuringia. In the bottom left is the Wheel of Mainz, and the deer antler in the bottom right is the symbol of the Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.

<doc id="364506" wikidata="Q336881" url="?curid=364506" title="Melvyn Bragg">
<text>Melvyn Bragg, Baron Bragg (born 6 October 1939) is an English broadcaster, author and parliamentarian. He is the editor and presenter of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; (1978–2010, 2012–2023), and the presenter of the BBC Radio 4 documentary series &quot;In Our Time&quot;.

Earlier in his career, Bragg worked for the BBC in various roles including presenter, a connection that resumed in 1988 when he began to host &quot;Start the Week&quot; on BBC Radio 4. After his ennoblement in 1998, he switched to presenting the new &quot;In Our Time&quot;, an academic discussion radio programme, which has run to more than one thousand broadcast editions and is also a podcast. He served as Chancellor of the University of Leeds from 1999 until 2017.

==Early life==
Bragg was born on 6 October 1939 in Carlisle, the son of Stanley Bragg, a stock keeper turned publican, and Mary Ethel (née Park), who worked alongside her husband in the pub. Both the Braggs and Parks, Cumberland families, were agricultural labourers, also working at collieries and in domestic service. He was given the name Melvyn by his mother after she saw the actor Melvyn Douglas at a local cinema. He was raised in the small town of Wigton, where he attended the Wigton primary school and later The Nelson Thomlinson Grammar School, where he was Head Boy. He was an only child, born a year after his parents married. His father was away from home serving with the Royal Air Force for four years during the war. His upbringing and childhood experiences were typical of the working-class environment of that era.

When he was a child, he was led to believe that his mother&#x27;s foster mother was his maternal grandmother. His grandmother had been forced to leave the town owing to the stigma of her daughter being born illegitimately. From the age of 8 until he left for university, his family home was above a pub in Wigton, the Black-A-Moor Hotel, of which his father had become the landlord. Into his teens he was a member of the Scouts and played rugby in his school&#x27;s first team. Encouraged by a teacher who had recognised his work ethic, Bragg was one of an increasing number of working-class teenagers of the era being given a path to university through the grammar school system. He read Modern History at Wadham College, Oxford, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

==Career==

===Broadcasting===
Bragg began his career in 1961 as a general trainee at the BBC. He was the recipient of one of only three traineeships awarded that year. He spent his first two years in radio at the BBC World Service, then at the BBC Third Programme and BBC Home Service. He joined the production team of Huw Wheldon&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; arts series on BBC Television. He presented the BBC books programme &quot;Read All About It&quot; (and was also its editor, 1976–77) and &quot;The Lively Arts&quot;, a BBC Two arts series. He then edited and presented the London Weekend Television (LWT) arts programme &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; from 1978 to 2010. His interview with playwright Dennis Potter shortly before his death is regularly cited as one of the most moving and memorable television moments ever. His interest in popular music as well as classical is credited with making the arts more accessible and less elitist.

He was Head of Arts at LWT from 1982 to 1990 and Controller of Arts at LWT from 1990. He has made many programmes on BBC Radio 4, including &quot;Start the Week&quot; (1988 to 1998), &quot;The Routes of English&quot; (mapping the history of the English language), and &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1998 to present), which in March 2011 broadcast its 500th programme. Bragg&#x27;s pending departure from the &quot;South Bank Show&quot; was portrayed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the last of the ITV grandees, speculating that the next generation of ITV broadcasters would not have the same longevity or influence as Bragg or his ITV contemporaries John Birt, Greg Dyke, Michael Grade and Christopher Bland.

In 2012 he brought &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; back to Sky Arts 1. In December 2012, he began &quot;The Value of Culture&quot;, a five-part series on BBC Radio 4 examining the meaning of culture, expanding on Matthew Arnold&#x27;s landmark (1869) collection of essays &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;. In June 2013 Bragg wrote and presented &quot;The Most Dangerous Man in Tudor England&quot;, broadcast by the BBC. This told the dramatic story of William Tyndale&#x27;s mission to translate the Bible from the original languages to English. In February 2012, he began &quot;Melvyn Bragg on Class and Culture&quot;, a three-part series on BBC2 examining popular media culture, with an analysis of the British social class system. Bragg appeared on the Front Row &quot;Cultural Exchange&quot; on May Day 2013. He nominated a self-portrait by Rembrandt as a piece of art which he had found especially interesting. In 2015, Bragg was appointed as a Vice President of the Royal Television Society.

===Writing===
Having produced unpublished short stories since the age of 19, Bragg had decided to become a writer after university. He recognised that writing would not, initially at least, earn him a living, and he took the opportunity at the BBC that arose after he had applied for posts in a variety of industries. While at the BBC, he continued writing. Publishing his first novel in 1965, he decided to leave the BBC to concentrate full-time on writing.

A novelist and writer of non-fiction, Bragg has also written a number of television and film screenplays. Some of his early television work was in collaboration with Ken Russell, for whom he wrote the biographical dramas &quot;The Debussy Film&quot; (1965) and &quot;Isadora Duncan, the Biggest Dancer in the World&quot; (1967), as well as Russell&#x27;s film about Tchaikovsky, &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1970). Most of Bragg&#x27;s novels are autobiographical fictions, set in and around the town of Wigton during his childhood. In 1972, he co-wrote the script for Norman Jewison&#x27;s film &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973). Although Bragg published several works, he was unable to make a living, forcing a return to television by the mid-1970s.

Bragg received a variety of reviews for his work, some critics declaring it outstanding and others suggesting it was lazy. Many suggested that splitting his time between writing and broadcasting was detrimental to the quality, and that his media profile and his known sensitivity to criticism made him an easy target for unjust reviews. &quot;The Literary Review&quot;″s prize mocking his writing of sex in fiction, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, was awarded not on readers&#x27; nominations, but simply because it would be good PR. From 1996 to 1998 he also wrote a column in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper; he has also occasionally written for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

===Peerage===
Bragg&#x27;s friends include the former Labour Party leaders Tony Blair and Neil Kinnock, and former deputy leader Roy Hattersley. He was one of 100 donors who gave the Labour Party a sum in excess of £5,000 in 1997, the year the party came to power under Blair in the general election. The following year he was appointed by Blair to the House of Lords as the life peer Baron Bragg, &quot;of Wigton in the County of Cumbria&quot;, one of a number of Labour donors given peerages. This led to accusations of cronyism from the defeated Conservative Party.

In the Lords he takes a keen interest in the arts and education. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2004, he voted 104 times out of a possible 226 in the 2002/3 session, only once against the government, on the Hunting Act. He campaigned against it on the grounds that it could affect the livelihoods of Cumbrian farmers. In August 2014, Bragg was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Bragg has occasionally commented on American politics, in 1998 agreeing with the sentiment that writer and polemicist Gore Vidal was &quot;the greatest president America never had&quot;. 

===Advocacy===
Bragg has defended Christianity, particularly the King James Bible, although he does not claim to be a believer, seeing himself in Albert Einstein&#x27;s term as a &quot;believing unbeliever&quot;, adding that he is &quot;unable to cross the River of Jordan which would lead me to the crucial belief in a godly eternity.&quot; In 2012, Bragg criticised what he claimed to be the &quot;Animus and the ignorance&quot; of the atheism debate.

In August 2016, Bragg publicly accused the National Trust of &quot;bullying&quot; in its &quot;disgraceful purchase&quot; of land in the Lake District, which could threaten the Herdwick rare breed of sheep as well as the Lake District&#x27;s historic farming system, for which the region was nominated as a Unesco World Heritage site.

==Personal life==
In 1961 Bragg married his first wife, Marie-Elisabeth Roche b. 1939), and in 1965 they had a daughter, Marie-Elsa Bragg. Roche was a French viscountess studying painting at Oxford. In 1971, Roche died by suicide. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1998, Bragg said, &quot;I could have done things which helped and I did things which harmed. So yes, I feel guilt, I feel remorse.&quot; This was in part a reference to his infidelities which included Cate Haste, whom he married in 1973. She was also a television producer and writer, whose literary work includes editing the 2007 memoir of Clarissa Eden, widow of Anthony Eden, and collaborating with Cherie Booth, wife of Tony Blair, on a 2004 book about the wives of British prime ministers. They had a son and a daughter.

In June 2016 it was reported that Bragg and Haste had separated amicably, and that Bragg now shared a home with former film assistant Gabriel Clare-Hunt, with whom he had an affair that began in 1995. She is 16 years younger than him. The marriage between Haste and Bragg was dissolved in 2018 and Haste died in April 2021. Another reported affair was with Lady Jane Wellesley between 1979 and 1987.

In September 2019 he married Clare-Hunt at St Bega&#x27;s Church in Bassenthwaite, part of the Lake District National Park. His eldest daughter, Marie-Elsa, a priest, conducted the service. His second daughter, Alice, read a lesson, while his son, Tom, was an usher. Guests included Cumbrian mountaineer Chris Bonington and the ceremony featured the premiere of music specially written by Bragg&#x27;s friend, composer Howard Goodall.

Bragg has publicly discussed two nervous breakdowns that he has suffered, one in his teens and another in his 30s. His first breakdown began at the age of 13. Inspired by a passage in Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Prelude&quot;, he found ways to cope, including exploring the outdoors and the adoption of a strong work ethic, as well as meeting his first girlfriend. The second followed his first wife&#x27;s suicide. He traces the origin of a lifelong nervousness of public speaking to the experience of giving a reading from the lectern as a choirboy at the age of six.

At the age of 75, he was profiled in the BBC Two television programme &quot;Melvyn Bragg: Wigton to Westminster&quot;, first broadcast on 18 July 2015. He lives in Hampstead, London, but still owns a house near his home town of Wigton. He is a member of the Garrick and Chelsea Arts clubs.

He also takes an interest in football, supporting both Carlisle United and Arsenal. He is the vice president of the Carlisle United Supporters Club London Branch.

Bragg is a relative of William Henry Bragg and his son Lawrence Bragg, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915 for their work in x-ray crystal structure analysis. He presented a Radio 4 programme on the subject in August 2013.

<text>Visingsö is an island in the southern half of Lake Vättern in Sweden.

Visingsö lies north of the city Jönköping and west of Gränna from which two car ferries connect the island. The island is long and wide, with a total area of .

According to legend, a giant named Vist created Visingsö by throwing a lump of soil into the lake so that his wife could use it to step over the lake.

== History ==
In the 12th and 13th century, Näs Castle on the southern end of Visingsö was the residence for the fragile Swedish monarchy. Four Swedish kings died there: Karl Sverkersson, Erik Knutsson, Johan Sverkersson, and Magnus Ladulås.
Furthermore, in the 17th century the influential Brahe family resided in Visingsborg, a castle on the eastern side of the island. Both Näs Castle and Visingsborg are presently in ruins and well known landmarks of Visingsö.

The Swedish Navy planted oak trees on the island beginning in 1831 to provide strategically important timber for future ship construction. Once the timber was ready to harvest it was no longer required for ship construction. The Swedish Navy declined to harvest the trees when offered them in 1975. Consequently, Visingsö is partially covered by oak forests, the rest being farmland. 

* The Visingsborg Castle became one of Sweden’s most prominent royal estates during the reign of King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century.
* It played an important role as the seat of nobility and as a strategic outpost for the crown. Many powerful Swedish families lived on the island, including the famous Stålhammar family, who were granted ownership of Visingsö.
* The castle was also a centre for trade, with a port for goods that travelled through the lake.

== Climate ==
Visingsö has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), influenced by its position in the middle of the deep lake. As a result of Vättern&#x27;s depth, it struggles both freezing over in winter as the surrounding landmass is colder, while in summer the temperature of the lake remains fairly cool. The relative warmth of Visingsö in summer is a result of Vättern being relatively narrow, resulting in warm air from the landmass only being slightly tempered. Temperatures below in winter are not very common annually due to the open water moderating the extremes. In spite of the unfavourable conditions for heat in its deep-lake position, Visingsö has warmer summers than all of the island of Ireland as well as much of Great Britain. Even so, the cold surface water enables air frosts to occur as late as May, in extreme instances. Visingsö is very dry for much of the year, although summers can be relatively wet.

== Geology ==

Visingsö has long been of interest to geologists because of the development of a sedimentary series of rocks (the Visingsö Group) there (and elsewhere around Lake Vättern, especially on the west side). The surrounding rocks are largely much older &quot;Småland granites&quot; of mixed granite-like compositions. The Visingsö Group is approximately 1000 m thick and is divided into three units. It is Late Riphean in date. A wide array of late Precambrian fossils have been recovered from the group, including stromatolites, vase-shaped microfossils, acritarchs and macro fossils such as Tawuia. The sediments of the Visingsö Group have been preserved within the Lake Vättern graben structure.

==Transportation==
There are two car ferries that travel between Visingsö and Gränna on a continuous basis. There are several roads connecting communities on the island, that are also served by bus. There is also a small airfield on the north end of the island, consisting of two grass runways.

<text>The South Bank Show is a British television arts magazine series originally produced by London Weekend Television and broadcast on ITV between 1978 and 2010. A new version of the series began 27 May 2012 on Sky Arts. Conceived, written, and presented by former BBC arts broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, the show aims to bring both high art and popular culture to a mass audience. In 2023, the series came to an end when it was announced that Bragg would be leaving the series after 45 years.

==History==
===ITV (1978–2010)===
The programme was a replacement for &quot;Aquarius&quot;, the arts series which had been running since 1970. Presenter Melvyn Bragg was already well known for his arts broadcasting on BBC television, notably &quot;Monitor&quot; and BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Lively Arts&quot;. It first aired on 14 January 1978, covering many subjects, including Germaine Greer, Gerald Scarfe and Paul McCartney. It is the longest continuously running arts programme on UK television. From the beginning the series&#x27; intent was to mix high art and popular culture. This has remained, and the programme has always focused predominantly on art of the 20th and 21st centuries.

For much of its life, the show was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for the ITV network.

In May 2009, ITV announced that the show was to come to an end. Although it was originally reported that the show was ending due to Bragg&#x27;s retirement, Bragg later made it clear that he decided to leave after they ended the show, and thought ending it was a mistake; according to him, &quot;they&#x27;ve killed the show, so I thought, I&#x27;ll go as well.&quot;

On Monday 28 December 2009 the final ITV edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; was broadcast, featuring The Royal Shakespeare Company as its subject. Melvyn Bragg announced on this programme that, after ITV&#x27;s last South Bank Show Awards in January 2010, there would be a series of ten &quot;The South Bank Show Revisited&quot; programmes transmitted in early 2010, featuring updates on previous &quot;South Bank Show&quot; subjects.

The production archive for the ITV series, including unaired footage, is housed at the University of Leeds.

ITV had 33 series with 743 episodes, from 1978 until 2010.

===Sky Arts (2012–2023)===
In July 2010, it was revealed that Bragg had bought the rights to the brand and had first right of access to &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; archives. Sky Arts broadcasts &quot;South Bank Show&quot; archive editions and hosted the South Bank Sky Arts Awards on 25 Jan 2011, presented by Melvyn Bragg, accompanied by a new arrangement of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; theme.

Sky Arts revived &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; with a new series starting 27 May 2012.

From 2012 to 2023 most series only have around 4–6 episodes.

==Theme music and visuals==
The theme music is taken from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Variations&quot; composed in 1977 for his brother, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. This is based on the theme from Paganini&#x27;s &quot;24th Caprice&quot;. The brand image of the programme is an animated version of a detail from Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling painting, specifically the image of the Hand of God giving life to Adam. It shows the two hands meeting, generating a lightning bolt.

== Podcast ==
From 18 September 2006, ITV released podcast of the interviews from the show, including extra material not included in the broadcast editions.

==Awards==
The programme has been awarded more than 110 awards (including 12 BAFTAs, 5 Prix Italia and 4 RTS Awards). Pat Gavin&#x27;s animated title sequences have won two BAFTAs.

==Parodies==

The comedy series &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; often parodied &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;. It does this in a series of sketches called &quot;South Bank&quot;, a cross between &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; and the American cartoon &quot;South Park&quot;, set in the South Bank of London. In these sketches, Melvyn Bragg is Stan Marsh, Alan Yentob is Kyle Broflovski, Mark Lawson is Eric Cartman and Kenneth Branagh is Kenny McCormick.

A sketch in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; featured Vic Reeves as Melvyn Bragg (with felt-tip marks on his face) presenting a feature on fictional folk singers Mulligan and O&#x27;Hare. Reeves depicts Bragg as an unlikely &quot;A-Team&quot; obsessive.

Harry Enfield&#x27;s TV film &quot;Norbert Smith - a Life&quot; is a parody edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant&#x27;s second series of &quot;Extras&quot; featured a reference to a fictional episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; focused on madcap children&#x27;s television presenters Dick and Dom.

&quot;Private Eye&quot; tends to parody Melvyn Bragg&#x27;s name, and &quot;Spitting Image&quot; would rather accentuate his nasal accent. As &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was often aired immediately before &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, episodes would often end with a send-up of Bragg, most notably in one episode having him advise viewers to switch off their televisions to avoid watching it.

Benny Hill once parodied Bragg in a 1978 episode of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; as Melvyn Dragg. The name of the show was also parodied, and it was called &quot;The South Blank Show.&quot;

<text>An executioner, also known as a hangman or headsman, is an official who effects a sentence of capital punishment on a condemned person.

== Scope and job ==
The executioner was usually presented with a warrant authorising or ordering him to &quot;execute&quot; the sentence. The warrant protects the executioner from the charge of murder. Common terms for executioners derived from forms of capital punishment—though they often also performed other physical punishments—include hangman (hanging) and headsman (beheading). In the military, the role of executioner was performed by a soldier, such as the &quot;provost&quot;. A common stereotype of an executioner is a hooded medieval or absolutist executioner. Symbolic or real, executioners were rarely hooded, and not robed in all black; hoods were only used if an executioner&#x27;s identity and anonymity were to be preserved from the public. As Hilary Mantel noted in her 2018 Reith Lectures, &quot;Why would an executioner wear a mask? Everybody knew who he was&quot;.

While this task can be occasional in nature, it can be carried out in the line of more general duty by an officer of the court, the police, prison staff, or even the military. A special case is the tradition of the Roman &quot;fustuarium&quot;, continued in forms of running the gauntlet, where the culprit receives their punishment from the hands of the comrades gravely harmed by their crime, e.g. for failing in vital sentinel duty or stealing from a ship&#x27;s limited food supply.

Many executioners were professional specialists who traveled a circuit or region performing their duty, because executions were rarely very numerous. Within this region, a resident executioner would also administer non-lethal physical punishments, or apply torture. In medieval Europe, to the end of the early modern period, executioners were often knackers, since pay from the rare executions was not enough to live off.

In medieval Europe executioners also taxed lepers and prostitutes, and controlled gaming houses. They were also in charge of the latrines and cesspools, and disposing of animal carcasses.

The term is extended to administrators of severe physical punishment that is not prescribed to kill, but which may result in death.

Executions in France (using the guillotine since the French Revolution) persisted until 1977, and the French Republic had an official executioner; the last one, Marcel Chevalier, served until the formal abolition of capital punishment in 1981.

== In society ==
In Western Europe and its colonies, executioners were often shunned by their neighbours, with their work as knackers also disreputable. In France, executioners and their families were ostracized and lived in social isolation. In Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and in the film &quot;La veuve de Saint-Pierre&quot; (&quot;The Widow of Saint-Peter&quot;), minor character executioners are ostracized by the villagers.

In early modern German society, executioners and their families were considered &quot;dishonourable people&quot; (&quot;unehrliche Leute&quot;).

The profession of executioner sometimes ran through a family, especially in France, where the Sanson family provided six executioners between 1688 and 1847 and the Deibler dynasty provided five between 1879 and its 1981 abolition. The latter&#x27;s members included Louis Deibler, his son Anatole, Anatole&#x27;s nephew Jules-Henri Desfourneaux, his other nephew André Obrecht, and André&#x27;s nephew Marcel Chevalier.

In Britain, the most notable dynasty was the Pierrepoints, who provided three executioners between 1902 and 1956 – Henry, his brother Thomas, and Henry&#x27;s son Albert. Unlike in France and many other European countries, far from being shunned, British executioners such as William Marwood, James Berry, Albert Pierrepoint, and Harry Allen were widely known and respected by the public.

In Korea, the &quot;Baekjeong&quot; were an &quot;untouchable&quot; group who traditionally performed the jobs of executioner and butcher. In Japan, executioners have been held in contempt as part of the &quot;Burakumin&quot; class (today executions in Japan are not carried out by professional executioners, but by prison guards). In &quot;Memories of Silk and Straw&quot;, by Junichi Saga, one of the families surveyed in the Japanese village of Tsuchiura is that of an executioner family (&quot;The Last Executioner&quot;, p. 54). This family does suffer social isolation, even though the family is somewhat well-off financially.

In the Ottoman Empire, the role of executioners was given to the Ottoman gardeners, bodyguards who guarded the sultan&#x27;s palace. Members of the gardeners conducted executions of anyone whom the sultan wanted executed, but the most senior officials who were sentenced to death were dealt with by the head of the gardeners () in person. Bostancibaşi would give the person sentenced to death a cup of sherbet, and if the sherbet was white, they would avoid death, but if it was red, they would be executed on the spot by janissaries. Grand viziers could avoid execution by racing the bostancibaşi. If they reached the Fish Market Gate (on the southern side of the palace complex) from the Central Gate of the palace complex before the bostancibaşi, they would be banished instead of being executed. If they were slower than the bostancibaşi, they would be executed and their body would be thrown into the sea. This custom lasted until the nineteenth century. The last recorded person to participate in a race with the bostancibaşi was grand vizier Hacı Salih Pasha who, in November 1822, outran the bostancibaşi and saved his life. He was so widely esteemed for winning the race that he got appointed governor general of the Damascus province. Executioners had their own graveyards, with uncarved and unpolished simple rough stones used as gravestones. The biggest of these graveyards is part of the Eyüp Cemetery in Istanbul.

The town of Roscommon has the distinction of having had Ireland&#x27;s most notorious hangwoman, Lady Betty, who was given the post in exchange for her life being spared when the hangman due to execute her death sentence took ill on the day that she and 25 others were due to be hanged. Lady Betty offered to carry out the task in exchange for her death sentence being commuted to a life sentence, and she acted as the county&#x27;s hangwoman from then on.
An unidentified woman hanged two men for murder on 13 November 1782 at Kilmainham, near Dublin. The men were also quartered. The sheriff received abuse for making a hangman of a woman.

<text>Brian Coffey (8 June 1905 – 14 April 1995) was an Irish poet and publisher. His work was informed by his Catholicism, his background in science and philosophy, and his connection to French surrealism. He was close to an intellectual European Catholic tradition and mainstream Irish Catholic culture. Two of his long poems, &quot;Advent&quot; (1975) and &quot;Death of Hektor&quot; (1979), were widely considered to be important works in the canon of Irish poetic modernism. He also ran Advent Books, a small press, during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life and work==
Coffey was born in Dublin in the suburb of Dún Laoghaire. He attended the Mount St Benedict boarding school in Gorey, County Wexford from 1917 to 1919 and then James Joyce&#x27;s old school, Clongowes Wood College, in Clane, County Kildare, from 1919 until 1922. In 1923, he went to France to study for a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Classical Studies at the Institution St Vincent, Senlis, Oise.

His father, Denis J. Coffey, was a professor of anatomy at the Catholic University of Ireland Medical School in Cecilia Street, who served as the first president following the creation of the National University of Ireland of University College Dublin (UCD) from 1908 to 1940. Coffey entered UCD in 1924 and earned advanced degrees in mathematics, physics and chemistry. He also represented the college in boxing tournaments.

While still at college, Coffey began writing poetry. He published his first poems in UCD&#x27;s &quot;The National Student&quot; under the pseudonym Coeuvre. These poems, which have never been collected, showed the influence of French Symbolism and of TS Eliot. During this time Coffey met Denis Devlin and together they published a volume entitled &quot;Poems&quot; in 1930. Coffey and Devlin both also participated in college dramatics, taking roles in French plays.

==Paris==
In the early 1930s, Coffey moved to Paris, where he studied Physical Chemistry under Jean Baptiste Perrin, who had won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1926. He completed these studies in 1933, and his &quot;Three Poems&quot; was printed in Paris by Jeanette Monnier that same year, as was the poem card &quot;Yuki Hira&quot;, which was admired by George William Russell and William Butler Yeats. He also became friendly with other Irish writers based in the city, including Thomas MacGreevy and Samuel Beckett. In his 1934 essay &quot;Recent Irish Poetry&quot;, Beckett picked out Coffey and Devlin as forming &#x27;the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland&#x27;.

He entered the Institut Catholique de Paris that year to work with the noted French philosopher Jacques Maritain, taking his licentiate examination in 1936. He then moved to London for a time and contributed reviews and a poem to Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Criterion&quot; magazine. On trips home to Dublin, he contributed to programmes on literary topics on RTÉ radio and published poems in &quot;Ireland Today&quot;.

He returned to Paris in 1937 as an exchange student to work on his doctoral thesis on the idea of order in the work of Thomas Aquinas. In 1938, Coffey&#x27;s second volume of poetry, &quot;Third Person&quot;, was published by George Reavey&#x27;s Europa Press. He also contributed translations to the same publisher&#x27;s &quot;Thorns of Thunder&quot; (1936), the first collection of Paul Éluard&#x27;s work published in English. The poems of this period saw Coffey shake off his earlier influences and begin to find his own voice but, for a variety of reasons, &quot;Third Person&quot; was to be his last poetry publication for a quarter of a century.

==St Louis==
During the war, Coffey taught in schools in London and Yorkshire, leaving his young family in Dublin. After the war, he returned to Paris and completed his doctoral thesis. The family then moved so Coffey could take up a teaching post at the Jesuit Saint Louis University. During this period, Coffey seems to have done very little, if any, creative writing as he focused mainly on philosophical work based on his thesis, publishing a number of essays in &quot;The Modern Schoolman&quot;.

By the early 1950s, Coffey had become uncomfortable for a number of reasons, including the nature of his work, his distance from Ireland and the pressures that inevitably came to bear on an academic who had previously associated with well-known left-wing writers in Paris. For these reasons, he began to look for a suitable opportunity to leave the United States and resigned, possibly on a matter of academic principle, in 1952.

==Later life and work==
In 1952, Coffey returned to live in London and, from 1973, Southampton. He began again to publish his poetry and translations, mainly of French poetry. The first work in English to appear after this period of silence was &quot;Missouri Sequence&quot;, apparently begun in St. Louis but first appearing in the &quot;University Review&quot; in 1962. This poem deals with the experience of exile, memories of the poet&#x27;s dead parents and the premature birth of a child. It is written in a much more conventional syntax than most of Coffey&#x27;s work and, thanks to this greater accessibility, is one of his most widely read works.

Over the next decade or so, he published regularly in the &quot;University Review&quot; (later known as the &quot;Irish University Review&quot;), a relationship that culminated in the 1975 special issue. This featured an introduction by Dr JCC Mays, a selection of translations from French, the satire &quot;Leo&quot; and &quot;Advent&quot;, a meditation on death inspired by the death of the poet&#x27;s son in a motorcycle accident. The poem is in seven sections, based, according to Coffey, in an interview with Parkman Howe on the canonical hours of the Catholic Church.

Another key work of this period was &quot;Death of Hektor&quot;, which uses the myth of Troy as a framework for a meditation on war and its victims. The trade editions of &quot;Advent&quot; and &quot;Death of Hektor&quot; were both published by the Menard Press. He also edited Devlin&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1964), first for a &quot;University Review&quot; Devlin special issue and later as a book from Dolmen Press.

He also set up his own publishing enterprise, Advent Books, which published work by himself and by younger writers he wanted to support. He learned printmaking and produced a good deal of original work, including an interesting set of images based on the plays of his old friend Beckett. His interest in visual art also led to some experiments in concrete poetry, most notably his 1966 Advent book &quot;Monster: A Concrete Poem&quot;. His work was championed by a number of younger Irish poets, especially Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. These two published poetry, prose and translations by Coffey in their journal &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;, and his &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1971), under their New Writers Press imprint. This book was instrumental in helping establish his reputation as a leading Irish exponent of modernist poetry.

The appearance in 1991 of a major selection &quot;Poems and Versions 1929–1990&quot; and his translations &quot;Poems from Mallarmé&quot; helped confirm his status as one of the leading Irish modernists. He died at the age of 89 and was buried in Southampton, England.

<text>Aa is a genus of plants of the family Orchidaceae.

Species in this genus can be found growing terrestrially in cold habitats near the snowline in the Andes and also in Costa Rica; they are usually found close to small streams. The elongated inflorescence grows from a basal rosette of leaves, terminating in a small white non-resupinate flower. This lip is fringed and hood-shaped. The flower gives off a pungent smell that attracts flies. This genus has often been included in the orchid genus &quot;Altensteinia&quot;.

The first scientific description of a species of this genus was made in 1815 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, naming it first &quot;Ophrys paleacea&quot; , and later &quot;Altensteinia paleacea&quot;. In 1854 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach separated &quot;Aa&quot; from &quot;Altensteinia&quot;, to include two species &quot;Aa argyrolepis&quot; and &quot;Aa paleacea&quot;. The genus name apparently was rendered by the author to always appear first in alphabetical listings. Another – disputed – explanation, is that Reichenbach named this genus after Pieter van der Aa; the printer of the Dutch botanist Paul Herman&#x27;s &quot;Paradisus Batavus&quot;. A few years later, Reichenbach reviewed the name of the genus and named it again &quot;Altensteinia&quot;. Finally in 1912 Rudolf Schlechter switched the name again to &quot;Aa&quot;, as more species were being discovered making the new name more significant.

<text>The American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS) was an abolitionist society in the United States. AASS formed in 1833 in response to the nullification crisis and the failures of existing anti-slavery organizations, such as the American Colonization Society. AASS formally dissolved in 1870.

AASS was founded by William Lloyd Garrison and Arthur Tappan. Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave, had become a prominent abolitionist and was a key leader in AASS, who often spoke at its meetings. William Wells Brown, also a freedman, also often spoke at meetings. By 1838, AASS had 1,346 local chapters. In 1840, AASS claimed about 200,000 members.

Prominent members included Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Theodore Dwight Weld, Lewis Tappan, James G. Birney, Lydia Maria Child, Maria Weston Chapman, Nathan Lord, Augustine Clarke, 
Samuel Cornish, George T. Downing, James Forten, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster, Henry Highland Garnet, Beriah Green, Lucretia Mott, Wendell Phillips, Robert Purvis, Charles Lenox Remond, Sarah Parker Remond, Lucy Stone, and John Greenleaf Whittier, among others.

== History ==

=== Background ===
By the 1820s, the controversy surrounding the Missouri Compromise had quieted considerably but was revived by a series of events near the end of the decade. Serious debates over abolition took place in the Virginia legislature in 1829 and 1831. (See Thomas Roderick Dew#Dew and slavery.) In the North, discussion began about the possibility of freeing slaves and &quot;resettling&quot; them in Africa (a proposal that, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, led to the founding of Liberia).

Agitation increased with the publication of David Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World&quot; in 1829, Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion in 1831, and Andrew Jackson&#x27;s handling of the nullification crisis that same year. According to Louis Ruchame, 
The Turner rebellion was only one of about 200 slave uprisings between 1776 and 1860, but it was one of the bloodiest, and thus struck fear in the hearts of many white southerners. Nat Turner and more than 70 enslaved and free blacks spontaneously launched a rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in August 1831. They moved from farm to farm, indiscriminately killing whites along the way and picking up additional slaves. By the time the militia put down the insurrection, more than 80 slaves had joined the rebellion, and 60 whites lay dead. While the uprising led some Southerners to consider abolition, the reaction in all Southern states was to tighten the laws governing slave behavior.

That same year, South Carolina&#x27;s opposition to the federal tariff led the legislature to declare that the law was null and void in the state, and the state&#x27;s leaders spoke of using the militia to prevent federal customs agents from collecting the tax. President Andrew Jackson swept aside the states&#x27; rights arguments and threatened to use the army to enforce federal laws. In the face of Jackson&#x27;s determination, the state backed down, but the episode raised fears throughout the South that it was only a matter of time before Congress would begin to tamper with slavery. Southern anxiety increased in 1833 with the founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Louisiana.

Beginning in 1816, the American Colonization Society became the early antebellum locus of anti-slavery activity, presided over by James Madison in his last three years of life (until 1836). In 1789, Madison had expressed his belief that blacks and whites could not integrate into society together, and proposed a policy of separation. Madison argued that integration (at the time called &quot;amalgamation&quot;) was impossible, because there would always be oppression, hatred, and hostility between former slaves and former slave holders. He also claimed, in his so-called &quot;Memorandum on an African Colony for Freed Slaves&quot;, that &quot;freedmen retained the vices and habits of slaves.&quot;
He advocated &quot;resettlement&quot; of former slaves to the west coast of Africa, where the Society acquired land and founded what became Liberia.

The ACS idea of colonization aligned with Madisonian perspectives on immediate abolition bills proposed to the Federal Congress. In 1791, Madison had observed that, in his experience, such proposals resulted in &quot;harm rather than good.&quot; During the Second Federal Congress, Madison corresponded with manumitter Robert Pleasants, confirming their mutual support for conscientious religious objection to a Virginia state militia, premised on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The correspondence belied arguments that Madison completely capitulated to Virginia Antifederalist demands for an individual and state &quot;right&quot; to organize militias, in what would become the Second Amendment. The scope of the Amendment potentially included slave patrols, stemming from Madison&#x27;s attempts to ameliorate Antifederal proponents of state police powers in the Virginia ratification convention. Scholarly attempts to establish such a Second Amendment &quot;original intent&quot; have been roundly criticized because of, at best, &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence. Another principal concern is the dismissal of additional intentions and considerations, including finalization of Second Amendment semantics by federal Senators, not Madison in the House of Representatives. As of September 2024, according to one historian of the politics of chattel slavery and gun control, a &quot;comprehensive treatment that can handle slavery, arms, constitutionalism, and the rest of political culture is still needed.&quot;

In perusing the correspondence with Pleasants, later ACS members heeded Madison&#x27;s warning that immediate abolition proposals could lead to protracted Congressional debates. Lengthy deliberations and Congressional sessions, in turn, allowed proslavery delegates sufficient time to propose the repeal of individual manumission codes in the several states, ostensibly in anticipation of federal abolition. A corollary to this concern was that proslavery delegates, in the context of individual manumission codes, had hitherto demanded &quot;a condition that the persons freed should be removed from the Country.&quot; For Madison, federal colonization legislation proved more prudent, practical, and feasible because proslavery representatives were already amenable to it. Madisonian colonization would ultimately be compulsory, not voluntary, which again aligned with ACS goals.

=== Origins ===
A convention of abolitionists was called for December 4, 1833, at the Adelphi Building in Philadelphia. The convention had 62 delegates, of which 21 were Quakers. At this point, the American Anti-Slavery Society formed to appeal to the moral and practical circumstances that, at this point, propped up a pro-slavery society. Between December 4–6, 1833, sixty delegates from New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and New Jersey convened a National Anti-Slavery Convention in Philadelphia. Beriah Green presided over the Convention — no one else was willing to—, with Lewis Tappan and John Greenleaf Whittier serving as secretaries. One Convention committee drafted an American Anti-Slavery Society Constitution and &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot;. The principal author of both was the publisher of the fledgling Boston-based &quot;Liberator&quot;, William Lloyd Garrison.

The new American Anti-Slavery Society charged William Lloyd Garrison with writing the organization&#x27;s new declaration. The document condemns the institution of slavery and accuses slave owners of the sin of being a &quot;man-stealer&quot;. It calls for the immediate abolition of slavery without conditions, and is critical of the efforts of the American Colonization Society. At the same time, it declares the group to be pacifist, and the signers agree, if necessary, to die as martyrs.

Beginning in January 1834 and ending in August of the same year, the society published the &quot;American Anti-Slavery Reporter,&quot; a monthly periodical containing professional essays regarding the subject of slavery.

=== Early history ===
The society was considered controversial and its activities were sometimes met with violence. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;The society&#x27;s antislavery activities frequently met with violent public opposition, with mobs invading meetings, attacking speakers, and burning presses.&quot;

In July 1834 the aims of the society appear to have been misrepresented in the prelude to the Farren Riots in New York, which resulted in attacks on the homes and properties of abolitionists. After the riots were quelled, the society issued a public disclaimer:

The black clergyman Theodore S. Wright was a significant founding member and served on the executive committee until 1840. A Presbyterian minister, Wright, together with well-known spokesmen such as Tappan and Garrison, agitated for temperance, education, black suffrage, and land reform.

According to Wright:

Many founding members used a practical approach to slavery, saying economically it did not make sense. Wright used the rhetoric of religion to elicit empathy toward African Americans, and presented slavery as a moral sin.

Frederick Douglass had seen the frustration that Garrison felt toward those who disagreed with him, but wrote many letters to Garrison describing to him the details of the prejudices that slavery had caused. One in particular was directed toward the church. According to Douglass:

Douglass hoped his letters would remind Garrison why slavery should be abolished. Douglass&#x27;s reminder did not ease the minds of those against Garrison.

=== 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention ===
In 1840, the American Anti-Slavery Society was invited to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England, to meet and network with other abolitionists of the time. Additionally, it served to strengthen each group&#x27;s commitment to racial equality. At this convention, female delegates were not allowed to participate in the event, but rather observe only, from a gallery.

The ruling to exclude female abolitionists caused feminists Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to form a group for women&#x27;s rights, though it garnered little success initially. Garrison arrived to the convention late and, upon hearing of the decision not to allow women to participate, he chose not to enter the Convention. He viewed the proceedings with the women in the gallery. This became the genesis for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

=== 1839-1840 split ===
From the beginning, women held a marginal role in the organization. Only white women were invited to the original 1833 gathering of the organization, and even they were not allowed to participate in an active role. Lucretia Mott, Lydia White, Esther Moore, and Sidney Ann Lewis attended on December 4, 1833, but none were able to sign the Constitution that day. Their exclusion from this convention contributed to female-led organizations that formed shortly thereafter.

In the western United States, women held more important roles in the American Anti-slavery Society. Attitudes of equalitarianism were more widely accepted and women were viewed as &quot;coworkers, not subordinates&quot;. Women not only held leadership positions, but also attended various societies and conventions. In contrast, women&#x27;s participation in the American Anti-slavery Society became a quite contentious issue in the eastern United States. Women who were publicly passionate about abolition were seen as fanatics.

In 1839, the national organization split over basic differences of approach: Garrison and his followers were more radical than other members. They denounced the U.S. Constitution as supportive of slavery, were against established religion, and insisted on sharing organizational responsibility with women. Disagreement regarding the formal involvement of women became one of the principal factors which contributed to the dissolution of the organization. Another issue was whether abolitionists should enter politics as a distinct party.

==== Anti-feminist split ====
One of the more irreconcilable differences between the two internal AASS factions resulted in an external rivalry between dual anti-slavery societies. A minority of anti-feminist delegates left the AASS, forming the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. Wright was among them. They were more conservative, supporting organized religion and traditional forms of governance, and excluding women from leadership. Recent studies examine remaining AAAS members who sympathized with the AFASS. Their rejoinders, rebuttals, and dialectics, proffered within AASS meetings and in the pages of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, framed arguments and ideas later appropriated by male and female anti-suffragists, the Liberal Republicans, and northeastern supporters for the Compromise of 1877. The progenitors of such ideas frequently shifted positions and retracted statements in the postbellum era, often to no avail.

==== Liberty Party ====
Along with differing opinions about the role of women, the Liberty Party emerged as a separate anti-slavery organization that broke away from the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 in order to pursue an abolitionist agenda through the political process. As a radical, Garrison did not believe it prudent to fight the system from the inside. Because women in the West had a more fluid approach to their political involvement, particularly when it came to Garrison&#x27;s staunch disagreement with the Constitution, they were drawn to supporting the Liberty Party. The disruption of the American Anti-Slavery Society, however, caused little damage to abolitionism.

At the annual Society meeting in New York, on May 12, 1840, the first item of business was the appointment of a Committee of Business. Eleven people were chosen, with William Garrison the chairman. One of them was a woman, Abby Kelley. &quot;The vote appointing Miss Kelley being doubted, the house was divided, and on a count there appeared 557 in favor and 451 against her election. Lewis Tappan, Amos A. Phelps, and Charles W. Denison successively asked to be excused from serving on the committee, for reasons assigned; having reference to the appointment of Miss Kelly as a member. They were excused.&quot;

=== Decline and dissolution ===
After the AASS schism in national leadership, the bulk of AASS activity in the 1840s and 1850s was carried on by state and local societies.

The antislavery issue entered the mainstream of American politics through the Free Soil Party (1848–1854) and subsequently the Republican Party (founded in 1854).

In 1870, the American Anti-Slavery Society was formally dissolved, after the Civil War, Emancipation and the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

== Leadership ==
The inaugural Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society included Arthur Tappan (President), Abraham L. Cox (Recording Secretary), William Greene (Treasurer), Elizur Wright (Secretary of Domestic Correspondence), and William Lloyd Garrison (Secretary of the Foreign Correspondence).

William Lloyd Garrison was one of the original founders of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. Two years before founding the Society, Garrison began publishing &quot;The Liberator.&quot; This abolitionist paper argued for the immediate freedom of all slaves and operated under the motto of &quot;Our country is the world – our countrymen are mankind.&quot; Within two years of the 1840 Society schism over the appointment of Abby Kelley to the Society business committee and efforts to wed abolition with first-wave feminism (and, to a lesser extent, over the roles of African-American leaders), the former Society President, his brother, and their adherents had seceded from the American Anti-Slavery Society. These men subsequently established the rival American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. Six African-American men also apostatized to the oppositional Society, principally due to a potential conflation of female leadership with white feminism in the American Anti-Slavery Society. The formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association and ethno-racial &quot;lower orders&quot; arguments by Elizabeth Cady Stanton in her weekly &quot;The Revolution&quot; substantiated these fears, to a certain degree, for a number of these men.

Frederick Douglass was one of the black activists who joined the American Anti-Slavery Society shortly after the internal schism and appointment of Garrison as Society President. Douglass was active within the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society between 1841 and 1842. He engaged with the American Anti-Slavery Society lecture circuit beginning 1843. Born into chattel slavery, Douglass escaped and made his way to New Bedford, Boston, and New York. He developed written and verbal skills that resulted in his becoming a prominent spokesman of the abolitionist movement. He endorsed a federal women&#x27;s suffrage resolution at the Seneca Falls Convention as well. During Reconstruction, Douglass retracted support for the inclusion of women in the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, fearing that a female suffrage clause would preclude ratification in several states.

Francis Jackson, grandfather of John Brown&#x27;s raider Francis Jackson Meriam, was a president of the Society.

== Publications ==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Slavery and Abolition in the United States&quot;, Weld held the positions of Manager, 1833–1835, and Corresponding Secretary, 1839–1840. &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot; states that &quot;in 1836 he...was appointed by the American Anti-slavery Society editor of its books and pamphlets.&quot;
* In 1839 the Society published &quot;American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses&quot;, by Theodore D. Weld, his wife Angelina Grimké, and her sister Sarah Grimké. In the book, the Society&#x27;s address is given as 143 Nassau Street, New York. Mail for Theodore Weld could be sent there. This book is the most extensive antislavery book, later becoming inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. In it, Weld writes about the horrors of slavery through graphic descriptions of mistreatment of slaves, including their living conditions, food, and from first-hand accounts. See Treatment of slaves in the United States#American Slavery As It Is (1839).

<text>Thorn Lighting Ltd, a subsidiary of the Zumtobel Group, is a global supplier of both outdoor and indoor luminaires and integrated controls.

Thorn was founded when Sir Jules Thorn started The Electric Lamp Service Company Ltd, in 1928, dealing in incandescent filament lamps. In 1936, renamed Thorn Electrical Industries, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange. Continuous post World War II expansion followed and the organisation seized a variety of lighting, engineering and consumer electronics businesses, merging with EMI in 1979 to create Thorn EMI, which itself demerged in the year 1996.

In 1994, following a leveraged management buy-out, Thorn Lighting Ltd floated on the London Stock Exchange as TLG plc (the Thorn Lighting Group) until it was acquired by Wassall plc four years later. In 2000, Wassall plc was purchased in order to merge TLG with the luminaire business of the Zumtobel Group, an acquisition financed with the assistance of private equity firm KKR who subsequently reduced its position. Thorn is now fully owned by the Zumtobel Group.

==History==
===Birth of the company===
The Thorn brand started life as the Electric Lamp Service Company Limited, established by Jules Thorn on 29 March 1928, importing incandescent filament lamps and radio valves from the continent. Faced with increased import duties, introduced to aid British manufacturing, Jules Thorn bought his first lighting factory, the Atlas Lamp Works Ltd in Edmonton, north London in 1932. In 1936 the company went public as Thorn Electrical Industries.

===1940s and 1950s===
The lamp businesses prospered until 1939 when production was geared to military needs. When war broke out a second lamp site, run by the Vale Royal Electric Lamp Company, was bought in nearby Tottenham in case Edmonton was bombed.

When World War II ended, Jules Thorn continued expansion through investing in new plants, partnerships and acquisitions, including the opening of an incandescent lamp operation in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales in 1947; a technology transfer with Sylvania Electric Products to mass-produce tubular fluorescent lamps in Enfield, north London and taking over 51% of Ekco-Ensign Electric (Ekco) in 1950, which added a further incandescent lamp factory – in Preston, Lancashire.

In 1951, Thorn took over Smart &amp; Brown (Engineers) Ltd&#x27;s luminaire factory at Spennymoor, near Durham. In the mid-1950s specialist incandescent lamp factories were opened in Buckie, Scotland and in Wimbledon, London (the Omega Electric Lamp Works Ltd).

Between 1952 and 1964 Thorn established additional overseas connections, including a controlling interest in an Italian lamp manufacturer (SIVI Illuminazione SpA) and plants in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, followed by agencies in the Middle East and Hong Kong, the latter with Jardine Pacific.

In September 1959 a new London-based headquarters was opened. Thorn House, designed by Sir Basil Spence, was at the time England&#x27;s tallest office block.

===1960s===
In 1964, driven by the need to compete more effectively in world markets, Thorn merged its lighting interests with those of Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) to form British Lighting Industries Ltd, taking a controlling 65% share (the remaining 35% being acquired three years later). AEI Lamp and Lighting brought to the BLI group three significant lighting interests: British Thomson-Houston (BTH) which owned major factories, especially at Melton Road in Rushey Mead, Leicester in the East Midlands of England (producing discharge lamps) and in Hereford, near the Welsh border (making luminaires), and sold lamps under the ‘Mazda’ brand; Metropolitan-Vickers (MV) which drew supplies from the BTH factories, selling them under the &#x27;Metrovick&#x27; brand; and the Edison &amp; Swan Electric Light Company (Ediswan), which had recently transferred its factory at Ponders End and ‘Royal Ediswan’ brand over to BTH.
Within a year of its formation BLI reorganised - consolidating laboratories, factories, and selling functions - to operate under just three main brands: Atlas, Mazda and Ekco (the remaining 49% interest in Ekco-Ensign being secured in 1966). Once complete, in 1969, the BLI name was changed to Thorn Lighting Ltd and subsequently the Ekco and Atlas brand names were replaced by the Thorn name.

Substantial export growth followed, quickly earning a Queen&#x27;s Award for Export Achievement, in 1968, and five years later Romford Export Centre opened, stocking over 10,000 items.

===1970s and 1980s===
By 1976 over 50% of sales were from outside the United Kingdom. 1979 saw Thorn acquire Gebr Kaiser GmbH &amp; Co. Leuchten K.G, a West German manufacturer of lighting fittings, and two years later close the Tottenham lamp factory.

In 1987 the purchase of the Jarnkonst group of Nordic light fitting companies and closure of the Buckie lamp factory signalled a new drive by parent Thorn EMI to trade an export and ‘colonies’ mentality for a multi-cultural, international outlook, one that took account of the forthcoming Single European Act. Gaining critical mass in lighting fixtures – defined as 10% market share in any one county – was identified as a priority.

In 1988 Thorn EMI bought the French group Holophane to gain access to its luminaire subsidiary, Europhane. The Jardine Pacific relationship in Asia was developed into an 18-year joint-venture, and the lighting brands of Sydney based Howard Smith were acquired.

===1990s===
On 14 November 1990, Thorn announced that it had agreed to sell its principal light source interests to GE Lighting of the United States. Under the agreement, GE acquired the lamp plants at Enfield, Leicester and Wimbledon, as well as Thorn&#x27;s 51% in SIVI Illuminazione in Italy and 100% holding in Gluhlampenfabrik Jahn, a small specialist manufacturer in Germany. Thorn subsequently closed its Merthyr Tydfil lamp factory, consolidated its UK distribution centres and sold its South African business. In 1991, Thorn won Management Today&#x27;s Business in Europe Award.

Using Hong Kong as a platform, the company entered Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Japan, while additional offices and agents were established in Eastern Europe. In 1992, placing staff in Jardine offices throughout mainland China secured more projects (at £35m Hong Kong International Airport became, and remains today, Thorn&#x27;s largest ever contract) and laid the groundwork for local manufacturing. The Guangzhou fluorescent fittings factory opened in 1996 and Tianjin followed a year later, making road and tunnel luminaires. That same year, an interest in Thorn India was established. European activities centred on the purchase of Jakobsson in Denmark.

On-going consolidation in the late 1990s saw the closure of the Hereford factory and luminaire production transfer from the Kaiser Leuchten factory to other sites.

===2000s===
The new millennium marked a new beginning as the Zumtobel Group invested heavily in Thorn, particularly in technological innovation, and consolidating the former regionally structured production operations of Zumtobel and Thorn into a single worldwide supply chain. It also sought organic growth in clearly defined regions and market sectors.

In 2006, the Zumtobel Group sold Thorn&#x27;s airfield ground lighting activities (Thorn AFL) to the Swedish airport specialist Safegate, and two years later merged two former luminaire production facilities to form a new plant at Wetherill Park, Sydney.

In 2009, Thorn invested in a new factory, laboratory and training and exhibition complex (the Thorn Academy of Light) in Spennymoor. The Distribution Centre at the former site nearby was retained. The plant was named UK Factory of the Year for 2009. This year also saw Thorn and Hess AG of Germany enter into a long-term sales partnership for outdoor lighting products. Initially, activity centred on Germany, where Hess’ subsidiary, Vulkan, marketed Thorn&#x27;s range, but further agreements were reached in 2011, extending Thorn rights to Hess products in France, East and Southeast Europe, and the UK and Ireland.

<text>The Zumtobel Group is an Austrian company specialising in lighting and headquartered in Dornbirn. Zumtobel engages in the development, production and sales of lighting, luminaires, lighting management and lighting components for indoor and outdoor applications. The company is a European market leader for professional lighting systems and the number two for lighting components in Europe.

The group operates 10 production facilities on three continents as well as sales and partner companies in nearly 90 countries.

Since 2007, the group has presented the Zumtobel Group Award (long name &quot;&quot;) to architects and engineers every two years. The prize was worth 140,000 euros in 2012, 150,000 euros in 2017 and 120,000 euros in 2021.

In the financial year from May 2017 to April 2018, the company recorded a loss of 46.7 million euros due to pricing pressure and currency effects and did not pay out a dividend for this period. Revenue declined by 8 percent and the share of LEDs in revenue increased from 73.6 to 79.6 percent. In 2018/19, the Zumtobel Group significantly reduced the net loss from 46.7 to 15.2 million euros. As a result of uncertainties related to Brexit and price pressure caused by intense competition in the lighting industry, revenue declined by 2.9 percent to 1.162 billion euros. The operating result (EBIT) improved from minus 7.3 million to 2.7 million euros. Profitability also increased compared to the previous year. Group EBIT, adjusted for one-off effects, rose by 8 million euros to 27.6 million euros. Return on sales improved to 2.4 percent. On 25 June 2020 the Zumtobel Group announced the figures for the 2019/20 financial year: net profit for the year rose by 30 million euros to a plus of 14.5 million euros. Adjusted Group EBIT almost doubled to 53.9 million euros despite a slight decline in revenues due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The EBIT margin increased from 2.4 percent to 4.8 percent. In the 2020/21 financial year, the Zumtobel Group recorded a more than 100% increase in net profit to 45.6 million euros, despite a 7.7 percent decline in revenues due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted Group EBIT thus rose by 23.4 percent to 43.4 million euros. In the 2021/22 financial year, Group sales increased to 1,148.3 million euros and EBIT to 60.8 million euros. Net profit was 45.8 million euros.

==History==

Walter Zumtobel (1907–1990) was one of roughly 300 so-called sequestrators in allied-occupied Austria who administered previously German-owned property in Vorarlberg, initially on behalf of the French military government, then based on an administrative law of the Federal Government of Austria. These properties included Michel-Werke in Bregenz and Hard as well as &quot;Werkzeugbau Arbeitsgemeinschaft Lustenau&quot; in Lustenau and &quot;Feinmechanische Werkstätte Josef Maurer&quot; in Wolfurt. He integrated these three formerly German companies into &quot;Elektrogeräte und Kunstharzpresswerk W. Zumtobel KG&quot;, which was founded on 1 January 1950 in Dornbirn, thus laying the foundation for today’s Zumtobel Group.

Initially, the company primarily produced electrical ballasts for fluorescent light fittings. In 1952, the company started to manufacture complete luminaires based on fluorescent light fittings. &quot;Profilux&quot;, a particularly thin batten luminaire introduced to the market in 1953, became a sales success. In 1963, Zumtobel won the first design price for the FER recessed luminaire. In 1959, Walter Zumtobel travelled to the United States for the first time to visit the luminaire manufacturer Day-Brite Lighting, in St. Louis.

In 1959, a light laboratory was established to determine light distribution curves. The German company Staff, still autonomous as Staff &amp; Schwarz Leuchtenwerke (founded in 1945), introduced the first voltage track system Lite-Trac in 1967. From 1956 to 1979, the company was a licensee of Lichttechnischen Spezialfabrik Dr. Ing. Schneider &amp; Co. In 1976, Zumtobel received the National Award, which entitles companies to use the national coat of arms in business dealings. In the same year, the group became a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft).

In 1976, the company acquired a minority stake in the British company Tridonic Ltd. The remaining shares were acquired in 1983. Based on a purchase agreement of 2 March 1979, the factory of Dr. Ing. Schneider &amp; Co. in Usingen was integrated into the company; on 28 March 1979, a contract was concluded to also transfer the operating business.

In 1991, the company was restructured and two divisions were established: Lighting Solutions (then Zumtobel Licht) and Lighting Components (then Tridonic-Bauelemente). In 1993, Zumtobel acquired a majority stake in the German Staff Group in Lemgo; the remaining shares were taken over in 1994. In 2000, the British company &quot;Wassall plc&quot; was acquired with the assistance of the American equity capital partner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR), and the Thorn Lighting Group was merged with Zumtobel’s luminaire business; the components business of Thorn was transferred to the Tridonic Division.

Since 2005, the LED-activities have been further developed. Lexedis Lighting in Jennersdorf was founded as a joint venture for high-performance LED light sources of Tridonic Optoelectronic (a joint venture of Tridonic and Lumitech, a spin-off of the Graz University of Technology) and Toyoda Gosei. LEDON Lamp GmbH (Dornbirn) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Zumtobel Group for LED applications.

In May 2006, the Zumtobel Group went public on the Vienna Stock Exchange. In September 2006, the Zumtobel share was admitted to the ATX. KKR sold its remaining share of 5.5 percent after the initial public offering to an institutional investor in an off-exchange transaction in December 2006. This investor was apparently Delta Lloyd Asset Management NV. In any case, Zumtobel announced in a mandatory disclosure regarding the shareholder structure on 11 May 2011 that Aviva plc was no longer a shareholder of Zumtobel after its majority investment in Delta Lloyd had been terminated. At the time, Delta Lloyd held 6.778 percent of the 43.5 million shares; a few days later, Fidelity held 9.99 percent.

In 2009, the LED start-ups were combined into a separate division (LEDON brand). In 2013, LEDON was sold to the Austrian entrepreneur Thomas Lorünser with a retroactive effect from 1 November 2012. With effect from 24 September 2012, the Zumtobel share was removed from the ATX and has since been traded on the Prime Market.

In the past years, the Zumtobel Group executed projects such as the lighting of the BMW-plants in Berlin and Leipzig as well as of the Airbus plant in Bremen and the new headquarters of the pharmaceutical group Boehringer Ingelheim. In addition, the expansion of Beijing International Airport in China as well as parts of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, the Bolte Bridge in Melbourne, Australia and the Cathedrale la Seu in Mallorca, Spain have been equipped with innovative lighting solutions. Other showcase projects of the Zumtobel Group include the Skylink terminal at Vienna Airport, with a contract volume of 10 million euros, the lighting of football stadiums such as the Allianz Arena, Munich and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as well as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the James Simon Gallery in Berlin, which was designed by David Chipperfield, or the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg.
In November 2017, the long-time managing director Jürg Zumtobel was awarded the &quot;Ehrenpreis der Vorarlberger Wirtschaft für das unternehmerische Lebenswerk&quot; (&quot;Vorarlberg business award for lifetime achievements&quot;). Alfred Felder has been CEO since 6 June 2018; Thomas Tschol took over the function of CFO as of 1 April 2018; Bernard Motzko has been COO since 1 February 2018. On 1 August 2021, Thomas Erath was appointed CFO of the Zumtobel Group. In May 2020, Karin Zumtobel-Chammah was elected chairwoman of the supervisory board. After holding several senior management positions in the finance sector, she joined the Zumtobel Group in 1996. Zumtobel-Chammah headed the arts and culture department prior to joining the board in 2019.

In September 2018, the Zumtobel Group added a new group-wide luminaire and component production facility in Niš, Serbia, to its global production network, investing 30.6 million euros. The production site covering 40,000 square metres enables the Zumtobel Group to react more flexibly to changed market requirements and to strengthen its presence in these emerging markets.

In 2019, the Zumtobel Group opened a group-wide software center in Porto, Portugal. The new technology and innovation centre in Porto, headed by João Granjo Lopes, develops software for smart light management and control systems. It also focuses on research in areas such as smart buildings and smart cities, aiming to develop integrated lighting solutions for smart energy, mobility and IoT technologies. The group-wide software centre represents an addition to the existing research and development network of the Zumtobel Group.

In November 2020, the Zumtobel Group opened the new light forum at its main location in Dornbirn. For this purpose, the company&#x27;s old factory hall in Höchsterstraße was refurbished within a year into a 4,000-square-metre presentation area, where lighting innovations can be experienced. To date, 8 million euros were invested in the new Light Forum. The design concept, developed in cooperation with the Innsbruck studio of the Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta, created space for a world of light that customers can experience with all their senses. At the same time, the Zumtobel Group celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2020.

The company is researching more efficient lighting and light management to use lighting systems only when needed. In 2019, the European Investment Bank approved loans to broaden the company’s research into connecting lighting to digital services.

==Company structure==
The group consists of two divisions: the Zumtobel Lighting Division for the lighting business with the Zumtobel and Thorn brands, and the Tridonic Division for the components business.
The Zumtobel family holds approximately 36 percent of the shares in the company. The remaining shares are largely held by institutional investors.

== Artistic annual report ==
Ever since 1991, the Zumtobel Group has invited figures from the fields of architecture, graphic design and art to present their take on the subject of light and the development of the company. In this task, the artists are given freedom in terms of design, unhampered by any corporate design considerations. The outcome, year after year, is a series of unconventional unique printed works. In addition to graphic designers like Italo Lupi, Neville Brody, Per Arnoldi and Stefan Sagmeister, with whom the artistic design began, artists including Gerhard Merz, Siegrun Appelt, Olafur Eliasson, Anish Kapoor and James Turrell as well as architects like Dominique Perrault, Hani Rashid / Asymptote, François Roche / Studio R&amp;Sie(n), Sejima Kazuyo and Ryue Nishizawa / SANAA, David Chipperfield / DCA, Kjetil Thorsen / Snøhetta, Elizabeth Diller / Scofidio and Renfro and Yung Ho Chang / Atelier FCJZ have been commissioned to design the Artistic Annual Report. The edition 2019/20 was designed by architect and consulting engineer Professor Werner Sobek. The 2020/21 edition was created by Dutch architect Iwan Baan in interdisciplinary collaboration with Berlin-based architect Francis Kéré. The report presents the role of natural light in the vernacular architecture of Burkina Faso, Africa, capturing the strong contrasts between the blinding sunlight outside the buildings and the complete darkness inside. The Artistic Annual Report 2021/22 was designed by Ben van Berkel, UNStudio, and used transformation as a central theme in architecture and the built environment.

<text>Thomas Gallaudet (June 3, 1822 – August 27, 1902), an American Episcopal priest, was born in Hartford, Connecticut. His father, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, was the renowned pioneer of deaf education in the United States. His mother, Sophia Fowler Gallaudet, who was deaf, was the founding matron of the school that became Gallaudet University. His brother, Edward Miner Gallaudet, was founder and President of the university.

== Biography ==
After graduating from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, Gallaudet accepted a teaching position at the New York Institution for Deaf-mutes, where he met and married a deaf woman, Elizabeth Budd. They had seven children, one of whom died in infancy, named Laurent Clerc Gallaudet. He was most certainly named after the man his father brought back from France to help start his deaf-mute school, Laurent Clerc.

Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, in 1852, Gallaudet established St. Ann&#x27;s Church for Deaf Mutes in New York City.

In 1872 Gallaudet, Jane Middleton, and the Church Mission to Deaf-Mutes established the Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes in a brownstone located at 220 East 13th Street in New York City. Jane served as the first Superintendent and Matron of the home from 1872 until her death in 1885.

In 1886, after years of hard work and fund raising, the Home was moved to Poughkeepsie and was renamed the Gallaudet Home for Deaf-Mutes.

Gallaudet was also instrumental in the work of the Sisterhood of the Good Shepherd, a group of women engaged in urban ministry in and around New York City.

One of Gallaudet&#x27;s students, Henry Winter Syle, became the first deaf person to be ordained by the Episcopal Church. Both Gallaudet and Syle are listed in the Episcopal Church&#x27;s Calendar of Saints for August 27.

Gallaudet is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

<doc id="364541" wikidata="Q554843" url="?curid=364541" title="Ernest Saves Christmas">
<text>Ernest Saves Christmas is a 1988 American Christmas comedy film directed by John Cherry from a screenplay by B. Kline and Ed Turner. It stars Jim Varney, Oliver Clark, Noelle Parker and Douglas Seale. It is the third film to feature the character Ernest P. Worrell and the second film in the &quot;Ernest&quot; series, after &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot; (1987). The film chronicles Ernest&#x27;s attempt to help find a replacement for an aging Santa Claus.

It was released on November 11, 1988. It grossed $28.2 million, making it the highest grossing film in the &quot;Ernest&quot; series. The next film in the series, &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot;, was released in April 1990.

==Plot==
A man claiming to be Santa Claus arrives in Orlando, Florida, where Ernest P. Worrell works as a taxicab driver. Santa informs Ernest that he is on his way to tell a local celebrity named Joe Carruthers that he has been chosen to be the new Santa Claus. Joe used to host a popular children&#x27;s program that emphasized manners and integrity.

During their drive, a runaway teenage girl named Harmony Starr joins Ernest and Santa in the taxi. Upon reaching their destination, Santa realizes he has no real money and only possesses play money. Ernest lets him ride for free, resulting in Ernest losing his job. Ernest later discovers that Santa left his magic sack in the taxi and decides to find Santa and return it to him.

Santa tries to talk to Joe at the Orlando Children&#x27;s Museum but is interrupted and dismissed by Joe&#x27;s rude agent, Marty Brock. Santa becomes worried when he discovers his sack is missing and feels discouraged due to his increasing forgetfulness at the age of 151. Marty refuses to believe Santa&#x27;s predicament and has him arrested.

To help Santa escape from jail, Ernest pretends to be an employee of the governor, and Harmony poses as the governor&#x27;s niece. They convince the police chief to transfer Santa to a mental hospital. Santa explains to Ernest and Harmony that he became Santa Claus in 1889 and has enjoyed the role, but the magic weakens over time. To restore its full strength, he must pass the job on to someone else, which is why he needs to find Joe and make him the new Santa Claus before 7:00 PM.

Ernest disguises himself as a snake rancher to sneak Santa into a movie studio. Marty pressures Joe to abandon his focus on teaching goodness to children and instead take a role in a horror film called &quot;Christmas Slay&quot;, which deeply offends Santa. Santa punches the director in response.

Meanwhile, two holding dock workers receive crates marked for release to &quot;Helper Elves&quot;. The workers argue over the shipping papers and the crates&#x27; contents, which are revealed to contain flying reindeer. They seek help from animal control, but the reindeer amaze them by walking on the warehouse ceiling.

Santa finally tracks down Joe at his home and explains the importance of passing on the Santa Claus position. Joe initially declines but later changes his mind when he refuses to use foul language in front of the children on the film set. Ernest and Harmony discover the magic of Santa&#x27;s sack, but Harmony, whose real name is Pamela Trenton, abuses it. She steals the sack but eventually returns it after her conscience prevails.

On Christmas Eve, Ernest and the helpers meet Santa&#x27;s elves at the airport, retrieve the reindeer and sleigh, and fly to the children&#x27;s museum. Although Ernest initially struggles to control the sleigh, they eventually make it to the museum. Joe witnesses the flying reindeer and sleigh, confirming Santa&#x27;s claims. Joe turns down the acting job and decides to become the new Santa Claus.

Joe uses his magic to make it snow in Orlando. Ernest and the helpers arrive just in time, and Pamela decides to go home after calling her mother. Joe chooses Pamela as his special helper and promises to take her home after their journey. Ernest becomes the sleigh driver for the night. Santa resumes his identity as Seth Applegate and spends Christmas Eve with a museum employee named Mary Morrissey.

At 7:00 PM, Joe takes off to deliver gifts. Later two dock workers receive a crate marked &quot;E. Bunny&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
This was the first major feature production filmed almost entirely in Orlando, Florida, at the then-unfinished Disney-MGM Studios. Exterior scenes set at the house of Ernest&#x27;s friend Vern were filmed at a house located on Residential Street at the park, and which was part of the Studio Backlot Tour until it was demolished in 2002.

The remainder of the scenes were filmed in various locations in the greater Orlando area, including Orlando International Airport, Epcot Center Drive, Lake Eola, Church Street Station and Orange Avenue in Downtown Orlando, a toll booth on the Bee Line Expressway (now known as the &quot;Beachline Expressway&quot;), the original Orlando Science Center which is now the John and Rita Lowndes Shakespeare Center (used as the &quot;Orlando Children&#x27;s Museum&quot; in the film), and the Orlando AMTRAK station.

The Lake Mary studios of then-Fox affiliate WOFL-TV (channel 35, which is now owned by Fox itself) were used for the &quot;Christmas Slay&quot; film scenes, as the station already had a promotional relationship with Jim Varney and the Ernest character. Other smaller scenes were filmed in Nashville.

==Release==
&quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution on November 11, 1988. It is the second film in the &quot;Ernest&quot; series, and the second in a four-film deal with Touchstone Pictures.

==Reception==
===Critical response=== 
The film received poor reviews.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot; placed second at the box office behind &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; and grossed $5.7 million from 1,634 theaters. Its domestic total was $28.2 million, making it the highest grossing &quot;Ernest&quot; film.

==Home media==
The DVD was released on September 3, 2002, from Touchstone Home Entertainment.

<text>The Welsummer or Welsumer is a Dutch breed of domestic chicken. It originates in the small village of Welsum, in the eastern Netherlands. It was bred at the beginning of the twentieth century from local fowls of mixed origin: Rhode Island Reds, Barnevelders, Partridge Leghorns, Cochins, and Wyandottes. In 1922–23, steps were taken to fix a standard after the birds began to show a good deal of uniformity. The eggs were originally exported for the commercial egg trade. Some stock was exported to the United Kingdom, and the breed was added to the British Standard in 1930.

In 2001, a number of farms culled their flocks in connection with the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.

== Characteristics ==

Three plumage colours are listed for the Welsumer by the Entente Européenne d’Aviculture et de Cuniculture, of which only one, Red Partridge, is recognised in the Netherlands.

== Use ==

Welsumer hens lay about 160 eggs per year; the eggs are dark brown and weigh about . Bantam Welsumers lay about 180 dark brown eggs per year, with an average weight of

<doc id="364550" wikidata="Q362553" url="?curid=364550" title="Fort Niagara">
<text>Fort Niagara, also known as Old Fort Niagara, is a fortification originally built by New France to protect its interests in North America, specifically control of access between the Niagara River and Lake Ontario, the easternmost of the Great Lakes. The fort is on the river&#x27;s eastern bank at its mouth on Lake Ontario. Youngstown, New York, later developed nearby.

The British took over the fort in 1759 during the French and Indian War. Although the United States ostensibly was ceded the fort after it gained independence in the American Revolutionary War, the British stayed until 1796. Transfer to the U.S. came after signing of the Jay Treaty that reaffirmed and implemented the legal border with British Canada. Although the US Army deactivated the fort in 1963, the Coast Guard continues to have a presence. A non-profit group operates the fort and grounds as a state park and preserves it in part as a museum and site for historical re-enactments. It is also a venue for special events related to the region&#x27;s history.

==Origin==
René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, built the first fortified structure, called Fort Conti, in 1678. In 1687, the Governor of New France, the Marquis de Denonville, replaced it with a new fort. He named it Fort Denonville and posted a hundred men as a garrison under the command of Capt. Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes. The winter weather and disease was severe, and all but twelve died by the time a relief force returned from Montreal. The government decided in September 1688 to abandon the post and had the stockade pulled down.

Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire was dispatched to the Seneca people, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois League, to obtain permission to build a French post on the banks of the river. He spoke to several chiefs in 1720, explaining his pleasure was always great when he visited them but that he would do it more spontaneously if he had a dwelling place. Considering that he was of the tribe since his turbulent captivity and his &quot;adoption&quot;, the chiefs agreed he had the right to build a dwelling where they chose. Joncaire and eight men dispatched from Fort Frontenac built a trading post, called &quot;Magasin Royal&quot; or &quot;Maison de la Paix&quot; (Royal Store or House of Peace) on the right bank of the river (going downstream). The name was intended to emphasize the French peaceful intent, to exchange goods for furs here.
In 1726, French engineer Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry built a two-story &quot;Maison à Machicoulis&quot; or &quot;Machicolated House&quot; on the site to replace the old fort. In 1755 the French expanded the fort to its present size in response to the armed confrontation that started between French and British colonial interests as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe. In North America, British colonists called this the French and Indian War; both sides cultivated Native American allies.

The name used today, &quot;The French Castle&quot;, was not used until the 19th century.

==British and American control==

The fort was a strategic site in the French and Indian War. It fell to the British after they conducted a nineteen-day siege in July 1759, which was called the Battle of Fort Niagara. The French relief force sent to relieve the besieged garrison was ambushed at the Battle of La Belle-Famille. The post&#x27;s commander, Pierre Pouchot, surrendered the fort to the British commander, Sir William Johnson, who initially led the New York Militia. The Irish-born Johnson became the expedition&#x27;s leader after General John Prideaux literally lost his head; he stepped in front of a mortar being test-fired during the siege. The British controlled the fort for the next thirty-seven years before they handed it over to the Americans after the Revolutionary War.

Fort Niagara served as the Loyalist base in New York during the American Revolutionary War for Colonel John Butler and his Butler&#x27;s Rangers, a provincial military unit. Lt. Col. William Stacy, a high-ranking officer of the Continental Army, was captured by Butler&#x27;s Rangers in their attack on Cherry Valley, New York. He was held captive at Fort Niagara during the summer of 1779. Niagara became notorious for drinking, brawling, whoring, and cheating. Crude taverns, stores, and bordellos sprouted on &quot;the Bottom&quot;, the riverside flat below the fort.

Though the British ceded Fort Niagara to the United States after the Treaty of Paris ended the American War of Independence in 1783, the region remained effectively under British control for thirteen years. Only after signing of the Jay Treaty did American forces occupy the fort in 1796. In the interim, United Empire Loyalists fleeing persecution in the new US were given land grants, typically per inhabitant in Upper Canada, and some were partly sustained in the early years by aid from the fort&#x27;s military stores. 

During the War of 1812, the fort&#x27;s guns sank the Provincial Marine schooner &quot;Seneca&quot; on November 21, 1812. British forces captured the fort on the night of December 19, 1813, in retaliation for the Americans&#x27; burning of Niagara, formerly called Newark, nine days earlier. Newark had been renamed Niagara in 1796. The British held the fort until they relinquished it under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent. It has remained in US custody ever since.

Nine currently active battalions of the Regular Army (4-1 FA, 1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf and 3-4 Inf) are derived from American units (Leonard&#x27;s Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, and the old 14th, 19th and 22nd Infantry Regiments) that were at Fort Niagara during the War of 1812. 52 (Niagara) Battery Royal Artillery (Holcroft&#x27;s Company, 4th Battalion Royal Artillery), Royal Scots and a number of other British units that fought at the Capture of Fort Niagara still exist today. A number of other units that served in the Fort in the War of 1812 (such as 20 Battery Royal Artillery (Caddy&#x27;s Company, 4th Battalion Royal Artillery)) also endure.

==Later use==
The name &quot;Old Fort Niagara&quot; is associated with the fort today; it does not refer to its age but to distinguish the colonial-era fortress from its more modern namesake. In the post-Civil War era, the &quot;New Fort Niagara&quot; was built outside the original walls of the fort. The military abandoned the use of masonry forts in this era, having found that masonry fared poorly under bombardment. They built the new fort in the newer style of a military camp. 

The new Fort Niagara had a 1,000-yard rifle range, access to rail lines, and access to the industrial areas of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, New York. Fort Niagara trained troops for the Spanish–American War. The United States was preparing for entry into World War I in June 1917, so the post began an officer training school which included Daniel W. Hand and Charles W. Ryder as instructors.

During World War II, Fort Niagara was an induction center before it became a prisoner of war camp for 1,200 German soldiers captured in the North African Campaign. After the war, the fort provided temporary housing for returning veterans.
During the Korean War, the fort was a headquarters for anti-aircraft artillery and later Nike missiles. The Niagara Falls Defense Area originally formed the northern half of the U.S. Army Anti-Aircraft Command defenses in western New York State. After the amalgamation of the Niagara Falls and Buffalo Defense Areas, the Army Air Defense Command Post moved to Lockport Air Force Station in Cambria, New York. 

Formations directing US defenses included the 2nd Artillery Group (Air Defense), which had its headquarters at Fort Niagara from March 1958 to December 1961, superseded by the 31st Artillery Brigade (Air Defense), 101st Artillery Group, and 18th Artillery Group. The only battalion in the region was the 44th Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion, superseded by the 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment on September 1, 1958.

The U.S. Army officially deactivated Fort Niagara in 1963. The 1/4 ADA moved to the Seattle Defense Area, where it was active from September 1972 to April 1974. Military presence on the site continues with the United States Coast Guard operating at &quot;The Bottoms&quot;. Fort Niagara is considered one of the longest continuously run military bases within the boundaries of the United States, from French control in 1726 to the present day.

A formal operating license between Old Fort Niagara Association and the U.S. War Department in 1931 established rights of the non-profit to preserve and operate the fort. In 1949, Congress transferred Father Millet Cross National Monument to the State of New York, now a small memorial at Fort Niagara. In 1960, the fort was among the first sites to be designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of Interior&#x27;s National Park Service.

==Today==


The renovated Fort Niagara now serves as Fort Niagara State Park and museum. It is often the site of historical reenactments of 18th-century battles that took place here. It is also a venue for period dances, fundraisers, and other special events (such as public displays, and shows relating to the history of the fort and the surrounding area). Fort Niagara is also designated as a State Historic Site, known as Old Fort Niagara State Historic Site.

Fort Niagara was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 9, 1960, as &quot;Old Fort Niagara&quot;. The Colonial Niagara Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It is a major contributing element to the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area.

==Haunting legend==
Some believe the site is haunted by a headless French soldier who was beheaded during a duel. It is said he wanders the grounds looking for his head.

<doc id="364553" wikidata="Q3221902" url="?curid=364553" title="Donald's Cousin Gus">
<text>Donald&#x27;s Cousin Gus is a Walt Disney cartoon released on May 19, 1939. Gus Goose debuted as a recurring character in Al Taliaferro&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot; newspaper comic since 9 May 1938.

This cartoon was also the first-ever pre-recorded program (in this case, film) to be televised in the United States, airing as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;first night&quot; of sponsored programming on May 3, 1939, sixteen days before the film was released in theaters.

The short was directed by Jack King, and animated by Lee Morehouse, Wolfgang Reitherman, and Don Towsley. The story was created by Jack Hannah and Carl Barks.

==Plot==
Gus Goose comes to visit his cousin Donald Duck, interrupting him in the middle of lunch. Gus brings a note from Aunt Fanny, which reads, &quot;Dear Nephew, this is your cousin Gus Goose. I&#x27;m sending him to visit you ― Love, Aunt Fanny. P.S., He don&#x27;t eat much&quot;. Donald welcomes his cousin, who shakes hands with him frantically.

Gus shows Donald Duck his pocket alarm clock, which is divided into, &quot;Dinner, tea, supper, lunch.&quot; Donald remarks to the audience, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll be doggone!&quot; Gus Goose proceeds to eat Donald out of house and home. He slurps up Donald&#x27;s soup with two spoons, eats a corn on the cob like a typewriter, shuffles a whole stack of bread and luncheon meat like cards and swallows them all, knits a bowl of spaghetti into a sock, and slurps it all up. Donald Duck is amused at first, but when Gus steals a loaf of bread from him and dips it into his coffee, eats an entire chocolate cake, steals all of his donuts with his umbrella, and sucks up all of the peas with a straw, Donald gets fed up. Enraged, Donald tries to evict Gus by handcart, but ends up out on the lawn himself.

Hoping to get the jump on Gus, Donald finds a &quot;barking hotdog&quot; in his icebox, with the label, &quot;A sure way to get rid of hungry relatives.&quot; Smirking, Donald offers the hotdog to Gus, who gulps it down. Donald starts acting like a cat, stirring up the &quot;dog&quot; in Gus&#x27; stomach. Donald then makes Gus lie down and roll over like a dog. Having driven Gus away by throwing a bone out onto the lawn, he bolts and locks the door with a drawbar, laughing. However, his joy turns to shock when he hears Gus come back in through the back door, and discovers a Gus-shaped hole, and discovers him eating cold lunch in his refrigerator, with the time, &quot;Cold Lunch&quot; on his pocket alarm clock. Donald Duck, shocked, exclaims, &quot;Boy! Oh, boy!&quot; and faints on the floor.

==Voice cast==

* Gus Goose: Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects)

==Legacy==
===Film===
* Gus Goose also made non-speaking cameo appearances in both &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

===Television===
* Gus Goose made no appearances in &quot;DuckTales&quot;, but there is a background character in the series, Vacation Van Honk, who looks similar to him.
* Gus Goose appeared in the 2000s animated series &quot;Disney&#x27;s House of Mouse&quot;, as the club&#x27;s gluttonous chef, speaking only in honks rather than words.
* The friend and neighbor Gustav Goose from &quot;Quack Pack&quot; is probably not the same as Cousin Gus since there are very few similarities (aside from the name and general size of the character).
* Gus Goose also appears in the 2016 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; Christmas special &quot;Duck the Halls&quot;.

===Comics===
* Gus Goose appears in the Disney comics, usually shown living as a farmhand on Grandma Duck&#x27;s farm outside of Duckburg. Along with his gluttony, Gus is quite lazy, often doing little if any work on Grandma&#x27;s farm. He also has a tendency of falling asleep at random occasions, sometimes even standing up. On occasion Gus has even shown signs of ingenuity as to finding methods or solutions to make his chores much easier for him and at times even automating them so he does not have to work at all.
* Some confusion is also caused by the German comicbook version of Gladstone Gander being referred to as &quot;Gustav Gans&quot; (&quot;Gustav Goose&quot;).
* In Danish comic book stories, Gus Goose has appeared as the boyfriend of a classy and rich anthropomorphic swan named Cissy Swann. In Italy, a nephew of him named Pepper appeared in two stories.

<doc id="364568" wikidata="Q324344" url="?curid=364568" title="Battle of Roliça">
<text>At the Battle of Roliça (17 August 1808), the first battle fought by the British army during the Peninsular War, an Anglo-Portuguese army under Sir Arthur Wellesley defeated an outnumbered Imperial French division under General of Division Henri François Delaborde, near the village of Roliça in Portugal. The French retired in good order.

==Background==
British intervention on the Iberian Peninsula started with the Battle of Roliça.

In the months after occupying Portugal, Napoleon attempted the conquest and control of Spain. He met much resistance but it was disorganised even when it was effective. By the end of July the Spanish had met the French a dozen times, winning, or at least not losing, at seven of those meetings. Their most spectacular victory was in southern Spain on 23 July 1808, when General Castaños surrounded and forced 18,000 French under General Dupont to surrender at Baylen. On 30 July 1808, the French division of General Loison massacred the population, men, women, and children, of Évora. Both of these events were to have an effect on the future of each nation&#x27;s relationships with British troops.

On the same day, Wellesley received a letter from Viscount Castlereagh, the Secretary of War, that informed him that General Junot&#x27;s forces numbered more than 25,000. Castlereagh forwarded his plans to augment the British Army in Portugal by another 15,000 men. General Sir John Moore was to arrive with an army from Sweden, and another force would be forwarded from Gibraltar. The command of this larger force would pass to Sir Hew Dalrymple (the Governor of Gibraltar, a 60-year-old general who had seen active service only in a failed campaign in Flanders in 1793–1794). Dalrymple would be seconded by Sir Harry Burrard, attended by five other generals, all senior to Wellesley (Dalrymple, Burrard, Moore, Hope, Fraser, and Lord Paget). The ambitious General Wellesley hoped to make something happen during the time he still commanded the army in Portugal. 

On 30 July 1808, General Wellesley remet Admiral Cotton&#x27;s convoy with Wellesley&#x27;s troops at Mondego bay. Wellesley chose this as his landing point because students from Coimbra University had seized the fort making this a safer landing than any place nearer Lisbon. The disembarking of Wellesley&#x27;s original 16,000 troops and supplies with the 6,000 they met off Portugal lasted from 1 to 8 August. Some landing craft capsized in the rough surf making the first British casualties in the Peninsula victims of drowning. 

The army marched off on the 10th on the hot and sandy march to Leiria. Wellesley arrived on the 11th and soon argued with General Bernardim Freire de Andrade, the commander of 6,000 Portuguese troops, about supplies and the best route to Lisbon. The result had Wellesley taking his preferred route, close to the sea and his supplies, with 1,700 of the Portuguese under the command of Colonel Nicholas Trant, a British officer in service with the Portuguese Army. 

The army then began its march toward Lisbon following a force of the French army. The French were under the command of General Delaborde. These troops had been sent by Junot to harass and hold the British while he brought his larger army into position to oppose the Anglo-Portuguese forces. 

By 14 August the British reached Alcobaça and moved on to Óbidos. Here the British vanguard, consisting of riflemen from 5th/60th and 95th Rifles, met pickets and the rearguard of the French forces. The 4,000 French were outnumbered approximately four to one.

== Composition of forces ==

=== British ===
The Anglo-Portuguese were formed in six brigades under Major General Hill, Major General Ferguson, Brigadier General Nightingall, Brigadier General Bowes, Brigadier General Catlin Craufurd, and Brigadier General Fane with the Portuguese under Trant. Trant with the Portuguese and 50 cavalry formed the right and were to turn the French left. Fergusson and Bowes with three companies of riflemen and some light artillery were to force the French right and hold against the possible arrival of French troops under Loison. Hill, Nightingall, Craufurd, Fane with the remaining Portuguese, and the rest of the guns and cavalry were to push the centre. British forces involved in the battle included:

* Artillery, commanded by Colonel Robe
** 6 Artillery Guns detached to Left division
** 12 Artillery Guns detached to Centre Division
* Left Division, commanded by General Ferguson
** Ferguson&#x27;s Brigade – 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot, 1/40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot, and 1/71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot
** Bowes Brigade – 1/6th (1st Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot and 1/32nd (Cornwall) Regiment of Foot
* Centre Division
**20th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (detachment), 6th (Bragança) Portuguese Cavalry, 12th (Miranda) Portuguese Cavalry, and 6th (Oporto) Portuguese Caçadores (in reserve) – Brigade taken from Portuguese 3rd (Northern) Division
** Fane&#x27;s Brigade – 5/60th (Royal American) Regiment and 2/95th Rifles (on the left)
** Nightingale&#x27;s Brigade – 29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot and 82nd Regiment of Foot (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers) (in the centre)
** Hill&#x27;s Brigade – 5th Regiment of Foot (Northumberland Fusiliers), 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, and 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot (on the right)
** Caitlin Craufurd&#x27;s Brigade – 45th (Nottinghamshire) (Sherwood Foresters) Regiment of Foot, 50th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot, and 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (in reserve)
* Right Division, commanded by Colonel Trant
**20th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (detachment), 11th (Almeida) Portuguese Cavalry Regiment (50 men, from 2nd (Central) Division), 12th (Chaves) Portuguese Infantry Regiment, 21st (Valenca) Portuguese Infantry Regiment, and 24th (Braganca) Portuguese Infantry Regiment – Brigade taken from the 3rd (Northern) Division

=== French ===
The French forces under Delaborde consisted of five battalions, including one Swiss, and five guns. The small French/Swiss force included:

* 70éme Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne (2 Battalions)
* 4éme Régiment Suisse d&#x27;Infanterie (1 Battalion)
* 2éme Régiment Légère (1 Battalion)
* 4éme Régiment Légère (1 Battalion)
* 26éme Bataillon de Chasseurs

==Battlefield==
The village of Roliça is located in the centre of a horseshoe shape of steep hills approximately one mile wide and two deep. The open end opens north-northeast toward Óbidos where the 5/60th and 95th had met the French the day before. The hills around Óbidos and Roliça were well wooded. 

The French began the day to the north of Roliça backed up to the higher ground allowing them to block or protect the roads south toward Lisbon. On the hill about one mile to the south of the village where the French first fell back, there were four defiles, or gullies leading into the new French position. The field below these hills were grassy, but boulders and the steep sides to the gullies made attack in formation impossible. In the first stages of the battle, Delaborde pulled his troops back to the top of the hill. 

==Battle==

Wellesley arrived at Óbidos on 16 August and moved toward Roliça on the following day. At the beginning of the battle, Delaborde occupied a position to the north-northwest of the village of Roliça. Wellesley attempted to manoeuvre his forces into a double envelopment, moving to each flank of the French position with his main force organised into three fighting columns of brigades. This could be attempted since the Anglo-Portuguese army outnumbered the French forces present by over 3 to 1. 

He sent Trant to the west, and a stronger force under Fergusson and Bowes with six guns to the east, while he distracted the French with a show of force and noise in the centre. Wellesley tried the manoeuvre twice starting at 9:00 a.m., but the French commander spotted this in time and fell back each. At this time the French final position was to the south and east of the village at the top of a steep hill that was littered with sharp rocks and the only way up was using narrow gullies.

Colonel Lake of the 29th Regiment of Foot in the centre then made the mistake of dashing up a gully toward the French position. He arrived behind Delaborde, which cost Lake his life and most of the men in the 29th. This prompted a general attack in relief by the outnumbering British. The fight was rough and uphill with Delaborde hoping for support to arrive from Loison. He repulsed three assaults by the British until nearly 4:00 p.m. At this time Wellesley ordered a general advance to support the 29th &amp; 9th Regiments of Foot. They swarmed up the rock face using their superior numbers to reach the French positions at the top of the hill and Ferguson arrived over the hills to the east.

Delaborde began to withdraw in good order with effective aid from his cavalry until his army&#x27;s discipline broke and his army ran. Without British cavalry to press the pursuit, they successfully withdrew to Montachique near Torres Vedras. 

==Results==
The Anglo-Portuguese won with 487 casualties, over half that number from the precipitate 29th. The French lost 700 men and three of their five guns. Delaborde himself was wounded. The following day Wellesley found that the 4,000 additional British troops had arrived from England and were off the coast. He marched his men to cover their disembarkation rather than follow Delaborde.

==Aftermath==
The British intervention proceeded with the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August 1808.

<text>The Cessna 208 Caravan is a utility aircraft produced by Cessna.

The project was commenced on November 20, 1981, and the prototype first flew on December 9, 1982.
The production model was certified by the FAA in October 1984 and its Cargomaster freighter variant was developed for FedEx.
The longer 208B Super Cargomaster first flew in 1986 and was developed into the passenger 208B Grand Caravan.
The strutted, high wing 208 typically seats nine passengers in its unpressurized cabin, is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A tractor turboprop and has a fixed tricycle landing gear, floats, or skis.
By 2022, 3,000 had been delivered and 24 million flight hours have been logged. Caravans have been used for flight training, commuter airlines, VIP transport, air cargo, skydiving and humanitarian missions.

== Development ==
On November 20, 1981, the project was given a go-ahead by Cessna for its Pawnee engineering facility. John Berwick, chief engineer at Pawnee, conceived of a single engine, high-wing airplane with a large payload. Berwick had originally approached Vice President Bill Boettger with the idea and once Dwane Wallace approved it, Berwick told Russ Meyer he would design it.

The prototype first flew on December 9, 1982. The production model was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 1984.

Deliveries began in 1985, and amphibious floats were approved that same year. A freighter variant without cabin windows was developed at the request of Federal Express as the Cargomaster. FedEx had been initially planning to build twin-engine piston-powered airplanes with Piper Aircraft, but picked the Caravan after surveying it and having flown the prototype, becoming its standard carrier.

Another cargo variant for Federal Express, with a longer fuselage and a cargo pod under the belly, was developed as the 208B Super Cargomaster and flew for the first time in 1986. Stretched by , it received its FAA type certification also in 1986.
A passenger model, the 208B Grand Caravan, was derived from the Super Cargomaster.
It was first delivered in 1990.

Since then, the Caravan has undergone a number of design evolutions, including upgrading the avionics in 2008 to provide a glass cockpit with the Garmin G1000 system. In January 2013 a higher-powered (867 shp from P&amp;WC PT6A-140) version, the Grand Caravan EX, received FAA certification.

In August 2016, Textron announced that it would move the Cessna 208 production line from its Wichita headquarters to its Independence, Kansas, production facility, for manufacture alongside the piston-powered 172, 182, 206 and TTx, and the Citation M2 light jet. The move was made to make room for production of the Citation Longitude and Denali in Wichita.
In 2023, the 208 Caravan unit cost was US$2.32 million and US$2.61 million for the 208B Grand Caravan EX.

=== Chinese production ===
In May 2012, Cessna announced that an assembly line for the 208 would be established in China, with the government-owned China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) conducting final assembly of Caravans at its plant in Shijiazhuang for the Chinese market. Chinese government approval was granted in September the following year and the first Chinese-assembled Caravan was delivered in December 2013. By April 2016 about 30 aircraft, assembled from kits of parts shipped from the US by Cessna, had been delivered to Chinese operators by the joint venture.

== Design ==

The Cessna 208 is a high-wing braced cabin monoplane powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop in tractor configuration. The cabin has room for nine passengers and two crew when used as a passenger aircraft with four doors: one for each crew member, an airstair door on the right side of the cabin and a cargo door on the left. The aircraft can be optionally fitted with an underslung cargo pod.

The basic 208 airframe has a fixed tricycle landing gear but can also be fitted with various types of landing gear, allowing it to operate in a wide variety of environments. Some common adaptations include floats with retractable landing gear on the Caravan Amphibian model, and skis.
The Caravan interior can be outfitted with seats or as a cargo compartment. The standard high-density airline configuration has four rows of 1-2 seating behind the two seats in the cockpit. This variant is capable of holding up to thirteen passengers, although it is marketed as being able to make a profit carrying just four.

The cabin can be configured in a low density passenger configuration, with 1-1 seating, as a combination of passengers and cargo, or as a strictly cargo aircraft. Many variants include an underbelly cargo pod, which can be used for additional freight capacity, or for passenger baggage. A number of Caravans are operated as skydiving aircraft with the left-side cargo hatch converted to a roll-up door.

The airplane typically seats nine passengers with a single pilot, although with a FAR Part 23 waiver it can seat up to fourteen passengers. The aircraft is also used for cargo operations.

The short-fuselage Caravan burns of fuel per hour at for stages.

== Notable incidents ==
In August 2021, fearing Taliban reprisals, pilots of the Afghan Air Force made a last minute escape from Kabul to Tajikistan on an AC-208 moments before the city fell to the Taliban.

In November 2021, Egyptian Army Cessna 208s were used to fight smugglers in western Egypt.

On May 11, 2022, a Cessna 208 pilot became incapacitated resulting in a passenger with no flight experience successfully making an emergency landing at Palm Beach International Airport. The passenger was assisted by Air Traffic Controller Robert Morgan, a certified flight instructor.

On November 21, 2023, a Cessna 208 flew for the first time without any human on board. The plane was modified by Reliable Robotics to fly autonomously with a remote pilot able to send commands to the aircraft from 50 miles away via satellite communication to the onboard flight computers.

On February 6, 2025, a Cessna Caravan went missing during a regular commuter flight from Unalakleet to Nome, Alaska. The plane was found by the United States Coast Guard on February 8 with all lives aboard lost.

== Variants ==
=== Civilian ===
:First production variant with a PT6A-114 turboprop engine and seating for up to nine passengers. The landplane variant was type approved on October 23, 1984, and the seaplane version with Wipline Model 8000 Amphibious/Seaplane Floats was type approved on March 26, 1986. Early aircraft can be modified to use the higher-powered PT6A-114A but have restricted operating limits.

:*208 Caravan 675
::Marketing designation for the 208 Caravan with a higher-powered PT6A-114A engine.
;208A Cargomaster
:A pure-cargo version of the Caravan developed with Federal Express (now FedEx); 40 aircraft produced. All 208A aircraft were serialized as 208 models.

:Officially named the 208B Caravan but marketed as the Grand Caravan. The 208B is longer than the 208; extending the cabin by the same amount. The 208B has a PT6A-114A engine. It was originally certified as a two-seater cargo version on October 9, 1986, and as an 11-seater passenger aircraft on December 13, 1989.
::Marketing name for upgraded version of the 208B Caravan certified in December 2012, with a more powerful Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A-140 that improves the rate of climb by 38% and was developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada specifically to power the 208B. The unladen weight is more but maximum payload is only more. While the more powerful PT6A-140 gives a higher cruise speed – and rate of climb is improved by , range is reduced to on a similar fuel capacity. It requires a longer take off run at and its landing roll is at . In early October 2019, after just under six years in production, the company had delivered 500 Grand Caravan EXs.
::Marketing name for the cargo variant of the 208B series. FedEx purchased 260 of this variant.

;Caravan Amphibian

<text>Mock-heroic, mock-epic or heroi-comic works are typically satires or parodies that mock common Classical stereotypes of heroes and heroic literature. Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th-century Italy, and in the post-Restoration and Augustan periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the &quot;Batrachomyomachia&quot; ascribed to Homer by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that epic and the pastoral genres had become used up and exhausted, and so they got parodically reprised. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt to be merely expressing the traditional values of feudal society.

Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish picaresque novels and the French burlesque novel, in Italy flourished the &quot;poema eroicomico&quot;. In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by Torquato Tasso in his work &quot;Discorsi del poema eroico&quot; (&quot;Discussions about the Epic Poems&quot;) and realized in his masterwork, the &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, were felt as antiquated. The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

&quot;Lo scherno degli dèi&quot; (&quot;The Mockery of Gods&quot;) by Francesco Bracciolini, printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian &quot;poema eroicomico&quot;.
However, the best known of the form is &quot;La secchia rapita&quot; (&quot;The rape of the Bucket&quot;) by Alessandro Tassoni (1622).

Other Italian mock-heroic poems were &quot;La Gigantea&quot; by Girolamo Amelonghi (1566), &quot;La moscheide&quot; by Giovanni Battista Lalli (1624), the &quot;Viaggio di Colonia&quot; (&quot;Travel to Cologne&quot;) by Antonio Abbondanti (1625), &quot;L&#x27;asino&quot; (&quot;The donkey&quot;) by Carlo de&#x27; Dottori (1652), &quot;La Troja rapita&quot; by Loreto Vittori (1662), &quot;Il Malmantile racquistato&quot; by Lorenzo Lippi (1688), &quot;La presa di San Miniato&quot; by Ippolito Neri (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in Neapolitan dialect the best known work of the form was &quot;La Vaiasseide&quot; by Giulio Cesare Cortese (1612). While in Romanesco Giovanni Camillo Peresio wrote &quot;Il maggio romanesco&quot; (1688), Giuseppe Berneri published &quot;Meo Patacca&quot; in 1695, and, finally, Benedetto Micheli printed &quot;La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa&quot; in 1765.

After the translation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, by Miguel de Cervantes, English authors began to imitate the inflated language of Romance poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters. The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the picaresque, burlesque, and satirical poem is the comic poem &quot;Hudibras&quot; (1662–1674), by Samuel Butler. Butler&#x27;s poem describes a &quot;trew blew&quot; Puritan knight during the Interregnum, in language that imitates Romance and epic poetry. After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.

&quot;Hudibras&quot; gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the &quot;Hudibrastic&quot;. The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often feminine rhymes or unexpected conjunctions. For example, Butler describes the English Civil War as a time which &quot;Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho&#x27; not one knew why or wherefore&quot; (&quot;punk&quot; meaning a prostitute). The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody. This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others. After Butler, Jonathan Swift is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

Poet Laureate John Dryden is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era. While Dryden&#x27;s own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot; is satirized in the mock-heroic &quot;The Author&#x27;s Farce&quot; and &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; by Henry Fielding, as well as &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;), Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; is perhaps the &quot;locus classicus&quot; of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come. In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares Thomas Shadwell with Aeneas by using the language of &quot;Aeneid&quot; to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe. The parody of Virgil satirizes Shadwell. Dryden&#x27;s prosody is identical to regular heroic verse: iambic pentameter closed couplets. The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see &quot;the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century&quot; by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.)

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780. Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel. The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by Alexander Pope. Pope’s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking epic poetry such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. The overall form of the poem, written in cantos, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the Muse”; in this case, Pope&#x27;s Muse is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, John Caryll: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3). Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda. These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the &quot;Iliad&quot;) that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle. All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory. Pope’s mastery of the Mock-Heroic is clear in every instance. Even the typical apotheosis found in the epics is mimicked in &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects. In this mock-epic the progress of Dulness over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (see also the metaphor of &quot;translatio studii&quot;). John Gay&#x27;s &quot;Trivia&quot; and &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; were mock-heroic (the latter in opera), and Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;London&quot; is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative parody, and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody, although Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; contains passages of pure mock-heroic. The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes&#x27;s novel. After Romanticism&#x27;s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot; were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in France, in Scotland, in Poland, in Bohemia, in Russia. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were &quot;Le Vergile Travesti&quot; (&quot;The disguised Vergil&quot;) by Paul Scarron (1648–52) and &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; by Voltaire (1730). In macaronic Latin enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions William Drummond of Hawthornden wrote &quot;Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam&quot; in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was Ignacy Krasicki, who wrote &quot;Myszeida&quot; (&quot;Mouseiad&quot;) in 1775 and &quot;Monacomachia&quot; (&quot;The War of the Monks&quot;) in 1778. In the same language Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski published &quot;Organy&quot; in 1775–77. The Bohemian poet Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: &quot;Dĕvin&quot; in Czech and &quot;Der böhmische Mägderkrieg&quot; in German. In 1791 the Russian poet N. P. Osipov published (). Ivan Kotliarevsky&#x27;s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the modern Ukrainian language.

<doc id="364576" wikidata="Q1517756" url="?curid=364576" title="Marmon Motor Car Company">
<text>Marmon Motor Car Company was an American Luxury automobile manufacturer founded by Howard Carpenter Marmon and owned by Nordyke Marmon &amp; Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., and active from 1902 to 1933.

It was established in 1902 but not incorporated as the successor of Nordyke Marmon &amp; Company until 1926. In 1933 it was succeeded by Marmon-Herrington, and in 1964 the Marmon brand name was sold to the Marmon Motor Company of Denton, Texas. Marmon-Herrington became the Marmon Group of Chicago, in 1964.

Marmon was notable for its various pioneering works in automotive manufacturing, introducing the rear-view mirror, pioneering the V16 engine, and the use of aluminum in auto manufacturing. The historic open wheel &quot;Marmon Wasp&quot; race car of the early 20th century was the first to use a single-seater &quot;monoposto&quot; construction layout.

==Marmon Automobiles==
Marmon&#x27;s parent company was founded in 1851, manufacturing flour grinding mill equipment and branching out into other machinery through the late 19th century. Small limited production of experimental automobiles began in 1902, with an air-cooled V-twin engine. An air-cooled V4 followed the next year, with pioneering V6 and V8 engines tried over the next few years, before more conventional straight engine designs were settled upon. Marmons soon gained a reputation as reliable, speedy upscale cars.

The Model 32 of 1909 spawned the Wasp. It was driven by Marmon engineer and former racer Ray Harroun (who came out of retirement as a driver for just one race) to the championship of the first ever Indianapolis 500 motor race, in 1911. This car debuted the first known automobile rear-view mirror.

=== Model 48 ===
The 1913 Model 48 was a left-hand steering tourer with a cast aluminum engine and electric headlights and horn, as well as electric courtesy lights for the dash and doors. It used a 573 in3 (9,382 cc) (4½×6-inch, 114×152 mm) T-head straight-six engine of between 48 and 80 hp (36 and 60 kW) with dual-plug ignition and electric starter. It had a 145 in (3683 mm) wheelbase (long for the era) and 36×4½-inch (91×11.4 cm) front/37×5-inch (94×12.7 cm) rear wheels (which interchanged front and rear) and full-elliptic front and ¾-elliptic rear springs. Like most cars of the era, it came complete with a tool kit; in Marmon&#x27;s case, it offered jack, power tire pump, chassis oiler, tire patch kit, and trouble light. The 48 came in a variety of models: two-, four-, five-, and seven-passenger tourers at US$5,000 ($ in dollars ), seven-passenger limousine at US$6,250 ($ in dollars ), seven-passenger landaulette at US$6,350 ($ in dollars ), and seven-passenger Berlin limousine at US$6,450 ($ in dollars ).

=== Model 34 ===
The 1916 Model 34 used an aluminum straight-six, and used aluminum in the body and chassis to reduce overall weight to just 3295 lb (1495 kg). A Model 34 was driven coast to coast as a publicity stunt, beating Erwin &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker&#x27;s record to much fanfare.

New models were introduced for 1924, replacing the long-lived Model 34, but the company was facing financial trouble, and in 1926 was reorganized as the Marmon Motor Car Co.

=== Little Marmon, Roosevelt ===

In 1927 the &quot;Little Marmon&quot; series was introduced and in 1929, Marmon introduced an under-$1,000 straight-eight car, the Roosevelt, but the stock market crash of 1929 made the company&#x27;s problems worse. 

=== Marmon Sixteen ===
The &quot;Marmon Sixteen&quot; was produced between 1931 and 1934. Howard Marmon had begun working on the world&#x27;s first V16 engine in 1927. By the time the Sixteen was introduced Cadillac had already debuted their V-16, designed by ex-Marmon engineer Owen Nacker. Peerless, too, had been developing a V16 with help from an ex-Marmon engineer, James Bohannon.

The Sixteen&#x27;s engine displaced 491 in³ (8.0 L) and produced 200 hp (149 kW). It was an all-aluminum design with steel cylinder liners and a 45° bank angle. The car&#x27;s body was designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1930, with assistance from his son.

=== Manufacturing Plant ===
The original Nordyke &amp; Marmon Plant 1 was at the southwest corner of Kentucky Avenue and West Morris Street. Plant 2 was at the southwest corner of Drover and West York Street. Plant 3 was a five-story structure measuring 80 x 600 feet parallel to Morris Street (now Eli Lilly &amp; Company Building 314). The Marmon assembly plant was built adjacent to the Morris Street property line with Plant 3 behind and parallel to it (also part of the Eli Lilly complex).

== Marmon-Herrington ==

While the Marmon Company discontinued auto production, it continued to manufacture components for other auto manufacturers and manufactured trucks. When the Great Depression drastically reduced the luxury car market, the Marmon Car Company joined forces with Colonel Arthur Herrington, an ex-military engineer involved in the design of all-wheel drive vehicles. The new company was called Marmon-Herrington.

In the early 1960s, Marmon-Herrington was purchased by the Pritzker family and became a member of an association of companies which eventually adopted the name The Marmon Group. In 2007, the Pritzker family sold a major part of the Group to Warren Buffett&#x27;s firm Berkshire Hathaway.

For the 1993 Indianapolis 500, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of The Marmon Group of companies, Éric Bachelart drove a tribute to the &quot;Marmon Wasp&quot;, actually a year old Lola with Buick power, which was uncompetitive and failed to qualify. After qualifications ended, the sponsorship was transferred to the car of John Andretti, who was driving for A. J. Foyt Enterprises. Andretti started 23rd and briefly led before eventually finishing tenth.

==Notable owners==

Actor Francis X. Bushman, at the height of his movie fame in the 1910s, owned a custom built purple painted &quot;Marmon.&quot; Other actors who were owners of &quot;Marmons&quot; include Wallace Reid, Douglas Fairbanks and Arthur Tracy.

Statesman and national hero of Finland Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim&#x27;s official car was a &quot;Marmon&quot; E-75. Much later, the same car was bought by a group of technology students. It is still the representational car of the Aalto University student union after considerable repairs, and the name &quot;Marmon&quot;, to some extent, is coupled to this specific vehicle.

J. Horace McFarland, president of the American Civic Association, owned a &quot;Marmon&quot;. In 1924, he wrote to John Gries of the National Bureau of Standards&#x27; Division of Building and Housing that his &quot;Marmon&quot; cost nine cents a mile to operate, &quot;independent of the chauffeur.&quot;

In his memoir, &quot;The Cruise of the Rolling Junk&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about a 1,200-mile automobile trip to the South that he and Zelda Fitzgerald took in their used 1918 &quot;Marmon&quot; Speedster.

In 1916–17, Ruby Archambeau of Portland, Oregon, became the first woman to drive the circumference of the United States. Her vehicle was a &quot;Marmon&quot;.

&quot;King of Bootleggers&quot; Italian Canadian Rocco Perri of Hamilton, Ontario, was known to favor &quot;Marmons&quot; in the 1920s.

Actress Bebe Daniels was driving a &quot;Marmon&quot; Roadster 72 miles per hour south of Santa Ana when she became the first woman to be convicted of speeding in Orange County.
