<text>Medan ( , ) is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of North Sumatra. The nearby Strait of Malacca, Port of Belawan, and Kualanamu International Airport make Medan a regional hub and multicultural metropolis, acting as a financial centre for Sumatra and a gateway to the western part of Indonesia. About 60% of the economy in North Sumatra is backed by trading, agriculture, and processing industries, including exports from its 4 million acres of palm oil plantations. The National Development Planning Agency listed Medan as one of the four main central cities in Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar. In terms of population, it is the most populous city in Indonesia outside of the island of Java. Its population as of 2023 is approximately equal to the country of Moldova.

As of the 2020 Census, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 within its city limits; the official population estimate as of mid 2023 was 2,474,166 - comprising 1,231,673 males and 1,242,493 females. When the surrounding urban area is included, the population is over 3.4 million, making it the fourth largest urban area in Indonesia. The Medan metropolitan area—which includes neighbouring Binjai, Deli Serdang Regency, and a part of Karo Regency—is the largest metropolitan area outside of Java, with 4,744,323 residents counted in the 2020 Census.

The city was founded at the confluence of the Deli River and the Babura river by a Karonese man named Guru Patimpus. Then called &quot;Kampung Medan Putri&quot;, it became part of the Deli Sultanate, established in 1632. In the late 19th century, colonial Dutch seeking new plantation areas chose Medan and Deli as plantation hubs to found the Deli Company. Within a few years, the Dutch tobacco trade transformed Medan into an economic hub, earning it the nickname (&quot;the land of the money&quot;). The Deli Railway, established to ship tobacco, rubber, tea, timber, palm oil, and sugar from Medan to the Port of Belawan for worldwide export, brought further rapid development to Medan. The city became first the capital of the State of East Sumatra, and then the provincial capital of North Sumatra.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;medan&quot; might be derived from the Batak Karo word (), which literally means &#x27;healed&#x27;, &#x27;blessed&#x27;, or &#x27;recovered&#x27;. The term is associated with the historical Karo figure and founder of the city, traditional doctor . The oldest evidence of this term used to refer to the city dates back to 13th-15th century during the reign of Aru, the Karo monarch.

Another popular theory suggests that &quot;medan&quot; is of Malay origin, literally meaning &#x27;field&#x27;. The term &quot;medan&quot; () in Malay might be derived from the Malayalam word (, &#x27;field&#x27;), which is cognate with the Tamil word (, &#x27;ground&#x27;).

==History==

Medan is located in what was once the Kingdom of Aru, founded by the Karo people and flourishing between the 13th and 16th centuries. A number of archaeological sites survive near Medan, including Kota Rentang, a port settlement in the Hamparan Perak area; Kota Cina, an ancient trading site in Medan Marelan; and Benteng Putri Hijau, a fort ruin in Deli Tua.

In the sixteenth century, Guru Patimpus Sembiring Pelawi, a Karonese man from the Karo Regency, converted from Pemena to Islam. While traveling to study under Datuk Kota Bangun, Guru Patimpus met and married the Princess of . Accompanied by their two sons, Kolok and Kecik, the couple founded Medan village between the Deli and Babura Rivers.

In 1632, the Aceh Sultanate under Gocah Pahlawan expanded to include Medan. Perunggit succeeded his father in 1669, and declared the Deli Sultanate, including Medan, independent of the Aceh Sultanate.

Starting in the 1860s, Dutch authorities began to release new land for tobacco plantations. Said Abdullah Bilsagih, brother-in-law of the Deli Sultan Mahmud Perkasa Alam, persuaded Dutch tobacco merchant Jacob Nienhuys to move his business from Java to Deli. Dutch merchants Van der Falk and Elliot, and Chinese brothers Tjong Yong Hian and Tjong A Fie, were also pioneers of Deli&#x27;s tobacco industry. In 1867, Nienhuys, Jannsen, P.W. Clemen, and Cremer founded De Deli Maatschappij; in 1869, they moved its head office from Labuhan Deli to Medan. This made Medan a centre of the tobacco trade, which continued to grow with the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal.

Sultan Ma&#x27;mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah, who ruled from 1873 to 1924, moved the kingdom&#x27;s capital to Medan. He became known as the builder of early Medan, finishing the construction of the Maimun Palace in 1888 and building the Great Mosque of Medan in 1907. In 1898, a Dutch businessman named Aeint Herman de Boer built Hotel de Boer to accommodate the cruise ships of European tourists which had begun to visit Medan.

During the 1942 Dutch East Indies campaign, the Japanese entered Medan on bicycles and occupied the city. The handover of power was chaotic, but through the use of the Kempetai. Locals of Medan were subjected to enforced Japanese language and worship. The Japanese were able to hold the city until their surrender in 1945. Following that, Medan came under the authority of the South East Asia Command led by British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. With the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August, Medan became part of the newly-independent Republic of Indonesia, news announced in Medan on 30 September.

In October, Allied troops landed in Belawan and marched on Medan. The subsequent conflicts between the Allies and the Indonesian Army became known as the Battle of Medan. The Allies regained control of Medan in April 1946, and in December 1947 the Dutch established the State of East Sumatra with Medan as its capital. This became part of the United States of Indonesia in 1949, and was dissolved into the Republic of Indonesia in 1950.

Medan continued to grow as a centre of commerce during the reign of . 
Developments of the 1970s, especially palm oil and rubber plantations, made Medan the busiest city outside Java, with the transmigration program bringing many Javanese and Batak migrants.

In May 1998, months of student demonstrations in Medan over the 1997 Asian financial crisis turned into riots when a student was killed in a clash with security forces. The next day, the mobs became bigger, and many shops and vehicles in the business district (mostly owned by Chinese residents) were burned and looted. As a result, a curfew was imposed for more than two weeks until peace returned.

On 5 September 2005, Mandala Airlines Flight 091 stalled a minute after taking off from Medan&#x27;s old Polonia International Airport for a flight to Jakarta. The aircraft crashed into a heavily populated residential area along Djamin Ginting road in &quot;Padang Bulan&quot;. Of the 117 passengers and crews on board, only 17 survived, and an additional 49 civilians on the ground were killed. As a result, Kualanamu International Airport was built in Deli Serdang to replace the old airport, with construction finished in 2012. After the move to the new airport, height restriction laws in Medan were relaxed.

==Geography==
Medan is in the northeastern part of Sumatra island, in the province of North Sumatra. The city is a semi-enclave within Deli Serdang Regency, bordered by that regency on three sides and by the Strait of Malacca to the north. The natural harbor formed where the Deli and Babura rivers feed into the straits has contributed to Medan&#x27;s growth as a trading port.

Medan&#x27;s elevation varies between above sea level, with the Barisan Mountains to the south, and volcanoes such as Sibayak Mountain and Sinabung Mountain from the city.

===Climate===
Medan features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) with no real dry season. Its driest month (January) on average sees about one-third the precipitation of its wettest month (October), with a total annual precipitation of about . Autumn (September - November) is the rainiest season, and the temperature is still coolest in winter (December and January). Temperatures in the city average approximately throughout the year.

==Government==
Medan was governed by Abdillah from 2000 until 2008, when he and his vice mayor were caught by the Corruption Eradication Commission. Syamsul Arifin, the governor of North Sumatra Province, appointed as acting mayor, followed by Rahudman Harahap after Lubis&#x27;s 2009 resignation. Harahap resigned in order to run for office in the 2010 mayoral election, leaving Arifin himself to become acting mayor. In 2013, Harahap was also arrested for corruption, and his deputy Dzulmi Eldin became acting mayor.

Dzulmi Eldin was elected mayor in 2016, and served until his arrest for corruption in 2019. He was replaced by his vice mayor, Akhyar Nasution, who served until the end of his term in 2021.

The current mayor of Medan is Bobby Nasution, with vice mayor .

===Administrative divisions===

Medan is divided into 21 districts (), tabulated below with their areas and populations at the 2010 Census, and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023. The table also includes the number of urban villages/neighbourhoods () in each district, and their postal codes.

Medan Tuntungan serves as the gateway to Karo Regency, Medan Helvetia to Binjai City and Langkat, and Medan Amplas to Tebing Tinggi and Pematang Siantar.

==Demographics==
Medan is Indonesia&#x27;s largest city outside Java, and its fourth largest altogether (after Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung). The population more than quadrupled in less than fifty years, growing from 568,000 in 1968 to 2.1 million in 2010. As of 2020, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 and the larger metropolitan area had a population of 4,756,863.

===Ethnicities and languages===
The dominant ethnic groups in Medan are Batak and Javanese, with smaller Malays, Acehnese, Indian, Nias, and Sundanese populations.
The Bataks in Medan are of three subethnicities. The native Karo mostly live in the southern parts of Medan, including Padang Bulan, Medan Johor and Tuntungan. The Toba, whom the Dutch employed on their oil palm plantations, live in Marindal and Amplas, or in nearby city centres such as the Medan Perjuangan district. Finally, the Mandailing, who migrated to Medan after Indonesian independence in search of job opportunities, mainly live in Medan Tembung. The primary languages spoken by Bataks in Medan are Batak and Karo.

The large Javanese community in Medan is primarily composed of the descendants of people transported from Java in the 19th century to be employed as contract workers at various plantations in North Sumatra. For the most part, they speak the local dialect of Javanese.

The Malays are also natives of Medan, having lived as fishermen in the outskirts of the city since the Aru era. Starting in the 18th century, they began to spread throughout the city, with large numbers living in Medan Maimun, Kota Matsum, Labuhan and Belawan and speaking Malay.

Immigration from southern China to Deli began in the 16th century, and accelerated in the 19th and early 20th centuries as immigrants sought employment as planters and coolies. Medan is home to the largest Chinese population in Sumatra, mostly concentrated around the city centre. Most Chinese people in Medan speak Medan Hokkien, a local dialect, but many also speak Mandarin, Teochew, or Cantonese.

Minangkabau came to Medan since the late of the 19th century. Minangs migration surged from the 1960s to the 1980s, becoming 10.9% of the population and founding Padang restaurants throughout the city. Most Minangkabau people in Medan speak Minangkabau. They are mostly concentrated around the city centre, near Central Market (&quot;Pajak Sentral&quot;), Kota Matsum and Sukaramai.

Many Acehnese sought sanctuary in Medan after the insurgency in Aceh in the late 1970s. They now own a number of Mie Aceh restaurants around the Setia Budi and Sunggal areas. Most speak Acehnese, and Gayonese is also common.

Medan also has a substantial Tamil Indonesian community. Kampung Madras, a busy area in the city centre, is well-known as a Tamil neighbourhood.

The different linguistic communities in Medan communicate in a slang called &quot;Bahasa Medan&quot; or &quot;Dialek Medan&quot; (&quot;Medanese slang&quot;). This dialect of Indonesian includes loanwords from the various local languages, especially Malay.

===Religion===
Most of Medan&#x27;s inhabitants are Muslim, accounting for approximately 69.72 percent of the population. The substantial Christian demographic (about 25 percent of the total population) includes Catholics, Methodists, and Lutherans, such as the Batak Christian Protestant Church. Buddhists make up about 9 percent of the population, and there are smaller Hindu, Confucian, and Sikh communities. Some Bataknese follow traditional religions such as Pemena and Parmalim.

Gunung Timur Temple, on Jalan Hang Tuah, is Medan&#x27;s oldest Taoist temple. Maha Vihara Maitreya, on Jalan Cemara Asri, is the largest Buddhist temple in southeast Asia. The city&#x27;s oldest church, Medan Cathedral, on Jalan Pemuda, was originally built as by the Dutch and Indian community. Sri Mariamman Temple, on Jalan Zainul Arifin in Kampung Madras, is the city&#x27;s oldest Hindu temple, built around 1881; it is surrounded by over a hundred statues of various deities. Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni, a Catholic church in an Indo-Mogul style, was built on Jalan Sakura III in 2005, dedicated to a Marian apparition in 17th century Tamil Nadu. At one point before and during the Japanese occupation of the city, Japanese migrants created a Shinto shrine, Hirohara Shrine, to accommodate the increasing worshipers of Japanese residents. It was later rebuilt during the Japanese occupation of the city in 1944 to accommodate the mandatory worship by locals. The former shrine still stands as the last Shinto shrine in Southeast Asia.

==Economy==

The Medan metropolitan area was recognized as an Indonesian National Strategic Region () by Government Regulation No 28/2008.

It also has a growing manufacturing sector, producing goods such as cars, machinery, tile, and paper and pulp.

Medan&#x27;s location makes it the main hub of international trade in western Indonesia, with exports going to Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Its trade and tourism businesses have also become essential to the Indonesia–Malaysia–Thailand Growth Triangle. Many multinational companies maintain offices in the city, such as Asian Agri, London Sumatra, Musim Mas, Philips Lighting, Toba Pulp Lestari, Marriott, Wilmar, ABB Group and DBS Bank.

==Transportation==

===Airport===

The Kualanamu International Airport (KNO) opened on 25 July 2013 as a replacement for the Polonia Airport. Located from downtown Medan, it is Indonesia&#x27;s first airport with a direct rail link to the city. The airport has a passenger terminal, and serves as a hub for Garuda Indonesia, Indonesia AirAsia, Lion Air, Susi Air and Wings Air, with direct domestic flights to many major cities in Sumatra, as well as Java-international flights to locations abroad including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka.

===Seaport===

The Port of Belawan is on the northeast coast of Sumatra, north of Medan and accessible by a railway across the channel south of the island. Originally built in 1890 for European tobacco exports, the harbour was expanded in 1907 with a new section for Chinese and indigenous traders.

The growth of northern Sumatra&#x27;s rubber and palm oil plantations in the early twentieth century brought new developments to the port. Several major berthing facilities were built in the 1920s, and by 1938 the port handled the greatest cargo value of any in the Dutch East Indies. Trade volumes dropped substantially after Indonesian independence, but reached pre-independence levels again in the mid-1960s. A major restructuring in 1985 saw the construction of a container terminal; it almost immediately captured about one-fifth of Indonesia&#x27;s containerized exports. Major products exported include rubber, palm oil, tea, and coffee.

The current port has two terminals. The first, which handles passengers, offers ferry services to cities including Penang, Langkawi, Batam, Jakarta, and Surabaya. The second, Belawan International Container Terminal (BICT), is used for export and import services, and is one of the largest shipping industry ports in Indonesia.

<doc id="360759" wikidata="Q28667972" url="?curid=360759" title="One Piece">
<text>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; since July 1997, with its chapters compiled in 110 volumes . The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the &quot;One Piece&quot; to become the next King of the Pirates.

The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007. Netflix released a live action TV series adaptation in 2023.

&quot;One Piece&quot; has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humour. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in a book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, &quot;One Piece&quot; set the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for &quot;the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author&quot;. It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018 and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only one that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published volumes. &quot;One Piece&quot; is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon&#x27;s weekly comic chart existence since 2008.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
The world of &quot;One Piece&quot; is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as &quot;Minks&quot;). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label &quot;pirate&quot;, which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to the World Government&#x27;s authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The &quot;One Piece&quot; world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits, which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another supernatural power is Haki, which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line. Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line, which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt, strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings. These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise and the New World.

=== Premise ===

The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating the Gum-Gum Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger&#x27;s ultimate treasure known as the &quot;One Piece&quot;, and take over his prior title. Luffy sets sail as captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and is joined by Roronoa Zoro, a swordsman and former bounty hunter; Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the &quot;Going Merry&quot;—later replaced by the &quot;Thousand Sunny&quot;—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, scientists, soldiers of the morally ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.

== Production ==
=== Concept and creation ===
Eiichiro Oda&#x27;s interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series &quot;Vicky the Viking&quot;, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates. The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in &quot;One Piece&quot;; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Teach. Apart from the history of piracy, Oda&#x27;s biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, which is one of his favorite manga.

While working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing &quot;One Piece&quot; in 1996. It started as two one-shot stories entitled &quot;Romance Dawn&quot;—which would later be used as the title for &quot;One Piece&quot;″s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot;, and reprinted in 2002 in &quot;One Piece Red&quot; guidebook. The second was published in the 41st issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in September 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda&#x27;s short story collection, &quot;Wanted!&quot; In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of &quot;One Piece&quot;, revealed that the manga was rejected by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; three times before they agreed to publish the series. Kazuhiko Torishima, then the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief, explained that they debated for two hours on whether or not to serialize &quot;One Piece&quot;. Although acknowledging that it had potential, he was one of those against the work because it was &quot;incomplete&quot;. But Torishima ultimately approved serialization due to Asada being so &quot;annoyingly earnest&quot; that another editor suggested both Oda and Asada would be crushed if it was rejected at that time.

=== Development ===
Oda&#x27;s primary inspiration for the concept of Devil Fruits was &quot;Doraemon&quot;; the Fruits&#x27; abilities and uses reflect Oda&#x27;s daily life and his personal fantasies, similar to that of Doraemon&#x27;s gadgets, such as the Gum-Gum Fruit being inspired by Oda&#x27;s laziness. When designing the outward appearance of Devil Fruits Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit&#x27;s appearance would entice one to eat it. The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in &quot;kanji&quot; are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters&#x27; techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro&#x27;s sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro&#x27;s signature move is &quot;Onigiri&quot;, which is written as &quot;demon cut&quot; but is pronounced the same as &quot;rice ball&quot; in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these &quot;kanji&quot; readings in the anime since they &quot;might have cut down the laughs by about half&quot;. Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators &quot;made the anime pretty close to the manga&quot;.

Oda was &quot;sensitive&quot; about how his work would be translated. In many instances, the English version of the &quot;One Piece&quot; manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeiae used in the Japanese version. For instance, &quot;&quot;saaa&quot; (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and &quot;zaaa&quot;&quot; (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as &quot;fshhhhhhh&quot;. Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn. This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda&#x27;s work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and the possible colouring. When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy&#x27;s crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in &quot;One Piece&quot; since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.

=== Conclusion ===
In 2006, Oda stated that he originally planned &quot;One Piece&quot; to last five years and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time. In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell. In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of &quot;One Piece&quot;, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot. In a television special aired in Japan in January 2019, Oda said that &quot;One Piece&quot; is on its way to the conclusion, but that it would exceed the 100th volume, also commenting that he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it. When asked if the titular treasure is &quot;family bonds&quot;, Oda replied: &quot;No, I hate that kind of thing&quot;, mentioning the ending of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and claiming that he does not endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal. In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga would end in five years. However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through. In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year&#x27;s 35th issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; that &quot;One Piece&quot; was &quot;headed toward the upcoming final saga.&quot; On January 4, 2021, &quot;One Piece&quot; reached its thousandth chapter. In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter 1054.

Following the digital &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;&#x27;s cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started simultaneously publishing &quot;One Piece&quot; through its &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; service, and by Shueisha through &quot;Manga Plus&quot;, in January 2019.

In the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006, until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume. In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.

==== Spin-offs and crossovers ====
Oda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of &quot;One Piece&quot; and Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Entitled &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and the April 2011 issue of the English &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;. Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of &quot;Toriko&quot;, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled , published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on April 4, 2011. The spin-off series , written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in &quot;Saikyō Jump&quot; on December 5, 2011. Its final chapter was published on &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; on February 2, 2021.

=== Anime ===
==== Festival films and original video animation ====
&quot;One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!&quot; was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi. Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka&#x27;s father, have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labour. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy&#x27;s capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armoured battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.

A second film, &quot;One Piece: Romance Dawn Story&quot;, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of &quot;Romance Dawn&quot;. It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the &quot;Thousand Sunny&quot;. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her &quot;treasure&quot;. The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help, he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally&#x27;s ship. The film was later released as a triple feature DVD with &quot;Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot; and &quot;Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night&quot;, that was available only through a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.

The &quot;One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0&quot; original video animation adapts the manga&#x27;s special &quot;Chapter 0&quot;, which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.

===== Theatrical films =====

Fourteen animated theatrical films produced by Toei Animation based on the &quot;One Piece&quot; series have been released. The films are typically released in March to coincide with the spring vacation of Japanese schools. The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films and were thus usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.

=== Critical response ===
Allen Divers of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; comments in 2003 that the art style &quot;One Piece&quot; employs &quot;initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins&quot;, adding that the &quot;artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation&quot;. He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;) shines through in Oda&#x27;s style of writing with its &quot;huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor&quot; and that, in &quot;One Piece&quot;, he &quot;manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots&quot;. Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series&#x27; strengths is to &quot;blend action, humor, and heavy fare together&quot; and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading. The website &quot;activeAnime&quot; describes the artwork in &quot;One Piece&quot; as &quot;wonderfully quirky and full of expression&quot;. Mario Vuk from &quot;Splash Comics&quot; commented that Oda&#x27;s &quot;pleasantly bright and dynamic&quot; art style suits the story&#x27;s &quot;funny and exciting&quot; atmosphere. Isaiah Colbert of &quot;Kotaku&quot; called &quot;One Piece&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, highlighting Oda&#x27;s character writing, world-building and the balance between &quot;fun and serious subject matter&quot;. Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that &quot;One Piece&quot; is more about the world-building, adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the &quot;usual shonen battling&quot; from series like &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Naruto&quot;. Bashir concluded: &quot;While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn&#x27;t even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it.&quot;

EX Media lauds Oda&#x27;s art for its &quot;crispy&quot; monochrome pictures, &quot;great use of subtle shade changes&quot; on color pages, &quot;sometimes exquisite&quot; use of angles, and for its consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda&#x27;s craft grew steadily. She states that &quot;he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,&quot; notes that &quot;interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,&quot; and recommends &quot;sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets&quot;. Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: &quot;&quot;One Piece&quot; is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.&quot; He praised Oda&#x27;s artwork as &quot;imaginative and creative&quot; and commented that &quot;Oda&#x27;s imagination just oozes all of the panels &quot;. He also noted that &quot;Oda&#x27;s panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast&quot;.

In March 2021, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;″s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that &quot;One Piece&quot; is the &quot;only manga to trust&quot;. He praised the manga, commenting: &quot;Still, we are working in the same studio and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know, among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting nonetheless. And I don&#x27;t trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is &quot;One Piece&quot;.

After the release of the hundredth volume, &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;″s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how &quot;One Piece&quot; changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; is &quot;a game of weekly popularity&quot;, and before &quot;One Piece&quot;, he aimed for something &quot;interesting this week without thinking about the next&quot;; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his &quot;overwhelming passion, talent and power&quot; and his &quot;unwavering will&quot; to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader&#x27;s expectations, with the belief in &quot;don&#x27;t fool the reader&quot; and &quot;there is something interesting ahead of it&quot;.

<doc id="360773" wikidata="Q610766" url="?curid=360773" title="Gimlé">
<text>In Norse mythology, Gimlé (alternately Gimli as in Icelandic) is a place where the worthy survivors of Ragnarök are foretold to live. It is mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the Eddic poem &quot;Völuspá&quot; and described as the most beautiful place in Asgard, more beautiful than the sun.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Gimli is likely &quot;the place protected from fire&quot; based on two Old Nordic elements : &quot;gimr&quot; &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;hlé&quot; &quot;protected place&quot;.

In scholar Lee M. Hollander&#x27;s view it is more likely it means &quot;gem-roof&quot;.

==Descriptions==
Within Asgard, the realm of the gods, Gimlé is a golden-roofed building where righteous people go when they die. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Snorri Sturluson places it in Víðbláinn, which he describes as third heaven currently inhabited only by light elves. In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, which he quotes in one of his accounts of Gimlé, the hall is on Gimlé, presumably a mountain, rather than being itself called Gimlé.

Snorri presents Gimlé as a pagan heaven. Scholars including Hollander and Rudolf Simek have seen the description of Gimlé as influenced by the Christian Heavenly Jerusalem. Ursula Dronke suggested that while the concept of a heaven in which &quot;hosts&quot; of the righteous lived together was based on the pagan Valhalla, the &quot;Völuspá&quot; poet or his associates invented the name &quot;Gimlé&quot; with reference to its protecting the blessed from the fires both of Surtr at Ragnarök and of the Christian Hell.

<doc id="360781" wikidata="Q1931829" url="?curid=360781" title="Fuel tax">
<text>A fuel tax (also known as a petrol, gasoline or gas tax, or as a fuel duty) is an excise tax imposed on the sale of fuel. In most countries the fuel tax is imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuel tax receipts are often dedicated or hypothecated to transportation projects, in which case the fuel tax can be considered a user fee. In other countries, the fuel tax is a source of general revenue. Sometimes, a fuel tax is used as an ecotax, to promote ecological sustainability. Fuel taxes are often considered by government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service as regressive taxes.

Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, as well as home heating oil which is similar to diesel, are taxed at a different, usually lower rate. These fuels may be dyed to prevent their use for transportation.

Aviation fuel is typically charged at a different rate to fuel for ground-based vehicles. Jet fuel and avgas can attract different rates. In many jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union, commercial aviation fuel is tax free.

Other fuels such as gases, or solid fuels such as coal, may also be taxed.

In countries with a sales tax or a value added tax, these taxes may also be levied on top of fuel taxes. The rate can vary depending on the fuel, as well as the location.

==Role in energy policy==

Taxes on transportation fuels have been advocated as a way to reduce pollution and the possibility of global warming and conserve energy. Placing higher taxes on fossil fuels makes petrol just as expensive as other fuels such as natural gas, biodiesel or electric batteries, at a cost to the consumer in the form of inflation as transportation costs rise to transport goods all over the country.

Proponents advocate that automobiles should pay for the roads they use and argue that the user tax should not be applied to mass transit projects.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank have called on governments to increase gasoline tax rates in order to combat the social and environmental costs of gasoline consumption. Fuel taxes can be implicit carbon pricing.

==Tax rates==
International pump prices for diesel and gasoline are tracked by several websites, including Bloomberg L.P. Price differences mostly reflect differences in tax policy.

A Nature study has shown that while gasoline taxes have increased in more countries than they have decreased in during the period 2003–2015, the global mean gasoline tax has decreased due to greater consumption in the low-tax countries. 
===Asia===
====China====
Chinese gasoline taxes have increased the most among the top twenty -emitting countries over the period 2003–2015.

In China, fuel tax has been a very contentious issue. Efforts by the State Council to institute a fuel tax in order to finance the National Trunk Highway System have run into strong opposition from the National People&#x27;s Congress, largely out of concern for its impact on farmers. This has been one of the uncommon instances in which the legislature has asserted its authority.

==== Hong Kong ====
The following is a list of fuel tax rates for different fuels in Hong Kong:
*Aviation fuel: HK$6.51
*Light diesel oil: HK$2.89
*Leaded petrol: HK$6.82
*Unleaded petrol: HK$6.06
*Ultra low sulphur diesel: HK$2.89
*Euro V diesel: HK$0

==== Singapore ====
The following is a list of fuel tax rates for different fuels in Singapore:
*98 Octane and above petrol: S$0.79 per litre
*92 to 95 Octane petrol: S$0.66 per litre

====India====
In India, the pricing of fuel varies by state, though central taxes still are part of the pump price of fuel. The Central and state government&#x27;s taxes make up nearly half of petrol&#x27;s pump price. The Central govt has different taxes, which amount to about 10–20% of the final cost. The states taxes vary, but on average end up making about 17–20% of the final cost. As a result, approximately 50% - 60% of the pump cost goes to the government in the form of different taxes.

For example, in Delhi, as of February 18, 2021, price of petrol is per litre. Out of this go to Central Govt of India in the form of excise and customs tax. is collected by state government in the form of sales tax and entry tax. Thus, a total of is collected due to various taxes (which accounts for around 58% of the total price).

====Israel====
In Israel, tax on fuel is 1.35 USD per liter which includes direct fuel tax and VAT. This totals to 78% of total pump price.

===Europe===
Jet fuel tax is banned on commercial flights within the European Union, according to the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive. It can be levied on domestic flights or by agreement between Member States, however no such agreements exist.

====France====
As of 2017, the excise tax on gasoline was €0.651 per liter (regional prices varied from €0.407 to €0.6682). With a VAT rate of 20%, the percent of the total price of gasoline that came from taxes was 63.9% The excise tax on diesel fuel was €0.531 per liter (€0.5307 to €0.5631). With the 20% VAT, 59.3% of the total cost of diesel fuel was taxes.

Petroleum products destined for utilisation by aircraft engaged in commercial flights outside of the customs territory of continental France are exempt from all customs duties and domestic taxes. Recently, a rise of 23% in the diesel fuel tax has caused serious protests in major cities of France, leaving disruption and damage behind them. Before the protests, the French government expected to increase both the petrol and diesel taxes until they both reached €0.78 per liter in 2022.

====Germany====
Fuel taxes in Germany are €0.4704 per litre for ultra-low sulphur Diesel and €0.6545 per litre for conventional unleaded petrol, plus Value Added Tax (19%) on the fuel itself and the Fuel Tax. That adds up to prices of for ultra-low sulphur Diesel and for unleaded petrol (December 2019).

====Luxembourg====
Since January 2023, petrol is taxed at a rate of €0.53799/litre and diesel at a rate of €0.42875/litre, with a VAT of 16% added to the total price. As of 2022, a &quot;maximum fuel price&quot; has been established by the government, capped at €1.534/litre for EURO 95 petrol and at €1.498/litre for diesel since 7 January 2025.

====Netherlands====
The sale of fuels in the Netherlands is levied with an excise tax. As of 2015, petrol excise tax is EUR0.766 per litre and diesel excise tax is EUR0.482 per litre, while LPG excise tax is EUR0.185 per litre. The 2007 fuel tax was . On top of that is 21% VAT over the entire fuel price, making the Dutch taxes one of the highest in the world. In total, taxes account for 68.84% of the total price of petrol and 56.55% of the total price of diesel. A 1995 excise was raised by Dutch gulden 25 cents (€0.11), the &quot;Kok Quarter&quot; (€0.08 raise per litre gasoline and €0.03 raise per litre diesel), by then Prime-Minister Wim Kok is now specifically set aside by the second Balkenende cabinet for use in road creation and road and public transport maintenance.

====Norway====
Motor fuel is taxed with both a &quot;road use tax&quot; and a &quot;CO2-tax&quot;. The road use tax on petrol is NOK 4.62 per litre and the CO2-tax on petrol is NOK 0.88 per litre. The road use tax on auto diesel is NOK 3.62 per litre mineral oil and NOK 1.81 per litre bio diesel. The CO2-tax on mineral oil is NOK 0.59 per litre.

====Poland====
In Poland half of the end-user price charged at a petrol station goes towards 3 distinct taxes:
* akcyza (meaning excise)
* opłata paliwowa (meaning fuel tax)
* Value-added tax &quot;VAT&quot; at 23% (from summary of akcyza and opłata paliwowa, and the price of petrol)
Excise and fuel tax are prescribed by European Commission law, and therefore cannot be lower in any EU nation. However it is even higher than this EU minimum in Poland, a policy pursued by the former Minister of finance.

====Russia====
Tax on mineral resource extraction (2008–2009):
*Oil: varies 1000 RUR/t – 13800 RUR/t; middle MRET 3000 RUR/t (0.058 €/l = 0.284 $/gal).
*Natural gas: 147 RUR/1000m3 (4 €/1000m3).
*Petroleum gas: no

Excise tax on motor fuel 2008–2009:
*RON &gt;80: 3629 RUR/t. (0.071 €/l = 0.343 $/US gal)
*RON &lt;=80: 2657 RUR/t. (0.052 €/l = 0.251 $/US

Other fuel (like avia gasoline, jet fuel, heavy oils, natural gas and autogas) prices has no excise tax.

Value Added Tax — 18% on fuel and taxes.

Full tax rate is near 55% of motor fuel prices (ministry of industry and energy facts 2006).

====Sweden====
The fuel tax in Sweden comprises a carbon tax and an energy tax. The total tax (including value added tax) is, from July 1, 2018, per liter petrol and per liter diesel.

====United Kingdom====

From 23 March 2022 the UK duty rate for the road fuels unleaded petrol, diesel, biodiesel and bioethanol is .

Value Added Tax at 20% is also charged on the price of the fuel and on the duty. An additional vehicle excise duty, depending on a vehicle&#x27;s theoretical production per kilometre, which is applied regardless of the amount of fuel actually consumed, is also levied.

Diesel for use by farmers and construction vehicles is coloured red (red diesel) and has a much reduced tax, currently .

Jet fuel used for international aviation attracts no duty, and no VAT.

===North America===

====Canada====
Fuel taxes in Canada can vary greatly between locales. On average, about one-third of the total price of gas at the pump is tax. Excise taxes on gasoline and diesel are collected both federal and provincial governments, as well as by some select municipalities (Montreal, Vancouver, and Victoria); with combined excise taxes varying from 16.2 ¢/L (73.6 ¢/imperial gal)) in the Yukon to 30.5 ¢/L ($1.386/imperial gal) in Vancouver. As well, the federal government and some provincial governments (Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Quebec) collect sales tax (GST and PST) on top of the retail price &quot;and&quot; the excise taxes.

====United States====

The first U.S. state to enact a gas tax was Oregon in 1919. The states of Colorado, North Dakota, and New Mexico followed shortly thereafter. By 1929, all existing 48 states had enacted some sort of gas tax. Today, fuel taxes in the United States vary by state. The United States federal excise tax on gasoline is and for diesel fuel. On average, as of July 2016, state and local taxes add 29.78 cents to gasoline and 29.81 cents to diesel for a total US average fuel tax of for gas and for diesel.

The state and local tax figures includes fixed-per-gallon taxes as well as variable-rate taxes such as those levied as a percentage of the sales price. For state-level fuel taxes, nineteen states and the District of Columbia levy variable-rate taxes of some kind. The other thirty one states do not tie the per-gallon tax rate to inflation, gas prices, or other factors, and the rate changes only by legislation. As of July 2016, twenty one states had gone ten years or more without an increase in their per-gallon gasoline tax rate.

Because the fuel tax is universally styled as a &quot;road use&quot; tax, exempting off-road farming, marine, etc. use; states impose a tax on commercial operators traveling through their state as if the fuel used was bought there, wherever the fuel is purchased. While most commercial truck drivers have an agent to handle the required paperwork: what&#x27;s reported is how much tax was collected in each state, how much should have been paid to each state, the net tax for each state and the combined net tax for all states to be paid by or refunded to the operator by their base jurisdiction where they file. The operator carries paperwork proving compliance. The member jurisdictions, the US states and the CA provinces, transmit the return information to each other and settle their net tax balances with each other either by a single transmittal through a clearinghouse set up by the IFTA and operated by Morgan Stanley, or by separate transfers with the other member jurisdictions.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The fuel tax system in Australia is very similar to Canada in terms of featuring both a fixed and a variable tax, but varies in the case of exemptions including tax credits and certain excise free fuel.

Since October 2018, the fuel tax in Australia is A$0.412 per litre for petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel (conventional diesel being taxed at A$0.412 per litre) and the excise for LPG is $0.282 per litre. Since 2000, there is also the GST (goods and services tax) on top of the fuel tax and inflation calculated twice a year called CPI (consumer price index) into the fuel tax since 2015.

====New Zealand====
Fuel taxes in New Zealand are considered an excise applied by the New Zealand Customs Service on shipments brought into the country. A breakdown of the fuel taxes is published by the Ministry of Economic Development. Excise as at 1 August 2012 totals 50.524 cents per litre (NZ on petrol. In addition the national compulsory Accident Compensation Corporation motor vehicle account receives a contribution of . The ethanol component of bio blended petrol currently attracts no excise duty. This was to be reviewed in 2012. Diesel is not taxed at the pump, but road users with vehicles over 3.5 tonne in Gross Laden Weight and any vehicles not powered wholly by any combination of petrol, LPG or CNG must pay the Road User Charge instead. The Goods and Services Tax (15%) is then applied to the combined total of the value of the commodity and the various taxes. On 25 July 2007 the Minister of Transport Annette King announced that from 1 July 2008 all fuel excise collected would be hypothecated to the National Land Transport Programme.

===Africa===

====South Africa====
South Africa imposes a fuel tax, in Dec 2020, per (unleaded 93 octane, inland) liter, composed of the Fuel Levy – R3,37, Road Accident Fund levy – R1,93, associated costs – R3,12, and the Basic Fuel Price – R5,81 for a total of R14.23. (R = South African Rand (ZAR) ~ R15 per US$ in Dec 2020)

<doc id="360788" wikidata="Q254569" url="?curid=360788" title="Backdoor (computing)">
<text>A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a &quot;homunculus computer&quot;—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel&#x27;s AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.

In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities. In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls —including employees of the then-vice president of the nation– and of the candidates themselves.

A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have &quot;legitimate&quot; uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.

Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.

Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors&#x27; triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.

==Overview==
The threat of backdoors surfaced when multiuser and networked operating systems became widely adopted. Petersen and Turn discussed computer subversion in a paper published in the proceedings of the 1967 AFIPS Conference. They noted a class of active infiltration attacks that use &quot;trapdoor&quot; entry points into the system to bypass security facilities and permit direct access to data. The use of the word &quot;trapdoor&quot; here clearly coincides with more recent definitions of a backdoor. However, since the advent of public key cryptography the term &quot;trapdoor&quot; has acquired a different meaning (see trapdoor function), and thus the term &quot;backdoor&quot; is now preferred, only after the term trapdoor went out of use. More generally, such security breaches were discussed at length in a RAND Corporation task force report published under DARPA sponsorship by J.P. Anderson and D.J. Edwards in 1970.

While initially targeting the computer vision domain, backdoor attacks have expanded to encompass various other domains, including text, audio, ML-based computer-aided design, and ML-based wireless signal classification. Additionally, vulnerabilities in backdoors have been demonstrated in deep generative models, reinforcement learning (e.g., AI GO), and deep graph models. These broad-ranging potential risks have prompted concerns from national security agencies regarding their potentially disastrous consequences.

A backdoor in a login system might take the form of a hard coded user and password combination which gives access to the system. An example of this sort of backdoor was used as a plot device in the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;, in which the architect of the &quot;WOPR&quot; computer system had inserted a hardcoded password-less account which gave the user access to the system, and to undocumented parts of the system (in particular, a video game-like simulation mode and direct interaction with the artificial intelligence).

Although the number of backdoors in systems using proprietary software (software whose source code is not publicly available) is not widely credited, they are nevertheless frequently exposed. Programmers have even succeeded in secretly installing large amounts of benign code as Easter eggs in programs, although such cases may involve official forbearance, if not actual permission.

==Politics and attribution==

There are a number of cloak and dagger considerations that come into play when apportioning responsibility.

Covert backdoors sometimes masquerade as inadvertent defects (bugs) for reasons of plausible deniability. In some cases, these might begin life as an actual bug (inadvertent error), which, once discovered are then deliberately left unfixed and undisclosed, whether by a rogue employee for personal advantage, or with executive awareness and oversight.

It is also possible for an entirely above-board corporation&#x27;s technology base to be covertly and untraceably tainted by external agents (hackers), though this level of sophistication is thought to exist mainly at the level of nation state actors. For example, if a photomask obtained from a photomask supplier differs in a few gates from its photomask specification, a chip manufacturer would be hard-pressed to detect this if otherwise functionally silent; a covert rootkit running in the photomask etching equipment could enact this discrepancy unbeknown to the photomask manufacturer, either, and by such means, one backdoor potentially leads to another.

In general terms, the long dependency-chains in the modern, highly specialized technological economy and innumerable human-elements process control-points make it difficult to conclusively pinpoint responsibility at such time as a covert backdoor becomes unveiled.

Even direct admissions of responsibility must be scrutinized carefully if the confessing party is beholden to other powerful interests.

==Examples==
===Worms===
Many computer worms, such as Sobig and Mydoom, install a backdoor on the affected computer (generally a PC on broadband running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook). Such backdoors appear to be installed so that spammers can send junk e-mail from the infected machines. Others, such as the Sony/BMG rootkit, placed secretly on millions of music CDs through late 2005, are intended as DRM measures—and, in that case, as data-gathering agents, since both surreptitious programs they installed routinely contacted central servers.

A sophisticated attempt to plant a backdoor in the Linux kernel, exposed in November 2003, added a small and subtle code change by subverting the revision control system. In this case, a two-line change appeared to &quot;check&quot; root access permissions of a caller to the sys_wait4 function, but because it used assignment codice_1 instead of equality checking codice_2, it actually &quot;granted&quot; permissions to the system. This difference is easily overlooked, and could even be interpreted as an accidental typographical error, rather than an intentional attack.

In January 2014, a backdoor was discovered in certain Samsung Android products, like the Galaxy devices. The Samsung proprietary Android versions are fitted with a backdoor that provides remote access to the data stored on the device. In particular, the Samsung Android software that is in charge of handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as remote file server (RFS) commands, that allows the backdoor operator to perform via modem remote I/O operations on the device hard disk or other storage. As the modem is running Samsung proprietary Android software, it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control that could then be used to issue the RFS commands and thus to access the file system on the device.

===Object code backdoors===
Harder to detect backdoors involve modifying object code, rather than source code—object code is much harder to inspect, as it is designed to be machine-readable, not human-readable. These backdoors can be inserted either directly in the on-disk object code, or inserted at some point during compilation, assembly linking, or loading—in the latter case the backdoor never appears on disk, only in memory. Object code backdoors are difficult to detect by inspection of the object code, but are easily detected by simply checking for changes (differences), notably in length or in checksum, and in some cases can be detected or analyzed by disassembling the object code. Further, object code backdoors can be removed (assuming source code is available) by simply recompiling from source on a trusted system.

Thus for such backdoors to avoid detection, all extant copies of a binary must be subverted, and any validation checksums must also be compromised, and source must be unavailable, to prevent recompilation. Alternatively, these other tools (length checks, diff, checksumming, disassemblers) can themselves be compromised to conceal the backdoor, for example detecting that the subverted binary is being checksummed and returning the expected value, not the actual value. To conceal these further subversions, the tools must also conceal the changes in themselves—for example, a subverted checksummer must also detect if it is checksumming itself (or other subverted tools) and return false values. This leads to extensive changes in the system and tools being needed to conceal a single change.

As object code can be regenerated by recompiling (reassembling, relinking) the original source code, making a persistent object code backdoor (without modifying source code) requires subverting the compiler itself—so that when it detects that it is compiling the program under attack it inserts the backdoor—or alternatively the assembler, linker, or loader. As this requires subverting the compiler, this in turn can be fixed by recompiling the compiler, removing the backdoor insertion code. This defense can in turn be subverted by putting a source meta-backdoor in the compiler, so that when it detects that it is compiling itself it then inserts this meta-backdoor generator, together with the original backdoor generator for the original program under attack. After this is done, the source meta-backdoor can be removed, and the compiler recompiled from original source with the compromised compiler executable: the backdoor has been bootstrapped. This attack dates to a 1974 paper by Karger and Schell, and was popularized in Thompson&#x27;s 1984 article, entitled &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot;; it is hence colloquially known as the &quot;Trusting Trust&quot; attack. See compiler backdoors, below, for details. Analogous attacks can target lower levels of the system,
such as the operating system, and can be inserted during the system booting process; these are also mentioned by Karger and Schell in 1974, and now exist in the form of boot sector viruses.

===Asymmetric backdoors===
A traditional backdoor is a symmetric backdoor: anyone that finds the backdoor can in turn use it. The notion of an asymmetric backdoor was introduced by Adam Young and Moti Yung in the &quot;Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology – Crypto &#x27;96&quot;. An asymmetric backdoor can only be used by the attacker who plants it, even if the full implementation of the backdoor becomes public (e.g. via publishing, being discovered and disclosed by reverse engineering, etc.). Also, it is computationally intractable to detect the presence of an asymmetric backdoor under black-box queries. This class of attacks have been termed kleptography; they can be carried out in software, hardware (for example, smartcards), or a combination of the two. The theory of asymmetric backdoors is part of a larger field now called cryptovirology. Notably, NSA inserted a kleptographic backdoor into the Dual EC DRBG standard.

There exists an experimental asymmetric backdoor in RSA key generation. This OpenSSL RSA backdoor, designed by Young and Yung, utilizes a twisted pair of elliptic curves, and has been made available.

==Compiler backdoors==
A sophisticated form of black box backdoor is a compiler backdoor, where not only is a compiler subverted—to insert a backdoor in some other program, such as a login program—but it is further modified to detect when it is compiling itself and then inserts both the backdoor insertion code (targeting the other program) and the code-modifying self-compilation, like the mechanism through which retroviruses infect their host. This can be done by modifying the source code, and the resulting compromised compiler (object code) can compile the original (unmodified) source code and insert itself: the exploit has been boot-strapped.

This attack was originally presented in Karger &amp; Schell (1974), which was a United States Air Force security analysis of Multics, where they described such an attack on a PL/I compiler, and call it a &quot;compiler trap door&quot;. They also mention a variant where the system initialization code is modified to insert a backdoor during booting, as this is complex and poorly understood, and call it an &quot;initialization trapdoor&quot;; this is now known as a boot sector virus.

This attack was then actually implemented by Ken Thompson, and popularized in his Turing Award acceptance speech in 1983, &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot;, which points out that trust is relative, and the only software one can truly trust is code where every step of the bootstrapping has been inspected. This backdoor mechanism is based on the fact that people only review source (human-written) code, and not compiled machine code (object code). A program called a compiler is used to create the second from the first, and the compiler is usually trusted to do an honest job.

Thompson&#x27;s paper describes a modified version of the Unix C compiler that would put an invisible backdoor in the Unix login command when it noticed that the login program was being compiled, and would also add this feature undetectably to future compiler versions upon their compilation as well. As the compiler itself was a compiled program, users would be extremely unlikely to notice the machine code instructions that performed these tasks. (Because of the second task, the compiler&#x27;s source code would appear &quot;clean&quot;.) What&#x27;s worse, in Thompson&#x27;s proof of concept implementation, the subverted compiler also subverted the analysis program (the disassembler), so that anyone who examined the binaries in the usual way would not actually see the real code that was running, but something else instead.

Karger and Schell gave an updated analysis of the original exploit in 2002, and, in 2009, Wheeler wrote a historical overview and survey of the literature. In 2023, Cox published an annotated version of Thompson&#x27;s backdoor source code.

===Occurrences===
Thompson&#x27;s version was, officially, never released into the wild. However, it is believed that a version was distributed to BBN and at least one use of the backdoor was recorded. There are scattered anecdotal reports of such backdoors in subsequent years.

In August 2009, an attack of this kind was discovered by Sophos labs. The W32/Induc-A virus infected the program compiler for Delphi, a Windows programming language. The virus introduced its own code to the compilation of new Delphi programs, allowing it to infect and propagate to many systems, without the knowledge of the software programmer. The virus looks for a Delphi installation, modifies the SysConst.pas file, which is the source code of a part of the standard library and compiles it. After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus. An attack that propagates by building its own Trojan horse can be especially hard to discover. It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was. It is believed that the Induc-A virus had been propagating for at least a year before it was discovered.

In 2015, a malicious copy of Xcode, XcodeGhost, also performed a similar attack and infected iOS apps from a dozen of software companies in China. Globally, 4,000 apps were found to be affected. It was not a true Thompson Trojan, as it does not infect development tools themselves, but it did prove that toolchain poisoning can cause substantial damages.

===Countermeasures===
Once a system has been compromised with a backdoor or Trojan horse, such as the &quot;Trusting Trust&quot; compiler, it is very hard for the &quot;rightful&quot; user to regain control of the system – typically one should rebuild a clean system and transfer data (but not executables) over. However, several practical weaknesses in the &quot;Trusting Trust&quot; scheme have been suggested. For example, a sufficiently motivated user could painstakingly review the machine code of the untrusted compiler before using it. As mentioned above, there are ways to hide the Trojan horse, such as subverting the disassembler; but there are ways to counter that defense, too, such as writing a disassembler from scratch.

A generic method to counter trusting trust attacks is called diverse double-compiling. The method requires a different compiler and the source code of the compiler-under-test. That source, compiled with both compilers, results in two different stage-1 compilers, which however should have the same behavior. Thus the same source compiled with both stage-1 compilers must then result in two identical stage-2 compilers. A formal proof is given that the latter comparison guarantees that the purported source code and executable of the compiler-under-test correspond, under some assumptions. This method was applied by its author to verify that the C compiler of the GCC suite (v. 3.0.4) contained no trojan, using icc (v. 11.0) as the different compiler.

In practice such verifications are not done by end users, except in extreme circumstances of intrusion detection and analysis, due to the rarity of such sophisticated attacks, and because programs are typically distributed in binary form. Removing backdoors (including compiler backdoors) is typically done by simply rebuilding a clean system. However, the sophisticated verifications are of interest to operating system vendors, to ensure that they are not distributing a compromised system, and in high-security settings, where such attacks are a realistic concern.

==List of known backdoors==
* Back Orifice was created in 1998 by hackers from Cult of the Dead Cow group as a remote administration tool. It allowed Windows computers to be remotely controlled over a network and parodied the name of Microsoft&#x27;s BackOffice.
* The Dual EC DRBG cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator was revealed in 2013 to possibly have a kleptographic backdoor deliberately inserted by NSA, who also had the private key to the backdoor.
* Several backdoors in the unlicensed copies of WordPress plug-ins were discovered in March 2014. They were inserted as obfuscated JavaScript code and silently created, for example, an admin account in the website database. A similar scheme was later exposed in a Joomla plugin.
* Borland Interbase versions 4.0 through 6.0 had a hard-coded backdoor, put there by the developers. The server code contains a compiled-in backdoor account (username: &quot;politically&quot;, password: &quot;correct&quot;), which could be accessed over a network connection; a user logging in with this backdoor account could take full control over all Interbase databases. The backdoor was detected in 2001 and a patch was released.
* Juniper Networks backdoor inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of firmware ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20 that gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.
* Several backdoors were discovered in C-DATA Optical Line Termination (OLT) devices. Researchers released the findings without notifying C-DATA because they believe the backdoors were intentionally placed by the vendor.
* A backdoor in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the popular Linux utility XZ Utils was discovered in March 2024 by software developer Andres Freund. The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux systems. The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

<doc id="360792" wikidata="Q477948" url="?curid=360792" title="Monkey D. Luffy">
<text>, also known as is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga series &quot;One Piece&quot; created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits.

Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as &quot;King of the Pirates&quot;.

He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different &quot;Gears;&quot; this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army; and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.

Luffy appears in most episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga&#x27;s anime adaptations, as well as in several of the franchise&#x27;s video games. Due to the series&#x27; international popularity, Luffy is one of the world&#x27;s most recognizable manga and anime characters. Beyond the &quot;One Piece franchise&quot;, the character also appears in various manga, anime series, and collaborative video games. His critical reception has been largely positive.

==Creation and conception==
===Development===
When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a &quot;manliness&quot; similar to that of Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. Oda said that he named his main character &quot;Luffy&quot; because he felt that the name suited him. When he later learned about the sailing term, &quot;luffing&quot;, he was delighted by the coincidence. In his prototype one-shot, &quot;Romance Dawn&quot;, Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of &quot;One Piece&quot;. In the second version of &quot;Romance Dawn&quot;, Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series. After the one-shot of &quot;One Piece&quot; was made, Oda contacted his former mentor, Nobuhiro Watsuki, whom he assisted in making the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. Watsuki was pleased with Luffy&#x27;s characterization and advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will. To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect and tries to make the character straightforward. In retrospect, Watsuki felt characters like Luffy reflect a trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his character Himura Kenshin.

===Portrayals===
In the original Japanese version of the &quot;One Piece&quot; anime series and later spin-offs of the franchise, Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka. Tanaka said jokingly that she regrets providing Luffy&#x27;s voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger. Asked about her voicing, Tanaka said that she &quot;strives for reality&quot; in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his nose. In the OVA &quot;Defeat the Pirate Ganzack!&quot;, Luffy was voiced by Urara Takano.

In Odex&#x27;s English-dubbed VCDs produced by Voiceovers Unlimited, Luffy is voiced by Chuck Powers, the director of said English version. In this edition his name is mispronounced as &quot;Luh-fee&quot; (). The character was voiced by Erica Schroeder in 4Kids Entertainment&#x27;s English-language dubs of the franchise between 2004–2006. Following Funimation/Crunchyroll&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise license in 2007, Colleen Clinkenbeard became the voice of Luffy in all English-language releases.

In the live action adaptation of &quot;One Piece&quot;, Luffy is portrayed by Mexican actor Iñaki Godoy, while Colton Osorio plays Luffy as a kid. Godoy and Tanaka reprised their roles as Luffy in the Latin America Spanish and Japanese dubs of the adaptation respectively.

==Description==
Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from &quot;Red-Haired&quot; Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts. The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew. He later wears a red vest, denim shorts, and sandals, before replacing his vest with a red, unbuttoned sea captain&#x27;s coat (revealing the X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu), and a yellow sash tied around his waist. In an interview, Eiichiro Oda said Luffy&#x27;s real-world nationality analogue is Brazilian.

===Personality===
Luffy is portrayed as a carefree, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself. Optimistic and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be, and he often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect. Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy &quot;enjoys playing stupid&quot;; Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.

He enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance, but also because of his instinctive ability to read people. Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew (cook, navigator, medic, musician, and shipwright, filled by Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Franky, respectively). At the beginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality, each crew member respects him in their own way. Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is right at the moment, even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force. He is an extremely loyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the well-being of his crew.

===Abilities===
====Devil Fruit====
Luffy&#x27;s rubber attributes are a result of him eating a devil fruit called the Human-Human fruit model Sun God Nika. This devil fruit is thought to be called the Gum-Gum fruit due to the world government&#x27;s propaganda. Granting him a rubber-like body, his powers make him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces, but he is susceptible to attacks made with a sharp object or weapon (eg. sword, spear). His rubber devil fruit powers grant him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches, kicks, head butts, and many other varied attacks as seen throughout the series. Like, others who have eaten a Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength, durability, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance, and stamina.

Luffy&#x27;s signature attack is the , a punch which he learned during years of training. Another technique developed later in the series is , which increases his strength and speed for a short time but strains his body and can shorten his lifespan if used too long. Observing CP9&#x27;s technique, Luffy adapts the move to his rubber body and can make his arms or legs bigger. , another technique, uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterward. Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; after the two year time skip, he gains better control of these techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks.

Luffy develops another technique, (similar to Gear 3), inflating his muscles with air to increase the size of his body (except for his legs) while his limbs are coated in Armament Haki. In contrast to Gears 2 and 3, Luffy uses compression rather than extension for his attacks, compressing and releasing his limbs to dish out devastating blows. The force of his kicks are to an extent that he uses them to fly in a similar fashion to CP9&#x27;s technique.

Later, it is revealed that the Gum-Gum Fruit&#x27;s real name is the &quot;Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika&quot;, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit whose &quot;awakening&quot; grants Luffy&#x27;s rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, including turning the environment and other living beings into rubber, which is limited only by the user&#x27;s imagination. It is for this reason that the user is said to become a trickster sun god known as the &quot;embodiment of freedom&quot;, able to bring joy to the people around them and making it &quot;the most ridiculous power in the world&quot;. In , Luffy&#x27;s hair and clothes also turn white. The World Government renamed it to erase the fruit&#x27;s original name from history and reclassified it as a Paramecia in order to conceal its true nature. The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World Government for over 800 years until it was stolen by Red-haired Shanks. According to the Five Elders, the fruit had not been awakened for centuries prior to Luffy&#x27;s having done so.

====Haki====
Luffy has the ability to use . This ability has three types: , an armor-like force, which can amplify defense and the force of attacks and negate a Devil Fruit user&#x27;s defense, allow physical contact and damage; , a sixth sense, which can read a person&#x27;s moves and detect their presence; and , which can render weak-willed people or animals near him unconscious. Luffy learns all those types of Haki and uses them with his improved attacks. As a result of his encounter with Magellan, he has also developed an immunity to poison (although it is shown that a strong poison may affect him, albeit very slowly). During his fight against Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy gains an advanced form of Observation Haki (Called Future Sight) to see several seconds into the future. During his time at Udon prison in Wano, Luffy gains two new advanced forms of Armament Haki. The first one is called Emission to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance while the second one is called Internal Destruction which can also go inside his target&#x27;s body or objects and destroy it from within. During his fight with Kaidou at the top of Onigashima, Luffy unlocks an advanced form of Conqueror&#x27;s Haki. It is the ability to coat his entire body with it, similar to Armament Haki, which could further enhance his attacks.

===Bounty===
Throughout &quot;One Piece&quot;, the bounty placed on Luffy continually increases as he faces off against increasingly powerful pirates, representing his notoriety in the &quot;One Piece&quot; world. After defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong of East Blue, early on in the series, Luffy&#x27;s initial bounty is set to 30,000,000 Berries. By the major timeskip in &quot;One Piece&quot;, this number had increased to 400,000,000 Berries after defeating some of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, rampaging at Enies Lobby, and retaking Nico Robin. After defeating the pirate emperor Kaido, Luffy&#x27;s total bounty has increased to 3 billion Berries after becoming one of the &quot;Four Emperors in the New World.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;One Piece&quot;===

Luffy first appears as a young boy in Windmill Village located in the Goa kingdom, where he befriends the pirate &quot;Red-Haired&quot; Shanks and intends to become one himself. He accidentally eats the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit and acquires rubber powers at the cost of being unable to swim. Shanks later saves Luffy from being devoured by a Sea King, a monstrous sea beast, at the cost of his left arm. Before departing Windmill Village, Shanks gives Luffy his treasured straw hat, on the condition that he becomes a great pirate someday and returns it to him. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in a small fishing boat in search of the legendary treasure &#x27;One Piece&#x27; to become the next King of the Pirates. He meets swordsman Roronoa Zoro, ocean navigator and thief Nami, cowardly marksman and liar Usopp, and chivalrous chef Sanji and invites them to join his crew, while procuring a ship named the &quot;Going Merry&quot; Luffy also encounters and defeats the top East Blue pirates Buggy the Clown, Don Krieg and the Fishman Arlong, gaining his first bounty from the Marines.

The crew enters the dangerous Grand Line on their ship, the &quot;Going Merry&quot;. Luffy encounters and offers to return Princess Nefertari Vivi of Alabasta to her homeland to stop a rebellion incited by Seven Warlords of the Sea member and Baroque Works crime syndicate leader Sir Crocodile. On the way, Nami contracts a severe illness and the crew goes to find a doctor on the winter Drum Island. After Nami is healed, the reindeer doctor Tony Tony Chopper joins the Straw Hat crew. Upon arriving in Alabasta, Luffy briefly reunites with his brother Portgas D. Ace, a commander in the Whitebeard Pirates, who is hunting the traitor Blackbeard. Luffy defeats Crocodile, though the World Government censors his involvement. Luffy then accepts Crocodile&#x27;s mysterious partner Nico Robin as the archeologist of his crew.

Robin&#x27;s knowledge alerts the crew to the existence of Sky Islands. Luffy meets Blackbeard — but does not find out his name. Blackbeard encourages Luffy to find the Sky Island, saying that the dreams of pirates never die. The crew successfully reaches Skypiea, where the crew is drawn into a four-hundred-year war over land. Luffy ends the war by defeating the god Eneru.

Upon landing back in the Blue Seas, the &quot;Going Merry&quot; is heavily damaged and Luffy seeks a shipwright to repair it. He meets Marine Admiral Aokiji, who easily defeats him but allows the crew to continue their voyage. The crew arrives at Water 7, the island with the best shipwrights in the world, where Robin mysteriously leaves with members of the World Government intelligence agency Cipher Pol No. 9. Luffy&#x27;s crew aligns with the cyborg shipwright Franky, initially an enemy, and storm the Government&#x27;s courthouse Enies Lobby to retrieve her. Robin reveals her past as a fugitive of the Government, but the Straw Hats declare war on the Government to affirm their commitment to her. After defeating CP9 and escaping Enies Lobby, Luffy encounters his grandfather, Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Garp tells him Shanks and Whitebeard are two of the Four Emperors, the most powerful pirates in the second half of the Grand Line. Luffy is surprised to learn from Garp that the leader of the Revolutionary Army which seeks to topple the World Government is Monkey D. Dragon, Luffy&#x27;s father.

On the way to Fishman Island in their new ship, the &quot;Thousand Sunny&quot;, which Franky built, Luffy encounters the skeletal musician Brook. Brook accepts Luffy&#x27;s offer to join the crew before declining since his shadow has been stolen. To return Brook&#x27;s shadow, they defeat Warlord Gecko Moria, and Brook becomes Luffy&#x27;s long-sought musician of the crew.

To enter Fishman Island, the crew takes a detour to the Sabaody Archipelago. By this time, Luffy has gained worldwide fame among the notorious rookie pirates with bounties of over 100 million Berries; these rookies are known as Supernovas and include Zoro, Trafalgar Law, Eustass Kidd, and Capone &quot;Gang&quot; Bege. The Roger Pirates&#x27; retired First Mate, Silvers Rayleigh, takes a liking to Luffy and agrees to coat the &quot;Thousand Sunny&quot; to sail into the ocean depths. However, the plan is derailed after Luffy attacks a World Noble for harming a friend, and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates are easily defeated by Admiral Kizaru and scattered to different parts of the world by Warlord Bartholomew Kuma.

Stranded on Amazon Lily, an island ruled by the warlord Boa Hancock, Luffy impresses her with his bravery and selflessness. While on Amazon Lily, Luffy learns that his brother Ace was defeated by Blackbeard and handed over to the World Government for execution. Hancock helps him infiltrate the underwater prison Impel Down to rescue Ace. Inside he meets previous foes and new allies, such as former Warlords Crocodile and Arlong&#x27;s old captain Jimbei. Along with Buggy and members of the Revolutionary Army, Luffy frees the prisoners, but Ace is transferred to Marineford for his execution. Luffy and Buggy lead the prisoners into the war in Marineford between the navy and Whitebeard&#x27;s forces. Whitebeard is eventually impressed by Luffy&#x27;s spirit and orders his men to support Luffy directly. Although Ace is freed, he gives his life to save Luffy from Admiral Akainu. A broken-hearted Luffy is evacuated with Jimbei from Marineford by Trafalgar Law.

Returning to Amazon Lily, Luffy remembers first meeting Ace; after Shanks left Windmill Village, Luffy&#x27;s grandfather Garp left him in the care of his friend, the bandit Curly Dadan. Luffy befriends Ace and Sabo, who are like brothers to him, but Sabo is seemingly killed by a World Noble. After returning to Marineford to send a hidden message to his crew, Luffy trains with Rayleigh on Ruskaina Island to learn Haki.

Two years later, the Straw Hats reunite and finally make it to Fishman Island. Luffy and the others meet Jimbei and the island&#x27;s princess, Shirahoshi, and are drawn into a battle for the island against the Fishman supremacist Hody Jones. He, the crew, and Jimbei conceive a plan to defeat Hody and his henchmen in a way that will alleviate racial tensions between humans and fish-men. After Hody&#x27;s defeat, Jimbei promises to join the crew at a later date and Fishman Island seeks to join the Reverie summit of human kings, held every four years. Luffy learns Akainu was promoted to Fleet Admiral and Blackbeard replaced Whitebeard as one of the Four Emperors. Luffy begins a feud with Emperor Big Mom over control of Fishman Island. The crew leaves the ocean depths and enters the secret New World island, Punk Hazard.

Upon arriving at Punk Hazard, half of the crew is captured by Caesar Clown, a subordinate of the Warlord and underworld broker Donquixote Doflamingo. Luffy and his crew ally with Trafalgar Law, now a Warlord, who plans to kidnap Caesar as part of a plan to take down Doflamingo and eventually his customer, Emperor Kaido. Samurai from the Wano Country, Kinemon, and Momonosuke join the alliance to venture to Dressrosa, the kingdom ruled by Doflamingo.

With Caesar hostage, the alliance lands on Dressrosa, where Luffy enters a tournament to win Ace&#x27;s Devil Fruit. Here he finds out that Sabo is still alive and is part of the Revolutionary Army. Sabo wins the tournament, and with Luffy&#x27;s blessing, Sabo consumes Ace&#x27;s Devil Fruit. Due to the machinations of Doflamingo, some of the crew is forced to leave for the island of Zou. Luffy and the rest of the crew are forced to fight for their lives when they stumble on the truth of Doflamingo&#x27;s operations, who attempts to kill everyone in Dressrosa to keep the truth of his rule hidden. With the aid of his fellow competitors in the tournament, Luffy defeats Doflamingo. In the aftermath, seven pirate crews pledge their loyalty to Luffy, despite his protests, marking the formation of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

Afterward, the remaining crew and their friends arrive at Zou and learn it was devastated by Kaido&#x27;s army. Luffy also learns that Sanji, who joined the first group to Zou, had been blackmailed by his family into an arranged marriage to the daughter of Emperor Big Mom. The crew learns from the Mink Tribe about the Road Poneglyphs and their connection to the final island Laugh Tale, where the One Piece is. An alliance between the Samurai, Mink, Straw Hats and Law is made to defeat Kaido, who rules over Wano via a puppet Shogun.

Before storming Wano, half the crew, along with the Mink warriors Pedro and Carrot, infiltrate Big Mom&#x27;s territory Tottoland both to retrieve Sanji and copy the writing on the Road Poneglyph that Big Mom has in her possession. Luffy and Sanji learn the wedding is a set-up to murder Sanji&#x27;s family and steal their advanced technology, while Brook steals a printing of the Road Poneglyph. The crew reunites with Jimbei, revealed to be indebted to Big Mom but intent on defecting to Luffy&#x27;s crew. They ally with Capone Bege to assassinate Big Mom at the wedding, though the plan goes awry. As the crew attempts to escape, Luffy defeats her general Charlotte Katakuri, discovering an advanced application of Observation Haki in the process. Jimbei formally joins the crew, but stays behind to aid his former Fishman crewmates in holding off the Big Mom Pirates as Luffy&#x27;s crew escapes.

News of Luffy&#x27;s fight with Big Mom and the reveal of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet cause Luffy&#x27;s bounty to skyrocket. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats are separated entering the Wano Country. Luffy befriends the residents and promises to improve their lives. After Kaido attacks his friend Tama, Luffy challenges the Emperor but is defeated and thrown in prison. There, he re-encounters Eustass Kid and trains under Hyogoro of the Flower, learning a new form of Armament Haki that will enable him to damage Kaido. Luffy&#x27;s allies liberate the prison and makes plans to attack the island of Onigashima where Kaido resides. Jimbei arrives in Wano, and on the night of Wano&#x27;s annual Fire Festival, an alliance of the Straw Hat, Heart and Kid pirates, the retainers of Kozuki Oden and an army of Samurai, launch a raid on Onigashima. Luffy faces Kaido across several bouts that push him to his limits. The Five Elders send CP0 to interfere with the fight, fearing the repercussions of Luffy winning. Despite suffering an apparently fatal blow from Kaido as a result, the thrill triggers the awakening of Luffy&#x27;s Devil Fruit—now revealed to be the mythical Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika. In his new transformation, dubbed &quot;Gear Fifth&quot;, Luffy can fight in any shape he likes and successfully overwhelms Kaido, liberating Wano from his rule. A week after these events, Luffy is pronounced a new member of the Four Emperors.

After departing Wano, the Straw Hats reach the island of Egghead where the World Government&#x27;s lead scientist Dr. Vegapunk resides. Jewelry Bonney also arrives, seeking to avenge her father Kuma&#x27;s transformation into a cyborg by Vegapunk Vegapunk admits to having studied the forbidden Void Century and requests that the Straw Hats help him escape an assassination attempt by CP0. The situation escalates when CP0 informs the Government of Luffy&#x27;s presence, and St. Jaygarcia Saturn arrives personally to eliminate him, accompanied by Kizaru.

<text>Bradyseism is the gradual uplift (positive bradyseism) or descent (negative bradyseism) of part of the Earth&#x27;s surface caused by the filling or emptying of an underground magma chamber or hydrothermal activity, particularly in volcanic calderas. It can persist for millennia in between eruptions and each uplift event is normally accompanied by thousands of small to moderate earthquakes. The word derives from the ancient Greek words &quot;bradús&quot;, meaning &quot;slow&quot;, and &quot;seismós&quot; meaning &quot;movement&quot;, and was coined by Arturo Issel in 1883.

==Phlegraean Fields==
The area of Phlegraean Fields (Campi Flegrei), near Naples, is a collapsed caldera, namely a volcanic area formed by several volcanic edifices, which includes the Solfatara volcano, well known for its fumaroles. The Campi Flegrei area is especially noted for bradyseismic uplift and subsidence. The inflation and deflation of this caldera is especially well documented due to its seaside location and a long history of habitation and construction in the area.

In particular, the town of Pozzuoli features the Roman Macellum of Pozzuoli in which three marble columns show bands of boreholes or &quot;Gastrochaenolites&quot; left by marine &quot;Lithophaga&quot; molluscs. These occur up to 7 metres up the columns, showing how bradyseism in the area lowered the land to at least this depth under the sea and subsequently raised it again.

More recently, between 1968 and 1972, the Campi Flegrei area suffered an episode of positive bradyseism and rose by 1.7 metres. Another rise of 1.8 metres occurred between 1982 and 1984. This correlated with a shallow (4 km deep) earthquake swarm during the same period, which led to the evacuation of 30,000 people due to the perceived risk of imminent eruption.

<doc id="360797" wikidata="Q1899132" url="?curid=360797" title="Black Friday (1978)">
<text>Black Friday () is the name given to an incident occurring on 8 September 1978 (17 Shahrivar 1357 in the Iranian calendar) in Iran, in which 64, or at least 100 people were shot dead and 205 injured by the Pahlavi military in Jaleh Square () in Tehran. According to the military historian Spencer C. Tucker, 94 were killed on Black Friday, consisting of 64 protesters and 30 government security forces. The deaths were described as the pivotal event in the Iranian Revolution that ended any &quot;hope for compromise&quot; between the protest movement and the regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

==Background==

As protests against the Shah&#x27;s rule continued during the first half of 1978, the Iranian government declared martial law. On 8 September, thousands gathered in Tehran&#x27;s Jaleh Square for a religious demonstration, unaware that the government had declared martial law a day earlier.

==Massacre==

Protestors had gathered in Jaleh Square for a religious demonstration even though the Shah had ordered martial law. The military came and told the protestors to leave but they did not. The military opened fire on the protestors killing many protestors. Jaleh Square ended any hope for the Shah compromising with the protestors.This bloodbath came to be known as “Black Friday” and was a huge catalyst for the Iranian Revolution, a process which has had enormous consequences for U.S. imperialism and the region.

==Aftermath==

Black Friday is thought to have marked the point of no return for the revolution, and it led to the abolition of Iran&#x27;s monarchy less than a year later. It is also believed that Black Friday played a crucial role in further radicalizing the protest movement, uniting the opposition to the Shah and mobilized the masses. The incident is described by historian Ervand Abrahamian as &quot;a sea of blood between the shah and the people.&quot; Initially, opposition and western journalists claimed that the Iranian army had massacred thousands of protesters. The clerical leadership announced that &quot;thousands have been massacred by Zionist troops&quot;. According to the historian Abbas Amanat: 

The events triggered protests that continued for another four months. The day after Black Friday, Amir-Abbas Hoveyda resigned as minister of court for unrelated reasons.

A general strike in October shut down the petroleum industry that was essential to the administration&#x27;s survival, &quot;sealing the Shah&#x27;s fate&quot;. The continuation of protests ultimately led to Shah leaving Iran in January 1979, clearing the way for the Iranian Revolution, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

==Legacy==
Initially, Western media and opposition reported &quot;15,000 dead and wounded&quot;, but Iranian government officials reported that 86 people had died in Tehran in the whole day. French social theorist Michel Foucault first reported that 2,000 to 3,000 people had died in Jaleh Square, and he later raised that number to 4,000. Johann Beukes, author of &quot;Foucault in Iran, 1978–1979&quot;, notes that &quot;Foucault seems to have adhered to this exaggerated death count at Jaleh Square, propagated by the revolting masses themselves. Thousands were wounded, but the death toll unlikely accounted to more than hundred casualties&quot;.

The BBC&#x27;s correspondent in Iran, Andrew Whitley, reported that hundreds had died.

According to the military historian Spencer C. Tucker, 94 were killed on Black Friday, consisting of 64 protesters and 30 government security forces. According to the Iranologist Richard Foltz, 64 protesters died at Jaleh Square.

According to Emadeddin Baghi, a former researcher at the Martyrs Foundation (&quot;Bonyad Shahid&quot;, part of the current Iranian government, which compensates families of victims) hired &quot;to make sense of the data&quot; on those killed on Black Friday, 64 were killed in Jaleh Square on Black Friday, with two females: one woman and a young girl. On the same day in other parts of the capital, 24 people died in clashes with martial law forces, with one female, making the total casualties on the same day to 88 deaths. Another source puts the Martyrs Foundation tabulation of dead at 84 during that day.

The square&#x27;s name was later changed to the Square of Martyrs (&quot;Maidan-e Shohada&quot;) by the Islamic republic.

Since the 2000s, some former Pahlavi Iranian politicians have suggested greater ambiguity in the situation, in particular the presence of Palestinian guerrillas in Iran, who they believe were agitators.

==In art==
===In Persian===

In 1978 shortly after the massacre, the Iranian musician Hossein Alizadeh set Siavash Kasraie&#x27;s poem about the event to music. Mohammad Reza Shajarian sang the piece &quot;Jāleh Khun Shod&quot; (&quot;Jaleh [Pers. &quot;the dew&quot;] turned to blood.&quot;).

===In English===
Nastaran Akhavan, one of the survivors, wrote the book &quot;Spared&quot; about the event. The book explains how the author was forced into a massive wave of thousands of angry protesters, who were later massacred by the Shah&#x27;s military. The 2016 adventure video game &quot;1979 Revolution: Black Friday&quot; is based on the event. The game is directed by Navid Khonsari, who was a child at the time of the revolution and admitted he did not have a realistic view of what was taking place. Khonsari described creating the game as &quot;[wanting] people to feel the passion and the elation of being in the revolution – of feeling that you could possibly make a change.&quot;

<doc id="360802" wikidata="Q510573" url="?curid=360802" title="Mount Edith Cavell">
<text>Mount Edith Cavell is a mountain in the Athabasca River and Astoria River valleys of Jasper National Park, and the most prominent peak entirely within Alberta.

The mountain was named in 1916 for Edith Cavell, a British nurse executed by the Germans during World War I for having helped Allied soldiers escape from occupied Belgium to the Netherlands, in violation of German military law. It was previously known as Mount Fitzhugh.

A close-up view of the north face of Mount Edith Cavell is visible after a short hike to Cavell Meadows. The trailhead is by the parking lot at the end of Mount Edith Cavell Road. The trail to the meadows is one way, rising to . &quot;The Canadian Rockies Trail Guide&quot; describes the trail in detail.

The hanging Angel Glacier is visible from Cavell Meadows, which spills over a cliff on the north face.

Access to the Tonquin Valley trails can be found about one kilometre before the end of the Mount Edith Cavell Road. There is a parking area across from the Mount Edith Cavell Hostel. A short walk down the gravel path leads to the north end of Cavell Lake. There is small bridge across the stream that empties the lake. From here there are good views with the lake in the foreground and the Mount Edith Cavell massif in the background.

It is believed that one of the world&#x27;s largest glacial erratics, called Big Rock, near Okotoks, Alberta, was once part of Mount Edith Cavell. The erratic was formed approximately ten thousand years ago when a large portion of quartzite stone was stripped away from the mountain along with the receding Athabasca River Valley glacier.

== Climbing routes ==
There are several popular climbing routes, including:
* West Ridge (normal route): Yosemite Decimal System II
* East Ridge: Yosemite Decimal System III, 5.3
* North Face, East Summit: Yosemite Decimal System IV, 5.8

The North Face route is included as a classic climb in Steck and Roper&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;.

==Notable ascents==
* 1961 &quot;North Face&quot;, IV 5.7, First ascent by Yvon Chouinard, Fred Beckey and Dan Doody. July 20–21.
* 1966 &quot;North Face&quot;, Second ascent by Denny Eberl and Gray Thompson. July 30, 1966.
* 1967 &quot;North Face&quot;, First solo ascent by Royal Robbins.
*1981 &quot;North Face&quot;, Second solo ascent by Dane Burns- North Face, via the Chouinard, Becky, Doody. 7hrs from the parking lot to the summit, with a direct line left of the Angle Glacier on the lower slopes and directly up the shale at the summit. 

==In philately==
Mount Edith Cavell was featured on a $1 Canadian stamp issued on December 4, 1930.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, the mountain is in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Athabasca River.

<doc id="360804" wikidata="Q273446" url="?curid=360804" title="Great Basin Desert">
<text>The Great Basin Desert is part of the Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch Range in the western United States. The desert is a geographical region that largely overlaps the Great Basin shrub steppe defined by the World Wildlife Fund, and the Central Basin and Range ecoregion defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and United States Geological Survey. It is a temperate desert with hot, dry summers and snowy winters. The desert spans large portions of Nevada and Utah, and extends into eastern California. The desert is one of the four biologically defined deserts in North America, in addition to the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts.

Basin and range topography characterizes the desert: wide valleys bordered by parallel mountain ranges generally oriented north–south. There are more than 33 peaks within the desert with summits higher than , but valleys in the region are also high, most with elevations above . The biological communities of the Great Basin Desert vary according to altitude: from low salty dry lakes, up through rolling sagebrush valleys, to pinyon-juniper forests. The significant variation between valleys and peaks has created a variety of habitat niches which has in turn led to many small, isolated populations of genetically unique plant and animal species throughout the region. According to Grayson, more than 600 species of vertebrates live in the floristic Great Basin, which has a similar areal footprint to the ecoregion. Sixty-three of these species have been identified as species of conservation concern due to contracting natural habitats (for example, &quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;, &quot;Vulpes macrotis&quot;, &quot;Dipodomys ordii&quot;, and &quot;Phrynosoma platyrhinos&quot;).

The ecology of the desert varies across geography also. The desert&#x27;s high elevation and location between mountain ranges influences regional climate: the desert formed by the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada that blocks moisture from the Pacific Ocean, while the Rocky Mountains create a barrier effect that restricts moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Different locations in the desert have different amounts of precipitation depending on the strength of these rain shadows. The environment is influenced by Pleistocene lakes that dried after the last ice age: Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville. Each of these lakes left different amounts of salinity and alkalinity.

==Definition and boundaries==
The Great Basin Desert is defined by its animals and plants, yet the boundaries are unclear.

Scientists have different definitions of the Great Basin Desert, which are often defined by negatives. J. Robert Macey defines the &quot;Great Basin scrub desert as lacking creosote bush.&quot; The Great Basin Desert includes several arid basins lacking &quot;Larrea tridentata&quot; (chaparral) such as the &quot;Chalfant, Hammil, Benton, and Queen valleys,&quot; as well as all but the southeast portion of the Owens Valley. Conversely, the &quot;Panamint, Saline, and Eureka valleys&quot; have creosote bush, unlike the Deep Springs Valley which includes part of the Great Basin scrub desert.

The study and definition of ecoregions can also indicate the boundaries of the Great Basin Desert. In 1987 J.M. Omernik defined a desert ecoregion between the Sierra Nevada and Wasatch Range, naming it the &quot;Northern Basin and Range&quot; ecoregion. In 1999, the U.S. EPA renamed the &quot;Northern Basin and Range&quot; the &quot;Central Basin and Range&quot; and the &quot;(Snake River) High Desert&quot; the &quot;Northern Basin and Range&quot;. The World Wildlife Fund adopted the Basin and Range ecoregions from Omernik, but excised a small region of high-altitude areas which contain Holocene refugia, from the former &quot;Northern Basin and Range&quot; ecoregion and renamed it the &quot;Great Basin Shrub Steppe&quot;. Although the EPA had refined the boundaries of the Central Basin and Range ecoregion by 2003, when USGS geographer Christopher Soulard wrote his reports on the region, his maps used the 1999 boundary for the &quot;Central Basin and Range&quot;, which is essentially the same as the &quot;Great Basin Shrub Steppe&quot;. He states that the Great Basin Desert is &quot;encompassed within&quot; that area.

This article describes the general ecology of the region, including the high-elevation areas, and does not rely on minor differences in the definitions of the ecoregion or desert. See Great Basin montane forests for more specific details on the high-elevation ecoregion.

==Climate==
The climate of the Great Basin desert is characterized by extremes: hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters; frigid alpine ridges and warm, windy valleys; days over followed by nights near . This is the climate of the high desert.

The Great Basin desert climate begins with the Sierra Nevada in eastern California. Rising above sea level, this mountain range casts a large rain shadow over the desert. Weather coming in from the Pacific Ocean quickly loses its moisture as rain and snow as it is forced up and over the steep mountains. By the time it reaches the east side of the mountains, little moisture is left to bring to the desert. The rain shadow effect is more pronounced closer to the Sierra Nevada, with yearly precipitation in the Great Basin desert averaging in the west and inches in the east. Moisture that manages to reach the ecoregion tends to precipitate as rain and snow in higher elevations, primarily over the region&#x27;s long, parallel mountains. Ultimately, any precipitation that falls within the desert fails to drain either to the Atlantic Ocean or to the Pacific Ocean (thus the term &quot;basin&quot;). Instead, precipitation drains to ephemeral or saline lakes via streams, or disappears via evaporation or absorption into the soil. The desert is the coldest of the deserts in North America.
On any given day, the weather across the Great Basin desert is variable. The region is extremely mountainous, and the temperatures vary depending on the elevation. In general, temperature decreases 3.6 degrees F for every 1000 feet gained in elevation. This translates to as much as a difference between mountaintops and valley floors on the same day at the same time. In the heat of summer this difference can be even more pronounced. With some exceptions wind generally increases with elevation or altitude and thus strong winds are often encountered on mountain tops and ridges.

This dry climate and rugged topography proves too harsh for many plant and animal species; however, genetic adaptations to these conditions have led to reasonably high species richness within the ecoregion.

The Great Basin National Park, located in a central part of the Great Basin desert, provides perhaps the best example of a typical climate for the region. 
Fallon&#x27;s climate is typical of lower elevations in the western part of the Great Basin desert. Located in the Forty Mile Desert, precipitation is rare, and summers are hot, though temperatures are more moderate than those in deserts like the Mojave and Sonoran, due to the region&#x27;s higher elevation and latitude. Winters in this section of the basin are still cold, however.
The Great Salt Lake Desert, located near the northeast corner of the Great Basin desert, is an excellent example of a cold desert climate. Although still arid, it is worthy to note that this portion of the desert receives more precipitation than the similar playas and salt pans on the western edge of the Great Basin desert.
==Biological communities==
The pattern of &#x27;basin and range&#x27; with adjacent basins and ranges in this region results in incredible biological diversity. Climate, elevation, soil type, and many anthropogenic variables greatly influence the diversity and distribution of shrubland, grassland, and woodland communities in the desert. Across the high desert there are numerous sub-climates correlating to the varied elevations. Heading from the valley bottoms to the mountain peaks one will encounter constantly changing combinations of plant and animal species making up some 200 distinct biological communities. These communities can be generally grouped into six general communities or &quot;life zones&quot;.

===Shadscale zone===

In the lower valley bottoms where mountain run off evaporates to create saline soils is the shadscale zone. Plants in this community are adapted to living with very little precipitation, high heat, and saline conditions. The amount of water and the soil type in any one area will determine exactly which plants will live there. Certain areas of the valley floors may harbor no life. These parched areas that flood periodically are called playas. On the shores of the playas, shadscale is the dominant plant, but is kept company by iodine bush, saltgrass, spiny hopsage, winterfat, four-winged saltbrush, and green rabbitbrush. Trees are not found in this community. Big greasewood is the dominant shrub in more saline areas or where the water table is high. These shrubs and associated grasses typically produce abundant small seeds that are harvested by rodents and insects. The soil salinity and lack of moisture in this zone is not very conducive to most agriculture; however, livestock grazing and grain farming have historically contributed to a decline in the already scattered vegetation.

===Sagebrush zone===

The drop in soil salinity and increase in moisture as elevation increases leads to a transition to sagebrush (Artemisia) and grasses just above the shadscale zone. This expanse, called the sagebrush zone, constitutes the largest amount of land in the desert (38.7 percent) and is dominated by big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;) shrubland. The sagebrush zone occurs on the lower mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and bajadas. Areas in this zone that have wetter and less saline soils are dominated by big sagebrush. Low sagebrush or black sagebrush dominate areas with steep rocky slopes and shallow soils. Introduced annual grasses such as cheatgrass (&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;) and halogeton (&quot;Halogeton glomeratus&quot;) also characterize this zone, although native bunchgrasses once thrived amongst sagebrush. Historical fire suppression, adjusted fire frequency following the introduction of annual grasses and widespread livestock grazing have contributed to contraction of the sagebrush zone. According to Noss, 99 percent of the sagebrush-grass zone has been damaged by livestock, with major damage in 30 percent of the zone. Other shrubs commonly found in the sagebrush zone are rabbitbrush, bitterbrush, snowberry, and Mormon tea (ephedra).

===Pinyon-Juniper community===

The pinyon–juniper community is adjacent and above the sagebrush zone. The main plants in this community are singleleaf pinyon pine and Utah juniper, often with a sagebrush and bitterbrush understory. Other species of junipers also occur in this zone, including &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; and &quot;Juniperus occidentalis&quot;.

The elevational range of this zone varies, but it is usually found between , with lower limits determined by lack of moisture and the upper limits determined by temperature. The pinyon-juniper community consists of short evergreen trees that rarely grow over 20 feet in height. This zone of dense vegetation, made possible by thermal inversions and increased precipitation, is important to a wide variety of isolated animals that rely on this vegetation interface for survival (for example, &quot;Eutamias palmeri&quot;).

The trees are widely spaced and have an understory of a mixture of shrubs and herbaceous plants, often with nearly bare ground. These characteristics have led this zone to be named the &quot;pygmy forest&quot; by many scientists. The lower end of this zone is dominated by juniper; the middle is a combination of both species, and the upper end is dominated by pinyon.

===Montane community===
The taller ranges of the Great Basin desert have a montane community. Due to the great distances created by basins between these small forest habitats, various rock substrates, and local climates, montane forests are tremendously varied across the desert.
Isolated from one mountain range to the next, montane communities in the region have long individual histories, each one affected differently by chance factors of migration over vast expanses of desert. Smaller communities are also vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change and to genetic drift.

White fir, Douglas fir, and ponderosa pines are found in the middle elevations of some mountain ranges, while limber pine, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and bristlecone pines occupy the higher elevations, continuing to the upper tree line. Mountain mahogany often dominates drier, warmer south-facing slopes. Pure stands of aspen are also common in this community.

The bristlecone pine is an important species that is indicative of the Great Basin desert. Bristlecones live a long time, some for thousands of years. The harsh areas they occupy are often devoid of other plant life, so there is little competition and reduced risk of fire. The trees grow very slowly, producing very dense, disease-resistant wood. These factors contribute to the bristlecone&#x27;s long life.

===Alpine community===

Some mountain ranges in the Great Basin desert are high enough to have an alpine community; a community of low growing plants above the treeline. Treeline is generally found above in the Great Basin desert, moving downslope with higher latitudes. The plants that grow above treeline are separated from other such areas by miles of foothills and valleys. This &quot;island&quot; phenomenon produces many endemic species - species that have evolved while isolated on a particular mountain peak or range and are found only in that one place. Grasses, sedges, low perennial herbs, and wildflowers grow above treeline.

===Riparian community===
The riparian communities of the Great Basin desert cut across all elevations and life zones. In the Great Basin desert surface water is rapidly lost by evaporation or infiltration. However, areas around streams where plant life is abundant constitute a riparian area. Water-loving plants like willow, narrowleaf cottonwood, choke cherry, wild rose, and aspen are found along these wet areas. The willow has a spreading root network that allows it to reach all around for water and it also helps streams by slowing erosion. These plants provide wood for beavers. In this community, silver buffaloberry often provides shelter for North American porcupines.

==Subregions==

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines its Central Basin and Range ecoregion as Level III: it is at the third level of a tree of ecoregions that cover North America. It further defines sub-ecoregions at Level IV, which describe differences in the ecoregion at different locations. The map shows the Level IV EPA ecoregions in Nevada. The low-elevation ecoregions lie in the Great Basin shrub steppe, while the high-elevation ones lie in the Great Basin montane forests (as defined by the WWF).

===Salt deserts===
The Salt desert ecoregion is composed of nearly level playas, salt flats, mud flats, and saline lakes. These features are characteristic of the Bonneville Basin: they have a higher salt content than those of the Lahontan and Tonopah playas ecoregion, below. Water levels and salinity varies from year to year. During dry periods salt encrustation and wind erosion occur. Vegetation is mostly absent, although scattered salt-tolerant plants, such as pickleweed, iodinebush, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass occur. Soils are not arable and there is very limited grazing potential. The salt deserts provide wildlife habitat and serve some recreational, military, and industrial uses. A prime example of this ecoregion is the Bonneville Salt Flats.

===Shadscale-dominated saline basins===
The Shadscale-dominated saline basins ecoregion is arid, internally drained and gently sloping to nearly flat. These basins are in, or are characteristic of, the Bonneville Basin: they are higher in elevation and colder in winter than the Lahontan salt shrub basin ecoregion to the west. Light-colored soils with high salt and alkali content occur and are dry for extended periods. The saltbush vegetation common to this ecoregion has a higher tolerance for extremes in temperature, aridity, and salinity than big sagebrush, which dominates ecoregion 13c at somewhat higher elevation. The basins in Nevada, in contrast to those in Utah, are more constricted in area and are more influenced by nearby mountain ranges with extensive carbonate rock exposures, which provide water by percolation through the limestone substrate to surface as valley springs. Isolated valley drainages support endemic fish, such as the Newark Valley tui chub.

===Lahontan and Tonopah playas===

The nearly level and often barren Lahontan and Tonopah playas contain mudflats, alkali flats, and intermittent saline lakes, such as the Black Rock Desert, Carson Sink, and Sarcobatus Flat. Marshes, remnant lakes and playas are all that remain of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, which was once the size of Lake Erie. Playas occur in the lowest elevation of the Lahontan Basin, and represent the terminus or sink of rivers running east of the Sierra Nevada. The playas fill with seasonal runoff from the surrounding mountains, providing habitat for migratory birds. Black greasewood or four-winged saltbush may grow around the perimeter in the transition to the salt shrub community, where they often stabilize areas of low sand dunes. This ecoregion has limited grazing potential. Windblown salt dust from exposed playas may affect upland soils and vegetation. The Lahontan and Tonopah playas are important as wildlife habitat, as well as for recreational and military uses.

===Lahontan salt shrub basin===
The Lahontan salt shrub basin is an expansive dry plain that was once below Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. The Lahontan Basin, compared to the Bonneville Basin to the east, is lower in elevation and warmer in winter. Although there is a direct connection to the south to the Mojave Desert, winters are cold enough in this ecoregion to discourage the northward dispersal of Mojavean species into the Lahontan Basin. In addition to shadscale, other salt-tolerant shrubs, such as Shockley&#x27;s desert-thorn and Bailey greasewood, cover the lower basin slopes. These shrubs distinguish the Lahontan salt shrub basin and the Tonopah Basin from other Nevada salt shrub ecoregions. Sand dunes may occur where windblown sand accumulates against a barrier; dune complexes support a specialized plant community and diverse small mammal populations. The Carson and Truckee Rivers, originating in the Sierra Nevada, provide water for irrigated farming. Riparian corridors along these rivers support the only trees found in this ecoregion.

===Lahontan sagebrush slopes===

Hills, alluvial fans, and low mountains comprise the Lahontan sagebrush slopes ecoregion. These areas are rock controlled and their soils lack the fine lacustrine sediments that are found in lower parts of the Lahontan Basin. Because moisture increases and alkalinity decreases with elevation, the shrub community grades from the greasewood-shadscale community on the basin floor, to a shrub community dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush and the endemic Lahontan sagebrush at higher elevations. Understory grasses increase the productivity towards the northeast, outside the rain shadow influence of the Sierra Nevada. The low hills and mountains of the Lahontan Basin experience frequent summer lightning and fire. The introduced cheatgrass tends to replace the shrub community and provides fuel for recurrent fires.

===Lahontan uplands===
The Lahontan uplands are restricted to the highest elevations of the mountains ranges within the Lahontan salt shrub basin. Slopes vary in elevation from and are covered in sagebrush, grasses, and scattered Utah juniper. Pinyon grows with juniper on the Stillwater Range and on Fairview Peak in the southeast portion of the Lahontan Basin, but it is otherwise absent from this ecoregion. Low sagebrush and black sagebrush grow to the mountaintops above the woodland zone. Cool-season grasses, including bluebunch wheatgrass, dominate the understory in the north, but are replaced by warm-season grasses, such as Indian ricegrass, in the south.

===Upper Humboldt Plain===

The Upper Humboldt Plains ecoregion is an area of rolling plains punctuated by occasional buttes and low mountains. It is mostly underlain by volcanic ash, rhyolite, and tuffaceous rocks. Low sagebrush is common in extensive areas of shallow, stony soil, as are cool season grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and Sandberg bluegrass. The ecoregion is wetter and cooler than other Nevada ecoregions in its elevation range. The ecoregion is transitional to the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion that spans the Nevada-Oregon border. However, as in the warmer Lahontan Basin to the west, lightning fires are common and a post-fire monoculture of cheatgrass tends to replace the native grasses and shrubs. Grazing is the major land use, though there is some agriculture near the Humboldt River.

===Carbonate Sagebrush Valleys===
The basins and semi-arid uplands of the Carbonate Sagebrush Valleys surround the carbonate ranges of eastern Nevada. These valleys are underlain by limestone or dolomite. The combination of summer moisture and a limestone or dolomite substrate affects regional vegetation, particularly in terms of species dominance and elevational distribution. The substrate favors shrubs, such as black sagebrush and winterfat, that can tolerate shallow soil. Even in alluvial soils, root growth may be limited by a hardpan or caliche layer formed by carbonates leaching through the soil and accumulating. As a result, shrub cover is sparse in contrast to other sagebrush-covered ecoregions in Nevada. The grass understory grades from a dominance of cool season grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, in the north, to warm season grasses, such as blue grama (an indicator of summer rainfall) in the south.

===Central Nevada high valleys===

The Central Nevada high valleys ecoregion contains sagebrush-covered rolling valleys that are generally over in elevation. Alluvial fans spilling from the surrounding mountain ranges fill the valleys, often leaving little intervening flat ground. Wyoming big sagebrush and associated grasses are common on the flatter areas, and black sagebrush dominates on the volcanic hills and alluvial fans. This ecoregion tends to have lower species diversity than other sagebrush ecoregions, because of its aridity and isolation from more species-rich areas. Saline playas may occur on available flats. Less shadscale and fewer associated shrubs surround these playas than in other, lower more arid ecoregions in the west, including the Lahontan salt shrub ecoregion and the Tonopah Basin ecoregion. Valleys with permanent water support endemic fish populations, such as the Monitor Valley speckled dace.

===Central Nevada mid-slope woodland and brushland===
The Central Nevada mid-slope woodland and brushland ecoregion at of elevation is analogous in altitudinal range to other woodland areas in Nevada. However, continuous woodland is not as prevalent on the mountains of central Nevada as in other woodland ecoregions, such as ecoregions 13d and 13q. Pinyon-juniper grows only sparsely through the shrub layer due to combined effects of past fire, logging, and local climate factors, including lack of summer rain and the pattern of winter cold air inversions. Where extensive woodlands do exist, understory diversity tends to be very low, especially in closed canopy areas. Areas of black and Wyoming big sagebrush grade upward into mountain big sagebrush and curlleaf mountain-mahogany, which straddles the transition between this mid-elevation brushland and the mountain brush zone of the higher Central Nevada Bald Mountains.

===Central Nevada Bald Mountains===

The Central Nevada Bald Mountains are dry and mostly treeless. Although they rise only east of the Sierra Nevada, they lack Sierra species due to the dry conditions. These barren-looking mountains are covered instead by dense mountain brush that is dominated by mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, snowberry, and low sagebrush. They contrast with the High-elevation Carbonate Mountains to the east, where the mountain brush zone is too narrow to be mapped as a separate ecoregion. Scattered groves of curlleaf mountain-mahogany and aspen in moister microsites grow above the shrub layer. A few scattered limber or bristlecone pines grow on ranges that exceed . The Toiyabe Range (west of Big Smoky Valley) is high enough to have an alpine zone, but lacks a suitable substrate to retain snowmelt moisture. The isolation of these &quot;sky islands&quot; has led to the development of many rare and endemic plant species.

===Tonopah Basin===

The Tonopah Basin lies in the transition between the Great Basin Desert and the more southerly Mojave Desert. The basin shows varying characteristics of both deserts. The west side of the Tonopah Basin is a continuation of the Lahontan Basin, while the lower and hotter Pahranagat Valley on the east side is more like the Mojave Desert. Similar to basins further north, shadscale and associated arid land shrubs cover broad rolling valleys, hills, and alluvial fans. However, unlike the Lahontan salt shrub basin and Upper Lahontan basin, the shrubs often co-dominate in highly diverse mosaics. The shrub understory includes warm-season grasses, such as Indian ricegrass and galleta grass. Endemic fish species, including the Railroad Valley tui chub, Pahranagat roundtail chub, Railroad Valley springfish, and the White River springfish are found in valleys with perennial water.

==Endangered species==

The topography of the Great Basin desert (&quot;island&quot; mountain tops separated from one another by vast expanses of desert valleys) renders it vulnerable to extinctions. Populations that occupy the high peaks are isolated from one another; therefore, they cannot interbreed. Small populations are more vulnerable to the forces of extinction - generally small populations have less genetic diversity and therefore a lesser ability to adapt to changing conditions. Groundwater pumping, road and home construction, grazing, and mining are all activities that alter habitat; as more habitat is affected, the threat of extinction increases. The Great Basin desert is home to many threatened and endangered species:

*Birds
**Least tern (&quot;Sterna antillarum athalassos&quot;)
*Plants
**Sodaville milkvetch (&quot;Astragalas lentiginosus var. sesquimetralis&quot;)
**Ute lady&#x27;s tresses (&quot;Spiranthes diluvialis&quot;)
*Fish
**Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;)
**Desert dace (&quot;Eremichthys acros&quot;)
**White River spinedace (&quot;Lepidomeda albivallis&quot;)
*Mammals
**Utah prairie dog (&quot;Cynomys parvidens&quot;)

<text>DJ&#x27;s GNU Programming Platform (DJGPP) is a software development suite for Intel 80386-level and above, IBM PC compatibles which supports DOS operating systems. It is guided by DJ Delorie, who began the project in 1989. It is a port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and mostly GNU utilities such as Bash, find, tar, ls, GAWK, sed, and ld to DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI). Supported languages include C, C++, Objective-C/C++, Ada, Fortran, and Pascal. It was originally called DJGCC, and was later renamed from DJGCC to DJGPP when C++ support was added, though the &quot;PP&quot; was said to stand for &quot;Programming Platform&quot; rather than &quot;Plus Plus&quot;.

== Overview ==
The compiler generates 32-bit code, which runs natively in 32-bit protected mode while switching back to 16-bit DOS calls for basic OS support. However, unlike the Open Watcom C/C++ compiler, it is not a zero-based flat model due to preferring NULL pointer protection for better stability. It is currently based upon a variant of the COFF format. It can access up to 4 GB of RAM in pure DOS when using a suitable DPMI host (e.g., CWSDPMI r7 or HDPMI32).

, main components of DJGPP 2 include:
* GNU Compiler Collection 9.3.0 (10.2.0 is also available)
* Autoconf 2.5.9
* Automake 1.9.4
* Binutils 2.34
* GNU Bash 4.1.17
* GNU Bison 2.4.1, Flex 2.5.4
* GNU Emacs 24.5
* GNU MPC 1.1.0, MPFR 4.1.0

It is also possible to use DJGPP to cross-compile software to DOS, for example on UNIX / Linux. Both the DJGPP libraries and the programs can be compiled this way, linked and then deployed to machines with DOS or DOS emulators.

== Compatibility ==
DJGPP presents the programmer an interface which is compatible with the ANSI C and C99 standards, DOS APIs, and an older POSIX-like environment. Compiled binaries are long filename (LFN) aware and can handle such names under most 32-bit Windows by default, but they cannot use the Win16 or Win32 APIs that graphical programs on Windows need. terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs to support LFNs under plain DOS or Windows NT 4 are available.

While DJGPP runs in 32-bit protected mode, its stub and library heavily rely on many 16-bit DOS and BIOS calls. Because the x86-64 versions of Windows lack support for 16-bit programs, there is no NTVDM, and DJGPP applications cannot be run. Under x86-64 systems these applications function only through emulation (e.g. DOSBox), x86 virtualization (e.g. VirtualBox), or similar (e.g. Linux&#x27;s DOSEMU). This problem arises because in long mode x86-64 processors do not support the virtual 8086 mode used to run 16-bit code in IA-32 processors. Newer x86 CPUs with VT-x do support paged real mode and unrestricted guest mode execution.

<doc id="360812" wikidata="Q731033" url="?curid=360812" title="Orichalcum">
<text>Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the &quot;Critias&quot; of Plato. Within the dialogue, Critias (460–403 BC) says that orichalcum had been considered second only to gold in value and had been found and mined in many parts of Atlantis in ancient times, but that by Critias&#x27;s own time, orichalcum was known only by name.

Orichalcum may have been a noble metal such as platinum, as it was supposed to be mined, but has been identified as pure copper or certain alloys of bronze, and especially brass alloys in the case of antique Roman coins, the latter being of &quot;similar appearance to modern brass&quot; according to scientific research.

== Overview ==
The name is derived from the Greek , &#x27; (from , &#x27;, mountain and , &quot;&quot;, copper), literally meaning &quot;mountain copper&quot;.

The Romans transliterated &quot;orichalcum&quot; as &quot;aurichalcum&quot;, which was thought to mean literally &quot;gold copper&quot;. It is known from the writings of Cicero that the metal which they called orichalcum resembled gold in color but had a much lower value. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the breastplate of Turnus is described as &quot;stiff with gold and white orichalc&quot;.

Orichalcum has been vaguely identified by ancient Greek authors to be either a gold–copper alloy, a form of pure copper or a copper ore or various chemicals based on copper, but also copper–tin and copper–zinc alloys, or a metal or metallic alloy supposedly no longer known.

In later years &quot;orichalcum&quot; was used to describe the sulfide mineral chalcopyrite and also to describe brass. These usages are difficult to reconcile with the claims of Plato&#x27;s Critias, who states that the metal was &quot;only a name&quot; by his time, while brass and chalcopyrite were very important in the time of Plato, as they still are today.

Joseph Needham notes that Bishop Richard Watson, an 18th-century professor of chemistry, wrote of an ancient idea that there were &quot;two sorts of brass or orichalcum&quot;. Needham also suggests that the Greeks may not have known how orichalcum was made and that they might even have had an imitation of the original.

== Ingots found ==

In 2015, 39 ingots were discovered in a sunken vessel on the coast of Gela in Sicily which have tentatively been dated at 2,100 years old. They were analyzed with X-ray fluorescence and found to be an alloy consisting of 75–80% copper, 15–20% zinc, and smaller percentages of nickel, lead, and iron. Another cache of 47 ingots was recovered in February 2016 and found to have similar composition as measured with ICP-OES and ICP-MS: around 65–80% copper, 15–25% zinc, 4–7% lead, 0.5–1% nickel, and trace amounts of silver, antimony, arsenic, bismuth, and other elements.

== In ancient literature ==
Orichalcum is first mentioned in the 7th century BC by Hesiod, and in the Homeric hymn dedicated to Aphrodite, dated to the 630s BC.

According to the &quot;Critias&quot; of Plato, the inner wall surrounding the citadel of Atlantis with the Temple of Poseidon &quot;flashed with the red light of orichalcum&quot;. The interior walls, pillars, and floors of the temple were completely covered in orichalcum, and the roof was variegated with gold, silver, and orichalcum. In the center of the temple stood a pillar of orichalcum, on which the laws of Poseidon and records of the first son princes of Poseidon were inscribed.

Pliny the Elder points out that orichalcum had lost currency due to the mines being exhausted. Pseudo-Aristotle in &quot;De mirabilibus auscultationibus&quot; (62) describes a type of copper that is &quot;very shiny and white, not because there is tin mixed with it, but because some earth is combined and molten with it.&quot; This might be a reference to orichalcum obtained during the smelting of copper with the addition of &quot;cadmia&quot;, a kind of earth formerly found on the shores of the Black Sea, which is attributed to be zinc oxide.

== Numismatics ==
In numismatics, the term &quot;orichalcum&quot; is used to refer exclusively to a type of brass alloy used for minting Roman as, sestertius, dupondius, and semis type of coins. It is considered more valuable than copper, of which the &quot;as&quot; coin was previously made.

<doc id="360815" wikidata="Q164373" url="?curid=360815" title="Thaksin Shinawatra">
<text>Thaksin Shinawatra (born 26 July 1949) is a Thai politician and businessman who served as the 23rd prime minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006.

Thaksin founded the mobile phone operator Advanced Info Service and the IT and telecommunications conglomerate Shin Corporation in 1987, ultimately making him one of the richest people in Thailand. He founded the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) in 1998 and, after a landslide electoral victory, became prime minister in 2001. He was the first democratically elected prime minister of Thailand to serve a full term and was re-elected in 2005 by an overwhelming majority.

Thaksin declared a &quot;war on drugs&quot; in which more than 2,500 people were killed. Thaksin&#x27;s government launched programs to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and extend universal healthcare coverage. Thaksin took a strong-arm approach against the separatist insurgency in the Muslim southern provinces.

His decision to sell shares in his corporation for more than a billion tax-free US dollars generated controversy. A protest movement against Thaksin, called People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy or &quot;Yellow Shirts&quot;, launched mass demonstrations, accusing him of corruption, abuse of power, and autocratic tendencies. In 2006 Thaksin called snap elections that were boycotted by the opposition and invalidated by the Constitutional Court.

Thaksin was deposed in a military coup on 19 September 2006. His party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity. Thaksin lived in self-imposed exile for 15 years—except for a brief visit to Thailand in 2008—before returning to Thailand in August 2023. During his exile he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to two years in jail for abuse of power, and stripped of his Police Rank of Police Lieutenant Colonel.

From abroad, he continued to influence Thai politics through the People&#x27;s Power Party that ruled in 2008 and its successor organisation Pheu Thai Party, as well as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship or &quot;Red Shirt&quot; movement. His younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra was prime minister from 2011 to 2014, and his youngest daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been the prime minister since 2024.

Later in exile, Thaksin registered a Clubhouse account under the name &quot;Tony Woodsome&quot;, which became his moniker, and frequently held activities on the platform. He also made several announcements expressing his desire to return to Thailand on various social media platforms. Ultimately, Thaksin returned to Thailand on 22 August 2023, and was promptly taken into custody.

==Heritage and early life==
Thaksin&#x27;s great-grandfather, Seng Saekhu (Khu Chun Seng 丘春盛), was an ethnic Chinese Hakka immigrant from Fengshun, Guangdong, China, who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in Chiang Mai in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Saekhu, was born in Chanthaburi in 1890 and married a local named Saeng Samana. Chiang&#x27;s eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname &quot;Shinawatra&quot; in 1938 because of the country&#x27;s pro-Central Thai movement, and the rest of the family also adopted it.

Seng Saekhu had made his fortune through tax farming. Chiang Saekhu/Shinawatra later founded Shinawatra Silks and then moved into finance, construction, and property development. Thaksin&#x27;s father, Loet, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. Yindi&#x27;s father, Charoen Ramingwong (born: Wang Chuan Cheng), was a Chinese Hakka immigrant who married Princess Chanthip na Chiangmai, a minor member of the Lanna (Chiang Mai) royalty.

In 1968, Loet Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai. Loet Shinawatra quit politics in 1976. He opened a coffee shop, grew oranges and flowers in Chiang Mai&#x27;s San Kamphaeng District, and opened two cinemas, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.

Thaksin was born in San Kamphaeng, Chiang Mai Province. He is a Theravada Buddhist. He lived in the village of San Kamphaeng until he was 15, then moved to Chiang Mai to study at Montfort College. At 16, he helped run one of his father&#x27;s cinemas.

Thaksin married Potjaman Damapong in July 1976. They have one son, Panthongtae and two daughters, Pinthongtha and Paethongtarn. They divorced in 2008. Thaksin&#x27;s youngest sister, Yingluck Shinawatra (; ), is said to have entered politics in 2011 at her brother&#x27;s request as leader of the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai Party. She was later elected prime minister on 3 July 2011. Thaksin received a doctorate in criminology at Sam Houston State University. Thaksin lectured at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities of Mahidol University in 1979.

==Police career==
Thaksin was a member of the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and was then admitted to the Thai Police Cadet Academy. Graduating in 1973, he joined the Royal Thai Police. He received a master&#x27;s degree in criminal justice from Eastern Kentucky University in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a doctorate in criminal justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.

Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a Police Lieutenant Colonel and leaving the police. His former wife, Potjaman Damapong, is the sister of Police General Priewpan Damapong and now uses her mother&#x27;s maiden name.

He was a former university lecturer at the Royal Police Cadet Academy in 1975–1976.

Thaksin&#x27;s police lieutenant colonel rank was revoked in September 2015.

==Business career==
===Early ventures===
Thaksin and his wife began several businesses while he was still in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures which left him over 50 million baht in debt, (£1 million). In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed. In April 1986, he founded Advanced Info Service (AIS), which started as a computer rental business.

In 1987 Thaksin resigned from the police. He then marketed a romance drama called &quot;Baan Sai Thong&quot;, which became a popular success in theatres. In 1988, he joined Pacific Telesis to operate and market the PacLink pager service, a modest success, though Thaksin later sold his shares to establish his own paging company.

In 1989, he launched IBC, a cable television company. At that time, Thaksin had a good relationship with Chalerm Yoobumrung, the minister of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, who was in charge of Thai press and media. It is a question whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration. However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group&#x27;s UTV.

In 1989, Thaksin established a data networking service, Shinawatra DataCom, today known as Advanced Data Network and owned by AIS and TOT. Many of Thaksin&#x27;s businesses were later consolidated as Shin Corporation.

===Advanced Info Service and later ventures===
Advanced Info Service (AIS) was given a monopoly contract by Thaksin&#x27;s military contacts in 1986 and used the GSM-900 frequency band. AIS grew rapidly and became the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand.

The Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and listed in 1990.

In 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated four Thaicom communications satellites.

In 1999, the Shinawatra family spent some one billion baht establishing Shinawatra University in Pathum Thani. It offers international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management, though it ranks quite low internationally.

In 2000, Thaksin acquired the ailing iTV television station from the Crown Property Bureau, Nation Multimedia Group, and Siam Commercial Bank.

==Entry into politics==

===Political career===
Thaksin entered politics in late 1994 through Chamlong Srimuang, who had just reclaimed the position of Palang Dharma Party (PDP) leader from Boonchu Rojanastien. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing Prasong Soonsiri. Thaksin left Palang Dharma along with many of its MPs in 1996, and founded the populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party in 1998. After a historic election victory in 2001, he became prime minister, the country&#x27;s first to serve a full term.

Thaksin introduced a range of policies to alleviate rural poverty. Highly popular, they helped reduce poverty by half in four years. He launched the country&#x27;s first universal healthcare program, the 30-baht scheme, as well as a notorious drug suppression campaign. Thaksin embarked on a massive program of infrastructure investment, including roads, public transit, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Nevertheless, public sector debt fell from 57 percent of GDP in January 2001 to 41 percent in September 2006. Levels of corruption were perceived to have fallen, with Transparency International&#x27;s &quot;Corruption Perceptions Index&quot; improving from 3.2 to 3.8 between 2001 and 2005. The Thai Rak Thai party won in a landslide in the 2005 general election, which had the highest voter turnout in Thai history.

Twelve years later, after Thaksin was removed from power, Chamlong Srimuang expressed regret at getting &quot;such a corrupt person&quot; into politics. The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of Chuan Leekpai to collapse.

===PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister under Banharn===
Chamlong, strongly criticised for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.

Thaksin joined the government of Banharn Silpa-Archa and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, he and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin&#x27;s move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest. But Chamlong lost to Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.

Chamlong&#x27;s failure to buttress the PDP&#x27;s failing power base in Bangkok amplified divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong&#x27;s &quot;temple&quot; faction and Thaksin&#x27;s. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.

Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government, and in September 1996 Banharn dissolved Parliament.

Thaksin announced he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections but would remain as leader of the PDP. It suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only one seat, and soon imploded, with most members resigning.

===Deputy Prime Minister under Chavalit===
On 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh&#x27;s government, after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the Asian financial crisis. He held the position for only three months, leaving on 14 November when Chavalit resigned.

During a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of profiting from insider information about the government&#x27;s decision to float the baht, but the next Democrat party-led government did not investigate the accusations.

During this period, Thaksin also served on the Asia Advisory Board of the Washington, D.C.–based Carlyle Group until he resigned upon becoming Prime Minister in 2001.

===The Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections===

Thaksin founded the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) (&#x27;Thais Love Thais&#x27;) party in 1998 along with Somkid Jatusripitak, PDP ally Sudarat Keyuraphan, Purachai Piumsomboon, and 19 others.

With a populist platform often attributed to Somkid, TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a three-year debt moratorium for farmers, and one million baht locally managed development funds for all Thai villages.

After Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the January 2001 elections, the first held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, some academics called it the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history. Thai Rak Thai won 248 parliamentary seats (more than any other party previously) and needed only three more seats to form a government. Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the Chart Thai Party (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats). Thaksin became Prime Minister of Thailand on 9 February 2001.

====Indictment of Thaksin for hiding his wealth====
Thailand&#x27;s National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) submitted an indictment to the Constitutional Court accusing Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister-in-waiting at the time, for failing to disclose assets worth about 2.37 billion baht ($56 million) while he was deputy prime minister in 1997 and a year afterward. If found guilty, Thaksin could be banned from political office for five years. This case is known as the &quot;stock hiding case&quot; because the Constitution prohibits politicians and their spouses from holding shares in private companies as per the law. However, Thaksin transferred the shares he owned to his domestic staff and other nominees in order to conceal his ownership.

According to his own testament in the constitutional court, his reasons for failing to reveal his complete asset include: (1) the constitution does not define the term &quot;personal property&quot;, (2) the accounting explanation is not clear, (3) not showing the property using another person&#x27;s name as a substitute, which was not previously required to be shown, is not considered a violation, (4) not intentionally not showing the list of property using another person&#x27;s name, (5) it is not his responsibility to submit the accounting before the announcement of the use of the organic law on the Prevention and Suppression of Corruption Act, B.E. 2542 (A.D. 1999), which was just announced on November 18, B.E. 2542 (A.D. 1999) and (6) in the confidential letter dated November 14, 24, and 30th, B.E. 2543 (A.D. 2000) to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the accused (Thaksin Shinawatra) had already explained the list of assets and debts and the reasons why they were not shown in the accounting, considering the notification of additional asset lists as part of the three times submitted accounting.

While Klanarong Jantik, the Secretary-General of the National Anti-Corruption Commission-NACC, argued in the court that (1) although the constitution does not define the term &quot;personal property&quot;, but it is a common sense understanding, (2) the accounting explanation may have minor changes but the important information remains unchanged and has been edited to make it clearer, (3) It is not shown that there have been any instances where a minister or individual who submitted the accounting has stated that they did not show the asset list because they used another person&#x27;s name as a substitute, citing that they did not understand the accounting explanation and (4) although the organic law on the Prevention and Suppression of Corruption Act, B.E. 2542 (A.D. 1999) was announced on November 18, B.E. 2542 (A.D. 1999), the accused has the responsibility to submit the accounting according to the current constitution from the day it is mandated, which is October 11, B.E. 2540 (A.D. 1997).

Later, the Constitutional Court ruled 8 to 7 that Thaksin Shinawatra did not have any intention in the matter. This ruling may have been influenced by public pressure against the Constitutional Court because at the time, Thaksin was very popular and some believed he should have been given the opportunity to govern the country. However, there is still a part of society that is skeptical of the court&#x27;s decision and sees Thaksin as disrupting the justice process, leading to the complaint and removal of four Constitutional Court judges.

In 2011, the Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand released a final report after two years of work, stating that all political crises were caused by the &quot;Thaksin stock hiding case&quot; in which the Constitutional Court acted unlawfully. Seven judges of the Constitutional Court ruled that Thaksin Shinawatra was guilty of the charges, while six other judges ruled that he was not guilty. However, the Constitutional Court then included the votes of the two judges who had ruled that the case was not within their jurisdiction, but had not ruled on the substance of the case, and added them to the votes of the six judges who had ruled that Thaksin was not guilty. This resulted in a ruling of 8 to 7 in favor of Thaksin, which was perceived as a violation of the law and led to public mistrust of the judicial process in Thailand.

==Prime Minister of Thailand, 2001–2006==
 

Thaksin Shinawatra was the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country&#x27;s modern history. He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors. They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.

Thaksin&#x27;s most effective policies were reducing rural poverty and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to gather the hitherto-neglected support of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.

His cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the Palang Dharma Party, including Prommin Lertsuridej, Chaturon Chaisang, Prapat Panyachatraksa, Surapong Suebwonglee, Somkid Jatusripitak, Surakiart Sathirathai, and Sudarat Keyuraphan. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.

However, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, demagogy, corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards a free press. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of lèse majesté, treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and religious desecration.

===Economic policies===
Thaksin&#x27;s government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed microcredit development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) rural, small, and medium enterprise development program.

Thaksin&#x27;s economic policies helped Thailand recover from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9 trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1 trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule.

Income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46 percent from 2001 to 2006. Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3 to 11.3 percent. Thailand&#x27;s Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000). The Stock Exchange of Thailand outperformed other markets in the region. After facing fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin balanced the national budget, producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a balanced budget was projected for 2007. Public sector debt fell from 57 percent of GDP in January 2001 to 41 percent in September 2006. Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30 billion in 2001 to US$64 billion in 2006.

Critics say Thaksinomics is little more than a Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy re-branded. Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor &quot;hooked on Thaksin&#x27;s hand-outs.&quot;

Thaksin helped legalise Thailand&#x27;s massive underground lottery system numbers game (Thai: หวย) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70 billion baht (US$2 billion) were used for social projects, including the &quot;One District, One Scholarship&quot; program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.

After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin&#x27;s economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office&#x27;s program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence.

===Educational policies===
According to World Bank Thailand has recentralized rather than decentralized during his administration.

One of Thaksin&#x27;s educational reforms was school decentralisation, as mandated by the 1997 Constitution. It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand&#x27;s 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. Teachers also feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.

Other intended policy changes included learning reform and related curricular decentralisation, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.

To increase access to universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin&#x27;s government was overthrown.

Thaksin was one of the first supporters of Nicholas Negroponte&#x27;s One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units. The junta later cancelled the project.

Thaksin also initiated the controversial &quot;One District, One Dream School&quot; project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district had at least one high-quality school. It was criticised, with claims that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving inadequate financial support from the central government.

In addition, he altered the state university entrance system, which had relied exclusively on nationally standardised exams. Thaksin pushed for greater weighting of senior high-school grades in the hope of focusing students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.

===Healthcare policies===
Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidised universal health care (UHC) in 2002 and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin&#x27;s 30 baht per visit UHC program won the praise of the general public, but was criticised by many physicians and officials. Prior to the program&#x27;s introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase healthcare access from 76% of the population to 96%. At its outset, UHC was reviled as a &quot;populist&quot; policy. Post-coup public health minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30 baht program a &quot;marketing gimmick&quot;. Nearly half of UHC patients were dissatisfied with the treatment they received. The program has downsides: excessive workloads for health care providers, crowded waiting rooms, and insufficient time spent diagnosing each patient, and costs have tripled from 56 million baht in 2006 to 166 million baht in 2019, but still remain below one percent of GDP.

===The War on Drugs===
On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid &quot;every square inch of the country&quot; of drugs in three months. It consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets including &quot;blacklists&quot;, awarding government officials for achieving targets and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeting dealers, and &quot;ruthless&quot; implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were extrajudicially executed. The government claimed that only around 50 of the deaths were at the hands of the police, the rest being drug traffickers who were being silenced by their dealers and their dealers&#x27; dealers. Human rights critics claimed a large number were extrajudicially executed. The majority of these individuals were listed on the government&#x27;s blacklist, but there is no evidence to suggest that they were actually involved in the drug trade. The blacklist was unreliable, with some drug dealers not being listed and many individuals who were listed having no involvement in the drug trade. The government encouraged community members to report drug users and dealers to authorities, who would then put the names in a box for the government to review. This led to confusion and mistakes, including the inclusion of innocent individuals on the blacklist. There were also instances of people using the blacklist for revenge against rivals.

In a 2003 birthday address, King Bhumibol subtly criticised the handling of the war on drugs by the government, hinting at a misplacement of accountability for its casualties onto him, despite constitutional provisions that exempt the monarch from governmental responsibilities. The King expressed concern over the broader accountability within the country, emphasising the challenge of identifying and distinguishing the casualties caused by state actions and others. The speech delicately pointed out the legal and moral responsibilities of the government officials in managing national crises.

Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings. Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.

The war on drugs was widely criticised by the international community. Thaksin requested that the UN Commission on Human Rights send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, &quot;The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue.&quot;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee to investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee&#x27;s results &quot;The Economist&quot; reported in January 2008: &quot;Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government &#x27;shoot-to-kill&#x27; policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin&#x27;s wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel&#x27;s original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month&#x27;s elections, those names were omitted.&quot;

While he was opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the campaign. After being appointed Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation into the killings, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the International Criminal Court. Former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen led the investigation and the investigation committee was approved by Abhisit&#x27;s Cabinet. Abhisit denied that the probe was politically motivated. Witnesses and victims were urged to report to the Department of Special Investigation, which operated directly under Abhisit&#x27;s control.

===Energy policies===
In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the Chuan Leekpai government&#x27;s privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government&#x27;s post-Asian financial crisis policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale power pool competition, Thaksin&#x27;s policies aimed to create national champions that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets. Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.

===South Thailand insurgency===
A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with their Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians (including Buddhist monks) are also regular targets. Thaksin was widely criticised for his management of the situation.

Of three key controversial incidents, the first was the Army&#x27;s storming of the Krue Se Mosque, where protesters had holed up and were killed.

The second, in October 2004, was the killing of 84 Muslim demonstrators at Tak Bai, when the Army broke up a peaceful protest. Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims were reported to have been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.

In a third incident, Muslim lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit disappeared, allegedly abducted and killed by police for his role in defending alleged insurgents who claimed to have been tortured. Despite witness testimony and forensic evidence during the court of police investigations and court trials, all allegations against police said to be involved were dropped and the enforced disappearance case closed.

Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region. In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organisations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.

In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled South. In its final report in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing elements of Islamic law and making Pattani-Malay (Yawi) an official language in the region along with Thai. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, but nothing came of it.

Thaksin blamed Malaysia&#x27;s jungle that has occasionally been used to train Islamic militants to cause violence in the south and Indonesia for being an inspiration to the militants.

===Administrative reform===
One of the most visible of Thaksin&#x27;s administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labelled the &quot;big bang.&quot; It was hailed as a &quot;historic breakthrough&quot; and &quot;the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand&#x27;s modern system of departmental government in 1897.&quot; Plans had been studied for years to loosen perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system but were not implemented until the Thaksin government. MCOT : TNA English News :

The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.

Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors to that of active policy managers. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials who reported back to Bangkok, while the Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.

A key component of Thaksin&#x27;s administrative reform policy, the &quot;CEO-governors&quot; epitomised what was called his &quot;transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive.&quot; Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and co-ordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The &quot;CEO governors&quot; were assisted by &quot;provincial CFOs&quot; from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. Governors were authorised to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course.

The CEO-governors of all 75 provinces at that time came from the appointment of the Minister of Interior Affairs and had greater authority in managing people and money. There was even a special budget allocated, called the &quot;CEO-governor budget,&quot; which amounted to tens of million baht. In reality, it was found that this budget was managed and shared among the local members of parliament and aimed at achieving political goals, leading to criticism that it was a budget used to gain support for Thaksin government. It was even accused by academics of being a &quot;hired vision writer&quot; for the government.

After the coup, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, drafted the royal decree on the management and preparation of budget plans for the development of provincial and district groups starting in 2008. The &quot;CEO-governor budget&quot; was eliminated and thereby preventing the local members of the parliament from spending the budget to gain votes.

The Thaksin era also saw the opening of a number of government one-stop service centres to reduce red tape for anything from investment to utilities and ID-card processing.

===Foreign policies===

Thaksin initiated negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.

Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

Thaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.

Thaksin was repeatedly attacked for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders and the international community. Besides his famous swipe at the UN (see The &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; above), there were also allegations of gaffes at international meetings.

Thaksin was keen to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries like Laos. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the impoverished country a 4 billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.

Thaksin energetically supported his former foreign minister Surakiart Sathirathai&#x27;s somewhat improbable campaign to become Secretary-General of the United Nations.

===Suvarnabhumi Airport===
Despite debate and long abandonment of the plan due to the stability of the ground for the location of the airport, the Thaksin government pushed to complete the construction of the new Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The airport was opened a week after Thaksin&#x27;s government was overthrown.

Members of Thaksin&#x27;s government were accused of corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project. These allegations were used by the military junta to justify the 2006 coup. The junta initiated several investigations into the airport. Nevertheless, investigative panels found that damage to the airport was &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;common.&quot; The cost of repairing the damage was estimated at less than one percent of the total airport cost. The junta was accused by its opponents of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport&#x27;s problems to pin further blame on the Thaksin government.

===Criticism===
====Corruption====
Thaksin was accused of &quot;policy corruption&quot;, such as infrastructure and liberalisation policies that, while legal &quot;...abuse the public&#x27;s interest...&quot; Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend 5 to 30 percent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400 billion baht. Thaksin critics point to more examples of corruption: the Thailand Board of Investment&#x27;s (BOI) granting tax breaks worth a total of 16.4 billion baht to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry&#x27;s decision the same year to abolish the minimum air fare of 3.8 baht per kilometre when Shin Corporation was about to consummate a joint venture with low-cost carrier AirAsia.

After the 2006 coup, the military junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin&#x27;s assets based on charges of policy corruption.

Thaksin denied the allegations. &quot;They just made up a beautiful term to use against me. There&#x27;s no such thing in this government. Our policies only serve the interests of the majority of the people&quot;, he said. From 2002 to 2006, the stock price of Shin Corporation increased from 38 to 104 baht, up 173 percent, while the stock price of Shin Satellite fell. In the same period, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 161 per cent, and the price of other major SET blue chip companies increased vastly more. Industry deregulation caused the market share of AIS to fall from 68 percent to 53 percent.

Transparency International reported that Thailand&#x27;s reputation for transparency among business executives improved somewhat during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score was 3.2 (ranked 61), whilst in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).

A study of governance indicators worldwide by the World Bank gave Thailand a lower score on &quot;control of corruption&quot; from 2002 to 2005 under Thaksin when compared to the Democrat-led government of 1998–2000.

In 2008 Thaksin was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment &quot;in absentia&quot; over a corrupt land deal. In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician ever to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a seemingly low price.

====Other charges====
Immediately after the events of March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajiva stated that he would talk to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin&#x27;s wealth and extravagance, contrasting the alleged opulence of the premier&#x27;s house and the humbler, agrarian roots of many of his supporters. Shortly after, he condemned his opponent&#x27;s self-proclaimed affinity with ordinary people, the &quot;phrai&quot; (), arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the &quot;ammart&quot;, or the traditional elites in Thailand&#x27;s army, bureaucracy, and political parties.

Thaksin&#x27;s government was accused of exerting political influence in its crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations, and Thaksin brought defamation lawsuits against critical journalists.

==Political crisis of 2005–2006==

===2005 re-election===
Under the slogans &quot;Four Years of RepairFour years of Reconstruction&quot; and &quot;Building Opportunities&quot;, Thaksin and the TRT won landslide victories in February 2005 elections, winning 374 of 500 seats in parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. But his second term was soon beset by protests, with claims that he presided over a &quot;parliamentary dictatorship&quot;.

The political crisis was catalysed by accusations published by media mogul and popular talk show host Sondhi Limthongkul, a former Thaksin supporter who had broken with him. These included accusations that Thaksin:
* Restricted press freedom by suing Sondhi after he printed a sermon by a Luang Ta Maha Bua, a controversial monk.
* Masterminded the desecration of the famous Erawan Shrine

===Sale of Shin Corporation===

On 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73 billion baht (about US$1.88 billion) tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange exempt from capital gains tax. Thaksin was the target of accusations of corruption for selling forbidden national assets such as national utility company to a foreign entity in exchange for personal profits and kickbacks. Thai laws at the time disallowed the sale of integral assets of national importance to the public or to any foreign entity, but Thaksin amended the laws to allow such sale.

Protests followed the Shin Corporation sale, led by the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), whose leaders included Chamlong and Sondhi. Numbers soon swelled to tens of thousands occupying the area around Government House in Bangkok.

===House dissolution and election===

Thaksin announced the dissolution of parliament on 24 February 2006. General elections were scheduled for 2 April.

Thaksin was attacked for calling for snap elections, which in effect prevented any member of parliament from changing parties. In an editorial, &quot;The Nation&quot; noted it that, &quot;It fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept [of democracy], particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin&#x27;s manipulation has been well documented.&quot;

Thaksin&#x27;s TRT Party won the widely boycotted elections, gaining 462 seats in parliament, with a ratio of yes-voters to no-voters of 16:10, not counting non-voters.

However, by-elections were needed for 40 TRT candidates who failed to win the minimum 20 percent required by the 1997 Constitution in uncontested races. The Democrat Party refused to contest them and, along with the PAD, petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel them. Chamlong Srimuang declared that the PAD would ignore the elections and &quot;go on rallying until Thaksin resigns and Thailand gets a royally appointed prime minister&quot;.

Thaksin had announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of prime minister after parliament reconvened, but would continue as caretaker prime minister until then. He then delegated his functions to caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Chidchai Wannasathit, moved out of Government House, and went on vacation.

Elections were held on 25 April and resulted in the TRT winning 25 of the constituencies and losing two. Yet another round of by-elections on 29 April was scheduled for 13 constituencies. The Thai Rak Thai Party was later accused and found guilty of paying smaller parties to contest the election to fulfill the 20 percent rule, while the Democrat Party was accused of paying smaller parties not to. The by-elections were suspended by the Constitutional Court while it deliberated whether or not to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.

===Invalidation of the elections===
On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court ruled 8–6 to invalidate the April elections based on the awkward positioning of voting booths. The ruling was called a landmark case in &quot;judicial activism&quot;. The Democrat Party, which had boycotted the April elections, said they were now ready to contest an October election.

A new election was ordered and later set for 15 October 2006. The court found the Election Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them. But the election was cancelled when the military seized power on 19 September.

===The ouster===
The Thaksin government faced allegations of corruption, authoritarianism, treason, conflicts of interest, acting non-diplomatically, and muzzling of the press. Thaksin was accused of tax evasion, lèse majesté (insulting King Bhumibol), and selling assets of Thai companies to international investors. Independent bodies, including Amnesty International, criticised Thaksin&#x27;s human rights record. Thaksin was also charged for concealing his wealth during his premiership.

Protests by the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy massed in 2006, and on 19 September 2006 a military junta which later called itself the Council for National Security (CNS) replaced Thaksin&#x27;s caretaker government in a coup while he was abroad. The Constitutional Tribunal dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party for electoral fraud &quot;ex post facto&quot;, banning him and TRT executives from politics for five years. The CNS-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin and his family&#x27;s assets in Thailand, totalling 76 billion baht (US$2.2 billion), claiming he had become unusually wealthy while in office. Thaksin and his wife had declared assets totalling 15.1 billion baht when he took office in 2001, although he had transferred many of his assets to his children and associates before taking office.

Thaksin returned to Thailand on 28 February 2008, after the People&#x27;s Power Party, which he supported, won the post-coup elections. But after visiting Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics, he did not return to hear the final supreme court sentence and applied for asylum in the United Kingdom. This was refused, after which he had to move about from one country to another. In October 2008, the Thai Supreme Court found him guilty of a conflict of interest and sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; to two years imprisonment.

The People&#x27;s Power Party was later dissolved by the Supreme Court, but party members regrouped to form the Pheu Thai Party, which Thaksin also supported. Thaksin is a supporter, and alleged bankroller, of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (aka &quot;Red Shirts&quot;). The government revoked Thaksin&#x27;s passport for his role in the UDD&#x27;s protests during Songkran 2009. On 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court seized 46 billion baht of his frozen assets, after finding him guilty of abnormal wealth. In 2009 it was announced that Thaksin had obtained Montenegrin citizenship through that country&#x27;s economic citizenship program.

==September 2006 coup==

On the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the Council on Foreign Relations, the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 soldiers ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex to lay down their weapons. Troops also surrounded the Thaicom satellite receiving station and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza, and Ratchadamnoen Avenue.

Troops participating in the coup were from the 1st and 3rd Army Regions, the Internal Security Operations Command, the Special Warfare Centre, army units from Nakhon Ratchasima and Prachinburi, and navy sailors. According to coup leader Army General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, coup leaders had arrested Deputy Prime Minister Chitchai Wannasathit and Defense Minister Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya.

The military, originally calling itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch (CDRM), issued a statement citing the government&#x27;s alleged &quot;lèse majesté&quot;, corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup. It declared the King of Thailand the head of state, and said elections would be held soon to return democracy to the country. Thaksin departed New York for Great Britain, where he had family.

===Thai Rak Thai Party===
Many Thai Rak Thai party members were reported to have resigned from the party in the aftermath of the coup for fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction. It was not clear whether Suriya Jungrungreangkit, another influential member of the faction, would also resign. Sontaya Kunplome was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party.

On 2 October 2006 Thaksin and his former deputy Somkid Jatusipitak resigned from the TRT. Chaturon Chaisang took over as party head.

The TRT was dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal, which banned over 100 of its executives, including Thaksin, from politics for five years, based on charges that two party executives (Defense Minister Thammarak and Pongsak Raktapongpaisarn) bribed a smaller party to stand in the April 2006 election. The Democrat party was cleared on a similar charge.

===2006 Bangkok New Year&#x27;s Eve bombings===

On 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2007, several bombs exploded in Bangkok, killing three and wounding a number of bystanders. Prime Minister General Surayud Chulanont accused &quot;those who lost power as a result of the military takeover&quot; of masterminding the bombings, but did not directly identify Thaksin. Thaksin went on CNN to publicly deny any involvement in the bombings. The government did not make any arrests in the case.

===Legal charges===
Thaksin&#x27;s diplomatic passport was revoked on 31 December 2006 after the junta accused him of engaging in political activities while in exile. Thai embassies were ordered not to aid him in his travels.

A junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee (AEC) froze Thaksin&#x27;s assets and attempted to bring charges against him. The AEC was criticised for being stacked with anti-Thaksin appointees. At one point, AEC Secretary Kaewsan Atibodhi claimed that &quot;evidence and witnesses are useless&quot;, when an AEC panel recommended legal action without hearing 300 witnesses or considering 100 additional pieces of evidence. The AEC froze Thaksin&#x27;s assets.

In January 2007, the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) complied with an AEC request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife for their purchase of four 772 million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on an alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which prohibits government officials and their spouses from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authority.

The AEC also accused Thaksin of issuing an unlawful cabinet resolution approving the spending of state funds to buy rubber saplings.

In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General charged Thaksin&#x27;s wife and brother-in-law with conspiring to evade taxes of 546 million baht (US$15.6 million) in a 1997 transfer of Shin Corporation shares.

The AEC found Thaksin guilty of malfeasance for obstructing competition by imposing an excise tax on telecom operators. Thaksin&#x27;s Cabinet had approved the relevant executive decree in 2003.

==Purchase of Manchester City Football Club==
As prime minister, Thaksin had unsuccessfully sought to buy the English Premier League football clubs Fulham and later Liverpool, in what critics claimed was a publicity stunt in response to his political problems.

On 21 June 2007, now out of office, Thaksin bought Premier League club Manchester City for £81.6 million. He became briefly popular with fans (who nicknamed him &quot;Frank&quot;), especially after appointing Sven-Göran Eriksson manager of the club and bringing in prominent players. Eriksson was later critical of Thaksin&#x27;s running of the club, saying &quot;he [Thaksin] didn&#x27;t understand football – he hadn&#x27;t a clue.&quot; He sold the club to investors from Abu Dhabi United Group in September 2008 for a reported £200 million.

After selling Manchester City, Thaksin was nominated as &quot;honorary president&quot; but did not have any administrative responsibilities. However, he was later dismissed as honorary club president after the club took a position against him following his conviction and was &quot;on the run&quot; from Thai authorities.

==Convictions and exile==
In May 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said Thaksin was free to return to Thailand, and he would personally guarantee Thaksin&#x27;s safety. In January 2008 Thaksin&#x27;s wife Potjaman was arrested on arrival in Bangkok but released on bail after appearing at the Supreme Court, with orders not to leave the country. She was set to be tried for alleged violation of stock-trading and land sale laws.

On 28 February 2008, Thaksin arrived in Bangkok after 17 months in exile. Thaksin stated that he would not re-enter politics and wished to focus on his football interests. In March Thaksin pleaded not guilty before the Supreme Court in one of his two criminal corruption cases. He was ordered to report back on 11 April after the court granted a month-long trip to England.

In June the Supreme Court denied Thaksin&#x27;s request to travel to China and Britain, since his corruption case was set for trial and was ordered to surrender his passport after arraignment. In July the court assumed jurisdiction over the fourth corruption charge against Thaksin concerning soft loans to Burma. The court also agreed to hear allegations that Thaksin, his former cabinet, and three members of the current government broke anti-gambling laws by setting up the new state lottery in 2003.

Potjaman was found guilty on 31 July and sentenced to three years imprisonment, then released on bail. The Bangkok Criminal Court also convicted her adopted brother Bhanapot Damapong and her secretary, who allegedly held assets for Thaksin by proxy, of tax evasion.

===Request for asylum in the United Kingdom===
On 10 August 2008, Thaksin and Potjaman violated their bail terms by attending the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Beijing. Stating that he wished to return to Thailand but claimed it was not currently safe for him and his family. Thaksin sought political asylum in the United Kingdom, claiming his political enemies were interfering with the judiciary. There is no evidence that he proceeded with his request and his asylum case was neither approved nor declined.

The Thailand Supreme Court&#x27;s Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions issued a second arrest warrant on 16 September 2008 against Thaksin over another of the four pending corruption cases and ordered suspension of the trial. Several more arrest warrants were issued over his subsequent non-appearance at various corruption trials.
===Ratchadaphisek land verdict===
On 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court&#x27;s Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions ruled that Thaksin, while prime minister, abused his power to help his wife buy public land at auction, and sentenced him to two years in jail.

Soon after, Thaksin told Reuters, &quot;I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way&quot;, and added that the case was politically motivated.

Chief prosecutor Seksan Bangsombun called on Britain to extradite him. Thaksin now denied he was seeking political asylum in Britain.

===Self-imposed exile===
On 10 November 2008, a Philippine spokesman said his government would &quot;politely&quot; turn down any request for political refuge from Thaksin due to Manila&#x27;s &quot;friendly&quot; relations with Bangkok.

The British Government Home Office, meanwhile, revoked Potjaman and Thaksin&#x27;s visas due to their convictions, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines asking them to disallow either of them to board flights to Britain. In late 2008, &quot;Arabian Business&quot; reported that the UK froze US$4.2 billion of his assets in the UK. The UK government did not confirm or deny this claim.

Thaksin had reportedly considered sanctuaries such as China, the Bahamas, Nicaragua, and several other countries in South America and Africa. Reports said the Shinawatras were granted honorary citizenship by the Bahamas and Nicaragua, and were building a £5.5 million home in China. As of late-May 2009, he reportedly remained in Dubai. A spokesman claimed Thaksin was travelling on six passports, none of them Thai. In December 2008 Thaksin obtained a residency permit for Germany which was subsequently withdrawn on 28 May 2009 when the German government became aware of the arrangement. Thaksin then obtained status as a diplomat of Nicaragua. Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, lifted the travel restriction banning Thaksin from entering Germany on 15 July 2011 after the election victory of Thaksin&#x27;s proxy party.

In a November 2009 interview, Thaksin told &quot;The Times&quot; that he was living in Dubai, still had access to about US$100 million of his money outside of Thailand, and was investing in gold mines, diamond polishing, and lottery licenses in various countries.

===Songkran unrest===
In mid-April 2009, violent protests of mostly Thaksin supporters calling themselves the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) led to the cancellation of the ASEAN summit in Pattaya and a declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok. Thaksin had given encouragement at UDD rallies via satellite and phone-in link, at one point calling for a &quot;people&#x27;s revolution&quot;. Following suppression of the protests he claimed to have merely been offering &quot;moral support&quot;.

Thaksin supported protests by the UDD against the Abhisit Vejjajiva government, demanding Thaksin be allowed to return free from all the earlier corruption charges. Thaksin denied leading the UDD, claiming he only gave them &quot;moral support&quot;.

===Money laundering allegations===
In April 2009, Privy Councilor General Pichitr Kullavanijaya reported he had been informed by former US ambassador to Thailand Ralph L. Boyce that Thaksin had laundered 100 billion baht (US$2.8 billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts to organise the anti-government protests. Boyce himself said that he had &quot;...no idea why he was cited as a knowledgeable source about where Thaksin may or may not have made deposits, and that he has no such information.&quot;

===Economic advisor to Cambodia===
On 4 November 2009, it was announced that Thaksin had been appointed as special advisor to the Cambodian government and Hun Sen and stated that Cambodia would refuse to extradite Thaksin because it considered him a victim of political persecution. On 5 November 2009, both countries recalled their ambassadors.

Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva stated this was &quot;the first diplomatic retaliation measure&quot;. Stating Cambodia was interfering in Thailand&#x27;s internal affairs and as a result all bilateral agreements would be reviewed. Sok An, a member of the Council of Ministers and Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, said Thaksin&#x27;s appointment is a decision internal to Cambodia and &quot;conforms to international practice&quot;. The mutual withdrawal of ambassadors is the most severe diplomatic action to have occurred between the two countries.

====Spy controversy====
On 11 November 2009, Sivarak Chutipong was arrested by Cambodian police for passing the confidential flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia Air Traffic Service, the private firm which managed air traffic control in Cambodia. Sivarak denied that he was a spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit&#x27;s secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct on the part of the First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob.

Sivarak was later sentenced to jail for seven years. Thaksin requested the Cambodian government to pardon Sivarak, and he was soon pardoned by King Norodom Sihamoni and expelled. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban later accused Sivarak of staging his own arrest in order to discredit the Abhisit government. Former Thai spy chief and Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri concurred, claiming, &quot;It has been a set-up from the beginning.

===Frozen asset seizure===
====Prior to the verdict====
On 26 February 2010, the Thai Supreme Court was scheduled to render its verdict on whether to seize Thaksin&#x27;s Thai assets, worth 76 billion baht frozen by the AEC after the coup. The AEC froze the assets under the authority of Announcement No. 30 of the military junta. Tensions ran high throughout Thailand. Tens of thousands of government security forces were deployed, particularly in routes leading to Bangkok. However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict. The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption. Policy corruption, was defined by the court as the abuse of powers by implementing economic policies that, while in themselves legal and of potential benefit to society and the economy, also aided companies that were owned in part by the policy maker. The prosecution claimed that Thaksin abused his powers five times while premier.

====The verdict====
The court first ruled that Thaksin and Potjaman were the real owners of the assets, rather than his children and relatives. The court also ruled that it had the authority to seize assets, based on the announcements of the junta. The court found Thaksin guilty of four out of five policy corruption, and ordered that 46 billion baht be seized. The remaining 30 billion was to remain frozen.

* Count 1: Conversion of telecom concession fees into excise charges. Previously, telecom operators had to pay TOT/CAT a percentage of their revenue as a concession fee (TOT/CAT are state-owned enterprises, although they were going through the process of privatisation). The Thaksin government modified this into a system wherein all operators would instead directly pay the government an equivalent excise tax. The imposition of excise tax here would eventually be passed on to consumers. Thaksin claimed that all operators continued to pay the same total costs. The judges ruled that this benefited AIS while harming TOT, and thus was an abuse of power.
* Count 2: Modification of a revenue sharing agreement on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators had to pay TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which generally cost the consumer less, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to TOT, an estimated loss of 14.2 billion baht (revenue reduced from 25 to 20 percent) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56 billion baht (revenue reduced from 30 to 20 percent) from 2006 to 2015. The judges ruled that the terms of the pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT&#x27;s total revenue actually increased substantially as a result of the agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT&#x27;s post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13 percent in 2001 to 80 percent in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68 to 53 percent in the same period were not taken into account by the court.
* Count 3: Modification of mobile roaming agreement. Previously, there were no roaming agreements between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator were not allowed to use services on another operator&#x27;s network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its subscribers roaming on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT&#x27;s income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS&#x27;s new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.
* Count 4: Replacement of ThaiCom 4 with iPSTAR. A previous government had originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 as a backup satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, at the time the largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as Thaicom 3. Shin Corp&#x27;s ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand&#x27;s communications security by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.
* Count 5: EXIM Bank loan to Myanmar to pay for ThaiCom services. Thaksin was scheduled to meet with Burmese leaders to negotiate trade deals between the two countries. One of the deals negotiated gave Myanmar a Thai EXIM Bank loan to purchase 376 million baht in satellite services from ShinSat. Thaksin noted that many deals were struck in the negotiations, and that 16 other companies also benefited from the EXIM Bank&#x27;s loans. The judges ruled that the loans gave preferential treatment to Thaksin, and hence were an abuse of power.

The judges decided to seize 46 billion differences in value of Shin Corp. shares from the date when he came to office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore&#x27;s Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8 billion to 9 billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister. Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while Siam Cement, one of Thailand&#x27;s premier blue chip companies, gained 717%. The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin&#x27;s policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100 billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.

====Aftermath====
In an email to his supporters, Thaksin claimed that the court was used as a tool. He also noted how the Thai stock market rose to the benefit of many companies, not just his, and claimed that all charges against him were politically motivated. He thanked his supporters for not protesting while the verdict was being read, and implored them to use non-violent means in the future. Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees. In spite of Pojaman&#x27;s claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company&#x27;s account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.
Some UDD members held a small protest in front of the court, but did not disrupt the ruling as the government had predicted they would. The UDD leaders announced that a large-scale protest was scheduled to be held on 14 March 2010.

On the evening of 27 February, M67 grenades were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of Bangkok Bank. Nobody was hurt or injured in the attacks. The perpetrators were not caught, and no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks. Thaksin and the UDD were quick to deny any involvement. An arrest warrant was issued based on sketches of a motorcycle driver.

===Transfer of Shin Corp. Shares===
The law does not allow the prime minister to run a side business while holding office. Charges were pressed against Thaksin on wealth concealment while in office.
Prior to the wealth declaration of Thaksin and his family when he took office, there had been an appeal to The National Anti-Corruption Commission that there were some suspicions about the numbers in the report.

====Transferring to maid and driver====
Thaksin was charged with illegally concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of Shin Corp. shares to his drivers and maids without their knowledge. Thaksin tearfully told the Constitutional Court that it was an honest mistake before the Court acquitted him on the charges.

====Transferring shares to children who reached maturity====
There was also a controversy over whether there was any hidden tax evasion when Thaksin and Potjaman transferred their Shin Corporation shares to their children. Panthongtae and Pinthongta Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parents.

The transfer of shares from Thaksin and Potjaman to Parnthongtae was claimed to have been a sham, since there was no actual transfer of money. Panthongtae said the shares were sold to him at cost. Thaksin stated he had a written agreement proving the transfer to his son. Prior to the transfer, Panthongtae had signed an agreement with his father to settle a 4.5 billion baht debt from buying 300 million shares of the Thai Military Bank (TMB). However, the actual market value of the TMB shares at that time was only 1.5 billion baht. This showed a &quot;fake debt&quot; of 3 billion baht had been created. The Assets Examination Committee (AEC) discovered that the account of Panthongtae&#x27;s which had received Shin Corporation&#x27;s dividend had also been used to transfer money to Potjaman&#x27;s account, to the amount of 1.1 billion baht.

Pintongtha was also accused of being a nominee for her parents. She said that the money from her mother was a &quot;birthday present&quot;. This birthday present was used to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corporation, which left her brother with the same amount. The AEC found the account had been receiving dividends from Shin Corp. There were no transactions between Pintongtha&#x27;s account and her mother&#x27;s account. However, the dividend money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark to the amount of 71 million baht and shares from 5 real-estate firms from 2 funds in 2004 worth 485 million baht.

DSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that both WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and his former wife.

==Return to Thailand==

During the run-up to the 2023 general election, Thaksin announced his intent to return to Thailand, after 15 years of self-imposed exile. He said that he was willing to serve his prison sentences in order to finally return home and be with his family. Following several postponements as the government formation process dragged on, he arrived on 22 August, the same day that Pheu Thai candidate Srettha Thavisin would be voted in as prime minister, and was promptly taken to the Supreme Court and then Bangkok Remand Prison to serve a sentence of eight years. Political observers believed that he would be unlikely to serve the entire sentence, and that his return was negotiated as part of a political deal that also brought military-oriented parties into the coalition government.

His sentence was commuted from eight years to one year by King Vajiralongkorn on 1 September after he submitted a formal royal pardon request. On 13 February 2024, Thai justice minister Tawee Sodsong announced that Thaksin was among 930 prisoners who had been granted parole on account of age and health. He was released on parole on 18 February, after spending six months in a Bangkok hospital. Shinawatra, wearing a neck brace and sitting beside his daughters Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Pintongta was driven away from the police hospital and arrived at his Bangkok mansion after his release. On 14 March, he made his first public appearance since his release at the City Pillar Shrine in Bangkok wearing a neck brace and accompanied by Paetongtarn, before going to Chiang Mai Province.

In May 2024, Thaksin was charged with lèse-majesté by the Attorney-General over remarks he made during an interview with South Korean media while in exile in 2015. On 14 June, Thaksin was charged with royal defamation. On 17 August, Thaksin received a royal pardon on the occasion of King Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s birthday.

On 23 February 2025, Thaksin Shinawatra issued a public apology over the Tak Bai incident.

<text>Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), officially the John F. Kennedy School of Government, is the school of public policy and government of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Harvard Kennedy School offers master&#x27;s degrees in public policy, public administration, and international development, four doctoral degrees, and various executive education programs. It conducts research in subjects relating to politics, government, international affairs, and economics. HKS had an endowment of $1.7 billion. It is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a global consortium of schools that trains leaders in international affairs.

The primary campus of Harvard Kennedy School is on John F. Kennedy Street in Cambridge. The main buildings overlook the Charles River and are southwest of Harvard Yard and Harvard Square, on the site of a former MBTA Red Line trainyard. The School is adjacent to the public riverfront John F. Kennedy Memorial Park.

Harvard Kennedy School alumni include 21 heads of state or government from around the world. Alumni also include cabinet officials, military leaders, heads of central banks, and legislators.

==History==
===Founding===
Harvard Kennedy School was founded as the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration in 1936 with a $2 million gift (equivalent to roughly $43 million as of 2023) from Lucius Littauer, an 1878 Harvard College alumnus, businessman, former U.S. Congressman, and the first coach of the Harvard Crimson football team.

Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s shield was designed to express the national purpose of the school and was modeled after the U.S. shield. The School drew its initial faculty from Harvard&#x27;s existing government and economics departments, and welcomed its first students in 1937.

The School&#x27;s original home was in the Littauer Center, north of Harvard Yard, which is now home to Harvard University&#x27;s Economics Department. The first students at the Graduate School were called Littauer Fellows, participating in a one-year course listing which later developed into the school&#x27;s mid-career Master in Public Administration program. In the 1960s, the School began to develop its current public policy degree and course curriculum associated with its Master in Public Policy program.

===Renaming and move===
In 1966, three years following the assassination of U.S. President and 1940 Harvard College alumnus John F. Kennedy, the school was renamed in his honor.

In 1966, concurrent with the school&#x27;s renaming, the Harvard Institute of Politics was created with Neustadt as its founding director. Harvard Institute of Politics has been housed on the school campus since 1978, and today sponsors and hosts a series of programs, speeches and study groups for Harvard undergraduates and graduate students. Along with major Harvard Kennedy School events, the Institute of Politics holds the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, named in honor of John F. Kennedy Jr., in Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Littauer Building.

By 1978, the faculty, including presidential scholar and adviser Richard Neustadt, a foreign policy scholar and later dean of the School, Graham Allison, Richard Zeckhauser, and others consolidated the school&#x27;s programs and research centers at the present Harvard Kennedy School campus. The first new building opened on the southern half of the former Eliot Shops site in October 1978. Under the terms of Littauer&#x27;s original grant, the current campus also features a building called Littauer.

=== Rebranding and campus expansion ===
In late 2007, the Kennedy School of Government announced that while its official name was not being altered, it was rebranding itself as Harvard Kennedy School effective Fall 2008. The goal was to make clearer the school&#x27;s connection with Harvard. It was also thought that the new branding would reduce confusion with other entities named after Kennedy, including the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and the Kennedy Library in Boston. The rebranding had the support of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s brother, U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Caroline Kennedy, the former president&#x27;s daughter.

In 2012, Harvard Kennedy School announced a $500 million fundraising campaign, $120 million of which was to be used to significantly expand the Harvard Kennedy School campus, adding 91,000 square feet of space including six new classrooms, a new kitchen, and dining facility, offices and meeting spaces, a new student lounge and study space, more collaboration and active learning spaces, and a redesigned central courtyard. Groundbreaking commenced on May 7, 2015, and the project was completed in late 2017. The new Harvard Kennedy School campus opened in December 2017.

From 2004 to 2015, Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s dean was David T. Ellwood, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official in the Clinton administration.

In 2015, Douglas Elmendorf, a former director of the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, was named both dean of the Harvard Kennedy School and the school&#x27;s Don K. Price Professor of Public Policy. Elmendorf announced in September 2023 that he would step down as dean at the end of the academic year 2023/2024.

Jeremy M. Weinstein was named dean effective July 1, 2024. Jeremy was a political scientist at Stanford University who previously served as chief of staff to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,

=== Degrees ===
Harvard Kennedy School offers four master&#x27;s degree programs. The two-year Master in Public Policy (MPP) program focuses on policy analysis, economics, management, ethics, statistics and negotiations in the public sector. There are three separate Master in Public Administration (MPA) programs: a one-year Mid-Career Program (MC/MPA) intended for professionals who are more than seven years removed from their college graduation; a two-year MPA program intended for professionals who have an additional graduate degree and are more recently out of school; and a two-year international development track (MPA/ID) focused on development studies with a strong emphasis on economics and quantitative analysis.

Members of the mid-career MPA class also include Mason Fellows, who are public and private executives from developing countries. Mason Fellows typically constitute about 50 percent of the incoming class of Mid-Career MPA candidates. The Mason cohort is the most diverse at Harvard in terms of nationalities and ethnicities represented. It is named after Edward Sagendorph Mason, the former Harvard professor who, from 1947 to 1958, was dean of Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Public Administration, now known as Harvard Kennedy School.

In addition to the master&#x27;s programs, Harvard Kennedy School administers three doctoral programs. Ph.D. degrees are awarded in public policy, in social policy in conjunction with Harvard&#x27;s departments of government and sociology, and in health policy in conjunction with FAS and the Harvard School of Public Health.

==== Joint and concurrent degrees ====
Harvard Kennedy School has a number of joint and concurrent degree programs within Harvard and with other leading universities, which allow students to receive multiple degrees in a reduced period of time. Joint and current students spend at least one year in residence in Cambridge taking courses. Harvard Kennedy School joint degree programs are run with Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Graduate School of Design, and concurrent programs are offered with Harvard Divinity School and Harvard Medical School.

Beyond Harvard, HKS has concurrent degree arrangements with other law, business, and medical schools, including the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the MIT Sloan School of Management, the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia Law School, Duke University School of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, New York University School of Law, Northwestern University School of Law, Stanford Law School, University of California, Berkeley School of Law, University of Michigan Law School, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Yale Law School, and UCSF School of Medicine.

Abroad, Harvard Kennedy School offers a dual degree with the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.

=== HKS courses ===
Harvard Kennedy School maintains six academic divisions each headed by a faculty chair. In addition to offerings in the Harvard Kennedy School course listing, students are eligible to cross-register for courses at the other graduate and professional schools at Harvard and at MIT Sloan School of Management, Fletcher School at Tufts University, and the MIT School of Architecture and Planning. MPP coursework is focused on one of five areas, called a Policy Area of Concentration (PAC), and includes a year-long research seminar in their second year, which includes a master&#x27;s thesis called a Policy Analysis Exercise.

== Rankings ==
Harvard Kennedy School has routinely ranked as the best, or among the best, of the world&#x27;s public policy graduate schools. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks it the best graduate school for social policy, the best for health policy, and second best for public policy analysis. In 2015 rankings, Kennedy School is ranked first in the subcategory of health policy and second in the category of public policy analysis and social policy.

Kennedy&#x27;s School&#x27;s foreign affairs programs have consistently ranked at the top or near the top of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Ivory Tower&quot; survey, which lists the world&#x27;s top twenty academic international relations programs at the undergraduate, Master&#x27;s, and Ph.D. levels. In 2012, for example, the survey ranked Kennedy School first overall for doctoral and undergraduate programs and third overall in the Master&#x27;s category.

==Student organizations==

Harvard Kennedy School maintains a range of student activities, including interest-driven student caucuses, Kennedy School Student Government, known as KSSG, student-edited policy journals, including &quot;Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy&quot;, &quot;Kennedy School Review&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Middle Eastern Politics and Policy&quot;, a student newspaper, &quot;The Citizen&quot;, and a number of student athletic groups.

Students can join the Harvard Graduate Council, which is the centralized student government for the twelve graduate and professional schools of Harvard University. The Harvard Graduate Council is responsible for advocating student concerns to central administrators, including the president of Harvard University, provost, deans of students, and deans for the nearly 15,000 graduate and professional students across the twelve schools, organizing large university-wide initiatives and events, administering and providing funding for university-wide student groups, and representing the Harvard graduate student population to other universities and external organizations. Harvard Graduate Council is known for spearheading the &quot;One Harvard&quot; movement, which aims to bring all of Harvard&#x27;s graduate schools together through closer collaboration and social interaction.

== Centers ==
Harvard Kennedy School is home to 14 centers, including:
* Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation
* Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs
* Bloomberg Center for Cities at Harvard University
* Carr Center for Human Rights Policy
* Center for International Development
* Center for Public Leadership
* Edmond &amp; Lily Safra Center for Ethics
* Institute of Politics
* Joint Center for Housing Studies
* Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy
* Mossavar Rahmani Center for Business and Government
* Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston
* Taubman Center for State and Local Government
* Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy
* Women and Public Policy Program

The majority of centers offer research and academic fellowships through which fellows can engage in research projects, lead study groups into specific topics and share their experiences with industry and government with the student body.

== Controversies ==
Under Dean Elmendorf, the school has tried to focus its engagement across the political spectrum, which has caused controversy at times. The school came under criticism for offering a fellowship to Chelsea Manning on September 13, 2017. It then publicly rescinded the offer on September 15, 2017, after CIA director Mike Pompeo canceled a speaking engagement at Harvard and sent a letter condemning the university for awarding the fellowship.

An investigative report in 2021 by student group Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard found that many of the centers&#x27; climate initiatives were funded in part by fossil fuel companies, and that some of the centers had allegedly taken several steps to cover up that fact.

The Kennedy School&#x27;s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy in 2022 invited Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, a leading global human rights organizations, to join it as a senior fellow. The Kennedy School eventually rescinded the invitation to Roth because Human Rights Watch&#x27;s 2021 investigation of Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians concluded that it met the threshold for the &quot;crime of apartheid&quot;. After condemnation by faculty, students, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, the dean of the school reversed this decision.

==Awards==

The Robert F. Kennedy Award for Excellence in Public Service is awarded to &quot;a graduating student whose commitment, activities, and contributions to public service are extraordinary&quot;. Several other awards are also awarded on Class Day annually at the end of May.

<text>The New-York Tribune (from 1914: &quot;New York Tribune&quot;) was an American newspaper founded in 1841 by editor Horace Greeley. It bore the moniker New-York Daily Tribune from 1842 to 1866 before returning to its original name. From the 1840s through the 1860s it was the dominant newspaper first of the American Whig Party, then of the Republican Party. The paper achieved a circulation of approximately 200,000 in the 1850s, making it the largest daily paper in New York City at the time. The &quot;Tribune&quot;s editorials were widely read, shared, and copied in other city newspapers, helping to shape national opinion. It was one of the first papers in the North to send reporters, correspondents, and illustrators to cover the campaigns of the American Civil War. It continued as an independent daily newspaper until 1924, when it merged with the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. The resulting &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; remained in publication until 1966.

Among those who served on the paper&#x27;s editorial board were Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, and Isidor Lewi.

==History==

The &quot;Tribune&quot; was created by Horace Greeley in 1841 with the goal of providing a straightforward, trustworthy media source. Greeley had previously published a weekly newspaper, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (unrelated to the later modern magazine of the same name), in 1833 and was also publisher of the Whig Party&#x27;s political organ, &quot;Log Cabin&quot;. In 1841, he merged operations of these two publications into a new newspaper that he named the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;.

Greeley sponsored a host of reforms, including pacifism and feminism and especially the ideal of the hardworking free laborer. Greeley demanded reforms to make all citizens free and equal. He envisioned virtuous citizens who would eradicate corruption. He talked endlessly about progress, improvement, and freedom, while calling for harmony between labor and capital. Greeley&#x27;s editorials promoted social democratic reforms and were widely reprinted. They influenced the free-labor ideology of the Whigs and the radical wing of the Republican Party, especially in promoting the free-labor ideology. Before 1848 he sponsored an American version of Fourierist socialist reform, but backed away after the failed revolutions of 1848 in Europe. 

To promote multiple reforms, Greeley hired a roster of writers who later became famous in their own right, including Margaret Fuller, Charles Anderson Dana, George William Curtis, William Henry Fry, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, Julius Chambers, and Henry Jarvis Raymond, who later co-founded &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1852–62, the paper retained Karl Marx as its London-based European correspondent. Friedrich Engels also submitted articles under Marx&#x27;s by-line. Marx resented much of his time working for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, particularly the many edits and deadlines they imposed upon him, and bemoaned the &quot;excessive fragmentation of [his] studies&quot;, noting that since much of his work was reporting on current economic events, &quot;I was compelled to become conversant with practical detail which, strictly speaking, lie outside the sphere of political economy&quot;. Engels wrote &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if they are never read again.&quot;. In the same correspondence Marx disparagingly referred to the publication as a &quot;blotting paper vendor&quot;. Nevertheless, Engels cited this career as a positive achievement of Marx&#x27;s during a eulogy given at his funeral.

Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was first published in the newspaper as part of his October 9, 1849, obituary, &quot;Death of Edgar A. Poe&quot;, by Rufus Griswold. In addition, Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Bells&quot; was published in the October 17, 1849, issue as &quot;Poe&#x27;s Last Poem&quot;.

=== Political influence ===
Founded in a time of civil unrest, the paper joined the newly formed Republican Party in 1854, named it after the party of Thomas Jefferson, and emphasized its opposition to slavery. The paper generated a large readership, with a circulation of approximately 200,000 during the 1850s. This made the paper the largest circulation daily in New York City—gaining commensurate influence among voters and political decision-makers in the process. During the Civil War Greeley crusaded against slavery, lambasting Democrats while calling for a mandatory draft of soldiers for the first time in the U.S. This led to an Irish mob attempting to burn down the &quot;Tribune&quot; building in lower Manhattan during the Draft Riots.

Greeley ran for president as the nominee of the Liberal Republican Party (and subsequently the Democratic Party) in the 1872 election against incumbent Ulysses S. Grant in his bid for a second term. Greeley was unsuccessful and, soon after the defeat, checked into Dr. George C.S. Choate&#x27;s Sanitarium, where he died only a few weeks later. &quot;Tribune&quot; editor Whitelaw Reid purchased the paper following Greeley&#x27;s death.

In 1886, with Reid&#x27;s support, the &quot;Tribune&quot; became the first publication in the world to be printed on a linotype machine, which was invented by a German immigrant, inventor Ottmar Mergenthaler. This technique allowed it to exceed the standard newspaper size of only eight pages while still speeding up printing time per copy, thereby increasing the overall number of copies that could be printed.

=== &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; ===
Under Reid&#x27;s son, Ogden Mills Reid, the paper acquired and merged with the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in 1924 to form the &quot;New York Herald Tribune.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; continued to be run by Ogden M. Reid until his death in 1947.

==Former Tribune buildings today==
* The New York Tribune Building was the first home of Pace University. Today, the site where the building once stood is now the One Pace Plaza complex of Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus. Dr. Choate&#x27;s residence and private hospital, where Horace Greeley died, today is part of the campus of Pace University in Pleasantville, New York.
* On December 15, 1921, &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; bought two plots of ground at 219 and 220 West 40th Street. The headquarters that &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; built at that site is now the home of the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism.

== Archives ==
Copies of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; are available on microfilm at many large libraries and online at the Library of Congress. Also, indices from selected years in the late nineteenth century are available on the Library of Congress&#x27; website. The original paper articles from the newspaper&#x27;s morgue are kept at The Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin.

<doc id="360820" wikidata="Q1417516" url="?curid=360820" title="Cowcatcher">
<text>A cowcatcher, also known as a pilot, is the device mounted at the front of a locomotive to deflect obstacles on the track that might otherwise damage or derail it or the train.

In the UK, small metal bars called &quot;life-guards&quot;, &quot;rail guards&quot; or &quot;guard irons&quot; are provided immediately in front of the wheels. They knock away smaller obstacles lying directly on the running surface of the railhead. Historically, fenced-off railway systems in Europe relied exclusively on those devices and cowcatchers were not required, but in modern systems cowcatchers have generally superseded them.

Instead of a cowcatcher, trams use a device called a fender. Objects lying on the tram track come in contact with a sensor bracket, which triggers the lowering of a basket-shaped device to the ground, preventing the overrunning of the obstacles and dragging them along the road surface in front of the wheels.

In snowy areas the cowcatcher also has the function of a snowplough.

==Invention==
An idea for a cowcatcher was proposed by Charles Babbage in 1830, during his period of working for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. However, Babbage&#x27;s invention was not constructed, and it is uncertain whether later manufacturers were aware of Babbage&#x27;s idea.

The first practical cowcatcher is widely credited to Isaac Dripps, who fitted one to the John Bull (locomotive) in 1833 shortly after steam haulage commenced on the Camden and Amboy Railroad. His design is described and illustrated in David Stevenson&#x27;s book &quot;Sketch of the Civil Engineering of North America&quot;, published in 1838.

==Design==

On a mainline locomotive, the cowcatcher has to successfully deflect an obstacle hit at speed. The design principle is to push the object upwards and sideways out of the way and not to lift the locomotive on impact.

The typical shape is a blunt wedge with a shallow V-shape in plan. In the later days of steam locomotives, the front coupler was designed to swing out of the way also, so it could not get caught up; this was called a &#x27;drop coupler pilot&#x27;.

Early on, cowcatchers were normally fabricated of bars mounted on a frame; later on, sheet metal cowcatchers were often used for their additional smoothness, and some cast steel cowcatchers were employed for their mass and smooth shape. Early diesel locomotives followed the same plan.

Cowcatchers on early switcher locomotives in the US often had steps (called &quot;footboard pilots&quot;) to allow yard workers to ride with the locomotive. In some countries, footboard pilots are outlawed for safety reasons, and have been removed. Modern locomotives often have front and rear platforms with safety rails, or deeply recessed steps, where workers can ride.

==Modern cowcatchers==
Most modern European rail vehicles must have cowcatchers with a snowplough function and rail guards. The required strength of the system is in the middle of the track and near the rails.

Modern US diesel locomotives have flatter, less wedge-shaped cowcatchers, because a diesel locomotive has the cab near the front, and the crew are vulnerable to impact from obstacles pushed up by the cowcatcher.

==Anti-climbers==
To protect the crew and passengers, most modern locomotives have a horizontally grooved steel beam known as an anti-climber fitted across the front, above the coupler. Its purpose is to prevent colliding locomotives from riding up and moving over the locomotive frame through the cab.

<text>The Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT; , , ; &quot;Thais Love Thais Party&quot;) was a Thai political party founded in 1998. From 2001 to 2006, it was the ruling party under its founder, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. During its brief existence, Thai Rak Thai won the three general elections it contested. Eight months after a military coup forced Thaksin to remain in exile, the party was dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal for violation of electoral laws, with 111 former party members banned from participating in politics for five years.

==Party platform and electoral outcomes==
Thai Rak Thai was registered on 15 July 1998, by telecommunications entrepreneur Thaksin Shinawatra and 22 other founding members, including Somkid Jatusripitak, Thanong Bidaya, Sudarat Keyuraphan, Purachai Piumsombun, Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya, and Prommin Lertsuridej.

The Thai Rak Thai party had a populist platform, appealing to indebted farmers, who had become indebted as a result of the Asian financial crisis of 1997, with promises of a strong economic recovery. The party also reached out to rural villages, and struggling businesses. Thai Rak Thai&#x27;s policies included a 30 baht per hospital visit scheme, an extended debt moratorium for farmers, one million baht microcredit development funds for all rural districts, and the One Tambon One Product project.

Thai Rak Thai won the legislative election of 2001 by a landslide over the ruling Democrat Party led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. Forty percent of elected MPs were freshmen. Thai Rak Thai was able to negotiate a merger with the New Aspiration Party and a coalition with the Thai Nation Party, resulting in a majority of 325 of 500 seats for the coalition government of Thaksin Shinawatra.

The Thai Rak Thai Party was the first political party in Thailand to have been represented by more than half of the members of the House of Representatives. In the 2005 legislative election, the party&#x27;s candidates were elected to occupy 376 seats of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives, defeating the largest opposition party, the Democrat Party which won 96 seats. After the election, Thailand&#x27;s first single party government was successfully formed.

In the invalid elections of April 2006, TRT won 61.6 percent of the vote and 460 out of 500 seats, many without any opposition, and the rest remaining vacant because the election was boycotted by opposition parties in the first-past-the-post electoral system.

==Factions==
As an amalgam of several different parties, Thai Rak Thai politicians owed their allegiance to different factions. Precise figures on faction membership do not exist, but estimates of the numerical strength of the major factions are provided below. These numbers are based on the membership of the House of Representatives elected in the 2005 general election, which was dissolved on 24 February 2006.

*Wang Bua Ban – Led by Thaksin&#x27;s sister, Yaowapa Wongsawat, this faction is one of the party&#x27;s most important groupings, as it included many members of prime minister&#x27;s inner circle. The faction&#x27;s base is Thaksin&#x27;s home province of Chiang Mai. It was estimated that Wang Bua Ban commanded the support of over 30 MPs (as of December 2005), mostly from the northern region.
*Wang Nam Yom – Originally a splinter group from Wang Bua Ban, Wang Nam Yom was led by then-Labour Minister Somsak Thepsutin and Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit, who also served as Thai Rak Thai&#x27;s Secretary-General. With the financial backing of Suriya, whose family controls the largest auto parts manufacturer in Thailand, some observers claimed that this faction had the resources to form a party in its own right. The group is said to include over 100 MPs, hailing from the northern, northeastern, and central regions of Thailand.
*Wang Nam Yen – This was the most notorious faction, led by the veteran political power-broker, Sanoh Thienthong, a former Interior Minister who held the title of Chief Advisor to the Thai Rak Thai Party. A native of Sa Kaeo Province, Sanoh in the 1990s built a political empire that came to dominate several border provinces in eastern and northeastern Thailand. Rather than start a political party of his own, however, Sanoh preferred to play the role of kingmaker by shifting his group from party to party. With the collapse in 1992 of the pro-military government, which Sanoh supported, the faction moved to the Chart Thai Party, which went on to win the elections held in 1995. Amid squabbles with Chart Thai leader Banharn Silpa-archa, Sanoh then defected to the New Aspiration Party, which won the 1996 elections. However, with New Aspiration&#x27;s star waning after it was forced out of power in 1997, Sanoh decided to cast his lot with Thai Rak Thai before the 2001 elections. Since joining Thai Rak Thai, however, Wang Nam Yen has largely been sidelined by Thaksin amid occasional squabbles with Sanoh. As a result, Sanoh has become one of Thaksin&#x27;s most vocal critics in the Thai Rak Thai Party. Wang Nam Yen&#x27;s electoral fortunes have also declined slightly since joining Thai Rak Thai at the expense of other factions, and as of February 2006, Sanoh commanded the loyalty of only 37 MPs. He and his wife resigned from the TRT in February 2006 to establish the Royalist People&#x27;s Party.
*Wang Phayanak – This group was led by Deputy Prime Minister Phinij Jarusombat, who was leader of the small Seritham Party before it merged with Thai Rak Thai after the 2001 election. Most of the faction&#x27;s following of approximately 30 MPs (as of December 2005) hail from the northeastern region, where the group often competes with Wang Nam Yen for influence.
*Wang Lam Takong – This faction was composed of the remnants of the old Chart Pattana (National Development) Party, which merged into Thai Rak Thai before the 2005 elections. Chart Pattana&#x27;s former leader, Deputy Prime Minister Suwat Liptapanlop, served as head of this group. The faction&#x27;s influence derives from its strength in the country&#x27;s second-most populous province, Nakhon Ratchasima, which was the stronghold of Chart Pattana. Wang Lam Katong&#x27;s membership is estimated to include as many as 20 MPs.
*Bangkok Faction – The leader of this group was Sudarat Keyuraphan and Chalerm Yubamrung
*Chonburi Faction – Former Sports and Tourism Minister Sontaya Kunplome led this faction, which split from the Chart Thai Party before the 2005 elections to join Thai Rak Thai. Sontaya&#x27;s father is the infamous Somchai Khunpluem, the &quot;godfather&quot; of Chonburi who is better known as &quot;Kamnan Po.&quot; The dominant political force in the eastern provinces of Chonburi and Rayong, this faction counts approximately seven MPs under its wing.
*Buriram Faction – Like the Chonburi Faction, this group also defected from the Chart Thai Party before the 2005 elections. The faction&#x27;s leader is Prime Minister&#x27;s Office Minister Newin Chidchob, probably one of the most popular members of Thai Rak Thai and at the time was considered to be one of Thaksin&#x27;s right hand men. It had a solid base in Newin&#x27;s home province of Buriram and in neighboring Surin Province.
*Ban Rim Nam – This group was led by Deputy House Speaker Suchart Tancharoen, a key figure in the former New Aspiration Party, which merged with Thai Rak Thai after the 2001 elections. The faction has around 15 members.
*Maleenont Faction – Led by Sports and Tourism Minister (as of February 2006) Pracha Maleenont, whose family controls the local broadcasting and entertainment group BEC World. This group&#x27;s influence derives from the Maleenont family&#x27;s role as one of the leading financiers of the Thai Rak Thai Party.
*Pongsak Faction – Under the leadership of Transport Minister Pongsak Raktapongpisak, this group has emerged recently as a significant force within the party, counting approximately 30 MPs as supporters as of December 2005. Pongsak&#x27;s alleged close friendship with Khunying Potjaman Shinawatra, the wife of Prime Minister Thaksin, is said to allow him to wield considerable influence over party and government affairs.

==After the September 2006 coup==
===Whereabouts of party leaders after the coup===
On the evening of 19 September 2006, the Thai military seized control of Bangkok to take over the government. Thaksin Shinawatra was in New York City attending a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Most of the TRT executive leadership were also abroad: Deputy Premier Surakiart Sathirathai was with Thaksin in New York, Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya was in Singapore attending the annual meeting of the World Bank/IMF, Commerce Minister Somkid Jatusripitak was attending the Thai-France Cultural Exhibition in Paris with Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon and HRH Princess Sirindhorn.

Several party executives remaining in Thailand were arrested and detained by the junta. Deputy Prime Minister in charge of national security Chitchai Wannasathit and Defence Minister Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya were in Thailand and were immediately arrested and detained by the junta. Secretary-General to the Premier Prommin Lertsuridej was also arrested. Natural Resources and Environmental Minister Yongyuth Tiyapairat and Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchop were ordered to report to the junta by 21 September. Both reported as ordered and were detained.

Several party executives including Chaturon Chaisang, Phumtham Wechayachai, Suranand Vejjajiva, Veera Musikapong, Party Deputy and Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit and former Social Development and Human Security Minister Watana Muangsook were reported to be in Thailand and free.

===Reactions from party members===
With Thaksin and key party executives either abroad or arrested, the reaction of TRT party members was muted and disorganized. In Thaksin&#x27;s absence, Chaturon Chaisang became the acting party leader.

Several former MPs believed the party would be dissolved by the junta, including former Khon Kaen MP Prajak Kaewklaharn. However, former Udon Thani MP Thirachai Saenkaew, called for the junta to allow Thaksin to contest the next election, claiming that TRT supporters wanted Thaksin to return to politics.

Former Sakon Nakhon MP Chalermchai Ulankul said that although he and others might be unemployed for about a year, his faction was &quot;firm&quot; and preparing to run in the election next year. &quot;As long as the Thai Rak Thai Party is not dissolved, we can&#x27;t say we will move to be under any other party. However, I don&#x27;t know who will continue the TRT.&quot;

Many party members were reported to have dropped their party membership in the aftermath of the coup. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yom faction. It was not clear whether Suriya Jungrungreangkit, another influential member of the faction would also resign. Sonthaya Kunplome also was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party. Fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics fueled the defections.

On 2 October 2006, Thaksin Shinawatra and his former deputy, Somkid Jatusripitak, resigned from the Thai Rak Thai Party, in all probability ending it as a political force.

==Party dissolution==

The party&#x27;s future was in doubt following the military coup that ousted Thaksin&#x27;s government in September 2006. The party was dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the order of the Constitutional Tribunal for violation of election laws. A few high-ranking party members were found to be directly involved in bribing several small parties into competing in constituencies that were bases of the former opposition parties to ensure that minimum turnout rules were met in favor of the TRT party and its partners. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and 110 members of the party were barred from participating in politics for a five-year period, with only eight of 119 charged acquitted. The remaining MPs and members of the party reorganized in the People&#x27;s Power Party.

<text>Solfatara () is a shallow volcanic crater at Pozzuoli, near Naples, part of the Phlegraean Fields () volcanic area. It is a dormant volcano, which still emits jets of steam with sulfurous fumes. The name comes from the Latin, &quot;Sulpha terra&quot;, &quot;land of sulfur&quot;, or &quot;sulfur earth&quot;. It was formed around 4000 years ago and last erupted in 1198 with what was probably a &quot;phreatic&quot; eruption – an explosive steam-driven eruption caused when groundwater interacts with magma. The crater floor was a popular tourist attraction until 2017, as it has many fumaroles and mud pools. The area is well known for its bradyseism. The vapours had been used for medical purposes since Roman times.

This volcano is where the thermoacidophilic archaeon &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot; was first isolated. The archaeon is named for the volcano, as most species of the genus &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; are named for the area where they are first isolated.

==Notable events==
Saint Proculus (the patron saint of Pozzuoli) and Saint Januarius (the patron saint of Naples) were beheaded at Solfatara in 305.

In 2017, three people—an 11-year-old boy and his parents—died, when they fell into a chasm. Initial rumors that claimed that the boy had entered an off-limits area of the crater were declared false by an eyewitness who had watched the scene unfold from her balcony. According to the eyewitness, the family were on the official walking path, when the 11-year-old slipped into the unsecured chasm. His parents died in an attempt to save him. The only survivor was the boy&#x27;s 7-year-old brother.

<text>Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited (AIS) is Thailand&#x27;s largest GSM mobile phone operator with 39.87 million customers as of Q3 2016. Founded in April 1986, AIS started off as a computer rental business. In October 1990, it launched analog 900 MHz mobile phone services with a 20-year monopoly concession from the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), and later became the first company allowed to operate on the GSM-900 frequency. It acquired Shinawatra Paging in June 1992.

The company is controlled by the Intouch Holdings (formerly Shin Corporation), headed by Temasek Holdings, a Singapore government-owned agency. AIS listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand on . As of 23 December 2011, Intouch holds 40.45 percent of the shares of the company and Singapore Telecommunications (also majority-held by Temasek) together with Thai Trust Fund and OCBC Nominees holds a 23.32 percent stake.

Temasek bought the AIS brand through the 2006 acquisition of the Shin Corporation from ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

In February 2014, in a conflict between the People&#x27;s Democratic Reform Committee (PRDC) and Shinawatra, the PDRC called for a boycott of AIS, wrongly believing it to be owned by the Shinawatra family.

In November 2015, four million people in Thailand used mPay, and in August 2013, mPay had around 700 merchant partners.

As of August 2019, AIS is the largest network in Thailand, with 40.1 million subscribers. In addition to post pay services, AIS offers prepaid services under the &quot;1-2-Call&quot; brand.

<text>Shang Yang (; c. 390 – 338 BC), also known as Wei Yang () and originally surnamed Gongsun, was a statesman, chancellor and reformer of the State of Qin. Arguably the &quot;most famous and most influential statesman of the Warring States period&quot;, Gongsun was born in the Zhou vassal state of Wey, migrating to take up office in the Qin state. His policies laid the administrative, political and economic foundations that would eventually enable Qin to conquer the other six rival states, unifying China into a centralized rule for the first time in history under the Qin dynasty. Scholars consider it likely that both he and his followers contributed to &quot;The Book of Lord Shang&quot;.

==Biography==
Shang Yang was born as the son of a concubine to the ruling family of the minor state Wey (衞). His surname (氏, lineage name) was Gongsun and his personal name Yang. As a member of the Wei family, he was also known as Wei Yang.

At a young age, Yang studied law and obtained a position under Prime Minister Shuzuo of Wei (魏, not the same as his birth state). With the support of Duke Xiao of Qin, Yang left his lowly position in Wei to become the chief adviser in Qin. His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral Qin state into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Changes to the state&#x27;s legal system (which were said to have been built upon Li Kui&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Laws&quot;) propelled the Qin to prosperity. Enhancing the administration through an emphasis on meritocracy, his policies weakened the power of the feudal lords.

In 341 BC, Qin attacked the state of Wei. Yang personally led the Qin army to defeat Wei, and eventually Wei ceded the land west of the Yellow River to Qin. For his role in the war, Yang received 15 cities in Shang as his personal fief and became known as the lord of Shang (Shang Jun) or Shang Yang. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, with his personal connections while serving in the court of Wei, Shang Yang invited Gongzi Ang, the Wei general, to negotiate a peace treaty. As soon as Ang arrived, he was taken prisoner, and the Qin army attacked, successfully defeating their opponents.

Gongsun oversaw the construction of Xianyang. and Mark Edward Lewis considered reorganization of the military as potentially responsible for the orderly plan of roads and fields throughout north China. This might be far fetched, but Yang was as much a military reformer as a legal one.

The Shang Yang school of thought was favoured by Emperor Wu of Han, and John Keay mentions that Tang figure Du You was drawn to Shang Yang.

==Reforms==
He is credited by Han Fei, often considered to be the greatest representative of Chinese Legalism (法家), with the creation of two theories;

#&quot;fixing the standards&quot; ()
#&quot;equality before the law&quot; ()

Believing in the rule of law and considering loyalty to the state above that of the family, Yang introduced two sets of changes to the State of Qin. The first, in 356 BC, were-
#Li Kui&#x27;s &quot;Book of Law&quot; was implemented, with the important addition of a rule providing punishment equal to that of the perpetrator for those aware of a crime but failing to inform the government. He codified reforms into enforceable laws. The laws were stringent and multitudinous reformed by Yang and the punishments were strict.
#Assigning land to soldiers based upon their military successes and stripping nobility unwilling to fight of their land rights. The army was separated into twenty military ranks, based upon battlefield achievements. The reform of military made Qin citizens willing to join the army and helped the Qin dynasty build the military power necessary to unify China.
#As manpower was short in Qin, Yang encouraged the cultivation of unsettled lands and wastelands and immigration, favouring agriculture over luxury commerce (though also paying more recognition to especially successful merchants).

Yang introduced his second set of changes in 350 BC, which included a new standardized system of land allocation and reforms to taxation.

The vast majority of Yang&#x27;s reforms were taken from policies instituted elsewhere, such as from Wu Qi of the State of Chu; however, Yang&#x27;s reforms were more thorough and extreme than those of other states, and monopolized policy in the hands of the ruler. Under his tenure, Qin quickly caught up with and surpassed the reforms of other states.

==Domestic policies==
Yang introduced land reforms, privatized land, rewarded farmers who exceeded harvest quotas, enslaved farmers who failed to meet quotas, and used enslaved subjects as (state-owned) rewards for those who met government policies.

As manpower was short in Qin relative to the other states at the time, Yang enacted policies to increase its manpower. As Qin peasants were recruited into the military, he encouraged active migration of peasants from other states into Qin as a replacement workforce; this policy simultaneously increased the manpower of Qin and weakened the manpower of Qin&#x27;s rivals. Yang made laws forcing citizens to marry at a young age and passed tax laws to encourage raising multiple children. He also enacted policies to free convicts who worked in opening wastelands for agriculture. 

Yang partly abolished primogeniture (depending on the performance of the son) and created a double tax on households that had more than one son living in the household, to break up large clans into nuclear families.

Yang moved the capital from the city of Yueyang to Xianyang, in order to reduce the influence of nobles on the administration. Xianyang remained Qin&#x27;s capital until its fall in 207 BC.

==Death==
Yang was deeply despised by the Qin nobility and became vulnerable after the death of Duke Xiao. The next ruler, King Huiwen, ordered the nine familial exterminations against Yang and his family, on the grounds of fomenting rebellion. Yang had previously humiliated the new duke &quot;by causing him to be punished for an offense as though he were an ordinary citizen.&quot; According to &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, Yang went into hiding; at one point Yang was refused a room at an inn because one of his own laws prevented admission of a guest without proper identification.

Yang was executed by &quot;jūliè&quot; (: dismemberment by being fastened to five chariots, cattle or horses and being torn to pieces); his whole family was also executed. Despite his death, King Huiwen kept the reforms enacted by Yang. 

A number of alternate versions of Yang&#x27;s death have survived. According to Sima Qian in his &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Yang first escaped to Wei. However, he was hated there for his earlier betrayal of Gongzi Ang and was expelled. Yang then fled to his fiefdom, where he raised a rebel army but was killed in battle. After the battle, King Hui of Qin had Yang&#x27;s corpse torn apart by chariots as a warning to others.

Following the execution of Yang, King Huiwen turned away from the central valley south to conquer Sichuan (Shu and Ba) in what Steven Sage calls a &quot;visionary reorientation of thinking&quot; toward material interests in Qin&#x27;s bid for universal rule.

===Assessments===
A. F. P. Hulsewé considered Shang Yang the &quot;founder of the school of law&quot;, and considers his unification of punishments one of his most important contributions; that is, giving the penalty of death to any grade of person disobeying the king&#x27;s orders. Shang Yang even expected the king, though the source of law (authorizing it), to follow it. This treatment is in contrast to ideas more typical of archaic society, more closely represented in the Rites of Zhou as giving different punishments to different strata of society.

Hulsewe points out that Sima Tan considered equal treatment the &quot;school of law&#x27;s&quot; most salient point: &quot;They do not distinguish between close and far relatives, nor do they disriminate between noble and humble, but in a uniform manner they decide on them in law.&quot; The Han dynasty adopted essentially the same denominations of crimes, and conception of equality, as Shang Yang set down for Qin, without collective punishment of the three sets of relatives.

Shang Yang appeared to act according to his own teachings, and translator Duvendak (1928) references him as being considered &quot;like a bamboo‑frame which keeps a bow straight, and one could not get him out of his straightness&quot;, even if spoken of by some pre-modern Chinese in ill regard with the fall of Qin. Duvendak believed that Shang Yang should be of interest not just to Sinologists, but Western Jurists as well.

Despite traditional history&#x27;s dim view, Sima Qian recounts the immediate effect of his policies as such: After [the ordinances] had been in effect for ten years, the commoners of Qin were delighted; no one picked up articles lost on the road, there were no bandits or thieves in the mountains, households were well provided for and the people were well off. The commoners were brave in the duke’s battles but cowardly in private feuds and the townships and cities were in good order. (Sima Qian 1994a, 90)

<doc id="360833" wikidata="Q532494" url="?curid=360833" title="New York Herald Tribune">
<text>The New York Herald Tribune was a newspaper published between 1924 and 1966. It was created in 1924 when Ogden Mills Reid of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; acquired the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. It was regarded as a &quot;writer&#x27;s newspaper&quot; and competed with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the daily morning market. The paper won twelve Pulitzer Prizes during its lifetime.

A &quot;Republican paper, a Protestant paper and a paper more representative of the suburbs than the ethnic mix of the city&quot;, according to one later reporter, the &quot;Tribune&quot; generally did not match the comprehensiveness of &quot;The New York Times&quot; coverage. Its national, international and business coverage, however, was generally viewed as among the best in the industry, as was its overall style. At one time or another, the paper&#x27;s writers included Dorothy Thompson, Red Smith, Roger Kahn, Richard Watts Jr., Homer Bigart, Walter Kerr, Walter Lippmann, St. Clair McKelway, Judith Crist, Dick Schaap, Tom Wolfe, John Steinbeck, and Jimmy Breslin. Editorially, the newspaper was the voice for eastern Republicans, later referred to as Rockefeller Republicans, and espoused a pro-business, internationalist viewpoint.

The paper, first owned by the Reid family, struggled financially for most of its life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements; the Reids subsidized the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; through the paper&#x27;s early years. However, it enjoyed prosperity during World War II and by the end of the conflict had pulled close to the &quot;Times&quot; in ad revenue. A series of disastrous business decisions, combined with aggressive competition from the &quot;Times&quot; and poor leadership from the Reid family, left the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; far behind its rival.

In 1958, the Reids sold the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; to John Hay Whitney, a multimillionaire Wall Street investor who was serving as ambassador to the United Kingdom at the time. Under his leadership, the &quot;Tribune&quot; experimented with new layouts and new approaches to reporting the news and made important contributions to the body of New Journalism that developed in the 1960s. The paper steadily revived under Whitney, but a 114-day newspaper strike stopped the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;s gains and ushered in four years of strife with labor unions, particularly the local chapter of the International Typographical Union. Faced with mounting losses, Whitney attempted to merge the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; with the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; and the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; in the spring of 1966; the proposed merger led to another lengthy strike, and on August 15, 1966, Whitney announced the closure of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;. Combined with investments in the &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;, Whitney spent $39.5 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in his attempts to keep the newspaper alive.

After the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; closed, the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, joined by Whitney, entered an agreement to operate the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, the paper&#x27;s former Paris publication. By 1967, the paper was owned jointly by Whitney Communications, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, also known as the &quot;IHT&quot;, ceased publication in 2013.

==Origins: 1835–1924==

===&quot;New York Herald&quot;===
The &quot;New York Herald&quot; was founded on May 6, 1835, by James Gordon Bennett, a Scottish immigrant who came to the United States aged 24. Bennett, a firm Democrat, had established a name in the newspaper business in the 1820s with dispatches sent from Washington, D.C., to the New York &quot;Enquirer&quot;, most sharply critical of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay; one historian called Bennett &quot;the first real Washington reporter&quot;. Bennett was also a pioneer in crime reporting; while writing about a murder trial in 1830, the attorney general of Massachusetts attempted to restrict the coverage of the newspapers: Bennett criticized the move as an &quot;old, worm-eaten, Gothic dogma of the Court...to consider the publicity given to every event by the Press, as destructive to the interests of law and justice&quot;. The fight over access eventually overshadowed the trial itself.

Bennett founded the &quot;New York Globe&quot; in 1832 to promote the re-election of Andrew Jackson to the White House, but the paper quickly folded after the election. After a few years of journalistic piecework, he founded the &quot;Herald&quot; in 1835 as a penny newspaper, similar in some respects to Benjamin Day&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; but with a strong emphasis on crime and financial coverage; the &quot;Herald&quot; &quot;carried the most authentic and thorough list of market prices published anywhere; for these alone it commanded attention in financial circles&quot;. Bennett, who wrote much of the newspaper himself, &quot;perfected the fresh, pointed prose practiced in the French press at its best&quot;. The publisher&#x27;s coverage of the 1836 murder of Helen Jewett—which, for the first time in the American press, included excerpts from the murder victim&#x27;s correspondence—made Bennett &quot;the best known, if most notorious…journalist in the country&quot;.

Bennett put his profits back into his newspaper, establishing a Washington bureau and recruiting correspondents in Europe to provide the &quot;first systematic foreign coverage&quot; in an American newspaper. By 1839, the &quot;Herald&quot;s circulation exceeded that of &quot;The London Times&quot;. When the Mexican–American War broke out in 1846, the &quot;Herald&quot; assigned a reporter to the conflict—the only newspaper in New York to do so—and used the telegraph, then a new technology, to not only beat competitors with news but provide Washington policymakers with the first reports from the conflict. During the American Civil War, Bennett kept at least 24 correspondents in the field, opened a Southern desk and had reporters comb the hospitals to develop lists of casualties and deliver messages from the wounded to their families.

===&quot;New-York Tribune&quot;===
The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; was founded by Horace Greeley in 1841. Greeley, a native of New Hampshire, had begun publishing a weekly paper called &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; (unrelated to the magazine of the same name) in 1834, which won attention for its political reporting and editorials. Joining the Whig Party, Greeley published &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, which helped elect William H. Seward Governor of New York State in 1838, and then the &quot;Log Cabin&quot;, which advocated for the election of William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election, attained a circulation of 80,000 and turned a small profit.

With Whigs in power, Greeley saw the opportunity to launch a daily penny newspaper for their constituency. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; launched on April 10, 1841. Unlike the &quot;Herald&quot; or the &quot;Sun&quot;, it generally shied about from graphic crime coverage; Greeley saw his newspaper as having a moral mission to uplift society, and frequently focused his energies on the newspaper&#x27;s editorials—&quot;weapons…in a ceaseless war to improve society&quot;—and political coverage. While a lifelong opponent of slavery and, for time, a proponent of socialism, Greeley&#x27;s attitudes were never exactly fixed: &quot;The result was a potpourri of philosophical inconsistencies and contradictions that undermined Greeley&#x27;s effectiveness as both logician and polemicist.&quot; However, his moralism appealed to rural America; with six months of beginning the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Greeley combined &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Log Cabin&quot; into a new publication, the &quot;Weekly Tribune&quot;. The weekly version circulated nationwide, serving as a digest of news melded with agriculture tips. Offering prizes like strawberry plants and gold pens to salesmen, the &quot;Weekly Tribune&quot; reached a circulation of 50,000 within 10 years, outpacing the &quot;Herald&quot;″s weekly edition.

The Tribune&#x27;s ranks included Henry Raymond, who later founded &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Charles Dana, who would later edit and partly own &quot;The Sun&quot; for nearly three decades. Dana served as second-in-command to Greeley, but Greeley abruptly fired him in 1862, after years of personality conflicts between the two men. Raymond, who felt he was &quot;overused and underpaid&quot; as a reporter on the Tribune staff, later served in the New York State Assembly and, with the backing of bankers in Albany, founded the &quot;Times&quot; in 1851, which quickly became a rival for the Whig readership that Greeley cultivated.

After the Civil War, Bennett turned over daily operations of the &quot;Herald&quot; to his son James Gordon Bennett Jr., and lived in seclusion until his death in 1872. That year, Greeley, who had been an early supporter of the Republican Party, had called for reconciliation of North and South following the war and criticized Radical Reconstruction. Gradually becoming disenchanted with Ulysses S. Grant, Greeley became the surprise nominee of the Liberal Republican faction of the party (and the Democrats) in the 1872 presidential election. The editor had left daily operations of the &quot;Tribune&quot; to his protege, Whitelaw Reid; he attempted to resume his job after the election, but was badly hurt by a piece (intended humorously) that said Greeley&#x27;s defeat would chase political office seekers from the &quot;Tribune&quot; and allow the staff to &quot;manage our own newspaper without being called aside every hour to help lazy people whom we don&#x27;t know and…benefit people who don&#x27;t deserve assistance&quot;. The piece was widely (and incorrectly) attributed to Greeley as a sign of bitterness at the outcome; Reid refused to print Greeley&#x27;s furious disclaimer of the story, and by the end of the month, Greeley had died.

===Decline under second generation===

Both newspapers went into gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett Jr.—&quot;a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse&quot;—had a mercurial reign. He launched the &quot;New York Telegram&quot;, an evening paper, in the late 1860s and kept the &quot;Herald&quot; the most comprehensive source of news among the city&#x27;s newspapers. Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives at one point that he was the &quot;only reader of this paper&quot;: &quot;I am the only one to be pleased. If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. I want one feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it&#x27;s going to be.&quot; In 1874, the &quot;Herald&quot; ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where the front page of the newspaper was devoted entirely to a fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.

Whitelaw Reid, who won control of the &quot;Tribune&quot; in part due to the likely assistance of financier Jay Gould, turned the newspaper into an orthodox Republican organ, wearing &quot;its stubborn editorial and typographical conservatism…as a badge of honor&quot;. Reid&#x27;s hostility to labor led him to bankroll Ottmar Mergenthaler&#x27;s development of the linotype machine in 1886, which quickly spread throughout the industry. However, his day-to-day involvement in the operations of the &quot;Tribune&quot; declined after 1888, when he was appointed Minister to France and largely focused on his political career; Reid even missed a large-scale 50th anniversary party for the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1891. Despite this, the paper remained profitable due to an educated and wealthy readership that attracted advertisers.

The &quot;Herald&quot; was the largest circulation newspaper in New York City until 1884. Joseph Pulitzer, who came from St. Louis and purchased the &quot;New York World&quot; in 1882, aggressively marketed a mix of crime stories and social reform editorials to a predominantly immigrant audience, and saw his circulation quickly surpass those of more established publishers. Bennett, who had moved permanently to Paris in 1877 after publicly urinating in the fireplace or piano of his fiancée&#x27;s parents (the exact location differed in witnesses&#x27; memories) spent the &quot;Herald&quot;s still sizable profits on his own lifestyle, and the Herald&#x27;s circulation stagnated. Bennett respected Pulitzer, and even ran an editorial praising the publisher of &quot;The World&quot; after health problems forced him to relinquish the editorship of the paper in 1890. However, he despised William Randolph Hearst, who purchased the &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1895 and attempted to ape Pulitzer&#x27;s methods in a more sensationalistic manner. The challenge of &quot;The World&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; spurred Bennett to revitalize the paper; the &quot;Herald&quot; competed keenly with both papers during coverage of the Spanish–American War, providing &quot;the soundest, fairest coverage…(of) any American newspaper&quot;, sending circulation over 500,000.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; largely relied on wire copy for its coverage of the conflict. Reid, who helped negotiate the treaty that ended the war had by 1901 become completely disengaged from the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s daily operations. The paper was no longer profitable, and the Reids largely viewed the paper as a &quot;private charity case&quot;. By 1908, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was losing $2,000 a week. In an article about New York City&#x27;s daily newspapers that year, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; found the newspaper&#x27;s &quot;financial pages … execrable, its news columns readable but utterly commonplace, and its rubber-stamping of Republican policies (making) it the last sheet in town operated as a servant of party machinery&quot;.

The &quot;Herald&quot; also saw its reputation for comprehensiveness challenged by the &quot;Times&quot;, purchased by &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot; publisher Adolph Ochs in 1896, a few weeks before the paper would have likely closed its doors. Ochs, turning the once-Republican &quot;Times&quot; into an independent Democratic newspaper, refocused the newspaper&#x27;s coverage on commerce, quickly developing a reputation as the &quot;businessman&#x27;s bible&quot;. When the &quot;Times&quot; began turning a profit in 1899, Ochs began reinvesting the profits make into the newspaper toward news coverage, quickly giving the &quot;Times&quot; the reputation as the most complete newspaper in the city. Bennett, who viewed the &quot;Herald&quot; as a means of supporting his lifestyle, did not make serious moves to expand the newspaper&#x27;s newsgathering operations, and allowed the paper&#x27;s circulation to fall well below 100,000 by 1912.

===Revival of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, fall of the &quot;Herald&quot;===

The &quot;Herald&quot; suffered a fatal blow in 1907. Bennett, his hatred for the &quot;Journal&quot; owner unabated, attacked Hearst&#x27;s campaigns for Congress in 1902, and his run for governor of New York in 1906. The &quot;Herald&quot;s coverage of Hearst&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign was particularly vicious, as Bennett ordered his reporters to publish every negative item about Hearst&#x27;s past that they could. Hearst, seeking revenge, sent a reporter to investigate the &quot;Herald&quot;″s personal columns, which ran in the front of the paper and, in veiled language, advertised the service of prostitutes; reporters referred to it as &quot;The Whores&#x27; Daily Guide and Handy Compendium.&quot; The resulting investigation, published in the &quot;Journal&quot;, led to Bennett&#x27;s conviction on charges of sending obscene matter through the mails. The publisher was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine—Bennett paid it in $1,000 bills—and the &quot;Herald&quot; &quot;suffered a blow in prestige and circulation from which it never really recovered&quot;.

Whitelaw Reid died in 1912 and was succeeded as publisher by his son, Ogden Mills Reid. The younger Reid, an &quot;affable but lackluster person,&quot; began working at the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1908 as a reporter and won the loyalty of the staff with his good nature and eagerness to learn. Quickly moved through the ranks—he became managing editor in 1912—Reid oversaw the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s thorough coverage of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, ushering a revival of the newspaper&#x27;s fortunes. While the paper continued to lose money, and was saved from bankruptcy only by the generosity of Elisabeth Mills Reid, Ogden&#x27;s mother., the younger Reid encouraged light touches at the previously somber &quot;Tribune&quot;, creating an environment where &quot;the windows were opened and the suffocating solemnity of the place was aired out&quot;. Under Reid&#x27;s tenure the &quot;Tribune&quot; lobbied for legal protection for journalists culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court case Burdick v. United States. In 1917, the &quot;Tribune&quot; redesigned its layout and became the first American newspaper to use the Bodoni font for headlines. The font gave a &quot;decided elegance&quot; to the &quot;Tribune&quot; and was soon adopted by magazines and other newspapers, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and the &quot;Miami Herald.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot; developed a reputation for typographical excellence it would maintain for more than four decades. Reid, who inherited a newspaper whose circulation may have fallen to 25,000 daily—no higher than the circulation in 1872—saw the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; readership jump to about 130,000 by 1924.

Reid&#x27;s wife, Helen Rogers Reid, took charge of the newspaper&#x27;s advertising department in 1919. Helen Reid, &quot;who believed in the newspaper the way a religious person believes in God&quot;, reorganized the faltering department, aggressively pursuing advertisers and selling them on the &quot;wealth, position and power&quot; of the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s readership. In her first two years on the job, the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s annual advertising revenues jumped from $1.7 million to $4.3 million, &quot;with circulation responsible for no more than 10 percent of the increase&quot;. Reid&#x27;s efforts helped cut the newspaper&#x27;s dependence on subsidies from the family fortune and pushed it toward a paying track. Reid also encouraged the development of women&#x27;s features at the newspaper, the hiring of female writers, and helped establish a &quot;home institute&quot; that tested recipes and household products.

The &quot;Herald&quot;″s decline continued in the new decade. With the outbreak of World War I, Bennett devoted most of his attention to the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;, doing his first newspaper reporting at the age of 73 and keeping the publication alive despite wartime censorship. The New York paper, however, was in freefall, and posted a loss in 1917. The next year, Bennett died, having taken some $30 million out of the lifetime profits of the &quot;Herald&quot;. Two years later, the &quot;Herald&quot; newspapers were sold to Frank Munsey for $3 million.

Munsey had won the enmity of many journalists with his buying, selling and consolidation of newspapers, and the &quot;Herald&quot; became part of Munsey&#x27;s moves. The publisher merged the morning &quot;Sun&quot; (which he had purchased in 1916) into the &quot;Herald&quot; and attempted to revive the newspaper through his financial resources, hoping to establish the &quot;Herald&quot; as the pre-eminent Republican newspaper within the city. To achieve that end, he approached Elisabeth Mills Reid in early 1924 with a proposal to purchase the &quot;Tribune&quot;—the only other Republican newspaper in New York—and merge it with the &quot;Herald&quot;. The elder Reid refused to sell, saying only that she would buy the &quot;Herald&quot;. The two sides negotiated through the winter and spring. Munsey approached Ogden Reid with a proposal to swap the profitable evening &quot;Sun&quot; with the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which Reid refused. The Reids countered with an offer of $5 million for the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;, which Munsey agreed to on March 17, 1924.

The move surprised the journalism community, which had expected Munsey to purchase the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; management informed its staff of the sale in a brief note posted on a bulletin board; reading it, one reporter remarked &quot;Jonah just swallowed the whale&quot;.

The merged paper, which published its first edition on March 19, was named the &quot;New York Herald New York Tribune&quot; until May 31, 1926, when the more familiar &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; was substituted. Apart from the &quot;Herald&quot;s radio magazine, weather listings and other features, &quot;the merged paper was, with very few changes, the &quot;Tribune&quot; intact&quot;. Only 25 &quot;Herald&quot; reporters were hired after the merger; 600 people lost their jobs. Within a year, the new paper&#x27;s circulation reached 275,000.

==&quot;New York Herald Tribune:&quot; 1924–1946==

===1924–1940: Social journalism and mainstream Republicanism===

The newly merged paper was not immediately profitable, but Helen Reid&#x27;s reorganization of the business side of the paper, combined with an increasing reputation as a &quot;newspaperman&#x27;s newspaper&quot;, led the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; to post a profit of nearly $1.5 million in 1929, as circulation climbed over the 300,000 mark. The onset of the Great Depression, however, wiped out the profits. In 1931, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; lost $650,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars), and the Reid family was once again forced to subsidize the newspaper. By 1933, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; turned a profit of $300,000, and would stay in the black for the next 20 years, without ever making enough money for significant growth or reinvestment.

Through the 1930s Ogden Reid often stayed late at Bleeck&#x27;s, a popular hangout for &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; reporters.; by 1945, &quot;Tribune&quot; historian Richard Kluger wrote, Reid was struggling with alcoholism. The staff considered the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s owner &quot;kindly and likable, if deficient in intelligence and enterprise&quot;. Helen Reid increasingly took on the major leadership responsibilities at the newspaper—a fact &quot;Time&quot; noted in a 1934 cover story. Reid, angered, called her husband &quot;the most independent-minded man I have ever met&quot;, to which &quot;Time&quot; replied that &quot;it is Mrs. Reid who often helps that independent mind make itself up&quot;.

Editorially, the newspaper thrived, winning its first Pulitzer Prize for reporting in 1930 for Leland Stowe&#x27;s coverage of the Second Reparations Conference on German reparations for World War I, where the Young Plan was developed. Stanley Walker, who became the newspaper&#x27;s city editor in 1928, pushed his staff (which briefly included Joseph Mitchell) to write in a clear, lively style, and pushed the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s local coverage &quot;to a new kind of social journalism that aimed at capturing the temper and feel of the city, its moods and fancies, changes or premonitions of change in its manners, customs, taste, and thought—daily helpings of what amounted to urban anthropology&quot;. The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s editorials remained conservative—&quot;a spokesman for and guardian of mainstream Republicanism&quot;—but the newspaper also hired columnist Walter Lippmann, seen at the time as a liberal, after &quot;The World&quot; closed its doors in 1931. Unlike other pro-Republican papers, such as Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; or the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;-owned &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which held an isolationist and pro-German stance, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; was more supportive of the British and the French as the specter of World War II developed, a similar stance was approached by the &quot;Sun&quot; and the &quot;World-Telegram&quot;, the latter of them also having an ardently liberal past as a Pulitzer newspaper.

Financially, the paper continued to stay out of the red, but long-term trouble was on the horizon. After Elisabeth Mills Reid died in 1931—after having given the paper $15 million over her lifetime—it was discovered that the elder Reid had treated the subsidies as loans, not capital investments. The notes on the paper were willed to Ogden Reid and his sister, Lady Jean Templeton Reid Ward. The notes amounted to a mortgage on the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, which prevented the newspaper from acquiring bank loans or securing public financing. Financial advisors at the newspaper advised the Reids to convert the notes into equity, which the family resisted. This decision would play a major role in the Reids&#x27; sale of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; in 1958.

Seeking to cut costs during the Recession of 1937, the newspaper&#x27;s management decided to consolidate its foreign coverage under Laurence Hills, who had been appointed editor of the &quot;Paris Herald&quot; by Frank Munsey in 1920 and kept the paper profitable. But Hills had fascist sympathies—the &quot;Paris Herald&quot; was alone among American newspapers in having &quot;ad columns sprout(ing) with swastikas and &quot;fasces&quot;—and was more interested in cutting costs than producing journalism. &quot;It is no longer the desire even to attempt to run parallel with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in special dispatches from Europe,&quot; Hills wrote in a memo to the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;s foreign bureaus in late 1937. &quot;Crisp cables of human interest or humorous type cables are greatly appreciated. Big beats in Europe these days are not very likely.&quot; The policy effectively led the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; to surrender the edge in foreign reporting to its rival.

The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; strongly supported Wendell Willkie for the Republican nomination in the 1940 presidential election; Willkie&#x27;s managers made sure the newspaper&#x27;s endorsement was placed in each delegate&#x27;s seat at the 1940 Republican National Convention. The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; continued to provide a strong voice for Willkie (who was having an affair with literary editor Irita Van Doren) through the election. Dorothy Thompson, then a columnist at the paper, openly supported Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election and was eventually forced to resign.

===World War II===

Historians of &quot;The New York Times&quot;—including Gay Talese, Susan Tifft and Alex S. Jones—have argued that the &quot;Times&quot;, faced with newsprint rationing during World War II, decided to increase its news coverage at the expense of its advertising, while the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; chose to run more ads, trading short-term profit for long-term difficulties. In &quot;The Kingdom and the Power&quot;, Talese&#x27;s 1969 book about the &quot;Times&quot;, Talese wrote &quot;the additional space that &quot;The Times&quot; was able to devote to war coverage instead of advertising was, in the long run, a very profitable decision: &quot;The Times&quot; lured many readers away from the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and these readers stayed with &quot;The Times&quot; after the war into the Nineteen-fifties and Sixties&quot;. Although &quot;The New York Times&quot; had the most comprehensive coverage of any American newspaper—the newspaper put 55 correspondents in the field, including drama critic Brooks Atkinson—its news budget fell from $3.8 million in 1940 to $3.7 million in 1944; the paper did not significantly expand its number of newsroom employees between 1937 and 1945 and its ad space, far from declining, actually increased during the conflict and was consistently ahead of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;s. Between 1941 and 1945, advertising space in the &quot;Times&quot; increased from 42.58 percent of the paper to 49.68 percent, while the &quot;Tribune&quot; saw its ad space increase from 37.58 percent to 49.32 percent. In 1943 and 1944, more than half the &quot;Times&quot;″ went to advertising, a percentage the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; did not meet until after the war. However, because the &quot;Tribune&quot; was generally a smaller paper than the &quot;Times&quot; and saw its ad space jump more, &quot;the &quot;proportionate&quot; increase in the &quot;Tribune&quot; seemed greater than it was in absolute terms. The evidence that this disproportionate increase in the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s advertising content left its readers feeling deprived of war news coverage and sent them in droves to the &quot;Times&quot; is, at best, highly ambiguous.&quot;

The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; always had at least a dozen correspondents in the field, the most famous of whom was Homer Bigart. Allowing wire services to write &quot;big picture&quot; stories, Bigart—who covered the Anzio Campaign, the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa—focused instead on writing about tactical operations conducted by small units and individual soldiers, in order to &quot;bring a dimension of reality and understanding to readers back home&quot;. Frequently risking his life to get the stories, Bigart was highly valued by his peers and the military, and won the 1945 Pulitzer Prize.

By the end of the conflict, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; had enjoyed some of its best financial years in its history. While the newspaper had just 63 percent of its rival&#x27;s daily circulation (and 70 percent of the Sunday circulation of &quot;The Times&quot;), its high-income readership gave the paper nearly 85 percent of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ overall ad revenue, and had made $2 million a year between 1942 and 1945. In 1946, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s Sunday circulation hit an all-time peak of 708,754.

==Decline: 1947–1958==

===Pressure from the &quot;Times&quot;===

The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; began a decline shortly after World War II that had several causes. The Reid family was long accustomed to resolve shortfalls at the newspaper with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper &quot;as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a profit-making opportunity&quot;. With its generally marginal profitability, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the &quot;Times&quot; did, and the Reids&#x27; mortgage on the newspaper made it difficult to raise outside cash for needed capital improvements.

After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper&#x27;s pressroom. The investment squeezed the paper&#x27;s resources, and Robinson decided to make up the difference at the end of the year by raising the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the &quot;Times&quot;, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. However, the &quot;Times&quot;, concerned by the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s performance during the war, refused to go along. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to give them any quarter,&quot; &quot;Times&quot; circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. &quot;Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn&#x27;t want to do anything to jeopardize them. &#x27;No free rides for the competition&#x27; was the way we looked at it.&quot; The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the &quot;Times&quot; was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; would not raise its price until 1950.

Ogden Reid died early in 1947, making Helen Reid leader of the &quot;Tribune&quot; in name as well as in fact. Reid chose her son, Whitelaw Reid, known as &quot;Whitie&quot;, as editor. The younger Reid had written for the newspaper and done creditable work covering the London Blitz, but had not been trained for the duties of his position and was unable to provide forceful leadership for the newspaper. The &quot;Tribune&quot; also failed to keep pace with the &quot;Times&quot; in its facilities: While both papers had about the same level of profits between 1947 and 1950, the &quot;Times&quot; was heavily reinvesting money in its plant and hiring new employees. The &quot;Tribune&quot;, meanwhile, with Helen Reid&#x27;s approval, cut $1 million from its budgets and fired 25 employees on the news side, reducing its foreign and crime coverage. Robinson was dismissive of the circulation lead of the &quot;Times&quot;, saying in a 1948 memo that 75,000 of its rival&#x27;s readers were &quot;transients&quot; who only read the wanted ads.

The &quot;Times&quot; also began to push the &quot;Tribune&quot; hard in suburbs, where the &quot;Tribune&quot; had previously enjoyed a commanding lead. At the urging of Goldstein, &quot;Times&quot; editors added features to appeal to commuters, expanded (and in some cases subsidized) home delivery, and paid retail display allowances—&quot;kickbacks, in common parlance&quot;—to the American News Company, the controller of many commuter newsstands, to achieve prominent display. &quot;Tribune&quot; executives were not blind to the challenge, but the economy drive at the paper undercut efforts to adequately compete. The newspaper fell into the red in 1951. The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s losses reached $700,000 in 1953, and Robinson resigned late that year.

===Leadership changes===
The paper distinguished itself in its coverage of the Korean War; Bigart and Marguerite Higgins, who engaged in a fierce rivalry, shared a Pulitzer Prize with &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; correspondent Keyes Beech and three other reporters in 1951. The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s cultural criticism was also prominent: John Crosby&#x27;s radio and television column was syndicated in 29 newspapers by 1949, and Walter Kerr began a successful three-decade career as a Broadway reviewer at the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1951. However, the paper&#x27;s losses were continuing to mount. Whitelaw Reid was gradually replaced by his brother, Ogden R. Reid, nicknamed &quot;Brown&quot;, to take charge of the paper. As president and publisher of the paper, Brown Reid tried to interject an energy his brother lacked and reach out to new audiences. In that spirit, the &quot;Tribune&quot; ran a promotion called &quot;Tangle Towns&quot;, where readers were invited to unscramble the names of jumbled up town and city names in exchange for prizes. Reid also gave more prominent play to crime and entertainment stories. Much of the staff, including Whitelaw Reid, felt there was too much focus on circulation at the expense of the paper&#x27;s editorial standards, but the promotions initially worked, boosting its weekday circulation to over 400,000.

Reid&#x27;s ideas, however, &quot;were prosaic in the extreme&quot;. His promotions included printing the sports section on green newsprint and a pocket-sized magazine for television listings that initially stopped the Sunday paper&#x27;s circulation skid, but proved an empty product. The &quot;Tribune&quot; turned a profit in 1956, but the &quot;Times&quot; was rapidly outpacing it in news content, circulation, and ad revenue. The promotions largely failed to hold on to the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s new audiences; the Sunday edition began to slide again and the paper fell into the red in 1957. Through the decade, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was the only newspaper in the city to see its share of ad lineage drop, and longtime veterans of the paper, including Bigart, began departing. The Reids, who had by now turned their mortgage into stock, began seeking buyers to infuse the &quot;Tribune&quot; with cash, turning to John Hay &quot;Jock&quot; Whitney, whose family had a long association with the Reids. Whitney, recently named ambassador to Great Britain, had chaired Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s fundraising campaigns in 1952 and 1956 and was looking for something else to engage him beyond his largely ceremonial role in Great Britain. Whitney, who &quot;did not want the &quot;Tribune&quot; to die&quot;, gave the newspaper $1.2 million over the objections of his investment advisors, who had doubts about the newspaper&#x27;s viability. The loan came with the option to take controlling interest of the newspaper if he made a second loan of $1.3 million. Brown Reid expected the $1.2 million to cover a deficit that would last through the end of 1958, but by that year the newspaper&#x27;s loss was projected at $3 million, and Whitney and his advisors decided to exercise their option. The Reids, claiming to have put $20 million into the newspaper since the 1924 merger initially attempted to keep editorial control of the paper, but Whitney made it clear he would not invest additional money in the &quot;Tribune&quot; if the Reids remained at the helm. The family yielded, and Helen, Whitie and Brown Reid announced Whitney&#x27;s takeover of the newspaper on August 28, 1958. The Reids retained a substantial stake in the &quot;Tribune&quot; until its demise, but Whitney and his advisors controlled the paper.

==The Whitney Era: 1958–1966==

===&quot;Who says a good newspaper has to be dull?&quot;===
Whitney initially left management of the newspaper to Walter Thayer, a longtime advisor. Thayer did not believe the &quot;Tribune&quot; was a financial investment—&quot;it was a matter of &#x27;let&#x27;s set it up so that (Whitney) can do it if this is what he wants&quot;—but moved to build a &quot;hen house&quot; of media properties to protect Whitney&#x27;s investment and provide money for the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Over the next two years, Whitney&#x27;s firm acquired &quot;Parade&quot;, five television stations and four radio stations. The properties, merged into a new company called Whitney Communications Corporation, proved profitable, but executives chafed at subsidizing the &quot;Tribune.&quot;

Thayer also looked for new leadership for the newspaper. In 1961—the same year Whitney returned to New York—the &quot;Tribune&quot; hired John Denson, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor and native of Louisiana who was &quot;a critical mass of intensity and irascibility relieved by interludes of amiability.&quot; Denson had helped raise &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; circulation by 50 percent during his tenure, in part through innovative layouts and graphics, and he brought the same approach to the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Denson &quot;swept away the old front-page architecture, essentially vertical in structure&quot; and laid out stories horizontally, with unorthodox and sometimes cryptic headlines; large photos and information boxes. The &quot;Densonized&quot; front page sparked a mixed reaction from media professionals and within the newspaper—&quot;Tribune&quot; copy editor John Price called it &quot;silly but expert silliness&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; called the new front page &quot;all overblown pictures (and) klaxon headlines&quot;—but the newspaper&#x27;s circulation jumped in 1961 and those within the &quot;Tribune&quot; said &quot;the alternative seemed to be the death of the newspaper.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot; also launched an ad campaign targeting the &quot;Times&quot; with the slogan &quot;Who says a good newspaper has to be dull?&quot;

The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s revival came as the &quot;Times&quot; was bringing on new leadership and facing financial trouble of its own. While the &quot;Times&quot; picked up 220,000 readers during the 1950s, its profits declined to $348,000 by 1960 due to the costs of an international edition and investments into the newspaper. A western edition of the newspaper, launched in 1961 by new publisher Orvil Dryfoos in an attempt to build the paper&#x27;s national audience, also proved to be a drain and the &quot;Times&quot; profits fell to $59,802 by the end of 1961. While the &quot;Times&quot; outdistanced its rival in circulation and ad lineage, the &quot;Tribune&quot; continued to draw a sizeable amount of advertising, due to its wealthy readership. The &quot;Times&quot; management watched the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s changes with &quot;uneasy contempt for their debasement of classic &quot;Tribune&quot; craftmanship but also with grudging admiration for their catchiness and shrewdness.&quot; &quot;Times&quot; managing editor Turner Catledge began visiting the city room of his newspaper to read the early edition of the &quot;Tribune&quot; and sometimes responded with changes, though he ultimately decided Denson&#x27;s approach would be unsuccessful. But the financial challenges both papers faced led Dryfoos, Thayer, and previous &quot;Times&quot; publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger to discuss a possible merger of the &quot;Times&quot; and the &quot;Tribune,&quot; a project codenamed &quot;Canada&quot; at the &quot;Times&quot;.

Denson&#x27;s approaches to the front page often required expensive work stoppages to redo the front page, which increased expenses and drew concern from Whitney and Thayer. Denson also had a heavy-handed approach to the newsroom that led some to question his stability, and led him to clash with Thayer. Denson left the &quot;Tribune&quot; in October 1962 after Thayer attempted to move the nightly lockup of the newspaper to managing editor James Bellows. But Denson&#x27;s approach would continue at the paper. Daily circulation at the &quot;Tribune&quot; reached an all-time high of 412,000 in November, 1962.

===Labor unrest, New Journalism===

The New York newspaper industry came to an abrupt halt on December 8, 1962, when the local of the International Typographical Union, led by Bert Powers, walked off the job, leading to the 114-day 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike. The ITU, known as &quot;Big Six&quot;, represented 3,800 printers, as well as workers at 600 printshops and 28 publications in the city but, like other newspaper unions, had taken a backseat to the Newspaper Guild (which had the largest membership among the unions) in contract negotiations. This arrangement began to fray in the 1950s, as the craft unions felt the Guild was too inclined to accept publishers&#x27; offers without concern for those who did the manual work of printing. Powers wanted to call a strike to challenge the Guild&#x27;s leadership and thrust ITU to the fore.

New technology was also a concern for management and labor. Teletypesetting (TTS), introduced in the 1950s, was used by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and promised to be far more efficient than the linotype machines still used by the &quot;Tribune&quot; and most other New York newspapers. TTS required less skill than the complex linotype machines, and publishers wanted to automate to save money. ITU was not necessarily opposed to TTS—it trained its members on the new equipment—but wanted to control the rate at which automation occurred; assurances that TTS operators would be paid at the same rates as linotype workers; that at least a portion of the savings from publishers would go toward union pension plans (to allow funding to continue as the workforce and union membership declined) and guarantees that no printer would lose their job as a result of the new technology. Publishers were willing to protect jobs and reduce the workforce through attrition, but balked at what they viewed as &quot;tribute payments&quot; to the unions. After nearly a five-month strike, the unions and the publishers reached an agreement in March, 1963—in which the unions won a weekly worker wage and benefit increase of $12.63 and largely forestalled automation—and the city&#x27;s newspapers resumed publication on April 1, 1963.

The strike added new costs to all newspapers, and increased the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s losses to $4.2 million while slashing its circulation to 282,000. Dryfoos died of a heart ailment shortly after the strike and was replaced as &quot;Times&quot; publisher by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who ended merger talks with the &quot;Tribune&quot; because &quot;it just didn&#x27;t make any long-term sense to me.&quot; The paper also lost long-established talent, including Marguerite Higgins, Earl Mazo and Washington bureau chief Robert Donovan. Whitney, however, remained committed to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and promoted James Bellows to editor of the newspaper. Bellows kept Denson&#x27;s format but &quot;eliminated features that lacked substance or sparkle&quot; while promoting new talent, including movie critic Judith Crist and Washington columnists Robert Novak and Rowland Evans.

From 1963 until its demise, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published a weekly magazine supplement titled &quot;Book Week&quot;; Susan Sontag published two early essays there. The &quot;Tribune&quot; also began experimenting with an approach to news that later was referred to as the New Journalism. National editor Dick Wald wrote in one memo &quot;there is no mold for a newspaper story,&quot; and Bellows encouraged his reporters to work &quot;in whatever style made them comfortable.&quot; Tom Wolfe, who joined the paper after working at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote lengthy features about city life; asking an editor how long his pieces should be, he received the reply &quot;until it gets boring.&quot; Bellows soon moved Wolfe to the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s new Sunday magazine, &quot;New York&quot;, edited by Clay Felker. Bellows also prominently featured Jimmy Breslin in the columns of the &quot;Tribune,&quot; as well as writer Gail Sheehy.

Editorially, the newspaper remained in the liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist, pro-business, and supportive of civil rights. In April 1963, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published the &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;, written by Martin Luther King Jr.. The &quot;Tribune&quot; became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, while agreeing with Goldwater&#x27;s approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater&#x27;s voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper&#x27;s editorial support also played a role in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.

===Attempted JOA and the death of the &quot;Tribune&quot;===

Whitney supported the changes at the &quot;Tribune&quot; but they did not help the newspaper&#x27;s bottom line. A survey of readers of the newspaper in late 1963 found that readers &quot;appreciated the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s innovations, (but) the &quot;Times&quot; still plainly ranked as the prestige paper in the New York field, based mostly on its completeness.&quot; Whitney himself was popular with the staff—Breslin called him &quot;the only millionaire I ever rooted for&quot;—and once burst out of his office wondering why the &quot;Tribune&quot; failed to sell more copies when &quot;there&#x27;s compelling reading on every page.&quot; But a second strike in 1965—which led the &quot;Tribune&quot; to leave the publishers&#x27; association in a desperate attempt to survive—pushed the Tribune&#x27;s losses to $5 million and led Thayer to conclude the newspaper could no longer survive on its own.

In 1966, Whitney and Thayer attempted to organize what would have been New York&#x27;s first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned &quot;New York Journal American&quot; and the Scripps-owned &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun.&quot; Under the proposed agreement, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; would have continued publication as the morning partner and the &quot;Journal-American&quot; and &quot;World-Telegram&quot; would merge as the &quot;World Journal,&quot; an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the &quot;Times&quot; continued to publish).

The strike, which dragged into August, sealed the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s fate. Half the editorial staff left the newspaper for new jobs during the strike. That summer, Bellows wrote to Matt Meyer, the head of the new company, that it would be &quot;almost impossible—with the present staff—to publish a &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; I would be proud to be the editor of, or be able to compete with successfully in the morning field.&quot; On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the &quot;Tribune&quot; building on August 15. &quot;I know we gave something good to our city while we published and I know it will be a loss to journalism in this country as we cease publication,&quot; Whitney said. &quot;I am glad that we never tried to cheapen it in any way, that we have served as a conscience and a valuable opposition. I am sorry that it had to end.&quot;

The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s demise hastened a settlement of the strike. Discontinued as a morning paper, the &quot;Tribune&quot; name was added to the afternoon publication and on September 12, 1966, the new &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot; published its first issue. &quot;It was not a bad paper, but it was a misbegotten thing&quot; according to &quot;Tribune&quot; historian Richard Kluger, and featured many &quot;Tribune&quot; writers, including Wolfe, Breslin, Kerr and columnist Dick Schaap, and incorporated &quot;New York&quot; as its Sunday magazine. The first weeks&#x27; editions were dominated by the input of the Hearst and Scripps papers, but after a time, the &quot;Widget&quot; (as the merged publication was nicknamed) took on the appearance and style of the late-era &quot;Tribune&quot;. The &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot; reached a circulation near 700,000—fourth-largest for American evening newspapers at the time—but had high overhead costs and relatively little advertising. Whitney eventually withdrew support for the newspaper, but Scripps and Hearst continued to back it until the paper folded on May 5, 1967.

Following the collapse of the &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; became joint owners with Whitney of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s European edition, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, which is still published under full ownership by the &quot;Times&quot;, which bought out the &quot;Post&quot; holdings in 2003 and changed the paper&#x27;s name to the &quot;International New York Times&quot; in 2013. In 1968, &quot;New York&quot; editor Clay Felker organized a group of investors who bought the name and rights to &quot;New York&quot;, and successfully revived the weekly as an independent magazine.

==Book and Author Luncheon==
From 1938 to 1966, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; participated in the American Booksellers Association&#x27;s popular Book and Author Luncheons. The luncheons were held eight times per year at the Waldorf Astoria and were hosted by the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s literary editor, Irita Bradford Van Doren. Van Doren also selected its guests, typically three per event, who included Jane Jacobs, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Moses, Rachel Carson, and John Kenneth Galbraith, among others. Radio broadcasts of the luncheon aired on WNYC from 1948 to 1968 (two years after the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s demise).

== New York Herald Tribune Syndicate ==

The New York Herald Tribune Syndicate distributed comic strips and newspaper columns. The syndicate dates back to at least 1914, when it was part of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. The Syndicate&#x27;s most notable strips were Clare Briggs&#x27; &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot;, Harry Haenigsen&#x27;s &quot;Our Bill&quot;, and &quot;Penny&quot;, Mell Lazarus&#x27; &quot;Miss Peach&quot;, and Johnny Hart&#x27;s &quot;B.C.&quot; Syndicated columns included Weare Holbrook&#x27;s &quot;Soundings&quot; and John Crosby&#x27;s radio and television column.

In 1963, &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; publisher John Hay Whitney (who also owned the Chicago-based Field Enterprises) acquired the Chicago-based Publishers Syndicate, merging Publishers&#x27; existing syndication operations with the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate, Field&#x27;s Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate, and the syndicate of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; (a newspaper that had been acquired by Field Enterprises in 1959).

In 1966, when the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; folded, Publishers Syndicate inherited the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate strips, including &quot;B.C.&quot;, &quot;Miss Peach&quot;, and &quot;Penny&quot;.

==European edition==
The merger that created the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; in 1924 also included bringing along the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;, an edition that was produced in Paris and had an established reputation.

For a while after 1924, the front-page masthead retained the title The New York Herald, with the subtitle European Edition Of The New York Herald Tribune. This was in part to avoid confusion with the European edition of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which was a competitor publication; this was resolved in 1934 when the owners of the Herald Tribune bought the European edition of the Chicago paper. The merger became effective December 1, 1934. Subsequently, the masthead carried the full New York Herald Tribune title, with the subtitle European Edition. In any case, throughout its lifetime, the European edition was often referred to as the Paris Herald Tribune, or just the Paris Herald.

In the pre-World War II years the European edition was known for its feature stories. The edition looked positively on the emergence of European fascism, cheering on the Italian invasion of Ethiopia as well as the German remilitarization of the Rhineland and annexation of Austria and calling for a fascist party to exist in the United States.

This carried on until April 1939, when the New York paper required the Paris one to hew to its editorial line. The European edition was the last newspaper to publish in Paris before the city fell in June 1940.

Following the liberation of Paris four years later, it resumed publication on December 22, 1944. In the years after the war, it was initially profitable, then not, then did better again when it began publishing the first columns by humorist Art Buchwald, who subsequently became a popular syndicated columnist. Later, the European edition took on more serious reporting while also employing what has been described as &quot;breezy promotion tactics&quot;. &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; owner John Hay Whitney began taking an active interest in the European edition in 1961. The International Edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was a competitor of sorts, and by 1964 had a circulation of some 32,000 although it attracted little advertising. As a commercial proposition it was inferior to the European edition of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, which had a circulation of around 50,000 and more advertising in it. In general, the European edition of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; was considered the stronger publication.

The European edition was not involved in the complex multi-paper merger discussions of 1966, and did not shut down when it was announced on August 15, 1966, that the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; would not continue. Instead, earlier that month on August 4, it had been announced that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was buying a 45 percent interest in the European edition, and that once the deal was closed it would begin publishing as &quot;The International Edition of the New York Herald Tribune–The Washington Post&quot;. The change became official in early December 1966. As Buchwald wrote about the ungainly title in his column, &quot;if you ask for it under that name at the airport you&#x27;ll miss your plane.&quot;

During the following year, the publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave up on its own international edition. Instead, the Times invested jointly and equally with Whitney Communications and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to create a new paper, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. The first issue of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; was published on May 22, 1967; in appearance it was very similar to the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

==Awards and cultural references==
In the 1920s, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; established one of the first book review sections that reviewed children&#x27;s books, and in 1937, the newspaper established the Children&#x27;s Spring Book Festival Award for the best children&#x27;s book of the previous year, awarded for three target age groups: 4–8, 8–12, and 12–16. This was the second nationwide children&#x27;s book award, after the Newbery Medal.

At an event in Washington, on November 23, 1946, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson honored 82 war correspondents. 18 of them had been employees of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. They were Howard Barnes, Homer Bigart, Herbert Clark, Joseph F. Driscoll, Joseph Evans, Lewis Gannett, Marguerite Higgins, Russell Hill, John D. O&#x27;Reilly, Geoffrey Parsons, John C. Smith, John Steinbeck, Dorothy Thompson, Sonia Tomora, Thomas Twitty, William W. White, and Gill Robb Wilson.

In Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Breathless&quot;, the lead female character Patricia (Jean Seberg) is an American student journalist who sells the European edition on the streets of Paris. She periodically calls out &quot;New York Herald Tribune!&quot; while engaged in conversation with her love interest, the wandering criminal Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo).

==The &quot;Dingbat&quot;==
For more than a century, the logo of the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;, and its later successor, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, featured a hand-drawn &quot;dingbat&quot; between the words &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot;, which first originated as part of the front page logotype of the &quot;Tribune&quot; on April 10, 1866. The &quot;dingbat&quot; was replaced with an all-text header beginning with the issue of May 21, 2008, to give a &quot;more contemporary and concise presentation that is consistent with our digital platforms.&quot; The drawing included a clock in the center, set to 6:12 p.m., and two figures on either side of it, a toga-clad thinker facing leftward and a young child holding an American flag marching rightward. An eagle spreading its wings was perched atop the clock. The dingbat served as an allegorical device to depict antiquity on the left and the progressive American spirit on the right. The significance of the clock&#x27;s time remains a mystery.

<text>C&amp;A is a multinational chain of retail clothing stores that originated in the Netherlands. It now has European head offices in Vilvoorde, Belgium, and Düsseldorf, Germany. The company operates approximately 1,300 stores in Europe and approximately 300 stores in Brazil, as well as websites for online shopping. It also licenses the C&amp;A name for stores in Mexico and China, which are under different ownership. 

==History==
===Foundation===
The Brenninkmeyer family had traded in linen and textiles since the 17th century from Mettingen, Germany. In 1841, a Dutch textile firm was founded in Sneek by brothers Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer, later taking its company name from the initials of the founders. The family was very secretive, in part to avoid customs scrutiny, and upon reaching age 14, male members of the family were given the choice of working for C&amp;A or joining the Catholic priesthood. In 1906, Clemens&#x27; son, Bernard Joseph, started operating in Amsterdam. By 1910, there were ten C&amp;A stores in the Netherlands.

In 1974, C&amp;A was one of the sponsors of the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In 1978, C&amp;A sponsored cycling through Eddy Merckx&#x27;s team, taking over from Fiat France.

===Development since 2000===
In 2000, due to competition from Tesco and Asda, as well as from expanding high street names such as H&amp;M, Zara and Topshop, C&amp;A announced its withdrawal from the British market, where it had been operating since 1922, had 109 stores, and had used the name &quot;C&amp;A Modes&quot;. The last UK retail stores closed in 2001. Primark bought six C&amp;A stores.

In June 2009, C&amp;A withdrew from the Argentinian market. 

In the summer of 2010, Beyoncé released a clothing line, House of Deréon, in cooperation with C&amp;A.

In May and June 2017, the company closed four stores in the Netherlands due to poor sales.

In February 2020, Grupo Axo agreed to buy C&amp;A Mexico, but cancelled the contract in March 2021. In June 2023 C&amp;A Mexico was sold to Grupo Alfra, owner of the Mexican Cuidado con el Perro stores. On 20 August 2020, C&amp;A sold C&amp;A China to Zhongke Tongrong Private Equity to operate the stores via franchising.

In 2021 and 2022, the company closed 70 stores and stated the goal of having half of its sales come from online channels by 2026. In March 2022, the company shut its &quot;Canda&quot; brand, which produced formalwear, due to the decline in sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2022, C&amp;A began selling clothing via Amazon. Also in July 2022, it was discovered that C&amp;A&#x27;s Serbian division was the victim of customs fraud on the import of goods from China. The unpaid duties led to the Serbian division filing bankruptcy and closing its 14 stores.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
The company name is derived from the initials of its founders, Clemens (1818–1902) and August (1819–1892) Brenninkmeijer. The Brenninkmeijer family owns C&amp;A through a Swiss firm named COFRA Holding AG. The company&#x27;s success has led the Brenninkmeijer family to be ranked among the wealthiest in the Netherlands, but most members of the family actually live in Geneva and Zug, Switzerland.

===Brands===
C&amp;A&#x27;s brands, under which several of its goods are sold, include Angelo Litrico, Avanti, Clockhouse, Here+There, Palomino, Rodeo, Westbury, Yessica, Yessica Pure, and Your Sixth Sense.

===Criticism===
In December 2021, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights filed a criminal complaint in a Dutch court against C&amp;A and other brands, including Lidl and Hugo Boss, alleging that they benefited from and were complicit in the use of forced labour by Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

==Locations==
As of 2023, C&amp;A had stores in the following countries:
==In popular culture==
*The Specials referenced C&amp;A in &quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot; on the 1980 album &quot;More Specials&quot;. The phrase &quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot; was later used to typify someone who was unfashionable.
*In an episode of the sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses,&quot; Del Boy tells his brother Rodney that when they become millionaires, their clothes will &quot;come from Man at C&amp;A&quot;.
*The Belle and Sebastian song &quot;Expectations&quot; features a character who is given the choice between working at Debenhams and C&amp;A &quot;cause that&#x27;s what they expect&quot;.

<doc id="360835" wikidata="Q432635" url="?curid=360835" title="Coercivity">
<text>Coercivity, also called the magnetic coercivity, coercive field or coercive force, is a measure of the ability of a ferromagnetic material to withstand an external magnetic field without becoming demagnetized. Coercivity is usually measured in oersted or ampere/meter units and is denoted .

An analogous property in electrical engineering and materials science, electric coercivity, is the ability of a ferroelectric material to withstand an external electric field without becoming depolarized.

Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity are called magnetically &quot;hard&quot;, and are used to make permanent magnets. Materials with low coercivity are said to be magnetically &quot;soft&quot;. The latter are used in transformer and inductor cores, recording heads, microwave devices, and magnetic shielding.

==Definitions==


Coercivity in a ferromagnetic material is the intensity of the applied magnetic field (&quot;H&quot; field) required to demagnetize that material, after the magnetization of the sample has been driven to saturation by a strong field. This demagnetizing field is applied opposite to the original saturating field. There are however different definitions of coercivity, depending on what counts as &#x27;demagnetized&#x27;, thus the bare term &quot;coercivity&quot; may be ambiguous:

* The &quot;normal coercivity&quot;, , is the &quot;H&quot; field required to reduce the magnetic flux (average &quot;B&quot; field inside the material) to zero.
* The &quot;intrinsic coercivity&quot;, , is the &quot;H&quot; field required to reduce the magnetization (average &quot;M&quot; field inside the material) to zero.
* The &quot;remanence coercivity&quot;, , is the &quot;H&quot; field required to reduce the remanence to zero, meaning that when the &quot;H&quot; field is finally returned to zero, then both &quot;B&quot; and &quot;M&quot; also fall to zero (the material reaches the origin in the hysteresis curve).

The distinction between the normal and intrinsic coercivity is negligible in soft magnetic materials, however it can be significant in hard magnetic materials. The strongest rare-earth magnets lose almost none of the magnetization at &quot;H&quot;Cn.

==Experimental determination==
Typically the coercivity of a magnetic material is determined by measurement of the magnetic hysteresis loop, also called the &quot;magnetization curve&quot;, as illustrated in the figure above. The apparatus used to acquire the data is typically a vibrating-sample or alternating-gradient magnetometer. The applied field where the data line crosses zero is the coercivity. If an antiferromagnet is present in the sample, the coercivities measured in increasing and decreasing fields may be unequal as a result of the exchange bias effect.

The coercivity of a material depends on the time scale over which a magnetization curve is measured. The magnetization of a material measured at an applied reversed field which is nominally smaller than the coercivity may, over a long time scale, slowly relax to zero. Relaxation occurs when reversal of magnetization by domain wall motion is thermally activated and is dominated by magnetic viscosity. The increasing value of coercivity at high frequencies is a serious obstacle to the increase of data rates in high-bandwidth magnetic recording, compounded by the fact that increased storage density typically requires a higher coercivity in the media.

==Theory==
At the coercive field, the vector component of the magnetization of a ferromagnet measured along the applied field direction is zero. There are two primary modes of magnetization reversal: single-domain rotation and domain wall motion. When the magnetization of a material reverses by rotation, the magnetization component along the applied field is zero because the vector points in a direction orthogonal to the applied field. When the magnetization reverses by domain wall motion, the net magnetization is small in every vector direction because the moments of all the individual domains sum to zero. Magnetization curves dominated by rotation and magnetocrystalline anisotropy are found in relatively perfect magnetic materials used in fundamental research. Domain wall motion is a more important reversal mechanism in real engineering materials since defects like grain boundaries and impurities serve as nucleation sites for reversed-magnetization domains. The role of domain walls in determining coercivity is complicated since defects may &quot;pin&quot; domain walls in addition to nucleating them. The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets is similar to that of grain boundaries and plasticity in metallurgy since both domain walls and grain boundaries are planar defects.

==Significance==
As with any hysteretic process, the area inside the magnetization curve during one cycle represents the work that is performed on the material by the external field in reversing the magnetization, and is dissipated as heat. Common dissipative processes in magnetic materials include magnetostriction and domain wall motion. The coercivity is a measure of the degree of magnetic hysteresis and therefore characterizes the lossiness of soft magnetic materials for their common applications.

The saturation remanence and coercivity are figures of merit for hard magnets, although maximum energy product is also commonly quoted. The 1980s saw the development of rare-earth magnets with high energy products but undesirably low Curie temperatures. Since the 1990s new exchange spring hard magnets with high coercivities have been developed.

<doc id="360837" wikidata="Q137869" url="?curid=360837" title="Germinal (novel)">
<text>Germinal is the thirteenth novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s twenty-volume series &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;. Often considered Zola&#x27;s masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel – an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers&#x27; strike in northern France in the 1860s – has been published and translated in over one hundred countries. It has also inspired five film adaptations and two television productions.

&quot;Germinal&quot; was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, then in March 1885 published as a book.

The title () refers to the name of a month of the French Republican Calendar, a spring month. &quot;Germen&quot; is a Latin word which means &quot;seed&quot;; the novel describes the hope for a better future that seeds amongst the miners. As the final lines of the novel read:
==Plot summary==
The novel&#x27;s central character is Étienne Lantier, previously seen in &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; (1877), and originally to have been the central character in Zola&#x27;s &quot;murder on the trains&quot; thriller &quot;La Bête humaine&quot; (1890) before the overwhelmingly positive reaction to &quot;Germinal&quot; persuaded him otherwise. The young migrant worker arrives at the forbidding coal mining town of Montsou in the bleak area of the far north of France to earn a living as a miner. Sacked from his previous job on the railways for assaulting a superior, Étienne befriends the veteran miner Maheu, who finds him somewhere to stay and gets him a job pushing the carts down the pit.

Étienne is portrayed as a hard-working idealist but also a naïve youth; Zola&#x27;s genetic theories come into play as Étienne is presumed to have inherited his Macquart ancestors&#x27; traits of hotheaded impulsiveness and an addictive personality capable of exploding into rage under the influence of drink or strong passions. Zola keeps his theorizing in the background and Étienne&#x27;s motivations are much more natural as a result. He embraces socialist principles, reading large amounts of working class movement literature and fraternizing with Souvarine, a Russian anarchist and political émigré who has also come to Montsou to seek a living in the pits, and Rasseneur, a pub owner. Étienne&#x27;s simplistic understanding of socialist politics and their rousing effect on him are very reminiscent of the rebel Silvère in the first novel in the cycle, &quot;La Fortune des Rougon&quot; (1871).

While this is going on, Étienne also falls for Maheu&#x27;s daughter Catherine, also employed pushing carts in the mines, and he is drawn into the relationship between her and her brutish lover Chaval, a prototype for the character of Buteau in Zola&#x27;s later novel &quot;La Terre&quot; (1887). The complex tangle of the miners&#x27; lives is played out against a backdrop of severe poverty and oppression, as their working and living conditions continue to worsen throughout the novel; eventually, pushed to breaking point, the miners decide to strike and Étienne, now a respected member of the community and recognized as a political idealist, becomes the leader of the movement. While the anarchist Souvarine preaches violent action, the miners and their families hold back, their poverty becoming ever more disastrous, until they are sparked into a ferocious riot, the violence of which is described in explicit terms by Zola, as well as providing some of the novelist&#x27;s best and most evocative crowd scenes. The rioters are eventually confronted by police and the army that repress the revolt in a violent and unforgettable episode. Disillusioned, the miners go back to work, blaming Étienne for the failure of the strike; then, Souvarine sabotages the entrance shaft of one of the Montsou pits, trapping Étienne, Catherine and Chaval at the bottom. The ensuing drama and the long wait for rescue are among some of Zola&#x27;s best scenes, and the novel draws to a dramatic close. After Chaval is killed by Étienne, Catherine and Étienne are finally able to be lovers before Catherine dies in his arms. Étienne is eventually rescued and fired but he goes on to live in Paris with Pluchart, an organizer for the International.

==Historical context==
The title, &quot;Germinal&quot;, is drawn from the springtime seventh month of the French Revolutionary Calendar and is meant to evoke imagery of germination, new growth and fertility. Accordingly, Zola ends the novel on a note of hope and one that has provided inspiration to socialist and reformist causes of all kinds throughout the years since its first publication:

By the time of Zola&#x27;s death, the novel had come to be recognized as his undisputed masterpiece. At his funeral crowds of workers gathered, cheering the cortège with shouts of &quot;Germinal! Germinal!&quot;. Since then the book has come to symbolize working class causes and to this day retains a special place in French mining-town folklore.

Zola was always very proud of &quot;Germinal&quot; and was always keen to defend its accuracy against accusations of hyperbole and exaggeration (from the conservatives) or of slander against the working classes (from the socialists). His research had been typically thorough, especially the parts involving lengthy observational visits to northern French mining towns in 1884, such as witnessing the after-effects of a crippling miners&#x27; strike first-hand at Anzin or actually going down a working coal pit at Denain. The mine scenes are especially vivid and haunting as a result. Tom Wolfe described one incident from Zola&#x27;s research:
In 1884 Zola went down into the mines at Anzin to do the documentation for what was to become the novel &quot;Germinal&quot;. Posing as a secretary for a member of the French Chamber of Deputies, he descended into the pits wearing his city clothes, his frock coat, high stiff collar, and high stiff hat (this appeals to me for reasons I won’t delay you with), and carrying a notebook and pen. One day Zola and the miners who were serving as his guides were 150 feet below the ground when Zola noticed an enormous workhorse, a Percheron, pulling a sled piled with coal through a tunnel. Zola asked, “How do you get that animal in and out of the mine every day?” At first the miners thought he was joking. Then they realized he was serious, and one of them said, “Mr. Zola, don’t you understand? That horse comes down here once, when he’s a colt, barely more than a foal, and still able to fit into the buckets that bring us down here. That horse grows up down here. He grows blind down here after a year or two, from the lack of light. He hauls coal down here until he can’t haul it anymore, and then he dies down here, and his bones are buried down here.” When Zola transfers this revelation from the pages of his documentation notebook to the pages of &quot;Germinal&quot;, it makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You realize, without the need of amplification, that the horse is the miners themselves, who descend below the face of the earth as children and dig coal down in the pit until they can dig no more and then are buried, often literally, down there.

A sensation upon original publication, it is now by far the best-selling of Zola&#x27;s novels, both in France and internationally. A number of modern translations are currently in print and widely available.

Much of Berri&#x27;s film was shot on location in the Lens and Valenciennes regions of northern France, and the extensive unemployment and poverty the cast and crew still witnessed there led to the formation of a society, &quot;Germinal l&#x27;association&quot;, headed by Depardieu, to alleviate the suffering caused by crippling unemployment in the &quot;départements&quot; comprising the region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
* &quot;Germinal&quot; (2021), a six-episode series for France 2 directed by David Hourrègue, starring Luis Peres, Alix Poisson, and Guillaume de Tonquédec.

<text>Benson is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC from September 13, 1979, to April 19, 1986. The show stars Robert Guillaume in the title role of Benson DuBois, the head of the household for Governor Eugene X. Gatling, played by James Noble. The show focused on the conflicts and relationships within the Governor&#x27;s household, with Benson generally providing the sarcastic voice of reason. Inga Swenson, Missy Gold, Didi Conn, Ethan Phillips, and René Auberjonois all played long-term supporting roles.

The series was a spin off of &quot;Soap&quot; in which the character Benson first appeared as the wise-cracking yet level-headed African-American butler for the highly dysfunctional Tate family. However, &quot;Benson&quot; avoided the soap opera format of its parent series for a more conventional sitcom structure, and the lead character eventually moved from his service position to a role as lieutenant governor. The series was created by Susan Harris, and produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions. In 1985, Guillaume won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in the series.

==Plot==
Benson DuBois (Robert Guillaume) is hired to be the head of household affairs for widowed Governor Eugene X. Gatling (James Noble) and his daughter Katie (Missy Gold). Governor Gatling was a cousin of Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) from &quot;Soap&quot;.

Benson faces housekeeping dilemmas and interacts with German cook Gretchen Wilomena Kraus (Inga Swenson) and John Taylor (David Hedison; later Lewis J. Stadlen) who assists Governor Gatling as chief of staff. After Season 1, John Taylor leaves and the governor&#x27;s new chief of staff is Clayton Endicott III (René Auberjonois).

The governor&#x27;s press secretary Pete Downey (Ethan Phillips) is introduced in Season 2, and Benson&#x27;s secretary Denise Stevens (Didi Conn) is introduced in Season 3. They later marry, having a child in the show&#x27;s fifth season. Both were then written out, with the reason given that Denise secured a job with NASA.

Benson works his way up the ladder during the series, going from head of household affairs to state budget director and eventually is elevated to the position of Lieutenant Governor. Finally, Benson runs for governor against Gatling.

===Series finale===
The term-limited Governor Gatling runs for re-election as an independent candidate with Benson securing the party nomination, setting the stage for the two to go head-to-head in the general election.

At the end of the series&#x27; final episode, Benson and Gatling—who had strained relations due to the race—make peace with each other and watch the tight election returns together on television. As the broadcaster begins to announce that a winner is at last being projected, the episode ends on a freeze frame of Benson and Gatling, leaving the series with an unresolved cliffhanger. Coincidentally, Guillaume&#x27;s previous series (&quot;Soap&quot;, from which &quot;Benson&quot; spun off) was also cancelled with unresolved cliffhangers.

In 2007, &quot;Benson&quot; executive producer Bob Fraser said that the season ended on a cliffhanger at the request of the network. The show was cancelled after the cliffhanger had already aired. Fraser indicated that, if the show had been renewed for another season, Gatling would have won the election and Benson would have become a United States senator.

According to Gary Brown who directed the finale and 20 other episodes of &quot;Benson&quot;, three different outcomes were filmed: with Benson winning, Gatling winning, and a tie. The intent was to decide over summer break which outcome to use. Brown also stated that regardless of the outcome, the long-term intent for the next season was for Benson to become the governor.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
* Robert Guillaume as Benson DuBois, the main character, hired as head of household affairs for Governor Gatling and his daughter Katie. Quick-witted and quick-thinking, Benson has helped the governor on several issues, bailing him out of tight political and public situations.
* James Noble as Eugene X. Gatling, the widowed and scatterbrained (but well-meaning) governor. Gatling has a penchant for telling off-the-wall stories, which Benson (and everyone else in the household) dreads.
* Inga Swenson as Gretchen Kraus, the governor&#x27;s chef. A fiercely proud German immigrant, she is often at odds with Benson and trades insults with him. A running gag in the series was whenever she would walk out of the room, under his breath, Benson would cast one last barb toward Kraus, to which she shouted from off-stage, &quot;I He-e-e-ear You-u-u-u!&quot;. Despite their rivalry, Benson and Kraus become close friends. She later becomes Benson&#x27;s strongest supporter when he runs for governor against Gatling.
* Missy Gold as Katie Gatling, the governor&#x27;s pre-teen daughter.
* Lewis J. Stadlen as John Taylor, Governor Gatling&#x27;s chief of staff (season 1 only), played by David Hedison in the pilot episode.
* Caroline McWilliams as Marcy Hill, the governor&#x27;s personal secretary (seasons 1 and 2, first three episodes of season 3). She is Benson&#x27;s closest friend in the mansion and often confides in him. Frequently unlucky in love, Marcy eventually marries and leaves the governor&#x27;s employ very early in season 3.
* Didi Conn as Denise Stevens, Marcy&#x27;s sweet-natured, cheerfully naive replacement (from season 3, episode 3 through season 5, with guest appearances in season 6).
* Ethan Phillips as Pete Downey, Gatling&#x27;s frequently high-strung press secretary (seasons 2 through 5, with guest appearances in season 6).
* René Auberjonois as Clayton Endicott III; he replaced Taylor as Gatling&#x27;s chief of staff beginning in season 2. Clayton is very snobbish and high-handed—even more so than his predecessor, Taylor. He is also a hypochondriac.
* Billie Bird as Rose Cassidy; she becomes Gatling&#x27;s chef partway through season 6 when Kraus is promoted to Benson&#x27;s administrative assistant.

===Recurring===
* Jerry Seinfeld played a small role as Frankie, a delivery boy and unsuccessful comedian, for three episodes in 1980 (all early in season 2). He was asked to leave because of creative differences.
* Ed Peck was seen in four episodes in seasons 2-3, as Police Captain Dennis McDermott, usually investigating strange, sometimes serious occurrences at the governor&#x27;s mansion. 
* Bob Fraser, who was a writer/producer on &quot;Benson&quot; through its entire run, appeared occasionally in seasons 5-7 as Senator Leonard Tyler, a duplicitous sometimes-ally, sometimes-rival of both Benson and Governor Gatling.
* Donna LaBrie played Senator Diane Hartford in four season 7 episodes. She became Benson&#x27;s fiancee.

<doc id="360846" wikidata="Q7653572" url="?curid=360846" title="Swanee Hunt">
<text>Swanee Grace Hunt (born May 1, 1950) is an American writer, academic, and former diplomat.

Hunt is a lecturer in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School and was the founding director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Kennedy School. From 1993 to 1997, she served as United States Ambassador to Austria. She is a recipient of the PEN/New England Award for non-fiction.

== Early life ==
Hunt was born May 1, 1950, in Dallas, Texas, the youngest of four children born to the oil tycoon H.L. Hunt and Ruth Ray. However, not until her father&#x27;s first wife died did Swanee Hunt&#x27;s parents marry in 1957 and it was only then that she and her siblings moved into the Hunt mansion, built to resemble its namesake, Mount Vernon.

Hunt grew up in Dallas, Texas, where she attended the Hockaday School. She lived for many years in Denver, Colorado, where she was active in many community and philanthropic activities. Her several siblings include sisters Helen LaKelly Hunt and June Hunt.

== Education ==
While Hunt had hoped to attend college in the east, her ultra-conservative father refused, so Hunt began college in her hometown at Southern Methodist University. Hunt earned her BA in philosophy from Texas Christian University, an MA in psychology from Ball State University, and an MA in religion and a doctorate in theology from Iliff School of Theology.

==Career==
Hunt was appointed in 1993 as ambassador to Austria, where she was notable for writing a weekly newspaper column and radio program. 

In 1997, Hunt helped establish the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School. Since stepping down as Director of the Program in 2008, she has continued on at the Kennedy School as the Eleanor Roosevelt Lecturer in Public Policy.

==Personal life==
At age 20, Hunt married Mark Meeks, a seminary student. Hunt gave birth to daughter Lillian in 1982, and the marriage dissolved soon after.

In 1985, Hunt married conductor Charles Ansbacher, who died on September 12, 2010. 
She has three children, among them filmmaker Henry Ansbacher, and three grandchildren.

== Books ==
Her book &quot;This Was Not Our War: Bosnian Women Reclaiming the Peace&quot; won the 2005 PEN/New England Award for non-fiction and includes a foreword by former president Bill Clinton.

<text>Mitchell William Sharp (11 May 1911 – 19 March 2004) was a Canadian civil servant and politician, most noted for his service as a Liberal Cabinet minister. He served in both the private and public sectors during his long career.

==Background==
Sharp was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba in 1934 and completed post-graduate work at that university and then at the London School of Economics. During this time, he worked as a writer focusing on the grain trade.

Sharp started his long career in public service in 1942 when he was offered a position at the Department of Finance. In 1947 he was named director of the department&#x27;s Economic Policy Division. From 1951 to 1957, Sharp served as the Associate Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce. During his tenure, he was responsible for international trade relations. Soon after, Sharp served a short term as the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce.

==Politics==
In 1963, Mitchell Sharp was elected as a member of Parliament (MP) representing Eglinton. Shortly thereafter, he was assigned the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Commerce. From 1965 through 1968, Sharp was the Minister of Finance. Other ministerial positions held include Secretary of State for External Affairs (1968–1974), President of the Privy Council (1974–1978) and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (1974–1978). Sharp resigned as a parliamentarian in 1978.

Sharp also disliked Canada&#x27;s constitutional structure, revealing in his 1994 memoirs that because of his negative views on the monarchy, he refused to accept Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s offer to recommend him for appointment as governor general. He also stated that &quot;Canada should have its own head of state who isn&#x27;t shared by others&quot; and that the status quo gave the impression that &quot;Canada had not yet achieved full independence from Britain.&quot;
Sharp&#x27;s support was influential in securing a prominent position for the Canadian Pavilion at Expo 67 during the Canadian Centennial, which had initially been proposed to be much smaller, limited to a single acre.

==After politics==
Sharp re-entered the public sector as the commissioner of the Northern Pipeline Agency, an agency formed under the Northern Pipeline Act (1978) to give effect to the U.S.-Canada Agreement on Principles Applicable to a Northern Natural Gas Pipeline (1977), from 1978 until 1988. His public service continued as he served as a co-chairman of a task force on conflict of interest and published a report on ethical conduct in the public service in 1984. Other posts included head of the &quot;Canadian group&quot; and deputy chairman of the Trilateral Commission (1976–1986). From 1988 through 1993, he served as a policy associate with Strategion. He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien from 1993 to 2003, a job for which he was paid $1 a year.

On February 22, 2004, Sharp fell and broke his collarbone in his home. He was taken to Elizabeth Bruyere Health Centre (hospital), in Ottawa, where he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer; that disease claimed his life on March 19 of that year. He was 92. He is buried in Ottawa.

==Honours==
Mitchell Sharp was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on 22 April 1963, giving him the honorific prefix The Honourable and the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.




==Honorary Degrees==
Michell Sharp received several honorary degrees in recognition of his service to Canada.

<text>București Mall (known locally as &quot;Mall Vitan&quot;) is a shopping mall located in the Vitan neighborhood of Bucharest, Romania, close to the Dudești and Văcărești neighbourhoods. At the time of its completion it was the first shopping mall in Romania.

Located on Calea Vitan approximately outside Bucharest&#x27;s historic center, the four-story, mall opened in 1999, in a Ceaușescu-era abandoned hunger circus, or giant food warehouse, in an area largely shaped during the Communist period (&quot;see Ceaușima&quot;).

<doc id="360865" wikidata="Q877955" url="?curid=360865" title="Deputy prime minister">
<text>A deputy prime minister or vice prime minister is, in some countries, a government minister who can take the position of acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent. The position is often likened to that of a vice president, as both positions are &quot;number two&quot; offices, but there are some differences.

The states of Australia and provinces of Canada each have the analogous office of deputy premier. In the devolved administrations of the United Kingdom, an analogous position is that of the deputy First Minister, albeit the position in Northern Ireland has equivalent powers to the First Minister differing only in the titles of the offices. In Canada, the position of deputy prime minister should not be confused with the Canadian deputy minister of the prime minister of Canada, a nonpolitical civil servant position.

In Austria and Germany, the officeholder is known as vice-chancellor.

A deputy prime minister traditionally serves as acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent or incapable of exercising power. The deputy prime minister is often asked to succeed to the prime minister&#x27;s office following the prime minister&#x27;s sudden death or unexpected resignation, but that is not necessarily mandated by the constitution. This government position is often a job that is held simultaneously with another ministry, and is usually given to one of the most senior or experienced ministers of the cabinet. The holder of this office may also be deputy leader of the governing party, or perhaps the leader of the junior party of a coalition government.

Little scholarly attention has focused on deputy prime ministers, as they are sometimes less involved in the political power plays of government and more focus on the work at hand. A 2009 study in &quot;Political Science&quot; identified nine &#x27;qualities&#x27; of deputy prime ministership: temperament; relationships with their Cabinet and caucus; relationships with their party; popularity with the public; media skills; achievements as deputy prime minister; relationship with the prime minister; leadership ambition; and method of succession.

By contrast, the structure of the Government of Russia and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine provides for several deputy prime ministers or vice prime ministers. In the case of the Russian government, the prime minister is responsible for defining the scope of the duties for each of their deputies, who also may head a specific ministry: e.g. the former Minister of Finance of Russia, Alexey Kudrin, also serves as one of the deputies of the prime ministers or &quot;vice-premiers&quot;. One or two of these deputy prime ministers may hold the title of a &quot;first deputy prime minister&quot;. Russian federal law indicates that in accordance with the order established in advance, &quot;one of the deputy prime ministers&quot; may temporarily substitute for the prime minister in their absence. Customarily, however, it is to one of the &quot;first&quot; Deputy prime ministers that the prime-ministerial duties may be delegated. At the same time, in the case of prime minister&#x27;s resignation, the law allows the President of Russia to choose &quot;any&quot; of the current vice-premiers to serve as an &quot;acting&quot; prime minister until the confirmation of the new government.

There is also the special case of Belgium: in the Federal Government of Belgium, a deputy prime minister not only replaces the prime minister in the case they are incapacitated, but also acts as the link between the government and their political party. In short, in Belgium, a Deputy prime minister is the voice of their political party in the federal government, and they are the voice of the government in their political party. The prime minister and the deputy prime ministers form what is called the &quot;inner cabinet&quot; (&quot;kernkabinet&quot;; &quot;conseil des ministres restreint&quot; or &quot;kern&quot;), an instance where the most important political decisions are discussed and taken.

<text>Sky Cinema is a British subscription film service owned by Sky Group (a division of Comcast). In the United Kingdom, Sky Cinema channels currently broadcast on the Sky satellite and Virgin Media cable platforms, and in addition Sky Cinema on demand content are available through these as well as via Now, EE TV and TalkTalk TV.

In 2016, Sky rebranded its television film channel operations under one single branding on 8 July, the channels in the United Kingdom and Ireland were rebranded from Sky Movies to Sky Cinema; on 22 September in Germany and Austria, the Sky Cinema brand (originally used for the flagship network) was extended to the German channels in the group formerly known as Sky Film; the Italian Sky Cinema channels followed suit on 5 November by adopting the brand packages introduced in the United Kingdom and Ireland earlier

Output includes movie premieres from Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures, and Sky original films.

==History==
===1989–1998: early years===
Launched at 6 pm on 5 February 1989, Sky Movies was originally a single service as part of Sky&#x27;s original four-channel package – alongside Sky News, Eurosport and Sky Channel (which later became Sky One) – on the Astra 1A satellite system. The first film shown on the channel was &quot;Project X&quot;. Before launch, Sky signed first-run deals with 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, Orion Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc. (which included Touchstone Pictures and Disney). One year after it began broadcasts, it became the first Sky channel to scramble its signal, using a encryption system called VideoCrypt. Anyone attempting to view it without a decoder and smart card could only see a scrambled picture.

On 2 November 1990, Sky Television merged with rival British Satellite Broadcasting, acquiring The Movie Channel. With the launch of the second SES Astra satellite (1B) was added to the Sky package on 15 April 1991 and the first film shown was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. From the relaunch of the channel under BSkyB, this ident was made by Pacific Data Images and heavily based on NBC&#x27;s movie opening used from 1987 to 1993. Similarly, Sky Movies was made available to viewers on BSB&#x27;s old satellite on 8 April earlier that year replaces its music channel, The Power Station. Also in the same year (6 May), Sky Movies and The Movie Channel started broadcasting for 24 hours per day – which previously they had been on air from early afternoon until the early hours of the next morning. In addition of these slots for 6.00 pm, 8.00 pm and 10.00 pm, Sky Movies had several different film genres were used every evening such as:
* &quot;Monday Night Comedy&quot;
* &quot;Tuesday Night Action&quot;
* &quot;Thursday Night Horror&quot;
* &quot;After Dark&quot; – used for Saturday and Wednesday nights at approximately 11.30 pm, which included erotic films with a 18 certificate that often shows sexually explicit material and various adult-oriented content

At the same time, The Movie Channel started to begin its evening films at the later slots of 6.15 pm, 8.15 pm and 10.15 pm, also include showing classic and children&#x27;s films (at around 4.00 pm) during the daytime hours between early morning and late afternoons were used.

For three consecutive years in the early 1990s, Sky Movies carried several non-film premium content known as &quot;special events&quot; including World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s annual events such as WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, SummerSlam and Survivor Series, various music concerts and live boxing competitions such as the first event was Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas on 11 February 1990. This was because at this time all of Sky&#x27;s other channels including Sky Sports, were shown free-to-air and during this period, the service was often referred to as Sky Movies Plus (up until 31 August 1993 shortly before the launch of the new Multichannels package). When Sky Sports became a pay channel on 1 September 1992, Sky Movies stopped showing non-movie related programming.

On 1 October 1992, The Comedy Channel was replaced by Sky Movies Gold, a service dedicated to &quot;classic movies&quot; from 4.00pm to midnight every day and it was added as a three-channel package, with the first film shown at 6.00pm on the new network was 1979&#x27;s &quot;Rocky II&quot;. On 31 December of that year, Sky Movies and The Movie Channel stopped broadcasting via Thor satellite.

From 1 February 1993, BSkyB introduced a new system of ratings for Sky Movies, The Movie Channel and Sky Movies Gold were used at various times replacing the British Board of Film Classification certificates which lasted over four years, and remained on air until 31 October 1997:
On 1 October 1995, Sky Movies Gold starts sharing its transponder space with The Disney Channel (which was delayed for over six years) resulting in the service&#x27;s broadcasting hours changed from 10.00 pm to 6.00 am.

The two main channels were rebranded under a common brand on 1 November 1997, Sky Movies became Sky Movies Screen 1 and The Movie Channel became Sky Movies Screen 2, as well as Sky Box Office launches a four-channel near on-demand service on 1 December of that year, also carried by Cable &amp; Wireless chooses not to use the service instead opting for Front Row. Following the major rebrand once again on 10 September 1998, as Sky Movies Screen 1 became Sky MovieMax, Sky Movies Screen 2 became Sky Premier and Sky Movies Gold was renamed Sky Cinema.

===1998–2007: digital era===
The launch of Sky Digital from the new Astra 28.2°E satellite position on 1 October 1998 was accompanied by a major expansion of channels. Sky Premier and Sky MovieMax both added three multiplex channels each (Sky Premier 2 to 4 and Sky MovieMax 2 to 4), Sky Cinema launched Sky Cinema 2, and additionally, Sky Premier Widescreen – at the time was the only channel devoted to showing widescreen films were all launched exclusively on digital satellite. Also on the same year (15 November), Sky MovieMax and Sky Premier launched on ITV Digital terrestrial platform. On 1 October 1999, Sky MovieMax 5 was launched.

From 1 July 2002, as the Sky Movies channels saw yet another rebranding exercise, the Sky Premier channels were renamed Sky Movies Premier, the Sky MovieMax channels became Sky Movies Max and the Sky Cinema channels became Sky Movies Cinema. Eventually in June 2003, Sky listened to demands for more widescreen films, the service was closed and the majority of films on the remaining channels were actually shown in widescreen. On 1 November 2003, the Sky Movies Premier and Sky Movies Max channels were all brought under one banner as simply Sky Movies 1 to 9. At the same time, Sky Movies Cinema 1 and 2 became Sky Cinema 1 and 2.

Sky Movies along with numerous other channels became available to watch via Sky Mobile TV in 2005, in partnership with Vodafone. From 30 January 2006, Sky Movies 9 and the new Sky Movies 10 started broadcasting from 5.00pm to 3.00am. They were PIN-protected, meaning that for the first time when films with a 15 certificate were able to be shown as early as 5.00pm. With the launch of Sky HD, the two channels were also available in a high-definition format.

===2007–2016: Sky Movies gets categorised===
Sky Movies was overhauled on 4 April 2007, when the different channels became dedicated to different genres, but three of the HD channels have launched already before the other:

* Premiere
* Premiere +1
* Comedy
* Action &amp; Thriller
* Family
* Drama
* Sci Fi &amp; Horror
* Classics
* Modern Greats
* Indie
* HD1/SD1
* HD2/SD2
Sky later made Sky Movies HD1 and HD2 available to subscribers without HDTV equipment through two channels simulcasting the same content in SDTV format, the channels were known as Sky Movies SD1 and SD2. These channels were renamed Sky Movies Screen 1 and Screen 2 in February 2008, and the HDTV channels were renamed Sky Movies Screen 1 HD and Screen 2 HD accordingly. On 20 March 2008, an additional high-definition film channel called Sky Movies Premiere HD, which is a simulcast version of the current Sky Movies Premiere channel, was added after many requests for the channel from Sky HD subscribers.

Sky also announced that in October 2008, they would launch six new high-definition simulcast channels called Sky Movies Action/Thriller HD, Sky Movies Sci-Fi/Horror HD, Sky Movies Drama HD, Sky Movies Modern Greats HD, Sky Movies Family HD and Sky Movies Comedy HD. This means that almost all Sky Movies channels are broadcast in both standard- and high-definition except for Sky Movies Premiere +1, Sky Movies Classics and Sky Movies Indie which remained standard-definition only until Sky Movies Indie HD launched on 26 October 2009. Sky Movies were rebranded as the part of the various Sky channels on 1 January 2010.

On 26 March 2010, some Sky Movies channels were renamed, the new Sky Movies Showcase that replaces Sky Movies Screen 1 were devoted to box sets, collections and seasons. Sky Movies also reshuffled its bouquet of ten channels to achieve greater &quot;clarity&quot; for subscribers. The changes included Sky Movies Action &amp; Thriller becoming Sky Movies Action &amp; Adventure, Sky Movies Drama becoming Sky Movies Drama &amp; Romance and Sky Movies Screen 2 becoming Sky Movies Crime &amp; Thriller. The Sky Movies HD channels launched on the Virgin Media platform on 2 August 2010.

Sky Movies Classics HD launched on 9 August 2010 was exclusively on Sky, and the channel was also added to Virgin Media on 4 October 2011. Smallworld Cable added the Sky Movies HD channels to their line-up in the first quarter of 2012, followed by Virgin Media Ireland on 16 August 2012.

On 28 March 2013, Sky Movies Disney was launched that effectively replaces Disney Cinemagic, as part of a multi-year film output deal between Sky and The Walt Disney Company. This marks the first time that Disney has been involved in a co-branded linear film channel anywhere in the world, included new Disney films are available on Sky Movies Disney around six months after they have ended their cinema run. To facilitate the channel, Sky Movies Classics has ceased broadcasting, when Sky Movies Modern Greats was rebranded as Sky Movies Greats and Sky Movies Indie became Sky Movies Select, whether the content of the three former brands was merged into Select and Greats.

===2016–present: rebrand and 4K UHD===
On 15 June 2016, Sky announced that Sky Movies would rebrand as Sky Cinema on 8 July within this change aligns the channel&#x27;s naming with those of Sky&#x27;s film services in other European countries, in consort with Sky plc&#x27;s takeover of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. To compete with subscription video-on-demand services, Sky announced that the rebranded network would premiere &quot;a new film each day&quot;, and that it would expand the service&#x27;s on-demand library. Sky also announced plans to launch a 4K ultra-high-definition feed later in the year. 4K films became available on 13 August 2016 for Sky Q customers in a 2TB box with Sky Cinema and multi-screen packs, as well as 70 were available by the end of 2016. During this time, the Sky Cinema networks would have their electronic program guide positions rebranded to tie into a highlight film, actor, or property being carried by that network throughout a certain month; for instance, a month filled with films starring Tom Hanks saw Sky Cinema Greats become Sky Tom Hanks for that period of time.

On 22 June 2020, Sky added a content warning to several older films stating that they &quot;have outdated attitudes, language, and cultural depictions which may cause offence today&quot;.

On 30 June 2020, several of Sky Cinema&#x27;s standard definition channels were fully discontinued. This move also coincided with the Sky Cinema brand adopting the 2020 Sky channel branding previously adopted by the entertainment channels following the launch of Sky Comedy. On 30 March 2022, the SD feeds of Sky Cinema Comedy, Sky Cinema Thriller and Sky Cinema Drama were similarly withdrawn. On 29 May 2024, the SD feeds of Sky Cinema Premiere, Sky Cinema Greats, Sky Cinema Family and Sky Cinema Action were removed from Sky.

On 23 July 2020, Sky Cinema launched a twelfth channel, Sky Cinema Animation, replaces Sky Cinema Premiere +1 on Sky and Virgin Media, and launched exclusively in high-definition on both platforms. Sky Cinema Premiere +1 continued to air on Virgin Media Ireland until its removal on 13 August 2020. The timeshift resumed broadcasting on 6 January 2021, replacing Sky Cinema Disney, which was shut down on 30 December 2020 (with the content moving into Disney+) and was temporarily replaced by Sky Cinema Five Star Movies from the next day (31 December) until Premiere +1&#x27;s return on 6 January 2021. On 30 April 2024, Sky Cinema Premiere +1 closed again, with Movies 24 moving to its old Sky EPG slot of 312.

Sky Cinema subscribers are able to access Paramount+ in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria without charge, which was inaugurated by the summer of 2022.

===Former===
==Original productions==

Sky Cinema has a dedicated production team that produces over 100 hours of original film-related programming each year – including &quot;Sky Cinema News&quot; and &quot;The Top Ten Show&quot;. In addition, Sky&#x27;s close relationships with the film studios means it regularly gets exclusive access for on-set to talenting one-off &#x27;making-ofs&#x27; and various talent-based programming.

In 1998 Elisabeth Murdoch (who was BSkyB&#x27;s director of channels and services at the time) advocated Sky setting up a film funding and production unit (similar to BBC Film and Film4 Productions). The result was Sky Pictures, which existed in order to investing both low-budget and mainstream British films. However, following a lack of success and her decision to leave Sky and set up her own production company called Shine, the unit was scaled back and closed in 2001.

In January 2018, Sky announced a partnership with film distributor Altitude Film Distribution, with the launch of Sky Cinema Original Films, this new brand would distribute films for Sky Cinema&#x27;s on-demand service, as well as release them into cinemas. The first film under the new banner was the United Kingdom release of the 2017 animated film &quot;Monster Family&quot;. Other films like &quot;The Hurricane Heist&quot;, &quot;Anon&quot;, &quot;Final Score&quot;, &quot;Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile&quot; have also been released with theatrical releases for &quot;May December&quot;, &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot; being handled by StudioCanal UK and the theatrical release &quot;Ferrari&quot; being handled by Black Bear UK.

<doc id="360869" wikidata="Q2041113" url="?curid=360869" title="Stewart platform">
<text>A Stewart platform is a type of parallel manipulator that has six prismatic actuators, commonly hydraulic jacks or electric linear actuators, attached in pairs to three positions on the platform&#x27;s baseplate, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. All 12 connections are made via universal joints. Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move: three linear movements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; (lateral, longitudinal, and vertical), and the three rotations (pitch, roll, and yaw).

Stewart platforms are known by various other names. In many applications, including in flight simulators, it is commonly referred to as a motion base. It is sometimes called a &quot;six-axis platform&quot; or &quot;6-DoF platform&quot; because of its possible motions and, because the motions are produced by a combination of movements of multiple actuators, it may be referred to as a &quot;synergistic motion platform&quot;, due to the synergy (mutual interaction) between the way that the actuators are programmed. Because the device has six actuators, it is often called a &quot;hexapod&quot; (six legs) in common usage, a name which was originally trademarked by Geodetic Technology for Stewart platforms used in machine tools.

==History==
This specialised six-jack layout was first used by V E (Eric) Gough of the UK and was operational in 1954, the design later being publicised in a 1965 paper by D Stewart to the UK Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 1962, prior to the publication of Stewart&#x27;s paper, American engineer Klaus Cappel independently developed the same hexapod. Klaus patented his design and licensed it to the first flight simulator companies, and built the first commercial octahedral hexapod motion simulators.

Although the title &quot;Stewart platform&quot; is commonly used, some have posited that &quot;Gough–Stewart platform&quot; is a more appropriate name because the original Stewart platform had a slightly different design, while others argue that the contributions of all three engineers should be recognized.

==Actuation==

===Linear actuation===

In industrial applications, linear actuators (hydraulic or electric) are typically used for their simple and unique inverse kinematics closed form solution and their good strength and acceleration.

===Rotary actuation===

For prototyping and low budget applications, typically rotary servo motors are used. A unique closed form solution for the inverse kinematics of rotary actuators also exists, as shown by Robert Eisele.

==Applications==
Stewart platforms have applications in flight simulators, machine tool technology, animatronics, crane technology, underwater research, simulation of earthquakes, air-to-sea rescue, mechanical bulls, satellite dish positioning, the Hexapod-Telescope, robotics, and orthopedic surgery.

===Flight simulation===
The Stewart platform design is extensively used in flight simulators, particularly in the full flight simulator which requires all 6 degrees of freedom. This application was developed by Redifon, whose simulators featuring it became available for the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle, Canadair CL-44, Boeing 727, Comet, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Vanguard, Convair CV 990, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Vickers VC10, and Fokker F-27 by 1962.

In this role, the payload is a replica cockpit and a visual display system, normally of several channels, for showing the outside-world visual scene to the aircraft crew that are being trained.

Similar platforms are used in driving simulators, typically mounted on large X-Y tables to simulate short term acceleration. Long term acceleration can be simulated by tilting the platform, and an active research area is how to mix the two.

===Robocrane===
James S. Albus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the Robocrane, where the platform hangs from six cables instead of being supported by six jacks.

===LIDS===
The Low Impact Docking System developed by NASA uses a Stewart platform to manipulate space vehicles during the docking process.

===CAREN===
The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment developed by Motek Medical uses a Stewart platform coupled with virtual reality to do advanced biomechanical and clinical research.

===Taylor Spatial Frame===
Dr. J. Charles Taylor used the Stewart platform to develop the Taylor Spatial Frame, an external fixator used in orthopedic surgery for the correction of bone deformities and treatment of complex fractures.

===Mechanical testing===
*First application: Eric Gough was an automotive engineer and worked at Fort Dunlop, the Dunlop Tyres factory in Birmingham, England. He developed his &quot;Universal Tyre-Testing Machine&quot; (also called the &quot;Universal Rig&quot;) in the 1950s and his platform was operational by 1954. The rig was able to mechanically test tyres under combined loads. Dr. Gough died in 1972 but his testing rig continued to be used up until the late 1980s when the factory was closed down and then demolished. His rig was saved and transported to the Science Museum, London storage facility at Wroughton near Swindon.
*Recent applications: the rebirth of interest for a mechanical testing machine based on Gough-Stewart platform occurred in the mid &#x27;90s. They are often biomedical applications (for example spinal study) because of the complexity and large amplitude of the motions needed to reproduce human or animal behaviour. Such requirements are also encountered in the civil engineering field for seism simulation. Controlled by a full-field kinematic measurement algorithm, such machines can also be used to study complex phenomena on stiff specimens (for example the curved propagation of a crack through a concrete block) that need high load capacities and displacement accuracy.

=== Motion compensation ===

The Ampelmann system is a motion-compensated gangway using a Stewart platform. This allows access from a moving platform supply vessel to offshore constructions even in high wave conditions.

<doc id="360876" wikidata="Q1031455" url="?curid=360876" title="Supremacism">
<text>Supremacism is the belief that a certain group of people are superior to, and should have supreme authority over, all others. The presumed superior people can be defined by age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, language, social class, ideology, nationality, culture, generation or belong to any other part of a particular population.

== Sexual ==
===Male===

Feminist scholars argue that in patriarchy, male supremacism is upheld through a variety of cultural, political, religious, sexual, and interpersonal systems and relations. Since the 19th century there have been a number of feminist movements opposed to male supremacism, usually aimed at achieving equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.

===Female===
==Racial==
===White===

Centuries of European colonialism in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania were justified by Eurocentric attitudes as well as sometimes by white supremacist attitudes.

During the 19th century, &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, the phrase which refers to the thought that whites have the obligation to make the societies of the other peoples more &#x27;civilized&#x27;, was widely used to justify colonial policies as a noble enterprise. Historian Thomas Carlyle, best known for his historical account of the French Revolution, &quot;The French Revolution: A History,&quot; argued that western policies were justified on the grounds that they provided the greatest benefit to &quot;inferior&quot; native peoples. However, even at the time of its publication in 1849, Carlyle&#x27;s main work on the subject, the &quot;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question,&quot; was poorly received by his contemporaries.

According to William Nicholls, religious antisemitism can be distinguished from racial antisemitism which is based on racial or ethnic grounds. &quot;The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.&quot; However, with racial antisemitism, &quot;Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the Enlightenment onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.&quot;

One of the first typologies which was used to classify various human races was invented by Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), a theoretician of eugenics, who published &quot;L&#x27;Aryen et son rôle social&quot; (1899 – &quot;The Aryan and his social role&quot;) in 1899. In his book, he divides humanity into various, hierarchical races, starting with the highest race which is the &quot;Aryan white race, dolichocephalic&quot;, and ending with the lowest race which is the &quot;brachycephalic&quot;, &quot;mediocre and inert&quot; race, that race is best represented by Southern European, Catholic peasants&quot;. Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the &quot;&quot;Homo europaeus&quot; (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the &quot;Homo alpinus&quot; (Auvergnat, Turkish, etc.), and finally the &quot;Homo mediterraneus&quot;&quot; (Neapolitan, Andalus, etc.) Jews were brachycephalic just like the Aryans were, according to Lapouge; but he considered them dangerous for this exact reason; they were the only group, he thought, which was threatening to displace the Aryan aristocracy. Georges Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of Nazi antisemitism and Nazi racist ideology.

=== United States ===

White Americans who participated in the Atlantic slave trade believed and Justified their economic exploitation of African Americans by creating a scientific theory of white superiority and black inferiority. Thomas Jefferson, who was a believer of scientific racism and enslaver of over 600 African Americans (regarded as property under the Articles of Confederation), wrote that blacks were &quot;inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.&quot;

A justification for the conquest of American Indian tribes emanated from their dehumanized perception as the &quot;merciless Indian savages&quot;, as described in the United States Declaration of Independence.

Before the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America was founded with a constitution that contained clauses which restricted the government&#x27;s ability to limit or interfere with the institution of &quot;negro&quot; slavery. In the 1861 Cornerstone Speech, Confederate vice president, Alexander Stephens declared that one of the Confederacy&#x27;s foundational tenets was White Supremacy over African American slaves. Following the war, a hate group, known as the Ku Klux Klan, was founded in the American South, after the end of the American Civil War. Its purpose has been to maintain White, Protestant supremacy in the US after the Reconstruction period, which it did so through violence and intimidation.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Southern Poverty Law Center condemn writings about &quot;Jewish Supremacism&quot; by Holocaust-denier, former Grand Wizard of the KKK, and conspiracy theorist David Duke as antisemitic – in particular, his book &quot;Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question.&quot; Kevin B. MacDonald, known for his theory of Judaism as a &quot;group evolutionary strategy&quot;, has also been accused of being &quot;antisemitic&quot; and a &quot;white supremacist&quot; in his writings on the subject by the ADL and his own university psychology department.

=== Nazi Germany ===

From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany, under the rule of Adolf Hitler, promoted the belief in the existence of a superior, Aryan &quot;Herrenvolk&quot;, or master race. The state&#x27;s propaganda advocated the belief that Germanic peoples, whom they called &quot;Aryans&quot;, were a master race or a &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; whose members were superior to the Jews, Slavs, and Romani people, so-called &quot;gypsies&quot;. Arthur de Gobineau, a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the ancien régime in France on racial intermixing, which he believed had destroyed the purity of the Nordic race. Gobineau&#x27;s theories, which attracted a large and strong following in Germany, emphasized the belief in the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and Jewish cultures.

===Russia===
===Black===

Cornel West, an African-American philosopher, writes that black supremacist religious views arose in America as a part of black Muslim theology in response to white supremacy.

====Hutu supremacism====
===Arab===
In Africa, black Southern Sudanese allege that they are being subjected to a racist form of Arab supremacy, which they equate with the historic white supremacism of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid. The alleged genocide and ethnic cleansing in the ongoing War in Darfur has been described as an example of Arab racism.
For example, in their analysis of the sources of the conflict, Julie Flint and Alex de Waal say that Colonel Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, sponsored &quot;Arab supremacism&quot; across the Sahara during the 1970s. Gaddafi supported the &quot;Islamic Legion&quot; and the Sudanese opposition &quot;National Front, including the Muslim Brothers and the Ansar, the Umma Party&#x27;s military wing.&quot; Gaddafi tried to use such forces to annex Chad from 1979 to 1981. Gaddafi supported the Sudanese government&#x27;s war in the South during the early 1980s, and in return, he was allowed to use the Darfur region as a &quot;back door to Chad&quot;. As a result, the first signs of an &quot;Arab racist political platform&quot; appeared in Darfur in the early 1980s.

===India===
In Asia, Indians in Ancient India considered all foreigners barbarians. The Muslim scholar Al-Biruni wrote that the Indians called foreigners impure. A few centuries later, Dubois observes that &quot;Hindus look upon Europeans as barbarians totally ignorant of all principles of honour and good breeding... In the eyes of a Hindu, a Pariah (outcaste) and a European are on the same level.&quot; The Chinese also considered the Europeans repulsive, ghost-like creatures, and they even considered them devils. Chinese writers also referred to foreigners as barbarians.

===China===
== Religious ==
===Christianity ===
Academics Carol Lansing and Edward D. English argue that Christian supremacism was a motivation for the Crusades in the Holy Land, as well as a motivation for crusades against Muslims and pagans throughout Europe. The blood libel is a widespread European conspiracy theory which led to centuries of pogroms and massacres of European Jewish minorities because it alleged that Jews required the pure blood of a Christian child in order to make matzah for Passover. Thomas of Cantimpré writes of the blood curse which the Jews put upon themselves and all of their generations at the court of Pontius Pilate where Jesus was sentenced to death: &quot;A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: &#x27;Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (&quot;solo sanguine Christiano&quot;).&quot; The Atlantic slave trade has also been partially attributed to Christian supremacism. The Ku Klux Klan has been described as a white supremacist Christian organization, as are many other white supremacist groups, such as the Posse Comitatus and the Christian Identity and Positive Christianity movements.

===Islam===

Academics Khaled Abou El Fadl, Ian Lague, and Joshua Cone note that, while the Quran and other Islamic scriptures express tolerant beliefs, such as Al-Baqara 256 &quot;there is no compulsion in religion&quot;, there have also been numerous instances of Muslim or Islamic supremacism. Examples of how supremacists have interpreted Islam include the history of slavery in the Muslim world, Caliphate, Ottoman Empire, the early-20th-century pan-Islamism promoted by Abdul Hamid II, the &quot;jizya&quot; and supremacy of Sharia law, such as rules of marriage in Muslim countries being imposed on non-Muslims.

While non-violent proselytism of Islam (Dawah) is not Islamic supremacism, forced conversion to Islam is Islamic supremacism. Death penalty for apostasy in Islam is a sign of Islamic supremacism.

Numerous massacres and ethnic cleansing of Jews, Christians and non-Muslims occurred in some Muslim-majority countries including in Morocco, Libya, and Algeria, where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos. Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted during the Middle Ages in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. At certain times in Yemen, Morocco, and Baghdad, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face the Islamic death penalty. While there were antisemitic incidents before the 20th century, antisemitism increased after the Arab–Israeli conflict. Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, the creation of the State of Israel and Israeli victories during the wars of 1956 and 1967 were a severe humiliation to Israel&#x27;s opponentsprimarily Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. However, by the mid-1970s the vast majority of Jews had left Muslim-majority countries, moving primarily to Israel, France, and the United States. The reasons for the Jewish exodus are varied and disputed.

===Judaism===

Ilan Pappé, an expatriate Israeli historian, writes that the First Aliyah to Israel &quot;established a society based on Jewish supremacy&quot; within &quot;settlement-cooperatives&quot; that were Jewish owned and operated. Joseph Massad, a professor of Arab studies, holds that &quot;Jewish supremacism&quot; has always been a &quot;dominating principle&quot; in religious and secular Zionism.

<text>Andrew Houston Longino (May 16, 1854 – February 24, 1942) was an American politician from Mississippi who served as a Democrat in the Mississippi State Senate (1880–1884), the U.S. District Attorney&#x27;s (1888–1890), and Governor&#x27;s offices (1900–1904).

==Early life and education==
Longino was born in Lawrence County, Mississippi. He attained education at Mississippi College, where he graduated in 1875, and at the University of Virginia, where he earned a law degree in 1880.

The surname Longino is of Italian origin, although his family had resided in the American South since the eighteenth century. He has been identified as the third U.S. governor of Italian-American descent, after Caesar Rodney and William Paca who held office in the 18th century and had distant Italian ancestry.

==Political career and death==
During his term as governor, Longino began a campaign to attract new industries to the state. He supervised designing and building a new Mississippi State Capitol still in use today. Also of note, the Mississippi Department of Archives and History was created and a new penitentiary at Parchman Farm was constructed during his administration.

Governor Longino invited president Theodore Roosevelt to a bear hunt in the Mississippi Delta, an event which inspired the creation of the teddy bear.

Longino died at age 87 and was interred at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

<text>Flossenbürg (Northern Bavarian: &quot;Flossenbirch&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Neustadt an der Waldnaab in Bavaria in Germany. The state-approved &quot;leisure area&quot; is located in the Bavarian Forest and borders Bohemia (the Czech Republic) in the east. During World War II, the Flossenbürg concentration camp was located here.

== History ==
The first reference of Flossenbürg&#x27;s existence was in 948. Its castle was the Hohenstaufen&#x27;s stronghold. Later, Flossenbürg belonged to the duchy of Neuburg-Sulzbach and came to the regional court of Floß in the Electorate of Bavaria in 1777. Today, it is located in the administrative region of Oberpfalz.

The town was the site of Flossenbürg concentration camp from 1938 until 1945. On 23 April 1945, the U.S. 90th Infantry Division of the 3rd Army liberated the camp and took it without any fighting.

== Transport ==
Flossenbürg was the terminus of the Floß–Flossenbürg railway line that branched off in Floß from the Neustadt (Waldnaab)–Eslarn railway and is served today by a bus route from Weiden via Neustadt an der Waldnaab to the Silberhütte Cross-Country Skiing Centre.

<doc id="360886" wikidata="Q5633063" url="?curid=360886" title="HMS Largs">
<text>HMS &quot;Largs&quot; was a former Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (French Line) fruit (banana) ship captured by the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Faulknor&quot; five months after the Battle of France while docked at Gibraltar in November 1940 and commissioned as an &quot;ocean boarding vessel&quot;. She subsequently became a Combined Operations Headquarters ship for almost every significant amphibious operation of World War II, including Operations &quot;Torch&quot;, &quot;Husky&quot; and &quot;Overlord&quot; and she would be manned by naval, army and air force crew.

==Royal Navy Transfer==
She was built by France and named MV &quot;Charles Plumier&quot; in 1938. Following the creation of Vichy France and Free France she was transferred in 1941 to the Royal Navy, instead of being handed over to the Free French Navy, and renamed HMS &quot;Largs&quot;. She took part in many operations including Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, and Operation Overlord, during the invasion of Normandy. she was the headquarters ship for Sword Beach.

==Camouflage research==

HMS &quot;Largs&quot; was used in 1942 for secret trials of a Canadian invention, diffused lighting camouflage. This used dimmable lamps for counter-illumination, camouflage by bringing the brightness of the ship&#x27;s superstructure to the same as the night sky. The system of 60 lamps reduced the distance at which a ship could be seen from a surfaced submarine by 25% using binoculars, or by 33% using the naked eye. It worked best on clear moonless nights, at best preventing &quot;Largs&quot; from being seen until it closed to when counter-illuminated, compared to unlighted, a 57% reduction in range. However, with the development of marine radar, the system was not put into service.

==Pacific &amp; Post WWII==
In 1945 she was transferred to the Pacific War and used in actions off Thailand and Malaya. After the end of the war she was handed back to France, and served for nineteen years. She was sold off to a private company from Greece in 1964 as a cruise ship, and given the name MV &quot;Pleias&quot;. She was scrapped in 1968.

<text>Karl Wilhelm Otto Lilienthal (23 May 1848 – 10 August 1896) was a German pioneer of aviation who became known as the &quot;flying man&quot;. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful flights with gliders, therefore making the idea of heavier-than-air aircraft a reality. Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding, favourably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical.

Lilienthal&#x27;s work led to his developing the concept of the modern wing. His flight attempts in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight and the &quot;Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat&quot; is considered the first airplane in series production, making the &quot;Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal&quot; in Berlin the first airplane production company in the world. He has been referred to as the &quot;father of aviation&quot; and &quot;father of flight&quot;.

On 9 August 1896, Lilienthal’s glider stalled and he was unable to regain control. Falling from about , he broke his neck and died the next day.

==Early life==
Lilienthal was born on 23 May 1848 in Anklam, Pomerania Province, in the German kingdom of Prussia. His parents were Gustav and Caroline, née Pohle. He was baptised in the evangelical-lutheran St. Nicholas church and confirmed in St. Mary&#x27;s church in Anklam. Lilienthal&#x27;s middle-class parents had eight children, but only three survived infancy: Otto, Gustav, and Marie. The brothers worked together all their lives on technical, social, and cultural projects. Lilienthal attended grammar school and studied the flight of birds with his brother Gustav (1849–1933). Fascinated by the idea of manned flight, Lilienthal and his brother made strap-on wings, but failed in their attempts to fly. He attended the regional technical school in Potsdam for two years and trained at the Schwarzkopf Company before becoming a professional design engineer. He later attended the Technische Hochschule in Berlin (now Technische Universität Berlin).

In 1867, Lilienthal began experiments in earnest on the force of air, but interrupted the work to serve in the Franco-Prussian War. Returning to civilian life, he was a staff engineer with several engineering companies and received a patent, his first, for a mining machine. He founded his own company to make boilers and steam engines.

On 6 June 1878, Lilienthal married Agnes Fischer, daughter of a deputy. Music brought them together; she was trained in piano and voice while Lilienthal played the French horn and had a good tenor voice. After marriage, they took up residence in Berlin and had four children: Otto, Anna, Fritz, and Frida. Lilienthal published his famous book &quot;Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation&quot; in 1889.

==Experiments in flight==

Lilienthal&#x27;s greatest contribution was in the development of heavier-than-air flight. He made his flights from an artificial hill he built near Berlin and from natural hills, especially in the Rhinow region.

The filing of a U.S. Patent in 1894 by Lilienthal directed pilots to grip the &quot;bar&quot; for carrying and flying the hang glider. The A-frame of Percy Pilcher and Lilienthal echoes in today&#x27;s control frame for hang gliders and ultralight aircraft. Working in conjunction with his brother Gustav, Lilienthal made over 2,000 flights in gliders of his design starting in 1891 with his first glider version, the Derwitzer Glider, until his death in a gliding crash in 1896. His total flying time was five hours.
At the beginning, in the spring of 1891, Lilienthal managed the first jumps and flights on the slope of a sand pit on a hill between the villages of Derwitz and Krielow in Havelland, west of Potsdam (). This is the site of man&#x27;s first flight. Later he made his flight attempts on an artificial hill near Berlin and above all in the Rhinow Hills. 
In 1891 Lilienthal succeeded with jumps and flights covering a distance of about . He could use the updraft of a wind against a hill to remain stationary with respect to the ground, shouting to a photographer on the ground to manoeuvre into the best position for a photo. In 1893, in the Rhinow Hills, he was able to achieve flight distances as long as . This record remained unbeaten for him or anyone else at the time of his death.

Lilienthal did research in accurately describing the flight of birds, especially storks, and used polar diagrams for describing the aerodynamics of their wings. He made many experiments in an attempt to gather reliable aeronautical data.

===Projects===
During his short flying career, Lilienthal developed a dozen models of monoplanes, wing flapping aircraft and two biplanes. His gliders were carefully designed to distribute weight as evenly as possible to ensure a stable flight. Lilienthal controlled them by changing the center of gravity by shifting his body, much like modern hang gliders. They were difficult to manoeuvre and had a tendency to pitch down, from which it was difficult to recover. One reason for this was that he held the glider by his shoulders, rather than hanging from it like a modern hang glider. Only his legs and lower body could be moved, which limited the amount of weight shift he could achieve.

Lilienthal made many attempts to improve stability with varying degrees of success. These included making a biplane which halved the wing span for a given wing area, and by having a hinged tailplane that could move upwards to make the flare at the end of a flight easier. He speculated that flapping wings of birds might be necessary and had begun work on such a powered aircraft.

While his lifelong pursuit was flight, Lilienthal was also an inventor and devised a small engine that worked on a system of tubular boilers. His engine was much safer than the other small engines of the time. This invention gave him the financial freedom to focus on aviation. His brother Gustav (1849–1933) was living in Australia at the time, and Lilienthal did not engage in aviation experiments until his brother&#x27;s return in 1885.

There are 25 known Lilienthal patents.

===Test locations===
Lilienthal performed his first gliding attempts in the spring of 1891 at the so-called &quot;Spitzer Berg&quot; near to the villages of Krielow and Derwitz, west of Potsdam.

In 1892, Lilienthal&#x27;s training area was a hill formation called &quot;Maihöhe&quot; in Steglitz, Berlin. He built a high shed, in the shape of a tower, on top of it. This way, he obtained a &quot;jumping off&quot; place high. The shed served also for storing his apparatus.

In 1893, Lilienthal also started to perform gliding attempts in the &quot;Rhinower Berge&quot;, at the &quot;Hauptmannsberg&quot; near to Rhinow and later, in 1896, at the &quot;Gollenberg&quot; near to Stölln.

In 1894, Lilienthal built an artificial conical hill near his home in Lichterfelde, called &quot;Fliegeberg&quot; (lit. fly hill). It allowed him to launch his gliders into the wind no matter which direction it was coming from. The hill was high. There was a regular crowd of people that were interested in seeing his gliding experiments.

In 1932, the Fliegeberg was redesigned by a Berlin architect Fritz Freymüller as a memorial to Lilienthal. On top of the hill was built a small temple-like construction, consisting of pillars supporting a slightly sloping round roof. Inside is placed a silver globe inscribed with particulars of famous flights. Lilienthal&#x27;s brother Gustav and the old mechanic and assistant Paul Baylich attended the unveiling ceremony on 10 August 1932 (36 years after Otto&#x27;s death).

==Worldwide notice==
Reports of Lilienthal&#x27;s flights spread in Germany and elsewhere, with photographs appearing in scientific and popular publications. Among those who photographed him were pioneers such as Ottomar Anschütz and American physicist Robert Williams Wood. He soon became known as the &quot;father of flight&quot; as he had successfully controlled a heavier-than-air aircraft in sustained flight.

Lilienthal was a member of the &quot;Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt&quot;, and regularly detailed his experiences in articles in its journal, the &quot;Zeitschrift für Luftschifffahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre&quot;, and in the popular weekly publication &quot;Prometheus&quot;. These were translated in the United States, France and Russia. Many people from around the world came to visit him, including Samuel Pierpont Langley from the United States, Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky, Englishman Percy Pilcher and Austrian Wilhelm Kress. Zhukovsky wrote that Lilienthal&#x27;s flying machine was the most important invention in the aviation field. Lilienthal corresponded with many people, among them Octave Chanute, James Means, Alois Wolfmüller and other flight pioneers.

==Final flight==
On 9 August 1896, Lilienthal went, as on previous weekends, to the Rhinow Hills. The day was very sunny and not too hot (about 20 °C, or 68 °F). The first flights were successful, reaching a distance of in his normal glider. During the fourth flight Lilienthal&#x27;s glider pitched upward and then headed down quickly. (It is believed that his glider stalled.) Lilienthal had previously had difficulty in recovering from this position because the glider relied on weight shift which was difficult to achieve when pointed at the ground. His attempts failed and he fell from a height of about , while still in the glider.

Paul Beylich, Lilienthal&#x27;s glider mechanic, transported him by horse-drawn carriage to Stölln, where he was examined by a physician. Lilienthal had a fracture of the third cervical vertebra and soon became unconscious. Later that day he was transported in a cargo train to Lehrter train station in Berlin, and the next morning to the clinic of Ernst von Bergmann, one of the most famous and successful surgeons in Europe at the time. Lilienthal died there a few hours later (about 36 hours after the crash).

There are differing accounts of Lilienthal&#x27;s last words. A popular account, inscribed on his tombstone, is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sacrifices must be made!&quot;). The director of the Otto Lilienthal Museum doubts that these were his last words. Otto Lilienthal was buried at Lankwitz public cemetery in Berlin.

Guinness World Records recognizes Otto Lilienthal as the first person recorded to be fatally injured in a glider accident.

==Legacy==
Lilienthal&#x27;s research was well known to the Wright brothers, and they credited him as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight. They abandoned his aeronautical data after two seasons of gliding and began using their own wind tunnel data.


Before its closure in 2020, Berlin&#x27;s then busiest airport, Berlin Tegel &quot;Otto Lilienthal&quot; Airport, was named after him.

In September 1909, Orville Wright was in Germany making demonstration flights at Tempelhof aerodrome. He paid a call to Lilienthal&#x27;s widow and, on behalf of himself and Wilbur, paid tribute to Lilienthal for his influence on aviation and on their own initial experiments in 1899.

In 1972, Lilienthal was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

In 2013, American aviation magazine &quot;Flying&quot; ranked Lilienthal No. 19 on their list of the &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot;.

A German Air Force tanker, Airbus A310 MRTT registration 10–24, has been named &quot;Otto Lilienthal&quot; in his honour.

The Lilium Jet, a prototype German electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) electrically powered airplane and the company which designed it, Lilium GmbH, were named after him.

An authentic replica of the &quot;Normalsegelapparat&quot; made by the Otto Lilienthal Museum have been investigated by the German Aerospace Center in wind tunnel and flight tests. The results prove that the glider was stable in pitch and roll and can be flown safely at moderate altitudes.

In 1989, a Soviet-era Ilyushin IL-62 passenger jet was flown to Gollenberg, and landed in a nearby field. It now serves as a museum of early flight, and has been named &#x27;Frau Agnes&#x27; (German for Lady Agnes), after Lilienthal&#x27;s wife. The back of the aircraft operates as a registry office, decorated for marriages. The jet previously served with East Germany&#x27;s state airline Interflug.

Lilienthal was regularly joined by photographers at his request. Most of them are well known, like Ottomar Anschütz. Lilienthal also took his own photographs of his flying machines after 1891. There are at least 145 known photographs documenting his test flights, some of excellent quality. All of them are available online at the Otto Lilienthal Museum website. The only negatives, preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, were destroyed during World War II.

<text>ReactOS is a free and open-source operating system for i586/amd64 personal computers intended to be binary-compatible with computer programs and device drivers developed for Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Microsoft Windows. ReactOS has been noted as a potential open-source drop-in replacement for Windows and for its information on undocumented Windows APIs.

ReactOS has been in development since 1996. , it is still considered feature-incomplete alpha software, and is therefore recommended by the developers only for evaluation and testing purposes. However, many Windows applications are working, such as Adobe Reader 9.3, GIMP 2.6, and LibreOffice 5.4.

ReactOS is primarily written in C, with some elements, such as ReactOS File Explorer, written in C++. The project partially implements Windows API functionality and has been ported to the AMD64 processor architecture. ReactOS, as part of the FOSS ecosystem, re-uses and collaborates with many other FOSS projects, most notably the Wine project, which presents a Windows compatibility layer for Unix-like operating systems.

==History==
===Early development===
Around 1996, a group of free and open-source software developers started a project called &quot;FreeWin95&quot; to implement a clone of Windows 95. The project stalled in discussions on the design of the system.

While FreeWin95 had started out with high expectations, there still had not been any builds released to the public by the end of 1997. As a result, the project members, led by then coordinator Jason Filby, joined together to revive the project. The revived project sought to duplicate the functionality of Windows NT. In creating the new project, a new name, &quot;ReactOS&quot;, was chosen. The project began development in February 1998 by creating the basis for a new NT kernel and basic drivers. The name ReactOS was coined during an IRC chat. While the term &quot;OS&quot; stood for operating system, the term &quot;react&quot; referred to the group&#x27;s dissatisfaction with – and reaction to – Microsoft&#x27;s monopolistic position.

In 2002, the ReactOS Foundation was established in Moscow with Maxim Osowski and Aleksey Bragin as executive officers and Vladimir Bragin, Saveliy Tretiakov and Alexey Ivanov on the board of directors. In 2015, the foundation was liquidated.

===Internal audit===
In order to avoid copyright prosecution, ReactOS had to be expressly completely distinct and non-derivative from Windows, a goal that needed very careful work. A claim was made on 17 January 2006 by developer Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S, as well as other unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.

On 27 January 2006, the developers responsible for maintaining the ReactOS code repository disabled access after a meeting was held to discuss the allegations. When approached by NewsForge, Microsoft declined to comment on the incident. Since ReactOS is a free and open-source software development project, the claim triggered a negative reaction from the free software community: in particular, Wine barred several inactive developers from providing contributions and formal high level cooperation between the two projects remained difficult .

In a statement on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. To avoid potential litigation, companies sometimes enact a policy where reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code. ReactOS clarified its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering to avoid potential infringement of United States law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them to comply with the project&#x27;s policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public, as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project&#x27;s own policies.

Also, the 2004 leaked Windows source code was not seen as legal risk for ReactOS, as the trade secret was considered indefensible in court due to broad spread.

Axel Rietschin, who is a kernel engineer at Microsoft, claimed that he recognized some specific bits in the ReactOS kernel that are unlikely to result from a clean room reimplementation. He suggests that the project took source code from the Windows Research Kernel, which was licensed to universities and has been leaked multiple times. Internal data structures and variable names have the exact same name in both ReactOS and the research kernel.

===Google Summer of Code participation===
Starting in 2006, the ReactOS project participated in several Google Summers of Code. For example, in the GSoC 2011, ReactOS mentored a student project which integrated lwIP into the network stack.

===Lobbying for support in Russia===
Between 2007 and 2015, Russian ReactOS contributors representing the ReactOS Foundation made efforts at lobbying the Russian federal government. , these efforts have not yielded government support for ReactOS, and the Russia-based ReactOS Foundation has been dissolved since November 2015.

* In 2007, then State Duma member and chairman of Russian Center of Free Technologies, Viktor Alksnis met with project coordinator Aleksey Bragin, who gave a presentation and demonstration of the project, showing ReactOS running with Total Commander and Mozilla Firefox. 
* In 2011, a demonstration was given to then president Dmitry Medvedev during a visit to a high school in Verhnerusskoe, Stavropol, attended by one of the development team members.
* On 31 July 2012, Vladimir Putin was also given a demonstration during his visit as President of Russia to Seliger Youth Forum, attended by Marat Karatov, one of the development team members.
* On 1 April 2015, Bragin attended an expert meeting of the Russian Ministry of Communications on reducing Russia&#x27;s dependency from proprietary software imports. Its minutes name the &quot;creation of an open source operating system based on ReactOS for PCs, laptops and other mobile devices&quot;, as well as the &quot;creation of an open source operating system for servers based on ReactOS&quot;, placing it second among three named proposals.

===Funding campaigns===
On 1 May 2012, a €30,000 funding campaign was started to finance additional development projects. At the end of the year, approximately 50% of the funding goal was achieved and it was decided to continue the funding campaign without deadlines. The money went to &quot;ReactOS Deutschland e. V.&quot;. As the tax law in Germany for this form of a registered voluntary association (&quot;Eingetragener Verein&quot;) makes it problematic to pay developers directly; indirect possibilities like stipends were evaluated.

===Thorium Core Cloud Desktop project===
When ReactOS was awarded as Project of the Month on SourceForge in June 2013, a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter was announced in an interview with the project&#x27;s coordinator, Aleksey Bragin. On 23 December 2013 the announced project was revealed as a Kickstarter campaign with the goal of US$120,000 was started. The &quot;Thorium Core Cloud Desktop&quot; dubbed cloud computing service would use ReactOS as core and could allow the use of Windows compatible applications from mobile devices (like smartphones, tablets), workstations, or any other connected device. On 21 February 2014, fundraising ended short of the target amount, with $48,965 of $120,000 raised, resulting in no transferred money.

===ReactOS Community Edition===
In April 2014, the ReactOS project announced an Indiegogo campaign to launch ReactOS Community Edition, a version of ReactOS based on the 0.4 release. The flexible funding campaign had a goal of $50,000 with additional stretch goals beyond that. Development of ReactOS Community Edition would be community-centric, with ReactOS users voting and funding to decide which software and hardware drivers the project will aim to support. On 1 June 2014, the flexible crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo ended, raising $25,141 for the development of the community edition, and the voting process to support hardware and software was started shortly thereafter.

===ReactOS Hackfest===

The ReactOS project organized a hackfest from 7 to 12 August 2015, in the German city of Aachen. The Hackfest resulted in many features being added to ReactOS.

The second hackfest was organized by the ReactOS project from 14 to 18 August 2017, in the German city of Cologne.

The third and fourth hackfests were organized by the ReactOS project from 16 to 21 August 2018 and from 15 to 20 August 2019 in Berlin respectively.

=== On-going national language development ===
Presently, ReactOS has active development in: Czech, English, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Ukrainian.

==Development==
===ReactOS core development===
ReactOS is primarily written in C, with some elements, such as ReactOS Explorer and the sound stack, written in C++. The project compiles using both MinGW and Microsoft Visual Studio, and contributes to the development of the build systems used through the submission of patches to its components.

The developers aim to make the kernel and usermode application programming interface (API) more compatible with Windows NT version 5.2 (Windows Server 2003) and to add support for more applications and hardware, with plans to target newer versions of Windows as development matures. DirectX support is undertaken through ReactX, an in-house implementation. 2D and OpenGL 3D hardware-accelerated rendering is done natively, while other drawing functionality such as Direct3D is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution, mostly using Wine&#x27;s code such as WineD3D.

The development progress is influenced by the size of the development team and the level of experience among them. As an estimate of the effort required to implement Windows 7, Microsoft employed 1,000 or so developers, organized into 25 teams, with each team averaging 40 developers. , in the ReactOS entry in Ohloh, the page followed through the &quot;Very large, active development team&quot; link lists 33 developers who have contributed over a 12-month period and a of 104 present and former users who have contributed code to the project via Apache Subversion since its inception. In his presentation at Hackmeeting 2009 in Milan, ReactOS developer Michele C. noted that most of the developers learn about Windows architecture while working on ReactOS and have no prior knowledge.

While ReactOS targets mainly the x86/AMD64 PC platform, an effort to port to the ARM architecture was at one point &quot;under way&quot;, while it did not produce much functionality and was abandoned along with a port to PowerPC, that is no longer actively maintained. Support for the Xbox and the NEC PC-9800, a variant IA-32 architecture, was added through the use of an architecture-specific HAL. Improved 64-bit support for ReactOS is &quot;being worked on&quot;, however, development seems to be going slowly.

===Collaboration and reuse===
While ReactOS has the aim to build a Windows-compatible kernel as open-source software, much of the surrounding required functionality to create a complete OS is already available in the greater open-source ecosystem. 
When available and possible, ReactOS therefore builds on and collaborates with already existing open-source projects. 
Conversely, projects like Wine, and formerly Captive NTFS and Longene re-use the open-source ReactOS code-base as well.

====Hardware driver stack====
On the hardware driver side, for instance the UniATA project provides Serial ATA drivers for ReactOS. The project has also experimented with using the FullFAT library in its rewrite of its FAT Installable File System. ReactOS makes use of the USB stack from Haiku both as a reference and as a foundation for its USB support. Mesa 3D provides OpenGL rendering.

====Networking====
ReactOS&#x27;s network stack is built on the TCP portion of OSKit&#x27;s port of the network stack in FreeBSD, along with an internally developed implementation for packet-oriented protocols like IP. Later, lwIP was integrated into the ReactOS network stack.

====Wine cooperation====

The ReactOS and the Wine projects share the goal to run binary Windows software natively and can therefore share many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses portions of the Wine project so that it can benefit from Wine&#x27;s progress in implementing the Win32 API. While Wine&#x27;s NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.

Separately, the experimental &quot;Arwinss&quot; branch was created as an alternative means to improve USER32 and GDI32 support through an alternative implementation of the Win32 API. Whereas ReactOS&#x27;s original Win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in Windows, Arwinss combines the architecture of that subsystem with the corresponding implementation in Wine. To this end, Arwinss uses Wine&#x27;s GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine&#x27;s existing software compatibility. Arwinss also allows the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display.

====Other====
The Tango Desktop Project initiative provides open-source design guidelines and resources (as icons) for applications on desktop environments. FreeType is an open-source software development library, used to render text on to bitmaps and provides support for other font-related operations. The &quot;KernelEx&quot; project is a Windows-API extension and compatibility layer project, which provides open-source implementations of some Windows-APIs. Other contributing projects are MinGW, SYSLINUX, adns, ICU, GraphApp, Ext2, GNU FreeFont, DejaVu fonts, and Liberation fonts.

==Forks==
Forks based on ReactOS exist:
*Ekush OS (2004)

==Reception==
Various people have acknowledged ReactOS and the implications of having a viable open-source drop-in replacement for Windows. A 2004 article and interview of the German weekly magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; describes ReactOS as directed at Windows users who want to renounce use of proprietary commercial software without having to switch to Linux. DistroWatch, a Linux distribution&#x27;s monitoring Web site, also lists ReactOS and describes it as &quot;a free and open-source operating system based on the best design principles found in the Windows NT architecture.&quot;

In his column for Free Software Magazine, David Sugar noted in 2006 that ReactOS would allow the use of applications depending on older versions of Windows whose APIs have been deprecated. He also recognized its potential to expand the total deployed base of free software, and as a resource for developers wanting to know undocumented Windows APIs in the course of writing portable applications. PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak remarked in 2008 that the Windows NT architecture had remained largely unchanged, making it an ideal candidate for cloning, and believed that ReactOS could be &quot;a bigger threat than Linux to Microsoft&#x27;s dominance&quot;. In response to Dvorak&#x27;s column, ZDNet technology journalist Dana Blankenhorn noted in 2008 that a lack of corporate sponsors and partners had rendered the project harmless to Microsoft. Echoing this, Thom Holwerda of OSNews in 2009 categorized ReactOS under a family of hobby operating systems maintained only by small groups of developers working in their spare time, lacking the financial support of more mainstream operating systems and the legacy of formerly mainstream ones such as RISC OS.

In October 2015, a Network World review of ReactOS v0.3.17 noted &quot;It&#x27;s just like running Windows 2000&quot; and praised the application package manager, a feature the original Windows is missing.

In August 2018, Jesse Smith from DistroWatch Weekly reviewed ReactOS v0.4.9, reporting that it suffered from limited hardware support and that it tended to lock up under load. He concluded: &quot;[it] should be used with caution and probably not as a main, day-to-day operating system&quot;

The ReactOS Project won on the annual Seliger Youth Forum &quot;The Best Presentation&quot; award with 100,000 Russian rubles ($2700) in 2011, attended by Alexander Rechitskiy, one of the development team members.

ReactOS was a featured project on SourceForge for the weeks beginning on 27 February 2012, 25 April 2013, and several others. It was Project of the Month on SourceForge for June 2013 and February 2019.

<text>, also known as Fushigi Yûgi: The Mysterious Play or Curious Play, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yuu Watase. It tells the story of two teenaged girls, Miaka and Yui, who are pulled into &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot;, a mysterious book at the National Diet Library. It is based on the four mythological creatures of China. Shogakukan serialized &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; in &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; from December 1991 to May 1996 and later compiled the manga into eighteen volumes.

Studio Pierrot adapted it into a fifty-two episode anime series that aired from April 1995 to March 1996 on TV Tokyo. The anime spawned three original video animation (OVA) releases, with the first having three episodes, the second having six, and the final OVA, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden&quot;, spanning four episodes. In North America, Viz Media licensed the manga series for an English-language release in 1999. The anime series was first licensed by Geneon Entertainment and re-licensed by Media Blasters in 2012.

A thirteen-volume Japanese light novel series, written by Megumi Nishizaki, followed &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;. Shogakukan published the novels from January 1998 to September 2003. Watase also released two prequel manga series: &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Genbu Kaiden&quot;, which ran from March 2003 to February 2013, and &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Byakko Senki&quot;, which began serialization in August 2017.

As of November 2015, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; had over 20 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.

==Plot==
The series describes the various trials of Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, two junior high school students. While at the library one day, Miaka and Yui encounter a strange book known as &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot;. Reading this book transports them into the novel&#x27;s universe in ancient China. Yui is transported back to the real world almost immediately, but Miaka finds herself the Priestess of Suzaku. 

Miaka is destined to gather the seven Celestial Warriors of the god Suzaku in order to summon Suzaku and obtain three wishes. She falls in love with the Celestial Warrior Tamahome, who eventually reciprocates and Miaka&#x27;s desire to use a wish to enter the high school of her choice begins to shift towards finding a way to be with Tamahome. 

Yui is also drawn into the book when she tries to help Miaka to come back to the real world; becoming the Priestess of Seiryuu, working against Miaka out of jealousy over Tamahome and revenge for the humiliation and pain she had suffered when she first came into the book&#x27;s world.

==Characters==
===Suzaku===
:
:The primary protagonist in &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;, is an ordinary 15-year-old junior high school student. She decides to become the Priestess of Suzaku in order to ask Suzaku to grant her wish to join her best friend, Yui, at the same high school. Outgoing and optimistic, Miaka shows herself amiable with friends and strangers, and has a tendency to be guileless and sentimental. She is naïve, but sometimes surprises adults with an insightful comment. Miaka is generous and cares greatly for other people and perceives herself to be a considerate person. She can be unassuming and unsophisticated, but also magnanimous and courageous. Because she creates the impression of a person who always needs help, Miaka has the good fortune of almost always having someone looking after her. Miaka has a primary weakness: her gluttony. She is an avid fan of anime, imitating several characters during the course of the story.
:
:He appears to be the strongest member of the Suzaku warriors. An adept martial artist, proficient unarmed and with weapons, he proves a good street-fighter and can channel his chi into energy-blasts. When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his chi to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.
:He is reincarted as and is the same age as he was in &quot;The Universe of Four Gods&quot;. His family runs a farm in the countryside. In &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden&quot;, he is Miaka&#x27;s husband and the father of her child, Hikari.
:
:He is the fourth Emperor of Kōnan, is known for his beauty and his narcissism. Known as a responsible ruler and capable of dealing with political affairs, Hotohori often places the well-being of his subjects first and forgets his own needs in the process. Hotohori has limited understanding of the world as a result of being raised in a sheltered environment.
:
:He first appears disguised in Emperor Hotohori&#x27;s harem. He is 18 years old. His true name is . While prone to jealousy, quick to anger, and possessing a calculating tendency, Nuriko is very level-headed and compassionate and shows the most concern regarding Miaka and Tamahome&#x27;s relationship. As a &quot;woman&quot;, Nuriko is infatuated with his fellow warrior, Hotohori, but as a man, he also loves Miaka Yuki.
:
:He a wandering monk, has trained for several years with Taiitsukun, the creator. As the oldest and wisest of all of the Suzaku warriors, Chichiri thinks of himself as the older brother who looks after them all. Appearing superficially light-hearted, he can put on super deformed &quot;chibi&quot; frivolity or suddenly become very serious and grim. While Tamahome and Hotohori are the obvious leaders, Chichiri is the ever-staunch advisor and supporter from behind the scenes, always willing to help when needed. Unconcerned with his own mortality or with earthly desires, he has a Zen master&#x27;s detached attitude.
:
:He formerly led the Mount Reikaku bandits. Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri.
:
:He is the healer of Suzaku&#x27;s warriors. He is soft-spoken and one of the most serious of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors. Mitsukake&#x27;s fighting abilities are limited to his own strength, but as a Celestial Warrior, he possesses incredible healing powers at the cost of exchanging some of his own life force.
:
:He is the youngest and the genius among the seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku.

===Seiryu===
Yui Hongo
 is the Priestess of Seiryū (&quot;Seiryū no Miko&quot;). An intelligent and mature girl, she is a tenth grade student and Miaka Yuki&#x27;s best friend. A passionate person at heart, she tends to see the world in black and white terms and is easily infuriated with perceived betrayal. Yui is confident and bold with everything she does, but longs for someone to take care of her. Although throughout the course of the story, Yui is in love with Tamahome, she ultimately gets together with Tetsuya Kajiwara.

Nakago
, considered to be the leader of the Seiryū warriors, is the main antagonist of &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;, and the antihero in the second OVA. Nakago is both merciless and charismatic; he eliminates those whose usefulness to him is exhausted and skillfully manipulates others into doing as he wishes. Nakago&#x27;s powers as a Celestial Warrior is shown to be stronger than any of the Suzaku and Seiryū warriors, having the ability to manipulate chi, enabling himself to become psychokinetic, fire energy blasts, and set up force fields. In battle, Nakago also utilizes a whip and sword.

Amiboshi
 is the elder twin brother of Suboshi. As a Celestial Warrior, Amiboshi is capable of emitting chi through his mouth and channel it through a flute to control the will of others. A skilled flute player, Amiboshi holds the instrument to the left when using his powers, but to the right when he is simply playing the flute. He works as a spy.

Suboshi
 is the younger twin brother of Amiboshi. As a Celestial Warrior, he can use a secret weapon known as the Ryūseisui, a double-meteor bell, and control it with his will alone. He and his brother can communicate with one another by writing messages on their bodies. In terms of temperament, Suboshi is fierce, impulsive, and stubborn to a fault, unwilling to listen to reason once he becomes determined to do something. Suboshi is particularly devoted to his brother and will not hesitate to kill if it means protecting Amiboshi, even killing fellow Seiryū warrior Tomo without a second thought for this reason alone.

Soi
 was rescued by Nakago when she was a child and is his most devoted follower. As a Celestial Warrior, Soi possesses Feng Shui related powers allowing her to control lightning, induce electromagnetic fields, but is also skilled in Fhangzang and chi raising techniques. She was born in Gen, a province near the Kutō border. Soi normally appears as a formidable armored fighter who speaks like a man, concealing a kind heart and feminine nature.

Ashitare
 is a werewolf from Hokkan whom Nakago found in a circus tent; until then, Ashitare apparently was a circus side-show. Hardened and angry, he developed a hatred of humans and would devour human flesh after killing them. Because of Ashitare&#x27;s brute strength, he is seemingly unstoppable.

Tomo
 is an illusionist and performer among the Celestial Warriors of Seiryū. Having faced hardship since childhood, Tomo is sadistic and cruel, possessing a contorted mentality and severe attitude toward others. Tomo&#x27;s abilities as a Celestial Warrior allow him to hypnotize opponents.

Miboshi
 is the last of the Seiryū Celestial Warriors to appear. While he looks like a young boy, he is actually much older than the other Seiryū warriors. As a Celestial Warrior he can possess others - as well as summoning and controlling demons. He employs a Tibetan prayer-wheel with sutras inscribed on it to summon monsters and to perform sorcery.

===Genbu===

Takiko Okuda
 (drama CD/game)

 is the Priestess of Genbu and the heroine of &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Genbu Kaiden&quot;. The daughter of Einosuke Okuda, the Japanese translator of the original scripture for &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot;, Takiko is a serious young girl skilled with the naginata. She demonstrates a strong will and good heart, but shows insecurity with her own abilities and tends to be impulsive. Takiko is sincere, honest, and possesses a strong sense of justice.

Uruki
 (drama CD/game)

 is the crown prince of the Hokkan Empire and second in line to the throne. He wields a bladed discus to fight, but as a Celestial Warrior, he is able to manipulate the wind in various ways, particularly for teleportation; the only setback to this power is that he must transform into a woman in order to utilize it.

Tomite
 is a Genbu Celestial Warrior and a bounty hunter from the Ka Tribe, an ethnic minority in western Hokkan. In addition to being a skilled archer, Tomite, as a Celestial Warrior, is capable of manifesting and manipulating ice.

Hatsui
 (drama CD)

 is a Genbu Celestial Warrior and the son of medical doctors. He possesses the ability to shoot spikes from his body and the ability to form a steel cage/basket around himself and others as a means of protection. He is timid, shy, and cries easily and finds it difficult to trust others.

Namame
 is a Genbu Celestial Warrior who appears as a small doll made of rock that resembles the kodama. Though he is apparently unable to speak, Takiko eventually is able to hear his voice and Namame speaks in simple and short sentences.

Hikitsu
 is a Genbu Celestial Warrior, able to manipulate water in the form of snakes, but also possesses a second ability which he has no control over: Shikyokan, where anyone who looks upon the eye with his character is forced to remember their worst memories. Hikitsu is withdrawn and cold to everyone apart from his sister Ayla and his best friend Tomite, whom Hikitsu had saved during an attack which caused the death of Tomite&#x27;s father.

Inami
 (drama CD)

 is a Genbu Celestial Warrior, initially found in the country of Konan working as a brothel madam. She fights using a large pipe shaped weapon and possesses the ability to manipulate the length of her hair and the smoke from her oversized pipe.

Urumiya
 (drama CD)

 is the last of the Genbu Celestial Warriors to be unveiled. A dangerous and skilled assassin, Hagus always carries a wide bladed sword and is a proficient archer. He is able to absorb the powers of other Celestial Warriors though his mouth and then use them as he pleases. Hagus comes across as a coldhearted and merciless man whose only desire is to succeed in his mission to kill Uruki. He is unemotional and able to remain calm and focused, even in the heat of battle, but demonstrates an unexpectedly compassionate side to him when he saves two children from misaimed arrows. When he is not battling Uruki and Takiko, he comes across as morose and quiet.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Yuu Watase, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; originally appeared in serial form in the semimonthly manga magazine &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot;. It premiered in the January 1, 1992 ( 1) issue, released in December 1991, and ran for over five years, ending in the June 5, 1996 ( 12) issue, released in May 1996. The series was simultaneously published in eighteen collected volumes by Shogakukan, with new volumes being released on a quarterly schedule.

In 1992, Viz Media licensed the manga for an English-language release in North America. The series was originally released in a flipped trade paperback format, starting in August 1998. Several characters have both Japanese pronunciations and Chinese pronunciations. In 1998, Watase visited the United States and met with Viz staff members at their San Francisco headquarters. Viz kept the original Chinese names of characters at her request. Bill Flanagan, the editor of the English version, asked Watase if he should use the Chinese names for popular characters such as Tai Yi-Jun (Taitsukun), and she also asked for the Chinese names to be used there. The characters with names remaining in Japanese in the English version are the characters such as Tamahome who have Japanese pronunciations of ancient constellations; there was never any intention of them having Chinese names.

This caused some confusion for fans as the anime version uses the Japanese names. For example, in the manga, Hotohori&#x27;s country is named &quot;Hong-Nan&quot; rather than the &quot;Konan&quot; found in the anime series. After eight volumes, Viz stopped publication of &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;, reviving it in June 2003 when it released the first two volumes in unflipped standard manga size volumes. The remaining volumes were released on a quarterly schedule, including the remaining ten volumes. The final volume of the series was released in April 2006. The dates and ISBN numbers given for the first eight volumes in the table on the link above are for the second edition releases.

Viz also serialized &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; in their manga anthology magazine, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;, starting with the October 1998 debut issue and running until the December 2004 issue, the magazine&#x27;s final issue. In 2009 and 2010, Viz re-released the series as part of their &quot;VIZBIG&quot; line, combining three individual volumes of the original release into each single, larger volume.

===Anime===

Produced by Studio Pierrot, the fifty-two episode &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; anime series premiered on TV Tokyo on April 6, 1995. The series aired weekly, until the final episode that was aired on March 28, 1996. The series was licensed for English-language release to Region 1 DVD and VHS format by Geneon Entertainment, then named Pioneer, under the expanded title &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: The Mysterious Play&quot;. It has been suggested that Geneon chose to license the series based on its popularity among the fansub community. The main series was released in eight individual volumes and as two box sets, the &quot;Suzaku&quot; and &quot;Seiryū&quot; sets. Media Blasters license-rescued the series, and released the first season to DVD on June 19, 2012. Season 2 was released on February 12, 2013.

===Original video animations===

Following the anime adaptation, three original video animation (OVA) works appeared. The first, spanning three episodes, takes place a year after the events of the main series and has no ties to the original manga. It was released to DVD on October 25, 1996. The second OVA, which has six episodes, animates the last four volumes of the manga series that had been left out of the main series. The episodes were split across two volumes, with the first released May 25, 1997, and the second coming over a year later on August 25, 1998.

The final OVA, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden&quot;, spans four episodes and is based on two of the light novels written by Megumi Nishizaki. Released on December 21, 2001, it focuses on a new character, Mayo Sakaki, a sixteen-year-old girl who attends Yotsubadai High School. Upon finding &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot; in a trash bin at the park, Mayo soon discovers that the story remains incomplete. In the unfamiliar world of the book, Mayo must come to terms with her own life and the unhappiness within it.

Geneon Entertainment also licensed the OVAs for Region 1 DVD release. The first two OVAs were released together in a set titled &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: The Mysterious Play&quot;, while &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden&quot; was released as a single disc volume. The OVAs were released with similar packaging as the main series, to give them a consistent look. All three OVA series have also been re-licensed by Media Blasters.

===Novels===
Over a series of five years, wrote thirteen Japanese light novels based on &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;. Illustrated by Yuu Watase, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi Gaiden&quot; primarily explores the lives the various Celestial Warriors before they are seen in the manga. The only two novels to be set after the manga, &quot;Eikō Den (Jōkan)&quot; and &quot;Eikō Den (Gekan)&quot;, later became the basis for the third &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; original video animation, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden.&quot; Originally published by Shogakukan, none of the novels have been licensed for English release.


===Video game===

==Reception==
===Manga===
As of November 2015, &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; had over 20 million copies in circulation.

In a column for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, writer Jason Thompson called &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; a &quot;great mix of monsters, magic, fighting and the more typical &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; material, romance.&quot; In his expanded review of the series for &quot;&quot;, Thompson further praised it as &quot;one of the best &#x27;schoolgirl in a strange land&#x27; fantasies.&quot; He singled out Watase&#x27;s writing, which he believes &quot;successfully balances&quot; romance, action, comedy, and cliffhangers, as well as the series&#x27; compact supporting cast full of &quot;strong personalities&quot;.

===Anime===
&quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; preferred the manga to the anime, criticizing the latter&#x27;s production values, repetitious dialogue, and reuse of footage in flashback episodes. &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; criticized the &quot;convoluted&quot; plot and &quot;nonsensical&quot; dialogue. Another review noted that although Miaka &quot;makes out with her boyfriend quite a bit&quot;, the climax is &quot;of the heart and soul&quot;, despite the many battles that the characters go through. Her strength and belief in herself give her the strength and courage to change the world. Patrick Drazen, author of &quot;Anime Explosion!&quot;, considers the humor in &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot; to be based on super deformed caricatures and therefore strange to Western audiences. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; argued that the show is &quot;always entertaining throughout,&quot; while &quot;CBR&quot; criticized that Nakago is a pretty character even when &quot;committing horrendous crimes like mass murder and sexual assault.&quot;

Winnie Chow of &quot;Animerica&quot; was disappointed by the ending of the anime adaptation, finding the final battle that resolves the series to be &quot;lame at best&quot; that left her cheering more for Nakago than the &quot;good guys&quot;. Throughout the series, she notes that the scenes between Miaka and Tamahome became &quot;increasingly sickening&quot; and &quot;overdone&quot;. &quot;Fushigi Yûgi: Eikoden&quot; was panned by &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot;, which considered the animation to be its only strong point. In particular, the reviewer found the new main character to be unlikeable.

<text>Libertadores (, &quot;Liberators&quot;) were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence from Spain and of the movement in support of Brazilian independence from Portugal. They are named that way in contrast with the &quot;Conquistadores&quot; (&quot;Conquerors&quot;).

They were largely local-born men of European descent (&quot;criollos&quot;), in most cases part of the bourgeoisie and with military training in the motherland, who were influenced by liberalism and led colonial subjects in their struggle for independence against the metropole.

==List of libertadores==

===Hispanic America===
===Brazil===
Pedro I of Brazil became known as &quot;o Libertador&quot; (&quot;the Liberator&quot;) in Brazil for his role in the country&#x27;s independence. Sporadically, the term has also been applied to other figures such as José Bonifacio (known as the &quot;patriarch for independence&quot;), Maria Leopoldina de Austria, and Joaquim Gonçalves Ledo.

===Philippines===

Emilio Aguinaldo, the first Filipino President and Generalissimo who liberated the Philippines from the Spanish Empire in 1898, is widely recognized as &quot;El Libertador de la Patria&quot; (The Liberator of the Homeland) 

==Legacy==
The flags of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador follow Francisco de Miranda&#x27;s design of 1806. Also, Bolivia was named after Símon Bolívar, who in turn was president of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and twice of Venezuela. San Martín served as &quot;President Protector&quot; of Peru.

In what today is part of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Agustín de Iturbide, a military leader revolted against the Viceroyalty of New Spain, founded an independent Mexican Empire where he ascended as Emperor Agustín I.

The names of &quot;libertadores&quot; are used all over South America to name anything from towns and places to institutions and sports clubs. Also, the most prestigious international club football competition in South America is named the Copa Libertadores in their honour.
