<text>Tactical or battlefield intelligence became vital to both sides in the field during the American Civil War. Units of spies and scouts reported directly to the commanders of armies in the field, providing details on troop movements and strengths. The distinction between spies and scouts was one that had life-or-death consequences: if a suspect was seized while in disguise and not in his army&#x27;s uniform, he was often sentenced to be hanged. A spy named Will Talbot, a member of the 35th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, was left behind in Gettysburg after his battalion had passed through the borough on June 26–27, 1863. He was captured, taken to Emmitsburg, Maryland, and executed on orders of Brig. Gen. John Buford.

==Confederate spying==
Intelligence-gathering for the Confederates was focused on Alexandria, Virginia, and the surrounding area.

Thomas Jordan created a network of agents that included Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow. Greenhow delivered reports to Jordan via the “Secret Line,” the name for the system used to get letters, intelligence reports, and other documents across the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers to Confederate officials.

The Confederacy&#x27;s Signal Corps was devoted primarily to communications and intercepts, but it also included a covert agency called the Confederate Secret Service Bureau, which ran espionage and counter-espionage operations in the North, including two networks in Washington.

==Union spying==

The Union&#x27;s intelligence-gathering initiatives were decentralized. Allan Pinkerton worked for Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and created the United States Secret Service. Lafayette C. Baker conducted intelligence and security work for Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army. President Abraham Lincoln hired William Alvin Lloyd to spy in the South and report to Lincoln directly.

As a brigadier general in Missouri, Ulysses S. Grant was ordered by Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont to start an intelligence organization. Grant came to understand the power of intelligence and later made Brig. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge the head of his intelligence operations that covered an area from Mississippi to Georgia with as many as one hundred secret agents.

Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, who became commander of the Army of the Potomac in January 1863, ordered his deputy provost marshal, Col. George H. Sharpe, to create a unit to gather intelligence. Sharpe set up what he called the Bureau of Military Information and was aided by John C. Babcock, who had worked for Allan Pinkerton and had made maps for George B. McClellan. Sharpe&#x27;s bureau produced reports based on information collected from agents, prisoners of war, refugees, Southern newspapers, documents retrieved from battlefield corpses, and other sources. When Grant began his siege of Petersburg in June 1864, Sharpe had become Grant&#x27;s intelligence chief.

African American slaves and free persons provided valuable intelligence supporting Union military operations, often exploiting their ability to move across lines without attracting attention. African American Civil War Intelligence Contributions (formerly known as &quot;Black Dispatches&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed significantly to the Union&#x27;s ultimate victory.

<doc id="372753" wikidata="Q746069" url="?curid=372753" title="Ussher chronology">
<text>The Ussher chronology is a 17th-century chronology of the history of the world formulated from a literal reading of the Old Testament by James Ussher, the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. The chronology is sometimes associated with young Earth creationism, which holds that the universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the biblical book of Genesis. Ussher&#x27;s work fell into disrepute in the 19th century.

Published in 1650, the full title of Ussher&#x27;s work in Latin is &quot;Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto&quot; (&#x27;Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the beginnings of Maccabees&#x27;). Ussher&#x27;s work was his contribution to the long-running theological debate on the age of the Earth. This was a major concern of many Christian scholars over the centuries.

The chronology is sometimes called the UssherLightfoot chronology because John Lightfoot published a similar chronology in 1642–1644; however, this is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher&#x27;s work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that the first day of creation was October 23, 4004 BC on the proleptic Julian calendar, near the autumnal equinox. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.

Ussher&#x27;s proposed date of 4004 BC differed little from other biblically based estimates, such as those of Jose ben Halafta (3761 BC), Bede (3952 BC), Ussher&#x27;s near-contemporary Scaliger (3949 BC), Johannes Kepler (3992 BC), and Isaac Newton (c. 4000 BC). Ussher was influenced by the same account as the apocryphal Book of Jasher, dating the worldwide flood to 2349 BC and the birth of Terah in 2127 BC. The date of 4000 BC as the creation of Adam was at least partially influenced by the widely held belief that the Earth was approximately 5600 years old (2000 from Adam to Abraham, 2000 from Abraham to the birth of Christ, and 1600 years from Christ to Ussher), corresponding to the six days of Creation, on the grounds that &quot;one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day&quot; (). This tradition was believed to indicate that Jesus would return in AD 2000, more than six thousand years after 4004 BC. Modern proponents of this interpretation hold that the creation date 4004 BC could be inaccurate.

==Ussher&#x27;s methods==
The chronologies of Ussher and other biblical scholars corresponded so closely because they used much the same method to calculate key events recorded in the Bible. Establishing the chronologies is complicated by the fact that the Bible was compiled by different authors over several centuries with lengthy chronological gaps, making it difficult to do a simple totaling of Biblical ages and dates. In his article on Ussher&#x27;s calendar, James Barr has identified three distinct periods that Ussher and others had to tackle:

# &quot;Creation to Abraham&#x27;s migration.&quot; This section is fairly easy to calculate, using the chronological data in Genesis 5 and 11, which gives an unbroken male lineage, with numbers of years, from the creation to Abraham being called out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ussher used the chronology found in the Masoretic text instead of the alternative chronologies found in the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch. Ussher fixed this period as 2082 years, from 4004 to 1922 BC.
# &quot;Abraham&#x27;s migration to Solomon&#x27;s temple.&quot; Ussher wrote that the time from Abraham leaving Haran to the Exodus was 430 years (based on Abraham&#x27;s descendants suffering a period of 400 years of persecution, commencing 30 years after Abraham left Haran) states that 480 years elapsed from the Exodus to the beginning of construction of Solomon&#x27;s temple in the fourth year of Solomon&#x27;s reign. Thus the temple foundations were laid 910 years after Abraham left Haran; these 910 years spanned from 1922 to 1012 BC.
# &quot;Period of the temple laid to the Babylonian captivity.&quot; This period is the most difficult to calculate, due to repeated difficulties in correlating the regnal years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The simple addition of the reigns of Judah&#x27;s kings results in a total of 430 years, but by positing a few overlapping reigns, Ussher shortened this to 424 years: 1012 to 588 BC.

After reckoning the years from creation to the last kings of Judah, Ussher used to establish the length of time from the creation to the accession of Babylonian king Amel-Marduk (also known as Evil-Merodach). He then used information from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sources to fix the date of Amel-Marduk&#x27;s enthronement at 562 BC (after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s death), from which he was able to deduce a creation in 4004 BC.

In fixing the date of Jesus&#x27; birth, Ussher took account of an error perpetrated by Dionysius Exiguus, the founder of the Anno Domini numbering system. Ussher chose 5 BC as Christ&#x27;s birth year because Josephus indicated that the death of Herod the Great occurred in 4 BC. Thus, for the Gospel of Matthew to be correct, Jesus could not have been born after that date.

The season in which Creation occurred was the subject of considerable theological debate in Ussher&#x27;s time. Many scholars proposed it had taken place in the spring, the start of the Babylonian, Chaldean and other cultures&#x27; chronologies. Others, including Ussher, thought it more likely that it had occurred in the autumn, largely because that season marked the beginning of the Jewish year.

Ussher further narrowed down the date by using the Jewish calendar to establish the &quot;first day&quot; of creation as falling on a Sunday near the autumnal equinox. The day of the week was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish calendar is Saturday—hence, Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Tabulae Rudolphinae&quot; (&quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;, 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday, October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars . Modern equations place the autumnal equinox of 4004 BC on Sunday, October 23 (by the Julian calendar).

Ussher&#x27;s understanding of creation placed the &quot;first day&quot; referred to in on October 23, but with a &quot;pre-creation&quot; event, which he identified as the &quot;beginning of time&quot; occurring the previous night. Ussher referred to his dating of creation on the first page of &quot;Annales&quot; in Latin and on the first page of its posthumous English translation &quot;Annals of the World&quot; (1658). In the following extract from the English translation, the phrase &quot;in the year of the Julian Calendar&quot; refers to the Julian Period, of which year 1 is 4713 BC, and therefore year 710 is 4004 BC.
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Ge. 1:1 This beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year of the Julian Calendar, 710.
Ussher provides a slightly different time in his &quot;Epistle to the Reader&quot; in his Latin and English works: &quot;I deduce that the time from the creation until midnight, January 1, 1 AD was 4003 years, seventy days and six hours.&quot; Six hours before midnight would be 6 pm.

==Ussher&#x27;s chronology today==
By the middle of the 19th century, Ussher&#x27;s chronology came under increasing attack from supporters of uniformitarianism, who argued that Ussher&#x27;s &quot;young Earth&quot; was incompatible with the increasingly accepted view of an Earth much more ancient than Ussher&#x27;s. It became generally accepted that the Earth was tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. Ussher fell into disrepute among theologians as well; in 1890, Princeton professor William Henry Green wrote a highly influential article in &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; entitled &quot;Primeval Chronology&quot; in which he strongly criticised Ussher. He concluded:
We conclude that the Scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of Abraham; and that the Mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the Flood or of the creation of the world.
The similarly conservative theologian B. B. Warfield reached the same conclusion in &quot;On The Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race&quot;, commenting that &quot;it is precarious in the highest degree to draw chronological inferences from genealogical tables&quot;.

Archbishop Ussher&#x27;s chronology has in recent years been subject to artistic criticism, including in the play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (based on the Scopes Monkey Trial) and the fantasy novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; which alleges that it is inaccurate &quot;by almost a quarter of an hour&quot;.

A different viewpoint comes from Stephen Jay Gould, who, while totally disagreeing with Ussher&#x27;s chronology, nevertheless wrote:
I shall be defending Ussher&#x27;s chronology as an honorable effort for its time and arguing that our usual ridicule only records a lamentable small-mindedness based on mistaken use of present criteria to judge a distant and different past.

Ussher represented the best of scholarship in his time. He was part of a substantial research tradition, a large community of intellectuals working toward a common goal under an accepted methodology.

<text>Horror punk is a music genre that mixes punk rock and 1950s-influenced doo-wop and rockabilly sounds with morbid and violent imagery and lyrics which are often influenced by horror films and science fiction B-movies. The genre was pioneered by the Misfits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Subsequent bands formed in the Misfits&#x27; wake like Mourning Noise, the Undead and Samhain, solidifying horror punk&#x27;s first wave. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the genre gained attention through the reunion of the Misfits and success of groups like AFI, Son of Sam and the Murderdolls. This popularity continued to the modern day with Blitzkid, Calabrese and Creeper.

==Characteristics==
Horror punk is defined by its fusion of punk rock music with the imagery and lyrical topics common in the horror film genre. Typically it references B movies, doing so in a way that emphasises cheesiness. However, some artists and songs in the genre also discuss events of real life horror. Due to this, horror punk generally eschews the political lyrics found in conventional punk rock. The genre also asserts the influence of 1950s–inspired doo-wop and rockabilly sounds.

During the earliest stages of the gothic rock genre, &quot;horror punk&quot; was one term often misapplied to the genre. While both horror punk and gothic rock pull from many of the same points of reference, and sometimes early horror punk groups, particularly the Misfits, are themselves cited as being &quot;proto-gothic&quot;, the two genres are distinctly separate by modern definitions. However, the gothic rock genre death rock, with its emphasis on influence from punk rock, contains significant overlap with horror punk. Although, death rock lacks horror punk&#x27;s rockabilly and doo-wop influences, instead paying a greater attention to musical atmospheres. Psychobilly is also a closely related style to horror punk, particularly during the 2000s when the genres became increasingly intertwined. In an article by Kerrang!, writer Chris Krovatin stated that &quot;the two [genres] have become so accepting of one another, that to make the distinction feels like splitting hairs&quot;. Some psychobilly groups even take influence from horror punk imagery, notably Tiger Army.

==History==
===Precursors===

The meeting of horror imagery and rock music has existed since the genre&#x27;s earliest years. 1950s rock and roll singer Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins and his single &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; is a prominent example of this, through its allusions to voodoo. Additionally, teenage tragedy songs such as &quot;Teen Angel&quot;, &quot;Endless Sleep&quot; and &quot;Moody River&quot;, were a popular style of songwriting which emphasised horror during the 1950s and 1960s. These elements continued into the 70s with the advent of glam rock and heavy metal. Pioneering groups such as Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath used horror themes extensively throughout their careers.

One of the most prominent influences on horror punk was the Cramps&#x27; merger of rockabilly and &quot;Shock Theater&quot; influenced imagery and lyrics. Furthermore, the Damned one of the earliest English punk rock bands made use of a horror influenced aesthetic. In particular, the band&#x27;s vocalist David Vanian shaped his stage persona around the 1931 film &quot;Dracula&quot; and its leading actor Bela Lugosi.

===Origins (1970s–1980s)===
The Misfits formed in 1977 and began creating music influenced by the then-burgeoning punk rock scene. After recording the album &quot;Static Age&quot; in 1978, they began writing music inspired by science fiction and B-movie horrors. At the same time, they began using the titular character from &quot;the Crimson Ghost&quot; (1946) as their logo, wearing makeup, clothes with skeleton patterns during performances and employed a style of hair inspired by Eddie Munster that they came to term a &quot;devilock&quot;. Through this stylistic shift, they laid the groundwork for all future horror punk bands. After Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele departed from the band, he formed New York horror punk band the Undead. Steve Zing who was a part of the band&#x27;s local Lodi, New Jersey following was one of the earliest musicians influenced by the Misfits. Zing formed his own horror punk Mourning Noise in 1981. Following the 1983 breakup of the Misfits, vocalist Glenn Danzig formed Samhain, a similarly horror-themed punk band. The band released only two albums during their time as a band, with a third recorded at the time being released posthumously in 1990. By this time the band&#x27;s members were instead pursuing the heavy metal band Danzig.

In the early 1980s the death rock genre was pioneered in Los Angeles by groups like 45 Grave, Christian Death, Super Heroines and Kommunity FK. Although death rock and horror punk are separate styles of punk, they bear a significant overlap through emphasis on horror themes and imagery. Death rock band 45 Grave, in particular, are massively influential on horror punk.

===Subsequent developments (1990s–present)===
The Misfits reformed in 1995, this time featuring Michale Graves on vocals, releasing two albums before his 1998 departure. Although a period of the band often demeaned by its fanbase, the Graves era of the Misfits played a significant role in increasing the notoriety of the band and horror punk in general. Prior to the reunion, they were a band influential amongst the punk and metal scenes however were obscure outside of that circle. It was only during the 1990s that &quot;the majority of rock fans woke up to them&quot;.
A new wave of horror punk emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. AFI, who had previously been established as hardcore band, transitioned into a horror punk sound following their 1998 recruitment of guitarist Jade Puget. A 2022 article published by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; credited their 1999 album &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; as having &quot;reinvented the horror punk of the Misfits for a new generation&quot;. In 2000, AFI vocalist Davey Havok formed Son of Sam alongside the 1999 reunion lineup of Samhain. This lineup released one album &quot;Songs from the Earth&quot; in 2001. Another key figure from this period was Wednesday 13, who &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Rich Hobson termed a &quot;horror-punk hero&quot;. In 2002 he formed the Murderdolls alongside Joey Jordison, which began writing by &quot;cannibalising&quot; the music of 13&#x27;s prior band Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Following the band&#x27;s 2004 hiatus, he began a solo-career. At this same time, horror punk-influenced bands also gained notability, including My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio and Tiger Army.

During the 2000s, the distinction between psychobilly and horror punk became increasingly obscured. The Creepshow were one prominent band blurring these genre lines. During this same period, Blitzkid&#x27;s merger of &quot;goth&#x27;s stretching shadow and pop-punk&#x27;s teenage humanity&quot; too gained notability alongside Calabrese.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; writer Chris Krovatin credited Creeper as the band &quot;keeping horror punk alive&quot; in the late-2010s. Following the release of their debut album &quot;Eternity, in Your Arms&quot; (2017) the band changed their sound towards glam rock. However, after this shift the band&#x27;s vocalist Will Gould began Salem, a band reviving Creeper&#x27;s earlier sound. This led &quot;Punktastic&quot; writer Tom Walsh to describe Gould as &quot;on a crusade to single handedly revive the horror punk genre&quot;.

<text>Ranchera () or canción ranchera is a genre of traditional music of Mexico. It dates to before the years of the Mexican Revolution. Rancheras today are played in the vast majority of regional Mexican music styles. Drawing on rural traditional folk music, the ranchera developed as a symbol of a new national consciousness in reaction to the aristocratic tastes of the period.

==Definitions==
The word &quot;ranchera&quot; was derived from the word &quot;rancho&quot; because the songs originated on the ranches and in the countryside of rural Mexico.

Traditional themes in rancheras are about love, heartbreak, patriotism or nature.

Rhythms can have a meter in (in slow tempo: &quot; ranchera lenta&quot; and faster tempo: &quot;ranchera marcha&quot;), (&quot;ranchera vals&quot;), or (&quot;bolero ranchero&quot;).

Songs are usually in a major key, and consist of an instrumental introduction, verse and refrain, instrumental section repeating the verse, and another verse and refrain, with a tag ending. Rancheras are also noted for the grito mexicano, a yell that is done at musical interludes within a song, either by the musicians and/or the listening audience.
The normal musical pattern of rancheras is a–b–a–b. Rancheras usually begin with an instrumental introduction (a). The first lyrical portion then begins (b), with instrumental adornments interrupting the lines in between. The instruments then repeat the theme again, and then the lyrics may either be repeated or begin a new set of words. One also finds the form a–b–a–b–c–b used, in which the intro (a) is played, followed by the verse (b). This form is repeated, and then a refrain (c) is added, ending with the verse.

The most popular ranchera composers include Lucha Reyes, Cuco Sánchez, Antonio Aguilar, Juan Gabriel and José Alfredo Jiménez, who composed many of the best-known rancheras, with compositions totaling more than 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific songwriters in the history of western music.

Another closely related style of music is the corrido, which is often played by the same ensembles that regularly play rancheras. The corrido, however, is apt to be an epic story about heroes and villains, or the narrator&#x27;s lifestyle.

<text>The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (; ), formerly often written Kuchuk-Kainarji, was a peace treaty signed on , in Küçük Kaynarca (today Kaynardzha, Bulgaria) between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, ending the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 with major concessions to Russia. The concessions to Russia are not merely territorial; not only was the Crimea Khanate (not Crimea proper) ceded, but Russia also gained the right to construct a Greek Orthodox Church in Istanbul, claiming itself to be the protector of the Greek Orthodox in the Ottoman Empire. This was a pretext for frequent and numerous interventions in the decades to follow. Ottoman Christians started to feel more empowered as European and Christian powers demonstrated their rising influence and political power. Access to Europe&#x27;s political networks, markets and educational institutions created a class privilege for Ottoman Christians, and scholars often regard the treaty as turning point for relations between Ottoman Christians and the European nations.

The treaty was a milestone in the history of the decline of the Ottoman Empire, as for the first time a foreign power had a say in the governance of the Porte in assuming direct responsibility for the fate of the Empire&#x27;s Orthodox Christian subjects.

==Description==
Following the recent Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Kozludzha, the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji ended the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74 and marked a defeat of the Ottomans in their struggle against Russia. The Russians were represented by Field-Marshal Count Pyotr Rumyantsev while the Ottoman side was represented by Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha. The treaty was a most humiliating blow to the once-mighty Ottoman realm. It would also stand to foreshadow several future conflicts between the Ottomans and Russia. It would be only one of many attempts by Russia to gain control of Ottoman territory.
Russia returned Wallachia and Moldavia to Ottoman control, but was given the right to protect Christians in the Ottoman Empire and to intervene in Wallachia and Moldavia in case of Ottoman misrule. The northwestern part of Moldavia (which became known as Bukovina) was ceded to Austria in 1775. Russia interpreted the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji as giving it the right to protect Orthodox Christians in the Empire, notably using this prerogative in the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) to intervene under the last Phanariote rulers and after the Greek War of Independence. In 1787, faced with increased Russian hostility, Abdul Hamid I declared war on Russia again.

Russia gained Kabardia in the Caucasus, unlimited sovereignty over the port of Azov, the ports of Kerch and Enikale in the Kerch peninsula in the Crimea, and part of the Yedisan region between the Bug and Dnieper rivers at the mouth of the Dnieper. This latter territory included the port of Kherson. Russia thus gained two outlets to the Black Sea, which was no longer an Ottoman lake. Restrictions imposed by the 1739 Treaty of Niš over Russian access to the Sea of Azov and fortifying the area were removed. Russian merchant vessels were to be allowed passage of the Dardanelles. The treaty also granted Eastern Orthodox Christians the right to sail under the Russian flag and provided for the building of a Russian Orthodox Church in Constantinople (which was never built).


The Crimean Khanate was the first Muslim territory to slip from the sultan&#x27;s suzerainty, when the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji forced the Sublime Porte to recognize the Tatars of the Crimea as politically independent, although the sultan remained the religious leader of the Tatars as the Muslim caliph. This was the first time the powers of the Ottoman caliph were exercised outside of Ottoman borders and ratified by a European power. The Khanate retained this nominal independence, while actually being dependent on Russia, until Catherine the Great formally annexed it in 1783, increasing Russia&#x27;s power in the Black Sea area.

The Ottoman-Russian War of 1768–74 had opened the era of European preoccupation with the Eastern Question: what would happen to the balance of power as the Ottoman Empire lost territory and collapsed? The Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji would provide some of the answer. After the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the Ottoman Empire ceased to be an aggressive power; it had terrified Christendom for over three hundred years. From then on, it mainly fought against the overwhelming might of Christian Europe. The Habsburgs had been one of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s chief European foes, but by the middle of the century, the tsars had taken over the Habsburgs&#x27; fight against the Turks. The Russian tsars were seeking the Black Sea, the bulwark of the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. Finally, after two centuries of conflict, the Russian fleet had destroyed the Ottoman navy and the Russian army had inflicted heavy defeats on the Ottoman land forces. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s frontiers would gradually shrink for another two centuries, and Russia would proceed to push her frontier westwards to the Dniester.

Article XXIII – The fortresses conquered by the Russian armies in Georgia and Mingrelia, Bagdadgick, Kutatis, and Scheherban shall belong to those on whom they were formerly dependent. In turn, the Sublime Porte grants amnesty to those in said countries who offended it in any manner during the course of the war. The Sublime Porte promises to treat this people fairly and grant them freedom of religion, but as they are subjects of the Sublime Porte, Russia must not meddle in their affairs in any way.

==Major implications==
Defeat had come this time not at the hands of the Habsburg Empire, one of the most powerful European rulers, but by a remote and once-backward country, which only two generations earlier had itself set out on the course of autocratic Europeanizing reform. The treaty demonstrated that if France and Austria could protect churches of their particular brand of Christianity in Constantinople, Russia could do the same for its own church.

The treaty forced the Ottomans to allow the passage of Russian ships through the Turkish Straits into the Mediterranean past the sultan&#x27;s palace in Constantinople, avoiding the lengthy detour previously used. The treaty allowed the Ottoman sultan to maintain certain rights there in his capacity as caliph of Muslims. In religious affairs only, the Muslims remained subject to the Ottoman sultan-caliph, which was the first internationally acknowledged assertion of the sultan&#x27;s rights over Muslims outside the frontiers of his empire. The Crimean Tatars retained the privilege of praying publicly for the sultan that was balanced by the privilege, newly accorded to the tsar, to make representations on behalf of certain of the sultan&#x27;s Orthodox subjects.

Russia&#x27;s right to build a church in Constantinople later expanded into Russian claims to protect all Orthodox Christians under Ottoman rule. The Ottomans were to pay a large indemnity to the Russians and address the Russian sovereign as padisah, the title reserved for the Ottoman sultan. The treaty acknowledged a religious role for the Ottoman sultan as caliph over Muslims, whom the treaty briefly made &#x27;independent&#x27; before they passed under Russian rule. To the extent that the caliphal title later gained importance beyond Ottoman borders, this treaty stimulated the process. However, Ottoman loss of the Crimea and the end of the Crimean khanate caused Muslims everywhere to question the sultans&#x27; legitimacy as defenders of Islam (ghazis). Ottoman statesmen recognized that the European menace was not isolated on distant frontiers but threatened the &#x27;heart of Islam&#x27; and the &#x27;entire Muslim community&#x27;.

The clause relating to the Orthodox Church opened foreign interference in the empire&#x27;s relations with its Christian subjects. But the defeat also posed a basic problem in statecraft, and threatened the Ottoman&#x27;s traditional self-confidence, while Russia and Tsarina Catherine would be praised immensely among the Greek Orthodox of Constantinople. The increase in Russia&#x27;s influence because of the new church paralleled the increase in territorial, commercial, and diplomatic status accorded to Russia by the treaty. The surrender of Muslims to Christian rule put into question the rationale of a state founded on Muslim conquest of Christians, and of a religious revelation that promised to the true believer prosperity and power on earth as well as salvation hereafter. It made abundantly clear the need for reform to save the state and to reassert the true faith; and the only basis of reform could be a Muslim equivalent of Satan casting out Satan. [?]

==Languages ==
Cevdet Pasa reproduced the treaty in his history. His Article 14 states that the church is to be called the &quot;dosografa&quot; church. The Mu‘āhedāt Mecmū‘ası is the officially-published collection of Ottoman treaties. A copy of the text of the treaty can also be found in Başbakanlık Arşivi in İstanbul and in the series of Ecnebi Defterleri that records treaties, decorations and consular matters.

Texts of the treaty are also found in Italian and Russian. Grand Vizier Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha signed Turkish and Italian copies of the treaty, and Field Marshal P. A. Rumyantsev signed Russian and Italian texts. Russian, Italian, and Turkish are the only three languages in which original copies of the treaty were written, and in case of a divergence between the Russian and Turkish texts, the Italian text would prevail.

Bernard Lewis suggests that the choice of spelling of Turkish words in the Italian version points to a Russian author.

==Problems in interpretation==
The treaty has been a continuing source of controversy for statesmen and scholars. The different reproductions of the treaty have led to divergences in the different languages, and thus they have been the source of some confusion.
While most of the treaty is straightforward, Articles 7 and 14 have been the source of a variety of interpretations. Article 14 of the treaty concerns the church that is to be built in Constantinople. In the Russian text, Article 14 states that the church would be of the &#x27;Greco-Russian&#x27; faith. The Italian text states that the church is to be called &#x27;Russo-Greek&#x27;. It is not clear if Russia gained the right to act as a protector of Ottoman Christians through those articles. That question is disputed among historians, as some consider that indeed the treaty gave Russia the right to act as the protector of Christianity within the Ottoman Empire, but others think the opposite or that it was too vague either way.

Because of the treaty, the Russians were accorded the right to build a church in Constantinople&#x27;s Galata quarter. The treaty stated that the church would be under the protection of the Russian minister, who could make representations concerning it to the Sublime Porte. In later years, the Russian government would make claims on an even broader right to protect the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox people in the Sultan&#x27;s domains. Those claims were exaggerated, but the connection seemed logical because of the treaty&#x27;s provision concerning the church in Constantinople being built. In Cevdet Pasa&#x27;s history, he makes no mention of the church that in the English text of the treaty is to be &quot;of the Greek ritual&quot;, but he rather states that the church was to be called the &quot;dosografa&quot; church.

If the church was to be called &quot;Russo-Greek&quot;, rather than just Greek, it would be more tenable for the Russian government to claim protection of the whole Greek church in the Ottoman Empire.

The Russian draft of the treaty presented to the Turks contained an article identical to Article 14 of the final treaty, which mentioned the right of Russia to construct a church of the &quot;Greco-Russian&quot; faith. The English text erroneously states that the church is to be &quot;of the Greek ritual&quot;.
The construction of this church was, in fact, a violation of Islamic law because it called for the building of an entirely-new church, not just the replacement of an old one. The Ottoman government had allowed Greek and Latin churches built before 1453 to survive, but no new ones could be built after the conquest of Constantinople.
There is a history shown here, not of faulty copying, but of faulty translation of the treaty. &quot;Rusogrek&quot; was mistakenly copied by a clerk as &quot;Rusograf&quot;, which was incorrectly copied as &#x27;Dosografa&#x27; by Cevdet Pasa or the compiler of the collection of Ottoman treaties. It is unknown exactly who was responsible for the error.

The English translation was made from a French translation of the treaty, which had been made in 1775 in St. Petersburg, and was printed for Parliament in 1854 with the English copy. That Russian-authorized French version of the treaty did not designate the church to be built in Constantinople as &quot;Russo-Greek&quot;. Mention of the church&#x27;s Russian character was omitted. &quot;Of the Greek ritual&quot; may seem to have an insignificant difference from a church &quot;of the Greco-Russian faith&quot;, but the mistranslation found in the French and the English texts helped Russian pretensions of a right to protect the wider Greek Church in the Ottoman Empire. It was not in conformity with the Turkish, Russian and Italian texts of the treaty and may or may not have been an innocent mistake, according to Roderic H. Davison. &quot;The St. Petersburg French translation, then, by dropping any reference to the Russian character of the church, and including only reference to the Greek, was misleading. Deliberate or not, it certainly laid an advantageous base for later Russian claims.&quot;

Surprisingly, the church was most likely never built; it is never mentioned, even by Russian visitors to Constantinople. Western travellers to Constantinople and residents of Constantinople are also silent on the topic of the construction of such a church.

From the mistranslations and the absence of church construction, Roderic H. Davison concludes that &quot;the &#x27;Dosografa&#x27; church of the published Ottoman treaty text is fictitious; the church &#x27;of the Greek ritual&#x27; in the French text of St. Petersburg is also erroneous.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In 1853, the Crimean War would break out over Russian assertion of a right to protect Orthodox Christians and the Ottoman denial that there was any such right. Russia tried to extend its right to build a church in Constantinople to intervene in domestic Ottoman affairs under the pretext of protecting the rights of all the Greek Orthodox people in the Ottoman Empire.

<text>The 2004 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 2004, was the 12th edition of the UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial football competition contested by the men&#x27;s national teams of UEFA member associations. The final tournament was hosted for the first time in Portugal, from 12 June to 4 July 2004. A total of 31 matches were played in ten venues across eight cities – Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Guimarães, Faro/Loulé, Leiria, Lisbon, and Porto.

As in 1996 and 2000, the final tournament was contested by 16 teams: the hosts plus the 15 teams that came through the qualifying tournament, which began in September 2002. Latvia secured their first participation in a major tournament after overcoming Turkey in the play-offs, while Greece returned to the European Championship after 24 years.

The tournament was rich in surprises and upsets: traditional powerhouses Germany, Spain, and Italy were eliminated in the group stage, while defending champions France were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Greece. Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match. Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas. Greece&#x27;s triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.

During the opening ceremony, one of the tableaux depicted a ship – symbolising the voyages of the Portuguese explorers – sailing through a sea that transformed into the flags of all competing countries. In the closing ceremony, Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado performed her single and official tournament theme song, &quot;Força&quot;.

==Bid process==
Portugal were announced as hosts for UEFA Euro 2004 on 12 October 1999, in Aachen, Germany, beating Spain and the joint bid of Austria and Hungary.

==Summary==
Group A opened with a shock as Greece, ranked outsiders from start, defeated the hosts 2–1. Giorgos Karagounis put the Greeks ahead after only seven minutes and Angelos Basinas made it 2–0 from the penalty spot on 51 minutes. A stoppage-time goal by Cristiano Ronaldo proved no more than a consolation. Greece then drew with Spain before losing to Russia in their last group stage game. Portugal recovered from their opening defeat by defeating Russia 2–0, who had their keeper Sergei Ovchinnikov sent off. Nuno Gomes scored the winning goal against Spain, which ensured Portugal finished top of Group A. Greece advanced to the quarter-finals as runners-up, ahead of Spain on goals scored.
Defending champions France scored twice in stoppage time to go from 1–0 down to beat England 2–1. Zinedine Zidane scored both goals; the second from the penalty spot. England&#x27;s other two games were memorable for the performances of their young star Wayne Rooney. Only 18 at the time, Rooney&#x27;s goal-scoring ability proved instrumental in victories over Switzerland (3–0) and Croatia (4–2). France and England qualified from the group as winners and runners-up respectively.

Group C featured a three-way tie between Sweden, Denmark and Italy. All matches between the three sides had ended in draws and all three had beaten Bulgaria. Italy were ultimately eliminated on the number of goals scored after Sweden and Denmark drew 2–2 and qualified as group winners and runners-up. The Italians accused Sweden and Denmark of fixing their match, as both sides knew that a 2–2 result would advance them both over Italy, but UEFA dismissed the complaint.

The Czech Republic won Group D as the only team to win all three of their group matches. They defeated Latvia 2–1, the Netherlands 3–2, and Germany 2–1. It was another disappointing European campaign for the Germans, who failed to advance from the group stage for the second consecutive time. The Netherlands claimed a quarter-final berth as runners-up.
In the first quarter-final between England and Portugal, the English opened the score after only two minutes through Michael Owen. Portugal&#x27;s constant attacking pressure from then on resulted in Hélder Postiga&#x27;s 83rd-minute equaliser. In the dying minutes, Owen hit the Portuguese crossbar and Sol Campbell headed in the rebound, but the goal was ruled out by referee Urs Meier for a foul on the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo. The sides exchanged goals in extra-time, sending the match to a penalty shoot-out. Portugal won 6–5, as Ricardo saved from Darius Vassell and then scored the winning goal himself.

The Greeks, meanwhile, continued to stun everybody. Firm defensive play and an Angelos Charisteas goal on 65 minutes helped Greece defeat France 1–0 and progress to the semi-finals. This victory made Greece the first team to defeat both the hosts and defending champions in the same tournament. Sweden and the Netherlands played out an exciting but goalless encounter, even after a dramatic period of extra-time in which Freddie Ljungberg hit the inside of the Dutch goalpost. The Dutch progressed after winning the penalty shoot-out 5–4, their first victory on penalties in a major tournament. The last quarter-final match saw the Czechs dispatch Denmark, as a two-goal effort from Milan Baroš helped seal a 3–0 win.
Portugal and the Netherlands faced each other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 with a spectacular goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of the European Championship for the first time. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favourites to take the trophy, having won all four of their games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless until the dying moments of the first half of extra time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.

The final was a repeat of the opening game of the tournament and Portugal were hoping to avenge their defeat. Portugal attacked and dominated possession but once again, sturdy defending and goalkeeping from Greece kept the hosts off the scoreboard. Just before the hour mark, Greece earned a corner kick from which Angelos Charisteas scored. Portugal continued to press after the goal but even with five minutes of stoppage time, they could not find an equaliser. Greece won the match 1–0 and were crowned European champions, a title that they were given odds as long as 150–1 chance of winning before the tournament. All of Greece&#x27;s wins in the knockout stage came in an identical manner: a 1–0 win, with the goal being a header off a cross from the right wing. Portugal became the first host nation to lose in a European Championship final.

==Qualification==

The draw for the qualifying round was held on 25 January 2002 at the Europarque Congress Centre, in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Fifty teams were divided into ten groups of five and each team played two matches against all its opponents, on a home-and-away basis. Qualification matches took place from September 2002 to November 2003. The first-placed teams from each group qualified automatically to the final tournament, whereas the ten runners-up took part in a two-legged play-off to select the remaining five teams that would join the host nation in the final tournament.

===Qualified teams===
Ten of the sixteen finalists participated in the previous tournament in 2000. Latvia made its first appearance in a major football competition, while Greece returned to the European Championship finals after a 24-year absence. Bulgaria, Croatia, Russia and Switzerland also took part in their second tournament finals since their debut in 1996.

As of 2024, this was the last time that Bulgaria qualified for either the World Cup or European Championship finals, the only time that Latvia qualified, as well as the last time that Poland failed to qualify.

===Final draw===
* The group stage draw took place on 30 November 2003 at the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, Portugal, and was televised live: Euro 2004 Draw on BBC Sport.

The 16 qualified finalists were drawn from four seeded pots into four groups. The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored. As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.

The Pot 1 teams were assigned to the first positions of their groups. For the purpose of determining the exact match schedules in each group, the 2nd/3rd/4th group positions were drawn separately for all other teams drawn from pot 2-4. The draw started by using pot 4 to draw one team to each of the four groups in alphabetic order from A to D. This same procedure was followed for pot 3 and pot 2. Finally the three remaining teams from pot 1 were drawn in alphabetic order into group B, C and D.

The draw resulted in the following groups:

==Venues==
The final tournament was played in ten venues located in eight different cities. Lisbon and Porto, the two biggest cities, had two venues each, while Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Faro-Loulé, Guimarães and Leiria had one venue. In order to meet UEFA&#x27;s requirements on venue capacity and infrastructure, six new stadiums were built – Estádio Municipal de Aveiro (Aveiro), Estádio Municipal de Braga (Braga), Estádio Algarve (Faro-Loulé), Estádio da Luz (Lisbon), Estádio José Alvalade (Lisbon) and Estádio do Dragão (Porto) – and four underwent renovation works – Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (Coimbra), Estádio D. Afonso Henriques (Guimarães), Estádio do Bessa (Porto) and Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa (Leiria). The Estádio da Luz was the largest stadium with a tournament capacity of 64,642 seats, and served as the venue for the final. The opening ceremony and match took place at the Estádio do Dragão.

This was the first European Championship where matches took place in more than eight venues since the tournament was expanded to 16 teams in 1996.

The table below lists stadium capacity for the final tournament, which may not correspond to their effective maximum capacity.

===Ticketing===
A total of 1.2 million tickets were available for the 31 matches of the final tournament, of which 77% were to be sold to the general public, and the remainder reserved for sponsors and partners (13%), media (5%), and corporate hospitality (5%). Public sales for an initial batch of 450,000 tickets (38%) were launched on 28 April 2003, in a ceremony in Lisbon which gathered former European football stars Eusébio and Ruud Gullit. Ticket prices were divided in three categories, ranging from €35 (group matches) to €270 (final).

In a first phase lasting until 16 June 2003, supporters could apply for tickets via UEFA&#x27;s tournament website or through forms available at the Portuguese Football Federation and match venues. Applicants could request a maximum of four tickets per match but were limited to one match per day. In parallel to individual match tickets, UEFA created a new category of tickets called &quot;Follow My Team&quot;, which allowed supporters to see all the matches of their favourite team (group stage and, if qualified, knockout stage matches). If there were oversubscribed matches by the end of the first phase of sales, a match-specific draw would take place to select the successful applicants.

Between 1 August and 24 November 2003, available tickets were placed again on sale in a first-come, first-served basis. After the draw for the group stage on 30 November, a third phase of public sales began on 9 December, which included a second batch of tickets (39%) that could be bought until March 2004 through the national associations of the finalist teams. Every national association was awarded 20% of the venue capacity for each of their team&#x27;s matches. From 1 to 30 April 2004, surplus tickets from UEFA or national associations were made available to the public for the last time. Ticket distribution began in May, after sales were officially closed.

===Team base camps===
Each team was provided a base camp for residence and daily training between tournament matches. An initial list of 25 bases approved by the Portuguese Football Federation, following a selection process started in November 2001, was announced by the organisation on 5 February 2003.

==Squads==
Each national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team&#x27;s first match, he would be replaced by another player.

==Match officials==
On 4 December 2003, UEFA revealed the twelve referees and four fourth officials. Each refereeing team was composed by one main referee and two assistant referees from the same country. In April 2004, the UEFA Referees Committee replaced Russian assistant referee Gennady Krasyuk with Yuri Dupanov of Belarus. The switch was made after Krasyuk incorrectly disallowed a second goal from Paul Scholes for offside in the Champions League round of 16 second leg between Manchester United and Porto.

==Group stage==
UEFA announced the match schedule for the final tournament on 10 March 2003, in Porto, Portugal. In a change from the previous tournament schedule, where two quarter-final matches were played per day, over two days, the quarter-finals at the Euro 2004 were to be played over four consecutive days, with one match per day.

&quot;All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:
# Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;
# Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference in all group matches;
# Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
# Higher coefficient derived from 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying (points obtained divided by number of matches played);
# Fair play conduct of the team in the final tournament;
# Drawing of lots.

Euro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shootout as a tiebreaker between two teams in the last round of the group stage, but only if two teams tied on points, goals scored, and conceded played against each other in their final group match and no other team in the group finishes with the same number of points. In the end, no match required the use of this procedure. The same procedure was used in future European Championships tournaments.

==Knockout stage==
The knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament involving the eight teams that advanced from the group stage. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions. Any game in the knockout stage that was not decided by the end of the regular 90 minutes was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves).

For the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner. If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round. The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.

As with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.

&quot;All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).&quot;

===Discipline===
If a player was shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – he would become suspended from playing in his team&#x27;s next match. A player would also become suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated would be cancelled once a team was eliminated from the tournament or reached the semi-finals. In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA could choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension would be required.

The following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:

==Marketing==

===Logo, mascot and official song===

The official tournament logo was created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper agency and unveiled on 13 May 2002 at a ceremony held in Lisbon&#x27;s Belém Cultural Center. It represents a football in the centre of a heart, surrounded by seven green dots. The football – displaying typical Portuguese folk artistic motifs on its panels – and the heart – shaped in the traditional style of the filigree art from Viana do Castelo – conveyed the football passion of the host country. The seven dots represent significant Portuguese elements and achievements, such as the number of castles in the national coat of arms or the conquest of the seven seas during the Age of Discoveries. The logo&#x27;s colour palette was based on the Portuguese flag and its warm tones recall the light and sun associated with the Portuguese landscape and climate. The competition slogan used was &quot;Vive O 2004!&quot; ().

The official mascot was a boy named Kinas – derived from &quot;quinas&quot; (), one of the symbols of the Portuguese coat of arms – who wore a football kit with the Portuguese colours (red shirt and green shorts) and was constantly playing with a football. He possessed the knowledge and talent of generations of highly gifted football players, and embodied the energy and passion of football. Created by Warner Bros., Kinas was officially unveiled on 29 March 2003 at the Casa de Serralves, in Porto, Portugal.

The official song, called &quot;Força&quot; (), was written and performed by Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado. The song was taken from her second studio album, &quot;Folklore&quot;, and released as its third single, soon after the start of the tournament. Furtado was selected to sing the official song of the tournament, because of her familial connection to the host country (her parents are both Portuguese from the Azores). She wrote &quot;Força&quot; with &quot;the passion the Portuguese people have for football&quot; in mind. The song was played at every match, and performed live by Furtado at the closing ceremony prior to the final.

===Match ball===

The official match ball was presented during the final draw ceremony on 30 November 2003 in Lisbon. It was produced by Adidas and named Adidas Roteiro, after the logbook () used by Portuguese maritime explorers such as Vasco da Gama. Roteiro was the first official tournament football to employ the new thermal-bonding technique in its production, which resulted in a seamless surface and a more homogeneous design. Portuguese Football Federation president Gilberto Madaíl praised the ball, stating: &quot;Adidas has delivered a stunning, modern and state-of the-art Portuguese football. This is very much how we envisage the UEFA Euro 2004 event to be&quot;. Roteiro was also used at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, and during the mid-season of the 2004–05 German Bundesliga.

The new ball received mixed reactions from players and technical staffs. England midfielder David Beckham, who was asked by Adidas to test it, was pleased with Roteiro&#x27;s performance, particularly in free-kicks. France midfielder Zinedine Zidane believed the ball would &quot;improve the game&quot;. Several Spanish players, however, regarded it as &quot;horrible, difficult to control and to pass&quot;, with Real Madrid footballer Iván Helguera describing it as a &quot;beach ball&quot;. Notable players of the Italy national team, such as Francesco Totti, Andrea Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon also voiced criticisms.

===Trophy tour===
During the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country. The tour began on 8 April 2004 at the Praça do Comércio in Lisbon, where the launching ceremony took place with the presence of Portuguese football legend and tournament ambassador Eusébio. A total of twenty towns and cities were visited by the trophy tour caravan, including the ten that would host matches.

===Merchandise and memorabilia===
In November 2002, UEFA appointed Warner Bros. Consumer Products (WBCP) as the tournament&#x27;s exclusive worldwide licensing agent. As the global licensing rights owner, WBCP was responsible for negotiating product licence contracts with third parties on the behalf of UEFA and delineate product sales strategies across the host country. Other tasks included setting up and managing marketing plans, product distribution and prices, and prevent illegal use of trademarks and product sales. Over 2,000 merchandise items were developed by the 28 licencees chosen by WBCP, and were distributed not only within Portugal but also in major European and Asian markets.

To celebrate Portugal&#x27;s hosting of the Euro 2004 finals, commemorative coin and stamp collections were issued by the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national mint and printing house, and CTT, the national postal service.

===Sponsorship===
UEFA distinguishes between global sponsors and national sponsors. Global Euro sponsors can come from any country and have together exclusive worldwide sponsorship rights for a UEFA European Football Championship. National sponsors come from the host country and do only have sponsorship rights within that country. Eight sponsors were announced by UEFA in December 2002.

==Broadcasting==
Nineteen cameras were used in each of the ten venues to broadcast the live matches, with three additional cameras in the opening and knockout stage matches.

<text>The Falco F8L is an Italian-designed lightweight 2-seater aerobatic aircraft.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed by the renowned Italian designer Stelio Frati in 1955, with the prototype, powered by a Continental C-90 engine, flying for the first time on 15 June 1955. The prototype was soon re-engined with a Lycoming O-290-D2B, forming the basis for the initial production batch. It was originally built in Italy by Aviamilano then Aeromere and later Laverda. 

The aircraft is single-engined, propeller driven and designed for private and general aviation use. The Falco was sold in kit or plans form for amateur construction by the Sequoia Aircraft Company of Richmond, Virginia from the 1980s until its closure in 2014.
The aircraft is widely considered to be one of the best handling, strongest, and most aesthetically pleasing designs ever made available to home builders. Pilots sometimes refer to the Falco as &quot;the Ferrari of the air.&quot;

Performance includes a 175 knot cruise speed and full aerobatic capability, with an inverted fuel tank an optional item.

The Falco F8L is constructed of spruce and typically Finnish birch plywood. The structure is built from laminated spruce bulkheads and the birch plywood is used for the skin. The plywood is often softened with hot steam, formed over the various structures and glued in place. The aircraft is rated for 6g positive and 3g negative.

Reviewers Roy Beisswenger and Marino Boric described the design in a 2015 review as &quot;a complex all-wooden construction in spruce and plywood and is therefore time-consuming to build. But the results in terms of weight and speed are remarkable., so much so that the Falco is considered a classic, with outstanding performance and handling.&quot;

==Variants==
;F.8L Series I: Initial production model powered by 101 kW (135 hp) Lycoming engine. Ten built by Aviamilano starting in 1956.
;F.8L Series II: Improved model built by Aviamilano, with 112 kW (150 hp) engine. Twenty built.
;F.8L Series III: (Also known as F.8L America) Modified version of Series II built by Aeromere in conformance with US airworthiness requirements. 35 built by Aeromere.
;Super Falco Series IV: Similar to America, but with more powerful engine ( Lycoming O-320-B3) and constant speed propeller. Built by Laverda. Twenty built.
;Sequoia Falco: Similar to the production aircraft but re-designed for homebuilding from kits or plans, by Alfred Scott of Sequoia Aircraft Company and David Thurston of Lake Buccaneer fame.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. An organisation of painters of metals and wood is known to have existed as early as 1283. A similar organisation of stainers, who generally worked on staining cloth for decorative wall hangings, existed as early as 1400. The two bodies merged in 1502; the new organisation was incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1581.

Today, the company is less an association of painters and more a charitable company, with the promotion of education in the fine and decorative arts and crafts as its main theme. The Painters&#x27; Company Scholarship Scheme was established in 2012 to support undergraduates every year at London Art Colleges. Each student receives £5,000 annually from the beginning of their second year until they complete their studies, and they are known as a Painters&#x27; Company Scholar. The students are selected entirely on merit, and this is the most meritocratically awarded scholarship for art students in London today.

The Painters Company also co-sponsors one of the largest UK open art competitions: the Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize was created in 2005 by the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers and the Lynn Foundation to encourage the very best creative representational painting and promote the skill of draftsmanship. It awards prize money of £30,000.

Twelve Liverymen have held the office of Lord mayor of London since 1922.

The Company ranks twenty-eighth in the order of precedence of livery companies. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Amor Queat Obedientiam&quot;, Latin for &quot;Love Can Compel Obedience&quot;.

The Master for the year ensuing 19 October 2015 is Anthony John Ward, son of the late Liveryman and scribe to the company, John Ward. The Clerk is Alice Pearson.

The livery company&#x27;s hall is situated between Huggin Hill and Little Trinity Lane, in the ward of Queenhithe.

<doc id="372786" wikidata="Q1581658" url="?curid=372786" title="Worshipful Company of Curriers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Curriers is one of the ancient livery companies of London, associated with the leather trade.

The curriers, or &quot;curers of leather&quot;, of London formed an organisation in 1272; this merchant guild was recognised in 1415 by Ordinances of the City Common Council before its grant of a Royal Charter by King James I in 1605. The company now exists, as do most other livery companies, as an education and charitable institution, the traditional process of currying having been made more or less obsolete by technological advances. The Curriers&#x27; Company, like other livery companies, supports the work of the Lord Mayor, the City Corporation and the Sheriffs of London.

The company ranks 29th in the order of precedence of City livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Spes Nostra Deus&quot;, Latin for &quot;Our Hope is God&quot;.

Most of the Curriers&#x27; Company archives are kept at the Guildhall Library for public view.

==History==
The Curriers&#x27; Company dates from 1272 when the &quot;Art or Mystery of Curriers&quot; formed a trade association with the tanners. In the 14th century the Curriers constituted themselves into a guild linked with the religious fraternity of Carmelite Friars near Fleet Street. In 1415 the City Common Council granted them full autonomy over all currying and tanning trade in and within two miles of the city. Before 1580 the &quot;Guild of Curriers&quot; was recognised as a City livery company and became armigerous in 1583, although, not until 1605 did the Curriers&#x27; Company receive its Royal Charter of Incorporation from King James I.

During the ensuing four centuries the company built no less than six Curriers&#x27; halls in London. After the sale of its sixth and last hall in 1921 it moved in with its longstanding trade and livery partner, the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, with which it maintains a close relationship. Along with many other livery halls, Cordwainers&#x27; Hall in Cannon Street was itself destroyed by enemy action in 1941 and since then the Curriers have been without their own hall. However, from 1942 onwards the company has been housed at Tallow Chandlers&#x27; Hall, where it holds its Court meetings. Historically several streets in the now London Borough of Camden&#x27;s environs were named after the currying trade, &quot;eg.&quot; Curriers&#x27; Alley, Curriers&#x27; Lane, &quot;etc&quot;.

==Charitable activity==
The Curriers&#x27; Company donates to charities which benefit the young, the elderly, the disabled and the socially disadvantaged. It primarily supports City of London charities and cultural organisations, general educational establishments and the training of young people in leathercraft.

The educational institutions which it regularly assists financially include: the London College of Fashion; Capel Manor College Enfield and Northampton University&#x27;s Leather Conservation Centre; these foster the conservation, creation and restoration of leather objects and materials.
In 2000 the Curriers&#x27; Millennium Healthcare Bursary was established. This annual bursary endows research or personal study to improve the health care of underprivileged sectors of London&#x27;s population or elsewhere. Though originally directed towards general practitioners, the scope of the bursary was widened in 2003, since when it has also attracted submissions from dentists, pharmacists, nurses, midwives, mental health workers and an ophthalmologist.

The Curriers&#x27; Company London History Essay Prize on the history of London is competed for by young graduates of British universities; endowed by Donald Adamson (Master Currier, 2012–13), it is assessed by the Institute of Historical Research and presented annually by the Lord Mayor. The Company also presents 16 annual prizes in mathematics and history for pupils aged 14 to 15 at the four London academies of the Oasis Trust.

Annually, each newly elected Master Currier has the option of designating a charity of choice: Master&#x27;s Charitable Appeal. The Master and Company make initial donations: liverymen, freemen and others are invited to follow suit. The Company encourages any enterprise which supports its charitable giving.

The Curriers&#x27; Company is affiliated to military units in HM Armed Forces: 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal); No. 7 Squadron RAF; and, Cambridge URNU.

The present Clerk to the Curriers&#x27; Company is former diplomat Giles Whitaker, whose role combines that of executive officer as well as supporting the Master: Piers Williamson (&quot;for&quot; 2024/25). The Company&#x27;s Honorary Chaplain is The Venerable Roger Preece.

==Former halls==
(1) In 1485 the Curriers&#x27; Company had its hall in the parish of St Mary Axe, by London Wall in Aldgate Ward.

(2) Circa 1583 the Curriers&#x27; Hall was situated close to the site of the Boar&#x27;s Head Inn, on a property which had been devised to the company in 1516. It stood in the parish of St Alphege, on the south side of the street leading along London Wall; Boar&#x27;s Head Alley lay between Philip Lane and Little Wood Street. Curriers&#x27; Hall was one of the 44 (out of 52) livery halls destroyed in the Great Fire of London early in September 1666.

(3) Curriers&#x27; Hall in 1670 was perhaps the most attractive of the company&#x27;s five halls on the Boar&#x27;s Head site.

(4) In 1820 a new and smaller hall was rebuilt to the east of the old one.

(5) The Curriers&#x27; Hall begun in 1873 and completed in the following year extravagantly was demolished in 1875 before it could even be furnished.

(6) Between 1874 and 1876 a new Curriers&#x27; Hall was built in the French Gothic style. It abutted on London Wall. It was sold in 1921 and destroyed by enemy action on 29 December 1940.

<text>The sika deer (Cervus nippon), also known as the northern spotted deer or the Japanese deer, is a species of deer native to much of East Asia and introduced to other parts of the world. Previously found from northern Vietnam in the south to the Russian Far East in the north, it was hunted to the brink of extinction in the 19th century. Protection laws were enacted in the mid-20th century, leading to a rapid recovery of their population from the 1950s to the 1980s.

== Etymology ==
Its name comes from , the Japanese word for &quot;deer&quot;. In Japan, the species is known as the . In Chinese, it is known as due to the spots resembling plum blossoms.

==Taxonomy==
The sika deer is a member of the genus &quot;Cervus&quot;, a group of deer also known as the &quot;true&quot; deer, within the larger deer family, Cervidae. Formerly, sika were grouped together in this genus with nine other diverse species; these animals have since been found to be genetically different, and reclassified elsewhere under different genera. Currently, deer species within the genus &quot;Cervus&quot; are the sika, the red deer (&quot;C. elaphus&quot;) of Scotland, Eurasia and Northern Africa (introduced in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand), and the wapiti, or elk (&quot;C. canadensis&quot;), of North America, Siberia and North-Central Asia.

DNA evidence indicates that the species formerly placed under &quot;Cervus&quot; are not as closely related as once thought, resulting in the creation of several new genera. The ancestor of all &quot;Cervus&quot; species probably originated in Central Asia and possibly resembled the sika deer. Members of this genus can crossbreed and produce hybrids in areas where they coexist. This includes sika and wapiti; in the Scottish Highlands, the interbreeding of native Scottish red deer with introduced sika has been deemed a serious threat to the gene pool of the Scottish deer. However, by comparison, an invasive sika deer in the United States cannot reproduce with a North American white-tailed, mule or black-tailed deer, all of which are placed in a separate genus, &quot;Odocoileus&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Serious genetic pollution has occurred in many populations, especially in China, so the status of many subspecies remains unclear. The status of &quot;C. n. hortulorum&quot; is particularly uncertain and might in fact be of mixed origin, hence it is not listed here.

*&quot;C. n. aplodontus&quot;, northern Honshu
*&quot;C. n. grassianus&quot;, Shanxi, China
*&quot;C. n. keramae&quot;, Kerama Islands of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan
*&quot;C. n. kopschi&quot;, southern China
*&quot;C. n. mandarinus&quot;, northern and northeastern China
*&quot;C. n. mantchuricus&quot;, northeastern China, Korea, and Russian Far East
*&quot;C. n. nippon&quot; (type species), southern Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu
*&quot;C. n. pseudaxis&quot;, northern Vietnam
*&quot;C. n. pulchellus&quot;, Tsushima Island
*&quot;C. n. sichuanicus&quot;, western China
*†&quot;C. n. sintikuensis&quot;, Taiwan
*&quot;C. n. soloensis&quot;, Southern Philippines (anciently introduced to Jolo island; of unknown subspecies origin, probably extinct)
*&quot;C. n. taiouanus&quot;, Taiwan
*&quot;C. n. yakushimae&quot;, Yakushima, Japan
*&quot;C. n. yesoensis&quot;, Hokkaido, Japan

==Description==
The sika deer is one of the few deer species that does not lose its spots upon reaching maturity. Spot patterns vary with region. The mainland subspecies have larger and more obvious spots, in contrast to the Taiwanese and Japanese subspecies, whose spots are nearly invisible. Many introduced populations are from Japan, so they also lack significant spots.

The color of the pelage ranges from mahogany to black, and white individuals are also known. During winter, the coat becomes darker and shaggier and the spots less prominent, and a mane forms on the back of the males&#x27; necks. They are medium-sized herbivores, though they show notable size variation across their several subspecies and considerable sexual dimorphism, with males invariably much larger than females. They can vary from tall at the shoulder and from in head-and-body length. The tail measures about long.

The largest subspecies is the Manchurian sika deer (&quot;C. n. mantchuricus&quot;), in which males commonly weigh about and females weigh , with large stags scaling up to , although there had been records of Yezo sika deer bulls weighing up to . On the other end of the size spectrum, in the Japanese sika deer (&quot;C. n. nippon&quot;), males weigh and females weigh . All sikas are compact and dainty-legged, with short, trim, wedge-shaped heads and a boisterous disposition. When alarmed, they often display a distinctive flared rump, much like the American elk.

Sika stags have stout, upright antlers with an extra buttress up from the brow tine and a very thick wall. A forward-facing intermediate tine breaks the line to the top, which is usually forked. Occasionally, sika antlers develop some palmation (flat areas). Females carry a pair of distinctive black bumps on the forehead. Antlers can range from to more than , depending on the subspecies. Stags also have distinctive manes during their mating period (rut).

These deer have well-developed metatarsal and preorbital glands. The volatile components of these glands were examined from a free-ranging female. The metatarsal gland contained 35 compounds: long-chain carboxylic acids, straight-chain aldehydes, long-chain alcohols, a ketone, and cholesterol. The components of the preorbital gland were C14 through C18 straight and branched-chain fatty acids.

==Behavior==

Sika deer can be active throughout the day, though in areas with heavy human disturbance, they tend to be nocturnal. Seasonal migration is known to occur in mountainous areas, such as Japan, with winter ranges being up to lower in elevation than summer ranges.

Lifestyles vary between individuals, with some occurring alone while others are found in single-sex groups. Large herds gather in autumn and winter. Males spend most years alone occasionally forming herds together. Females with fawns only form herds during birthing season. The sika deer is a highly vocal species, with over 10 individual sounds, ranging from soft whistles to loud screams.

Sika males are territorial and keep harems of females during their rut, which peaks from early September through November, but may last well into the winter. Territory size varies with habitat type and size of the buck; strong, prime bucks may hold up to . Territories are marked by a series of shallow pits or &quot;scrapes&quot;, which is digging holes (up to 1.6 m in wide and 0.3 m in deep) with forefeet or antlers, into which the males urinate and from which emanates a strong, musky odor. Fights between rival males for territorial disputes, which occur by using hooves and antlers, are sometimes fierce and long and may even be fatal.

The gestation period lasts for seven months. Hinds (does) give birth to a single fawn, weighing , which is nursed for up to ten months. The mother hides her fawn in thick undergrowth immediately after giving birth, and the fawn stays very quiet and still while it waits until the mother returns to nurse it. The fawn becomes independent 10 to 12 months after birth, and attains sexual maturity at 16 to 18 months in both sexes. The average lifespan is 15 to 18 years in captivity, although one case is recorded as living 25 years and 5 months.

The sika deer may interbreed with the red deer, the closest relative; hybrid descendants may have adaptive advantages over purebred relatives.

In Nara Prefecture, Japan, the deer are also known as &quot;bowing deer&quot;, as they bow their heads before being fed special . However, deer bow heads to signal that they are about to headbutt. Therefore, when a human &quot;bows&quot; to a deer, the deer may take it as a challenge, and will assume the same stance before charging and attempting to headbutt the person. Deer headbutt both for play and to assert dominance, as do goats. Sika deer are found throughout the city of Nara and its many parks and temples like Tōdai-ji, as they are considered to be the messengers of the Shinto gods.

==Habitat==

Sika deer are found in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, preferring areas with dense understory, and where snowfall does not exceed . They tend to forage in patchy clearings of forests. Introduced populations are found in areas with similar habitats to their native ranges, including Western and Central Europe, Eastern United States, and New Zealand.

==Population==
Sika deer inhabit temperate and subtropical woodlands, often in areas suitable for farming and other human exploitation. Their range encompasses some of the most densely populated areas in the world, where forests were cleared hundreds of years ago. Their population status varies significantly in different countries. Although the species as a whole is thriving, it is endangered and extinct in many areas.

Japan has by far the largest native sika population in the world. The population was estimated to be between 170,000 and 330,000 individuals in 1993, mainly due to recent conservation efforts and the extinction of its main predator, the Japanese wolf (&quot;Canis lupus hodophilax&quot;), over a century ago. Without its main predator, the population of sika exploded and it is now overpopulated in many areas, posing a threat to both forests and farmlands. Efforts are now being made to control its population instead of conserving it. None of its subspecies is endangered except the Kerama deer (&quot;C. n. keramae&quot;) on the tiny Kerama Islands.
In 2015, Japanese Ministry of the Environment estimated the population at 3,080,000 in Japan, including Hokkaido.

China used to have the largest population of sika, but thousands of years of hunting and habitat loss have reduced the population to less than 1,000. Of the five subspecies in China, the North China sika deer (&quot;C. n. mandarinus&quot;) is believed to be extinct in the wild since the 1930s; the Shanxi sika deer (&quot;C. n. grassianus&quot;) has not been seen in the wild since the 1980s and is also believed to be extinct in the wild. The status of Manchurian sika deer in China is unclear, though it is also believed to be extinct, and the sightings there are actually feral populations.

The South China sika deer (&quot;C. n. kopschi&quot;) and Sichuan sika deer (&quot;C. n. sichuanicus&quot;) are the only subspecies known to remain in the wild in China. The former exists in fragmented populations of around 300 in southeast China, while the latter is found in a single population of over 400. The feral population is likely to be much higher than the wild, though most of them are descended from domesticated sikas of mixed subspecies. All of the subspecies are present in captivity, but a lack of suitable habitats and government efforts prevent their reintroduction.

The Formosan sika deer (&quot;C. n. taioanus&quot;) has been extinct in the wild for almost two decades before individuals from zoos were introduced to Kenting National Park; the population now numbers 200. Reintroduction programs are also under way in Vietnam, where the Vietnamese sika deer (&quot;C. n. pseudaxis&quot;) is extinct or nearly so.

Russia has a relatively large and stable population of 8,500–9,000 individuals of the Manchurian subspecies, but this is limited to a small area in Primorsky Krai. Small populations might exist in North Korea, but the political situation makes investigation impossible. The original stock of sika deer in South Korea is extinct, with only captive stock raised for medicine from other parts of the deer&#x27;s habitat. But in June 2020, an unmanned camera located a doe and fawn which might hold proof for Korea&#x27;s last native sika deer, although the claim is contested.

===Introduced populations===
Sika deer have been introduced into a number of other countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Russia, Romania, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines (Jolo Island), Poland, Sweden, Finland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States (in Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Maine, New York, Texas, and Wyoming). In many cases, they were originally introduced as ornamental animals in parklands, but have established themselves in the wild. On Spieden Island in the San Juan Islands of Washington, they were introduced as a game animal.

In the UK and Ireland, several distinct feral populations now exist, in addition to about 1000 individuals in deer parks. Some of these are in isolated areas, for example on the island of Lundy, but others are contiguous with populations of the native red deer. Since the two species sometimes hybridize, a serious conservation concern exists. In research which rated the negative impact of introduced mammals in Europe, the sika deer was found to be among the most damaging to the environment and economy, along with the brown rat and muskrat.

In the 1900s, King Edward VII presented a pair of sika deer to John, the second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. This pair escaped into Sowley Wood and were the basis of the sika to be found in the New Forest today. They were so prolific, culling had to be introduced in the 1930s to control their numbers.

==Hunting==
Across its original range and in many areas to which it has been introduced, the sika is regarded as a particularly prized and elusive sportsman&#x27;s quarry. In Britain, Ireland, and mainland Europe, sika display very different survival strategies and escape tactics from the indigenous deer. They have a marked tendency to use concealment in circumstances when red deer, for example, would flee, and have been seen to squat and lie belly-flat when danger threatens.

In the British Isles, sika are widely regarded as a serious threat to new and established woodlands, and public and private forestry bodies adopt policies of rigorous year-round culling.

The main predators of sika deer include tigers, wolves, leopards, and brown bears. Lynx and golden eagles target fawns.

==Velvet antler==
Velvet antler (dried immature antlers) is a popular ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, and sika in China were domesticated long ago for the antler trade, along with several other species. In Taiwan, both Formosan sika deer and Formosan sambar deer (&quot;Cervus unicolor swinhoei&quot;) have been farmed for velvet antlers. Japan is the only country in eastern Asia where sika deer were not farmed for velvet antlers.

Other deer raised for the antler trade were Thorold&#x27;s deer (&quot;Cervus albirostris&quot;), central Asian red deer (&quot;Cervus canadensis affinis&quot;), and American elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis canadensis&quot;).

==Cultural significance==
In Shinto, the &quot;Shika&quot; Deer is considered a kind of messenger between mortals and the &quot;kami&quot;.

<text>Farringdon () is an interchange station located in Clerkenwell, London, England, in the London Borough of Islington, just outside the boundary of the City of London for London Underground, Elizabeth line and National Rail services.

The station is served by the London Underground&#x27;s Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines between and stations, the Elizabeth line between and stations, and the Thameslink route between and . 

Opened in 1863 as the terminus of the Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground passenger railway, Farringdon is one of the oldest surviving underground railway stations in the world.

==History==

The station was opened on 10 January 1863 as the terminus of the original Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground metro line. The station, initially named Farringdon Street, was originally a short distance from the present station building. The line ran from the Farringdon area to , a distance of .

The station was relocated on 23 December 1865 when the Metropolitan Railway opened an extension to Moorgate. It was renamed Farringdon &amp; High Holborn on 26 January 1922 when the new building by the architect Charles Walter Clark facing Cowcross Street was opened, and its present name was adopted on 21 April 1936. It was built in conjunction with a freight station to take livestock to a slaughterhouse to its south-east to supply Smithfield Market; remains of cattle ramps on a street outside the market, West Smithfield. Smithfield was redesignated as a wholesale &#x27;deadmeat&#x27; market in the 19th century and the freight station was last used in the 1920s.
The lines from Farringdon towards King&#x27;s Cross St. Pancras run alongside the Fleet ditch, culverted since 1734. The station building is unusually well-preserved early 20th-century London Underground architecture. It retains indications of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s main-line style operation such as a sign for a parcel office on the outer wall and some original signage, with the 1922–1936 name on the facade.

After the bay platforms at closed on 21 March 2009, Southeastern services that previously terminated at Blackfriars were extended to , St. Albans, Luton or Bedford, calling at this station. Thameslink trains to Moorgate ceased at the same time.

===Recent and current developments===
Farringdon has recently received significant upgrades to allow it to meet the needs of a series of major rail upgrade projects: The Thameslink Programme was a major upgrade to the existing north-south Thameslink route, enabling longer and more frequent trains, completed in 2018; and the Four Lines Modernisation involves the wholesale resignalling of the London Underground&#x27;s sub-surface lines bringing a major boost in capacity to Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan line services calling at Farringdon. In addition the station has been significantly expanded to serve as a stop on the new east-west Elizabeth line providing interchange between Thameslink and the Elizabeth line.

Once all these projects have been completed, Farringdon will be one of the country&#x27;s busiest stations with approximately 200 , an average of one departure every 20 seconds. A new building, housing a dedicated ticket hall, has been constructed to serve these extra passengers. The new building is to the immediate south of the original station, which itself has been upgraded as part of the programme.

An additional entrance has also been built at the north end of the original station, onto Turnmill Street.

====Thameslink upgrade====

Farringdon Station has been rebuilt to accommodate longer Thameslink trains and to make other improvements to the station. The existing station building has been refurbished with a new roof canopy covering the north end of all four platforms and a new entrance and concourse facing Turnmill Street. An additional ticket hall has been built on the south side of Cowcross Street providing access to the Thameslink platforms, which have been extended southwards underneath this building, allowing the station to handle 240 m (12-carriage) trains. Platforms have been widened to accommodate increased passenger numbers. This process required the bridge that formed Cowcross Street to be demolished and rebuilt. Cowcross Street is now pedestrianised. Lifts have been provided throughout.

The existing listed ticket hall and concourse have been remodelled, for use by London Underground and Thameslink passengers. Interchange within the station has been improved by removing the interchange bridge and installing new stairs and lifts with access to all four platforms, allowing passengers with impaired mobility to use the station.

It was necessary to build the Thameslink platform extensions to the south, since there is a sharp gradient to the immediate north of the station. This resulted in the two-station branch to Moorgate being permanently closed. The platform extensions cross the former Moorgate line and reach within a few metres of the entrance of the Snow Hill Tunnel. The alternative of realigning both the Thameslink and Circle/Hammersmith &amp; City/Metropolitan lines was impractical as the latter crosses over the former on a bridge almost immediately to the north of the station.

====Elizabeth line====
The Farringdon Elizabeth line station was built as part of the Crossrail project. It lies between Farringdon and Underground stations and has interchanges with both of them. Access at the Farringdon end is via the new Thameslink ticket hall. Work was anticipated to be completed in 2018, but the scheduled opening date was delayed.

From 24 May 2022 the new railway line linked Farringdon to Abbey Wood via Canary Wharf in the east and Paddington, in the west. The station is also a hub for cross-London travel, being the only station to be on both the north-south Thameslink service and the east-west Elizabeth line service.

Direct Elizabeth line services between Reading/Heathrow in the west and Shenfield (via Whitechapel and Stratford) started in late 2022.

==Dual traction current supply==

Thameslink trains switch between the 25 kV AC overhead supply used to the north of London and the 750 V DC third rail supply used to the south whilst standing at the platform. The trains that formerly ran to Moorgate used 25 kV AC throughout their journeys. This project was installed by the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail in May 1988.

Until the start of the Thameslink Programme southbound trains that were unable to switch to DC were taken out of service at Farringdon and stabled at Moorgate to prevent them from blocking the core section of the Thameslink route. As this option is no longer possible the catenary has been extended to City Thameslink to enable these trains to continue to the southbound platform at City Thameslink using AC and then return northwards using the new crossover in Snow Hill Tunnel. The pantograph on southbound trains is normally lowered at Farringdon.

Underground trains serving Farringdon use the four-rail 630 V DC system.
==Artwork==
On the London Underground concourse, a memorial to Edward Johnston (the creator of the eponymous London Underground typeface) was designed by Fraser Muggeridge. Consisting of the letters of the alphabet in wood type set in Johnston, the memorial was unveiled by Sir Peter Hendy in 2019.

As part of the Crossrail Art Programme, two artworks were commissioned from British artist Simon Periton. At the eastern entrance, the exterior glass of the station is printed with patterns echoing the Victorian ironmongery of the Smithfield Market located opposite the station entrance. At the western entrance, the glazing alongside the escalators are printed with giant diamonds, referencing the jewellers located nearby in Hatton Garden.

<text>The Apollo Theater (formerly the Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s New Theatre; also Apollo Theatre or 125th Street Apollo Theatre) is a multi-use theater at 253 West 125th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. It is a popular venue for black American performers and is the home of the TV show &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;. The theater, which has approximately 1,500 seats across three levels, was designed by George Keister with elements of the neoclassical style. The facade and interior of the theater are New York City designated landmarks and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nonprofit Apollo Theater Foundation (ATF) operates the theater, as well as two smaller auditoriums at the Victoria Theater and a recording studio at the Apollo.

The Apollo was developed by Jules Hurtig and Harry Seamon as a burlesque venue, which opened in 1913 and originally served only white patrons. In 1928, the Minsky brothers leased the theater for burlesque shows. Sidney Cohen acquired the theater in 1934, and it became a venue for black performers. Frank Schiffman and his family operated the theater from 1935 to 1976. A group of black businessmen briefly operated the theater from 1978 to 1979, and former Manhattan borough president Percy Sutton bought it at an auction in 1981. The Apollo reopened in 1985 following a major refurbishment that saw the construction of new recording studios. In September 1991, the New York State Urban Development Corporation bought the Apollo and assigned its operation to the ATF. Further renovations took place in the mid-2000s, and an expansion of the theater commenced in the 2020s.

Among the theater&#x27;s longest-running events is Amateur Night at the Apollo, a weekly show where audiences judge the quality of novice performances. Many of the theater&#x27;s most famous performers are inducted in the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame, and the theater has commissioned various works and hosted educational programs. Over the years, the theater has hosted many musical, dance, theatrical, and comedy acts, with several performers often featured on the same bill. In addition, the theater has hosted film screenings, recordings, and tapings, as well as non-performance events such as speeches, debates, and tributes. The Apollo has had a large impact on African-American culture and has been featured in multiple books and shows.

==Site==
The Apollo Theater is located at 253 West 125th Street, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (Seventh Avenue) and Frederick Douglass Boulevard (Eighth Avenue), in the Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. The irregular land lot has frontage on both 125th Street to the south and 126th Street to the north. The site covers , with a frontage of on 125th Street and a depth of . The theater is adjacent to the Victoria Theater to the west. Several MTA Regional Bus Operations routes stop outside the theater, while the New York City Subway&#x27;s 125th Street/St. Nicholas Avenue station, served by the , is located one block to the west.

== Design ==
The theater was designed by George Keister with elements of the neoclassical style. It was one of several theaters that Keister designed in that style, along with the Belasco Theatre, Bronx Opera House, Selwyn Theater, and Earl Carroll Theatre.

=== Facade ===
The theater&#x27;s main facade is on the south, toward 125th Street, and is three stories high. The ground floor has been renovated several times and consists of a ticket office to the west and a storefront to the east. The modern design of the ground floor dates to a renovation completed in 2005. The eastern side of the ground floor contains a glass-and-steel storefront, with monitors installed in place of the original display cases. The modern-day box office is a semicircular steel structure that protrudes outward.

The second and third stories are made of white glazed terracotta, which dates from the theater&#x27;s opening in 1914. A cornice with dentils runs horizontally across the facade just below the second floor. The second- and third-story windows are arranged vertically into four bays. The bays are separated by three fluted pilasters topped by capitals in the Ionic order, and there is a paneled pilaster with Tuscan capitals outside each of the outermost bays. The capitals of all five pilasters contain anthemia. Within each bay, the second and third floors each contain a square window and are separated by spandrel panels with shields and fluting. Above the third-story windows are spandrels with Greek fret designs, as well as a metal cornice with modillions.

A steel marquee was added above the ground floor in the 1940s; it stretched half the width of the facade and bore the name &quot;Apollo&quot; on its two side elevations. The marquee displayed letters with the name of the entertainer who were performing that night. Jack Schiffman, the son of former theater owner Frank Schiffman, recalled that the marquee also displayed various additional signs or movie posters. A vertical sign with the name &quot;Apollo&quot; was erected near the western end of the facade in the 1940s. A modern marquee with LEDs, resembling the original marquee, was installed in 2005. At the same time, the original vertical sign was replaced with the current yellow-and-red blade sign.

=== Interior ===
The theater has an L-shaped plan, with a narrow lobby leading to the main entrance on 125th Street, as well as the auditorium at the rear on 126th Street. Although the interior underwent several modifications in the mid-20th century, many of the 1910s-era decorations remained intact in 1983. The theater&#x27;s original decorative features were preserved during the mid-1980s renovation.

==== Lobby ====
The main lobby is a long and narrow space; some observers, including Jack Schiffman, have likened it to a bowling alley. The space was modified significantly in the 1930s and again in the 1960s, and the lobby was enlarged in the late 1970s. Following another renovation in 2006, the Tree of Hope, a stump that performers rubbed for good luck, was moved to the lobby.

The lobby occupies the western half of the ground level frontage on 125th Street; the eastern half of the frontage houses a store. The original main lobby had a group of murals. By the early 1970s, the lobby had been redecorated with a montage of notable entertainers who appeared at the Apollo. There was also a ticket office and box office on one wall of the lobby. The modern-day lobby has two staircases, which lead to the first and second balconies of the auditorium. The space is illuminated by four grand chandeliers. There is a gift shop near the entrance. , a cafe is planned to be built within the lobby; it is expected to open in 2025.

==== Auditorium ====
The auditorium is at the north end of the building and is rectangular in plan, with curved walls, a domed ceiling, and two balcony levels over the orchestra level. The Apollo Theater was cited as having 2,000 seats in the 1930s and 1,700 seats in the 1970s; it was described in 1985 as having 1,500 or 1,550 seats. By the early 2010s, the theater had 1,536 seats. The seats were refurbished in the 1980s and again in 2006, when wide cranberry-colored seats were installed. The bottom of each row of seats is illuminated by aisle lighting. In addition, there is a seating area for disabled patrons. On each level, the seats are divided by two central aisles. As part of a 2024 renovation, the Apollo Theater Foundation planned to add 29 seats on the orchestra level.

The rear (western) end of the orchestra contains a standing rail with scagliola. Scagliola decorations, composed of scrolls supporting a triangular pediment, are also placed around the doorways on the rear wall of the orchestra. Fluted columns on the orchestra level support the first balcony; the lower parts of the columns are devoid of ornamentation. The orchestra is raked, sloping down toward an orchestra pit in front of the stage. The front walls of the auditorium flank a flat proscenium opening in the center.

The balconies are also raked and contain similar scagliola decorations to the orchestra level. The balconies&#x27; fronts have brass handrails and are decorated with plasterwork motifs. At the first balcony are square columns supporting the second balcony. The second balcony was described by author James V. Hatch as &quot;the bird&#x27;s nest&quot;, since audiences in the second balcony could see the entire theater. On either side of the proscenium are two boxes each on the first and second balcony levels, which are accessed by their own staircases and are housed within round-arched openings. The spandrels above the arches contain classical motifs, and the boxes have varying amounts of decorations. The proscenium arch has a surround with colonnettes on either side of the arch and a molded band and entablature running atop it. The surround and entablature both contain decorative plaster motifs.

Above the boxes and the proscenium arch is a cornice with large dentils, as well as a plaster frieze decorated with foliate motifs. The ceiling is slightly coved at its edge. At the center of the ceiling is a semicircular dome with a medallion surrounded by a molding of cornucopia. The theater was mechanically advanced for its time, with a ventilation system to remove cigarette smoke, as well as electric lights. The ventilation system was rebuilt when the theater was renovated in the 1980s, and lighting trusses were added at that time.

==== Other spaces ====
In addition to the main auditorium, the ground floor had a store to the east of the lobby. There originally was a cafe and cabaret in the basement, which served as a rehearsal space and was converted into a staff recreation room in the 1940s. In addition, there were a ladies&#x27; parlor and men&#x27;s smoking room, which were enlarged in the 1940s. The second story originally had a dining room, while the third story had meeting rooms and lofts. By the 1980s, the second and third floors were being used as storage space and offices, with small rooms on both stories. The third floor also has a sound stage; to accommodate this use, the windows on that story were covered up in 1985.

When the Apollo Theater was developed, the dressing rooms were placed in a separate annex with showers and baths. The dressing rooms are simple in design. There is a wall of signatures in the dressing room. The Apollo&#x27;s historian Billy Mitchell said in 2012, &quot;Anyone who&#x27;s been to or performed at the Apollo in the last 20 years has their name on the wall—from Pee-wee Herman to the president of the United States&quot;.

A production studio for TV broadcasts and video productions was constructed on top of an adjacent wing during the 1980s. The studio is variously cited as covering , , or . It could record 24 tracks at once and was equipped with 96 microphone lines connecting with the auditorium. The studio has been used by media companies such as advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Black Entertainment Television.

==History==
In the late 19th century, Harlem was developed as a suburb of New York City and was inhabited largely by upper-middle-class whites. Black residents began moving to Harlem in the beginning of the 20th century with the development of row houses, apartments, and the city&#x27;s first subway line. By the early 20th century the neighborhood had several vaudeville, burlesque, film, and legitimate theaters centered around 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, which led to the corridor being known as &quot;Harlem&#x27;s 42nd Street&quot;. Among the operators of these early theaters were theatrical producers Jules Hurtig and Harry Seamon, who leased the Harlem Music Hall at 209 West 125th Street in 1897. Hurtig and Seamon produced several shows starring black superstars Bert Williams and George Walker between 1898 and 1905. The Music Hall was converted to burlesque 1911.

==== Development and early years ====
C. J. Stumpf &amp; H. J. Langhoff of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, acquired land on 125th and 126th Street from the Cromwell estate and Lit family around 1911 or 1912. They announced plans in June 1912 for a three-story commercial structure at 253 to 259 West 125th Street, with a 2,500-seat burlesque theater in the rear, at 240 to 260 West 126th Street. Hurtig and Seamon, who had been leasing the nearby Harlem Music Hall, wanted a larger venue to accommodate the burlesque productions of the Columbia Amusement Company, which they had joined, and were set to lease the theater for 30 years for a total of $1.375 million; the theater itself would cost $200,000. Work could not begin until the existing leases on the site expired the following May. Stumpf and Langhoff hired Keister to design the theater, while either Cramp &amp; Company or the Security Construction Company was hired as the general contractor. One local real-estate investor wrote that the theater was to be &quot;the most important new work for the immediate future&quot; on that block of 125th Street.

A groundbreaking ceremony occurred in January 1913, at which point it was known as Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s New (Burlesque) Theater. Local real-estate journal &quot;Harlem Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;The theatre when completed will add in no small degree to the appearance and prosperity of this locality.&quot; The theater hosted its first Columbia show on Dec. 17, 1913. Hurtig &amp; Seamon initially employed female ushers, described by &quot;Variety&quot; magazine as &quot;all good-looking and polite girls&quot;, and banned black patrons. Initially, the theater also hosted movies during the summer when burlesque was on hiatus, as well as other events such as benefits and fundraisers. A stock burlesque company composed of numerous Broadway performers was established at the theater in 1917.

Beginning in 1920, Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s New Theatre faced competition from the nearby Mount Morris Theatre on 116th Street, which featured shows on the American wheel, a lower-tier Columbia subsidiary. The American wheel was dissolved in 1922 and the New Theatre retained its monopoly on Columbia burlesque in Upper Manhattan. The growth of Harlem&#x27;s black population forced many theater owners to begin admitting black patrons in the 1920s, though Jamaican-American author Joel Augustus Rogers claimed that the New Theatre&#x27;s black patrons were consistently given inferior seats. The New Theatre began sponsoring shows with mixed-race casts in the middle of that decade, and Hurtig &amp; Seamon also planned to produce shows with all-black casts. The theater building was sold in August 1925 to the Benenson Realty Company, though Hurtig &amp; Seamon continued to operate the theater. That year, the theater&#x27;s orchestra was expanded, and a runway was introduced. As Columbia burlesque withered in 1926, Hurtig &amp; Seamon elected to present stock burlesque in 1927, then, later that year, switched allegiance to the Mutual Burlesque Association.

==== Minsky years ====
Following Hurtig&#x27;s death in early 1928, Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s New Theater was leased that May to the Minsky brothers and their partner, Joseph Weinstock, who had been staging burlesque shows at a small theater above the Harlem Opera House named the Apollo. Seamon, along with I. H. Herk, retained an interest in the New Theater. As part of the agreement, the New Theater was renamed Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s Apollo, and the Harlem Opera House and the former Apollo within it were restricted from staging burlesque, vaudeville, musical comedy, or &quot;tab shows&quot; as long as Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s Apollo staged burlesque. In exchange, the latter theater could not show movies.

Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s Apollo reopened in August 1928 after the Minskys renovated the lobby, repainted the auditorium, and extended the runway at orchestra level. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that Walter Reade had leased the new Apollo for years, but Billy Minsky bought out Seamon&#x27;s lease the next month and continued to operate the theater. Initially, the theater still presented shows from the Mutual Circuit, which Herk headed. Performers typically mingled with audience members and performed for longer durations than under Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s tenure. Minsky and Herk split in mid-1929, but the theater continued to feature a mixture of stock shows and Mutual shows. Mutual began a decline precipitated by the Depression, and Billy Minsky announced in March 1930 that he would stop presenting Mutual shows. The following month, he started presenting stock shows with both black and white casts. Bessie Smith was among the earliest black entertainers to perform at the Apollo.

Burlesque at the Apollo Theater began to decline in 1930 as Minsky concentrated on his new flagship theater off Times Square, the Republic. The Minskys moved many of their shows from the Irving Place Theatre and Minsky&#x27;s Brooklyn theater to the Apollo in 1931. For the 1931–1932 season, the theater hosted Columbia burlesque, with two shows per day. After Billy Minsky died in 1932, his younger brother Herbert took over the theater&#x27;s operation. That same year, Herk, Herbert Minsky, and Weinstock agreed to showcase Columbia burlesque at the Apollo. Attendance decreased after the Apollo started presenting shows without nudity or stripteases. The theater briefly hosted performances from the Empire Wheel in late 1932, and the Apollo began to stage black vaudeville that year. The Apollo&#x27;s operators also started serving alcoholic beverages in April 1933. After failing to renew its burlesque license, the Apollo closed temporarily that May and remained dark for seven months. The theater began hosting burlesque again in December 1933, with two midday shows in addition to the usual evening show. By then, however, newly elected mayor Fiorello La Guardia had begun to crack down on burlesque theaters citywide.

Sidney Cohen, who owned other theaters in the area, took over the theater in January 1934. At the time, many of Harlem&#x27;s most popular black theaters were clustered around 125th Street. The theater was converted into a performance venue for black entertainers, with an all-black staff. Most vestiges of the former burlesque shows were quickly removed. Unlike the previous burlesque shows, which had been controversial because they verged on nudity, the new programming would be family-friendly. The theater was renamed the 125th Street Apollo Theatre and reopened on January 26, 1934, catering to the black community of Harlem. Cohen initially employed Clarence Robinson as the Apollo Theatre&#x27;s producer and Morris Sussman as the manager. He also hired talent scout John Hammond to book his shows. Though advertised as a &quot;resort for the better people&quot;, the theater quickly attracted working-class, unemployed, and young audiences.

The Apollo was frequented by black performers, who, during the early 20th century, were not allowed to perform at many other venues. The theater was a prominent venue on the primarily black &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot;, though many shows featured actors of different races. It featured a wide variety of musical performances, including R&amp;B, jazz, blues, and gospel performances. Early shows consisted of revues, but this was quickly changed to a loosely connected format of dance, comedy, music, and novelty acts. The performances resembled vaudeville shows, with six to eight acts sharing a bill. Up to seven comedians or musicians and eight singing groups would perform for a week, doing as many as seven shows per day. Novice performers often started off as the opening act and aspired to become the headliner of the show. Because the Apollo did not have wealthy backers, in contrast to venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House, its income depended heavily on the success or failure of each week&#x27;s show. As a cost-cutting measure, the Apollo paid performers low salaries, to which most up-and-coming performers readily agreed.

The Apollo&#x27;s conversion had occurred at the end of the Harlem Renaissance. It was held in such high regard by local black residents that, according to Schiffman&#x27;s son Robert, it was not damaged during the Harlem riots of 1935, 1943, or 1964. The theater was a source of pride for Harlem&#x27;s black community and was often used as a gathering place during demonstrations. Although the Schiffmans were white, Robert recalled that local residents frequently referred to the Apollo as &quot;our theater&quot;, never &quot;the white man&#x27;s theater&quot; or &quot;Frank Schiffman&#x27;s theater&quot;. One writer said that &quot;in Harlem show business circles [Frank Schiffman] was God&quot;. Over the years, the format of the shows was changed.

==== 1930s and 1940s ====
The first major performer at the Apollo, jazz singer and Broadway star Adelaide Hall, appeared at the Apollo in February 1934. Hall&#x27;s limited-engagement show was highly praised by the press, which helped establish the Apollo&#x27;s reputation. Sussman hosted competitions for amateur performers on Wednesday nights, as well as &quot;kiddie hours&quot; on Sundays. The Apollo Theatre had vigorous competition from other venues, namely Leo Brecher&#x27;s Harlem Opera House and Frank Schiffman&#x27;s Lafayette. The former had been a popular vaudeville venue, while the latter had previously been the neighborhood&#x27;s predominant black theater. Cohen took out advertisements and broadcast shows on local radio stations, prompting equally vigorous promotion campaigns from Schiffman and Brecher. Cohen, Schiffman, and Brecher agreed to a truce in May 1935, and Cohen leased the theater the next month to the Harlem Opera House&#x27;s operator, Duane Theater Corporation. Ralph Cooper was hired as the emcee the same year.

After Cohen died in late 1935, the Opera House became a movie theater, while the Apollo continued to present stage shows. The Apollo was rebranded as &quot;The Only Stage Show in Harlem&quot;. Initially, the Apollo attracted blues and ragtime performers, as well as comedians and big bands. Early shows were accompanied by a chorus line of 16 girls, most of whom were fair-skinned; the chorus girls were no longer employed at the theater by the late 1930s. The &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; described the Apollo in 1939 as &quot;the only theatre in the country where Negro performers are predominantly featured&quot;, at a time when many other venues still did not allow black performers. The Apollo temporarily closed in mid-1940 for upgrades, reopening that September. The theater began showing musical comedies for the first time in February 1941. Jazz performances and bebop at the Apollo were popular in the 1940s, and gospel was hosted sporadically.

The Apollo appealed to mixed-race audiences in the 1940s; on Sundays, as much as four-fifths of the audience were white. During World War II, the theater offered 35 free tickets to members of the U.S. armed forces, and entertainers at the Apollo performed at the nearby Harlem Defense Recreation Center on Tuesday nights. Schiffman closed the theater temporarily for renovations in August 1945. The project cost $45,000 and entailed new sound systems, a remodeled orchestra pit, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s lounges, a staff recreation room, and modifications to decorations. After World War II, the theater occasionally staged a chorus line with six acts. By 1946, Schiffman had announced plans to widen the theater and add an air-cooling system when construction materials became available. The theater was sold in 1949 to the Harlem Apollo Realty Corporation, although Schiffman and Brecher continued to operate the Apollo. That year, they began experimenting with staging Broadway-class shows at the Apollo. Schiffman&#x27;s sons Jack and Robert began working at the theater in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

==== 1950s and 1960s ====
As the years progressed, variety shows were presented less often. The Apollo started staging rock music concerts when that genre became popular, and the big bands gave way to R&amp;B performances. The theater also began hosting different musical genres such as mambo and gospel. There were often two shows a day if a headliner was performing, and it showed movies at other times. Additionally, the theater was closed for upgrades for two weeks every August; a large CinemaScope screen was installed during one such closure in 1955. By the late 1950s, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine criticized the theater for &quot;allowing some of its actors to carry on with assorted vulgarisms&quot;. A typical booking consisted of five or six performances per day for seven days. The Apollo was one of the few remaining venues for black entertainers in Harlem during that time, although other venues such as the Waldorf Astoria New York and Copacabana had started allowing black performers. Even so, many popular black artists such as Eartha Kitt and Sammy Davis Jr. regularly returned for &quot;the folks who can&#x27;t make it downtown&quot;.

Robert Schiffman took over the theater&#x27;s management in 1960 or 1961. He kept prices low to cater to the local community, and he tried to attract up-and-coming talent by talking with local DJs and listening to music at nearby bars. The 1960s saw the rising popularity of R&amp;B at the Apollo, as well as mixed-genre productions. The theater was renovated slightly in 1960, and new sound-amplification equipment and lighting was added in August 1961. During the 1964 Harlem riots, the Apollo temporarily screened movies exclusively due to decreased patronage. The lobby and auditorium were renovated in 1967; the project was conducted almost entirely by black workers and cost $50,000. Business began to decline after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, allowing black entertainers to perform in nightclubs and hotels. The Apollo was smaller than similar venues; the neighborhood&#x27;s economy was in decline; and the Apollo was not near other popular venues. Other issues included a perception of rising crime and a lack of parking. The theater&#x27;s production manager, Charles Coles, said in 1967 that white audiences avoided the Apollo because of the 1964 riots and the rise of race-integrated venues. The Apollo continued to decline through the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The Schiffman family was looking to sell the Apollo to black entrepreneurs in the 1960s, having rejected several purchase offers from white theatrical operators. There was also growing support for grassroots performances at the theater. During that time, the Apollo continued to host variety shows every night and was often sold out during weekends; many of these live acts were accompanied by films. In 1972, a group of investors led by &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; editor Clarence B. Jones expressed interest in buying the theater, but the deal was canceled when interest rates increased sharply. As late as 1973, it had between 42 and 45 weeks of live shows annually, and the Apollo&#x27;s headliners earned as much as $50,000 per week. The theater had pivoted away from staging comedy and drama and were instead mostly presenting recording groups. Frank Schiffman recalled that the theater&#x27;s audience at the time was predominantly black and largely consisted of local residents.

==== Decline and closure ====

Although the Apollo did host some successful shows between 1970 and 1974, the theater&#x27;s offerings dropped sharply afterward; Herb Boyd wrote in 2009 that &quot;Apollo lovers had to resort to memories rather than performances&quot;. By the 1970s, the Apollo was the only remaining black vaudeville theater in the U.S.; other such theaters had closed because they were attracting fewer entertainers and could not compete with large venues. The Apollo Theater was struggling financially by early 1975, forcing its owners to lay off over 100 staff members. The Apollo had been forced to cut back its schedule of live shows to 20–22 weeks per year, less than half of the 45–50 weeks that the theater had presented in its peak. Management could not raise prices, even by a few cents, because that would drive away the local residents who frequented the theater. In addition, the surrounding area was deserted at night; the Apollo could not afford to pay performers at the significantly higher rates that they demanded; and patrons preferred to watch headliners&#x27; performances instead of multi-act shows.

To raise money, Robert Schiffman wanted to show first runs of films featuring black actors but faced competition from other Manhattan theaters. The Apollo&#x27;s managers began running for-sale advertisements in several major papers in 1975. The area had also become dangerous; for example, a young patron was killed at the theater later the same year. The Apollo was used exclusively for movies and gospel shows in the mid-1970s and was closed in January 1976. The theater had faulty stage equipment and deteriorating facilities, and many of the Apollo&#x27;s onetime headliners refused to perform there. More obscure acts did not draw large enough crowds to make a profit, and the Apollo had closed by 1977. Robert Schiffman considered replacing the existing theater with a new 3,000-seat venue, and there were also calls to renovate the Apollo or to merge it with the Victoria Theater. During the Apollo&#x27;s closure, the already-dilapidated seats and decorations continued to decay, and burst water pipes destroyed the stage.

Robert Schiffman sold the Apollo in early 1978 to a group of black businessmen, who became the first black owners of the theater. The new owners included Rich and Elmer T. Morris and Guy Fisher. The group spent $250,000 renovating the Apollo, which entailed replacing the sound system, renovating backstage areas, and furnishing the lobby. In addition, the new owners hired David E. McCarthy as the general manager and added reserved seating. The theater reopened on May 6, 1978, with a performance by percussionist Ralph MacDonald that was beset by technical issues. In the months after it reopened, the Apollo hosted numerous acts and was moderately successful. The Internal Revenue Service raided the theater in November 1979 after finding that the new owners had failed to pay tens of thousands of dollars in taxes over the two preceding years. The theater&#x27;s operators filed for bankruptcy in May 1981 after Elmer Morris&#x27;s arrest on drug charges.

=== Sutton operation ===
Inner City Broadcasting, a firm owned by Percy E. Sutton, agreed in late 1981 to buy the theater; he paid either $220,000 or $225,000. Inner City had beat out a competing bid from the Bible of Deliverance Evangelist Church. Sutton recalled that there were &quot;roaches, dead rats, swimming rats&quot; in the flooded basement. Inner City acquired an 81 percent stake in the theater&#x27;s legal owner, the Apollo Theatre Investor Group, while Sutton owned the remaining 19 percent of the group. According to Sutton, the purchase price was &quot;the cheapest part of bringing the Apollo back&quot;, since the theater needed extensive renovations.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) started to consider designating the Apollo Theater as a city landmark in early 1982, and it hosted hearings for the theater&#x27;s landmark status during the middle of that year. That July, state officials also proposed listing the theater on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) after nonprofit New York Landmarks Conservancy had conducted a report of the theater. The Apollo&#x27;s facade and interior were designated as New York City landmarks in June 1983. The theater was added to the NRHP in November 1983; the NRHP listing became official in June 1984.

==== Initial renovation ====

Sutton initially intended to spend $5.7 million on renovating the Apollo, and he intended to host and broadcast live shows from the theater. The Apollo Entertainment TV Network was formed in mid-1982 to broadcast programs from the theater&#x27;s studios. The Harlem Urban Development Corporation (HUDC) announced a $1 million grant for the theater in May 1982. The original reopening date of July 1982 was postponed due to the complexity of the project, and the state government expressed concerns that Sutton could not afford to pay for increasing renovation costs. That September, the U.S. federal government gave a $1.5 million Urban Development Action Grant to the city government, which lent the money to the Apollo&#x27;s operators. The city&#x27;s Industrial Development Agency also issued $2.8 million in bonds to fund the construction of a recording studio. Percy Sutton and his brother Oliver wished to raise the rest of the $6.8 million cost by themselves.

The Suttons announced in December 1982 that they would withdraw from the project after the New York State Mortgage Agency rejected the Suttons&#x27; request for insurance assistance. Despite this, mayor Ed Koch expressed optimism that the renovation would continue. The renovation was restarted in May 1983 after the state UDC agreed to give the theater $2.5 million; without this funding, the Apollo Theatre Investor Group would have canceled the project entirely. Sutton transferred the theater building and underlying land to the New York state government, as he wished to receive a $9 million state grant. He then leased the theater for 99 years. Sutton ultimately obtained $10 million from a consortium of lenders. The renovation experienced more delays, and a construction management firm incurred nearly $800,000 in charges before work had even started.

The renovated theater included a production studio for TV broadcasts and video productions, as well as a new hall of fame with memorabilia from the theater&#x27;s history. Air-conditioning and an elevator were added, and the theater also received new lights, sound systems, and dressing rooms and a restored interior. By late 1983 and early 1984, the Apollo was expected to open in late 1984. To advertise the Apollo&#x27;s return, Sutton briefly reopened the theater for several events during its renovation. These included the AUDELCO awards in November 1983, an Amateur Night that December, and a revue in June 1984. Sutton estimated that it cost $72,000 just to operate the theater once a month. At the end of 1984, the State Mortgage Agency agreed to insure three-fourths of a $2.9 million mortgage that the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation had placed on the theater; that bank had provided $6 million in total funding. The first phase cost $5.5 million in total. Local residents hoped that the Apollo&#x27;s renovation would spur a revival of the neighboring stretch of 125th Street.

==== Reopening and late 1980s ====
The first shows at the refurbished theater were hosted on May 22, 1985. At the time of the rededication, the recording studio was not complete. Sutton had intended to stage a wide variety of genres on different evenings: for example, the Apollo hosted jazz and rock on Friday and Saturday nights, gospel on Sunday mornings, and Amateur Nights on Wednesday nights. The revived theater also had a mixed-race dance company, which according to Sutton was intended to &quot;send a message that everyone is welcome here&quot;. By October 1985, the theater had closed temporarily to accommodate the construction of the recording studio; the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; reported two months later that the work would last until late 1986. &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, a TV series showcasing Amateur Night performers, was launched in 1987. The facilities were not all complete until mid-1988, and the renovation ended up costing $20 million.

Sutton&#x27;s lenders allowed him to defer payments on the loans until 1992 while he tried to make a profit. To raise money, Sutton sold recordings of shows on a pay-per-view basis and tried to create syndicated TV programs at the theater. He also planned to earn money from &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, the Apollo Theater Records label, and licensing agreements, but the theater remained unprofitable. Advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi signed a contract in 1989 for the exclusive use of the Apollo&#x27;s broadcast studios, but only one syndicated program was created through 1991. The theater was also being used only 50 percent of the time, while the studio&#x27;s uptime was 30 percent. The Apollo was losing $2.4 million a year by 1990 and was predicted to lose $2.1 million over the next year. Sutton had expected to earn $1.7 million from videos and pay $1.3 million in salaries in 1990, but he ended up earning $280,000 and paying $1.8 million. The theater still faced competition from larger venues and was affected by perceptions of high crime. The Apollo Theatre Investor Group was delinquent on payments to the UDC by early 1991. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported in 1991 that the group had never kept a formal ledger, which may have worsened its financial issues.

Sutton announced in April 1991 that he would shutter the theater on June 1 unless his lenders restructured the loans. After Sutton made a payment of $36,000 later that month, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation agreed to waive further loan payments for six months. Sutton considered transferring the theater&#x27;s operation to a new nonprofit organization, which would cost him $6 million. He asked entertainers such as Bill Cosby to perform at the Apollo to raise money, A network TV special, benefit performances, and film screenings were organized to raise money, and numerous celebrities formed an organization called Save the Apollo Film Committee. Three hundred churches with black congregations also donated to the Apollo, and State Assembly member Geraldine L. Daniels asked the Recording Academy to consider hosting the Grammy Awards there. By July 1991, the Apollo Theatre Investor Group was creating a nonprofit to take over the theater&#x27;s operation.

=== Apollo Theater Foundation operation ===
In September 1991, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) bought the Apollo and assigned its operation to the nonprofit Apollo Theater Foundation (ATF). As part of the deal, Manufacturers Hanover agreed to forgive $2.9 million in unpaid mortgage payments. In addition, the state UDC agreed to restructure a $7.67 million grant, although it was unwilling to forgive the entire debt, which totaled $11.4 million. Performers such as Natalie Cole continued to host shows to raise money for the Apollo. Sutton remained involved with the theater as an unpaid consultant, and Inner City provided $500,000 per year in radio advertising for the Apollo. In addition, Inner City Theater Group licensed the Apollo&#x27;s name and the rights to use the theater for five years.

==== 1990s ====
The ATF took over the theater in September 1992. A plaque, celebrating the Apollo&#x27;s listing on the National Register of Historic Places, was added to the theater the same month, although the plaque was stolen in 1996. Leon Denmark was appointed as the foundation&#x27;s director. The foundation sought to attract notable black performers and to reduce the theater&#x27;s debts. During its first operating season in 1993–1994, the ATF subsidized performances at the main auditorium and a smaller auditorium, and it launched the Community Arts Program to attract less experienced entertainers. In addition, local TV station WPIX began broadcasting events from the Apollo. The ATF also created a public museum and held events to pay for maintenance. The revitalization of the Apollo Theater led to increased pedestrian traffic along West 125th Street, while the theater itself had 12 events per month, attracting 17,000 guests.

Grace Blake became the ATF&#x27;s director in 1996. The next year, the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation allocated funding for a gift shop next to the theater. The ATF began raising $30 million for the theater in the late 1990s, but the city and state governments refused to issue $750,000 in grants unless the foundation could provide financial statements. At the time, there was a dispute over how much Inner City owed the ATF for the use of the Apollo&#x27;s name. The Apollo was mostly empty by 1998, except on Amateur Nights, and it was physically deteriorating. The only other major show at the theater was &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, and the Apollo was rented out for other events for the rest of the time. Many black performers shunned the theater because of its small size and because larger venues were no longer segregated.

In 1998, the Attorney General of New York&#x27;s office began investigating whether Inner City was underpaying ATF. Then–attorney general Dennis Vacco accused the foundation&#x27;s board of directors of mismanagement and sued the six black members of the 10-member board, including chairman Charles Rangel. Vacco also unsuccessfully requested that New York Supreme Court justice Ira Gammerman place the theater into receivership. Rangel and Sutton denied Vacco&#x27;s accusations, and Vacco&#x27;s successor Eliot Spitzer calculated that Inner City owed the ATF only $1 million. By early 1999, Time Warner was considering taking over the Apollo&#x27;s board, and the state government was willing to drop the lawsuits if Time Warner took over the board and ousted Rangel as chairman. That August, Time Warner donated $500,000 and expanded the ATF&#x27;s board to 19 members; the agreement would go into force when Rangel resigned as chairman. Rangel initially refused to step down, but Ossie Davis was ultimately appointed as the new chairman that September. Spitzer dropped his office&#x27;s lawsuits in late 1999, and governor George Pataki approved a $750,000 grant for the Apollo. Time Warner planned to host events such as TV specials, pay-per-view shows, and concerts there.

==== 2000s ====

By 2000, Time Warner planned to fully renovate the Apollo, but this was delayed by internal disputes over whether Time Warner should replace Blake as the ATF&#x27;s director. The ATF&#x27;s board hired Caples Jefferson Architects to design the renovation, and the New York Landmarks Conservancy created a report on the theater&#x27;s condition. Time Warner executive Derek Q. Johnson was appointed as the ATF&#x27;s president in early 2001, when annual patronage totaled 115,000. Plans for the renovation were announced that May, with a tentative budget of $6 million or $6.5 million. The ATF also wished to lease the neighboring Victoria Theater for 99 years and expand into the Victoria, although this was expected to inflate the cost of the renovation to almost $200 million. The Coca-Cola Company signed a ten-year sponsorship agreement with the ATF that August, and the Dance Theatre of Harlem also partnered with the Apollo that year. Between 2001 and 2003, the theater&#x27;s annual budget increased from $3 million to $10 million, and the theater began to host events such as musicals, galas, and fundraisers.

The first phase of renovation involved restoration of the facade and marquee, which was underway by 2002 and was expected to cost $12 million. That July, the ATF announced that it planned to close the theater for eight months. Davis Brody Bond and Beyer Blinder Belle were hired as restoration architects, while local firms Bordy-Lawson Associates and Jack Travis Architect designed other parts of the renovation. Johnson resigned in September 2002 after the ATF&#x27;s board canceled plans to lease the Victoria and approved a smaller renovation project costing $53–54 million. Jonelle Procope was named as the Apollo&#x27;s director in 2003. The ATF was involved in another proposal to renovate the Victoria in the mid-2000s, but this proposal was unsuccessful. The ATF launched an annual spring benefit in 2005 to raise money. The renovation of the facade was finished that December, and the ATF installed wider seats in early 2006. The first phase of the renovation also included replacing the stage and dressing rooms. By then, the theater had 1.3 million annual visitors; many tourists visited the theater just to tour it or learn its history, but the Apollo still hosted events and performances, and it remained an important gathering space for Harlem&#x27;s residents.

The ceilings, walls, and other interior decorations were to be restored in the second phase of renovations. As part of the Apollo Rising Capital Campaign, by the beginning of 2008, the ATF had raised $51.5 million for the project&#x27;s first phase and was planning to raise another $44.5 million for the second phase. The lobby would be expanded by , which would have required that the theater be closed for several months in 2009. The work also entailed recladding the lobby, restoring the auditorium&#x27;s decorations, and adding a walk of fame. In addition, a multi-purpose space would have been established on the second floor. The ATF delayed the interior renovation and paused its capital campaign in 2009. Although the Apollo was receiving many grassroots donations, Procope had decided to focus on expanding the theater&#x27;s programming; it sold 400,000 tickets per year at the time.

==== 2010s ====
In the early 2010s, the Apollo was used primarily for TV shows, benefit parties, special events, and Amateur Nights. These included the Dining with the Divas luncheon, which started in 2011, as well as the Apollo Theater Spring Gala. A walk of fame was dedicated outside the theater in May 2010, recognizing performers in the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame. That year, the ATF decided to expand its board to 27 members. By 2011, the ATF was looking to expand into the site of the neighboring Showman&#x27;s Cafe club, which had been vacant for 35 years, and was looking to raise $12 million for the project. The foundation revamped the Amateur Nights website, placed advertisements in the subway system, developed a mobile app for Amateur Nights, and invited a more diverse slate of performers. The ATF launched the 21st Century Apollo Campaign in 2014, seeking to raise $20 million; at the time, it had raised $10 million. Three-fourths of this amount was to be used to expand programming, $4 million would be raised for a reserve fund, and $1 million would be raised for smaller improvements.

By the mid-2010s, the ATF&#x27;s finances had stabilized, with an annual operating budget of $13.2 million, and the organization had 30 trustees, six more than in 2009. A growing number of tourists were visiting the Apollo as well; for instance, Amateur Nights had attracted 60,000 viewers in 2013, of which nearly half were tourists. The ATF recorded surpluses in its budget for several consecutive years in the 2010s. The foundation announced in 2018 that it would build two auditoriums, one with 199 seats and another with 99 seats, on the third and fourth stories of the Victoria Theater. The new stages, the first major expansion of the Apollo since 1934, would host works by rising artists and would also allow the ATF to produce a wider variety of content.

==== 2020s expansion ====
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the Apollo Theater was temporarily closed in March 2020 and did not reopen until August 2021. The ATF announced in late 2021 that they would open the auditoriums in the Victoria Theater the next year. The expansion into the Victoria Theater, which also included office space operated by the ATF, occurred amid increased interest in tourism in Harlem. ATF officials announced in October 2022 that they would renovate the original theater in early 2024, which would require that the main auditorium be closed for six months. The theater had raised $63 million for its capital campaign and was planned to be renamed the Apollo Performing Arts Center when the renovations were completed. Procope announced in late 2022 that she would step down as the Apollo&#x27;s director the following June.

The 99-seat performance space in the Apollo Victoria Theater was renamed after Procope in early 2023. That June, Michelle Ebanks was appointed as the Apollo&#x27;s director. The Apollo Stages at the Victoria opened in March 2024; it consisted of a lobby, offices, and two additional stages. The ATF announced further details of the renovation that June. The plans included a restoration of the facade; expansion of the lobby; and upgrades to the seating, lighting, sound systems, restrooms, and soundstage.

== Programming and governance ==
The Apollo Theater Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1991, controls the theater. , Michelle Ebanks is listed as the president and CEO of the Apollo Theater Foundation. For the fiscal year that ended in June 2023, the organization recorded $4,507,683 in revenue and $9,935,823 in expenses. The ATF hosts programs such as Amateur Night, as well as events like concerts.

The theater&#x27;s audience was often mixed: in the 1940s it was estimated that during the week about 40% of the audience was white, which would go up to 75% for weekend shows. Some performers such as Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, and the Beatles&#x27; members sat in the audience. Bill Clinton visited the Apollo in 2005, after the end of his presidency, while Jamaican prime minister P. J. Patterson was the first Caribbean head of state to visit the theater in 2002.

=== Amateur Night at the Apollo ===
Amateur Night was first hosted in 1934 or 1935 and has been hosted nearly continuously since then, except from the 1970s to 1985. Schiffman had introduced an amateur night at the Lafayette Theater, where Ralph Cooper had hosted Harlem Amateur Hour; Cooper hosted the event at the Apollo for fifty years. At the Apollo, Amateur Nights were held every Wednesday evening and broadcast on the radio over WMCA and eleven affiliate stations. The shows attracted audiences of all races. Until the 1990s, Amateur Nights often ran for up to four hours and hosted as many as 30 performers. After the ATF took over the Apollo, it shortened Amateur Nights to about 12 performers per night. A mobile app for Amateur Nights was launched in 2011, and auditions were hosted virtually for the first time in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amateur Nights performances were showcased in the TV series &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, which ran from 1987 to 2008 and was relaunched in 2018.

Traditionally, many contestants would rub a stump on the stage for good luck; this stump, known as the Tree of Hope, was originally planted in the median of Seventh Avenue in Harlem. A winner and three runners-up are selected after each show. First-place winners were given money and invited to return to the Apollo; the contests have sometimes ended in a tie. Early winners of Amateur Nights were invited to perform at the Apollo the following week; by the late 20th century, winners were invited to participate in monthly Show Off shows and annual Top Dog competitions.

The &quot;executioner&quot;, holding a broom, would sweep Amateur Night performers off the stage if they were performing poorly. The executioner might also use other objects, such as a chair, balls, gavels, or weapon props. Vaudeville tap dancer &quot;Sandman&quot; Sims played the role from the 1950s to 2000, while C. P. Lacey also served as executioner for over 20 years starting in the 1980s. The performer might also be chased offstage with a cap pistol, accompanied by the sound of a siren. According to &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; presenter Steve Harvey, some musicians were informally off limits, and contestants were booed off the stage if they missed a single note while performing these musicians&#x27; songs. Luther Vandross was booed off stage four times before he won, and James Brown was also unsuccessful in his first performance in 1952.

Amateur Night performers came from across the U.S. The vast majority of Amateur Nights performers have historically been young black performers, although there have also been older or white performers. The Amateur Nights events helped popularize young or obscure artists. Winners have included Pearl Bailey, Thelma Carpenter, Ella Fitzgerald, The Jackson 5, Sarah Vaughan, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, King Curtis, Wilson Pickett, Ruth Brown, Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson, The Ronettes, The Isley Brothers, Stephanie Mills, Leslie Uggams, Sammy Davis Jr., Billie Holiday, and Dionne Warwick. One author wrote in 2010 that &quot;if there had been no Apollo Theater, many of these stars would never have been given their first chance.&quot;

=== Apollo Legends Hall of Fame ===
The Apollo Legends Hall of Fame was created in 1985. The Hall of Fame initially consisted of the names of 25 performers who debuted at the Apollo before 1955, as well as memorabilia representing the theater&#x27;s history. Every year thereafter, up to ten people have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Nominees for the Hall of Fame are required to have either performed at the Apollo or have created a show or other artistic work inspired by those who performed at the Apollo. Some of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s inductees are honored in the Walk of Fame, created in 2010. The walk consists of bronze plaques inset into the sidewalk.

=== Commissioned work and educational programs ===
The theater&#x27;s educational programs over the years have included lectures, such as a 1974 lecture by blues musician B.B. King. The ATF formed a partnership with the Verizon Foundation in 2007 to teach local students about the theater&#x27;s history, and it began hosting the Master Class Series for performers in 2012. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the ATF curated numerous education programs that taught 20,000 children annually. In late 2022, the ATF created the Apollo Apprenticeship program, which provides internships in event management, technical production, technical direction, management, and project creation.

In 2010, playwright Keith Josef Adkins launched New Black Fest at the Apollo, an annual event that showcases theatrical works by black playwrights. The ATF launched the Apollo New Works program in 2020 after receiving $3 million in grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Ford Foundation. Apollo New Works is intended to showcase musical, theatrical, or dance performances by black artists; a set of artists-in-residence is selected every year. The ATF and the United Talent Agency signed an agreement in 2021 to allow the UTA to promote films, TV shows, and other shows produced at the Apollo. , the Apollo presents both remote and in-person workshops and programs to over 20,000 people per year.

In partnership with the Columbia Center for Oral History Research, in 2008, the ATF assembled an archive of historical documents, photographs, and other media and launched an oral history project. Dozens of performers, including Smokey Robinson, Leslie Uggams, and Fred Wesley, gave interviews for the project. The archive includes a plywood wall that thousands of mourners signed after Michael Jackson&#x27;s death.

After the Apollo was renovated in the 1980s, it hosted such diverse acts as the New York Philharmonic, rock and soul band Hall &amp; Oates, and pop musician Prince. During the 2000s, the Apollo also attempted to launch a Latin music series and hosted performers such as the band Gorillaz. Additionally, the Apollo partnered with Opera Philadelphia to create several operas based on black culture. Several rappers have performed at the Apollo in the late 20th and the 21st centuries, including Ice Cube, Drake, and Lil Wayne. The Apollo&#x27;s musical offerings have also included competitions, such as an R&amp;B contest in the 1960s and a gospel competition in the 2010s.

==== Concerts ====
Some of the theater&#x27;s concerts have attracted particular notice. For instance, Aretha Franklin played to sold-out crowds in 1971, and Bob Marley and The Wailers performed there for their Survival Tour in 1979. Pop star Michael Jackson played a free concert at the Apollo in 2002, raising $2.5 million for the U.S. Democratic Party; this was his last ever performance at the Apollo.

The theater has hosted numerous benefit concerts throughout its history. These included a fundraiser for the Scottsboro Boys in 1937, a concert for Attica Prison riot victims&#x27; families in 1971, as well as a gospel concert that Shirley Caesar and The Clark Sisters performed for the United Negro College Fund in 1986. Starting in 1993, the theater also hosted concerts to raise money for its Hall of Fame.

=== Dance ===
The theater also featured tap dancers such as the Berry Brothers, Nicholas Brothers, Buck and Bubbles, and Bojangles Robinson. The theater hosted dancers such as Bunny Briggs and Babe Lawrence during the mid-20th century, as well as Cholly Atkins, Bill Bailey, Honi Coles, The Four Step Brothers, and Tip, Tap and Toe. Other dancers appearing at the Apollo have included Carmen De Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder. The theater hosted the Les Ballets Africains, the national dance company of Guinea, for several years starting in 1970. Dancing continued to feature at the Apollo in later years, such as in 1990 when the Apollo held a tap-dancing festival. Starting in 2011, the Ballet Hispanico performed at the Apollo regularly.

=== Revues and legitimate theatre ===
The Apollo has hosted numerous revues and legitimate theatrical productions. These included a popular revue with white and black performers during the 1930s; a pageant honoring black soldiers during World War II; and separate revues led by boxer Ray Robinson, comedian Timmie Rogers, and actress Pearl Bailey. The Apollo&#x27;s first musical comedy, &quot;Tan Manhattan&quot;, was staged in 1941. The Apollo also hosted plays such as &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot; (1949), &quot;The Respectful Prostitute&quot; (1950), and &quot;The Detective Story&quot; (1951). The theater started staging R&amp;B revues in 1955, with each bill featuring up to a dozen performers. The Jewel Box Revue, a show featuring female impersonators, was first presented at the Apollo in 1959 and was staged several times through at least the 1970s. The Motortown Revue was staged at the theater in 1962, featuring artists such as Smokey Robinson, the Supremes, the Temptations, and Stevie Wonder. Other revues in the 1960s and 1970s included the musical drama &quot;Listen My Brother&quot;, and an all-black production of the drama &quot;Jazztime&quot;.

&quot;Harlem Song&quot;, a revue about Harlem&#x27;s history, opened at the Apollo in 2002, becoming the Apollo&#x27;s first &quot;open-ended&quot; show with no definite end date. The theater has also hosted other plays, musicals, and revues in the 21st century, such as The Jackie Wilson Story in 2003 and &quot;Apollo Club Harlem&quot; in 2013, as well as &quot;James Brown: Get on the Good Foot&quot;, also in 2013. &quot;James Brown: Get on the Good Foot&quot; was also the first show ever produced by the Apollo that went on tour internationally.

=== Comedy ===
Comic acts have also appeared on the Apollo stage. In the theater&#x27;s early years, these included Butterbeans and Susie, Moms Mabley, Dewey &quot;Pigmeat&quot; Markham, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, Nipsey Russell, Slappy White, Flip Wilson, Godfrey Cambridge, Timmie Rogers, and Stump and Stumpy. Among the theater&#x27;s most popular comedy acts in the mid-20th century were Mabley, who satirized Jim Crow laws in her shows, and Rogers, who performed song-and-dance routines. Russell, White, and Foxx also focused on social commentary in their shows. By the 1960s, the theater hosted younger comedians including George Kirby, Godfrey Cambridge, and Scoey Mitchell. Bill Cosby made his debut at the theater in 1968, and Pryor and Wilson also made frequent appearances in the 1960s. Later on, Chris Rock taped a comedy show at the Apollo in 1999.

== Other events ==

=== Films ===
The Apollo has screened some films throughout its history. In the theater&#x27;s heyday as a venue for black artists, it hosted &quot;Take My Life&quot; in 1943, &quot;Sepia Cinderella&quot; in 1947. &quot;Prince of Foxes&quot; in 1950, and a musical film called &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Blues&quot; in 1956. As part of a pilot program that launched in 1965, a local community group screened films to teach local teenagers about cinema. During the same decade, the Apollo also hosted gospel films and a summertime film festival with films such as &quot;What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot;.

The Apollo hosted the documentary &quot;Save the Children&quot; in 1973 and first runs of the films &quot;Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold&quot; in 1975 and &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot; in 1976, though the Apollo was not as successful in attracting other films at the time. The documentary &quot;The Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II&quot; was also screened at the theater in 1992.

=== Recordings and tapings ===
Over the years, there have been recordings of numerous performances at the Apollo Theater. &quot;A Night at the Apollo&quot;, a track released in 1957, consisted of samples of performances at the theater. James Brown recorded a show at the theater in 1962; this became the album &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;, which spent 66 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart. Brown went on to record the albums &quot;Live at the Apollo, Volume II&quot; (1967), &quot;Revolution of the Mind&quot; (1971), and &quot;Live at the Apollo 1995,&quot; as well as the 1968 television special &quot;James Brown: Man to Man&quot;, at the theater. Gospel recording artist Byron Cage played at the Apollo for his album &quot;Live at the Apollo: The Proclamation&quot; in 2007. Bruno Mars recorded a concert titled &quot;Bruno Mars: 24K Magic Live at the Apollo&quot; in 2017, and Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;Live at the Apollo 2017&quot; the same year after visiting the theater during their Not in This Lifetime... Tour. The music video for Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1986 cover of the song &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, was filmed in the Apollo Theater, featuring Houston and her mother Cissy Houston on the stage.

Some of the Apollo&#x27;s shows have also been filmed for specific purposes. For example, in April 1976, Fred and Felicidad Dukes and Rafee Kamaal produced two 60-minute television specials with Group W Productions to help revitalize the theater. A TV special called &quot;Motown Returns to the Apollo&quot; was taped in May 1985 to celebrate the Apollo&#x27;s reopening. NBC filmed the show &quot;A Hot Night in Harlem&quot; in 2004 to raise money for the theater&#x27;s ongoing renovation.

=== Non-performance events ===
When Schiffman operated the Apollo, he frequently rented the theater for meetings on topics concerning black Americans, including discussions of civil rights and employment. Civil-rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., A. Philip Randolph, and Bayard Rustin, as well as organizations like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality, hosted speeches at the Apollo during the 1950s and 1960s. Between 20 and 25 civil rights–related events took place at the Apollo each year between 1966 and 1971. There have been some religious services, such as sermons by Jesse Jackson in 1969, Fela Kuti&#x27;s sermon and musical performance in 1991, and Suzan Johnson Cook&#x27;s worship series in 2008.The Apollo has hosted memorial services, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in 1972, James Brown in 2007, and Michael Jackson in 2009. Similarly, the theater has hosted tribute shows such as a tribute to Bob Marley in 1984; &quot;Swing into Spring: A Harlem Tribute to Lionel Hampton&quot; in 1996; and a benefit honoring Ossie Davis in 2004. Several awards ceremonies have been held at the Apollo, including the Caribbean Music Awards, and the Rhythm and Blues Foundation&#x27;s Pioneer Awards.

The theater hosted a poetry recital in 1994, as well as the first professional boxing match in the theater&#x27;s history (a card pitting Lou Savarese against David Izonritei) in 1997. The theater hosted a debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley during the 2000 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and then-U.S. senator Barack Obama campaigned at the theater during his 2008 presidential campaign. Events in the 21st century have included a fashion show at the Apollo in 2004, a commencement ceremony for Wagner Graduate School of Public Service graduates, as well as an annual skipping rope competition called the Double Dutch Holiday Classic.

== Impact ==
Particularly when Robert Schiffman managed the Apollo in the mid-20th century, the theater itself was a symbol of success for many black performers. The &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot; wrote in 1982 that &quot;the Apollo has had a significant impact on the careers of virtually every black performer who has played there&quot;, and the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; said the next year that the theater &quot;led the way in the presentation of swing, bebop, rhythm and blues, modern jazz, commercially produced gospel, soul and funk&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 2011: &quot;You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a major African-American entertainer, singer, bandleader, dancer or comic who didn&#x27;t appear there.&quot; Record producer Quincy Jones said in 2004: &quot;The influence of the Apollo reaches beyond the shores of this country-it is truly the premiere platform for world music.&quot; Robert Schiffman claimed: &quot;For years, you could write &#x27;Apollo Theater&#x27; on a postcard, drop it into a mailbox anywhere and it would be delivered.&quot; In July 2024, the Apollo became the first cultural institution to receive a Kennedy Center Honors award.

=== Works about the theater ===
The Apollo was showcased in a 90-minute episode of the &quot;David Frost Show&quot; in 1969. &quot;The Apollo ... It Was Just Like Magic,&quot; a musical dramatization of the theater&#x27;s history, was produced off-off-Broadway in 1981. The theater&#x27;s history was chronicled in the 1976 television special &quot;Apollo&quot;, the 1980 NBC special &quot;Uptown&quot;, and the 2019 documentary &quot;The Apollo&quot;. Lee Daniels also considered directing a documentary called &quot;The Apollo Theater Film Project&quot; in the mid-2010s.

Several books have been written about the theater. These include &quot;Showtime at the Apollo: The Story of Harlem&#x27;s World Famous Theater&quot; by Ted Fox, published in 1983 and republished in 2003. A graphic novel of the same name was published in 2019. The theater was also the subject of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, a 2011 exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York, as well as a traveling exhibition at the National Museum of American History in 2010.

<text>The manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. The series takes place in a fictional universe where countries vie for power by employing ninja who can use special techniques and abilities in combat. The storyline is divided into two parts, simply named Part I and Part II, with the latter taking place two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I. It is followed by the sequel series &quot;&quot; by Ukyō Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series&#x27; storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Tree Leaves).

The character of the first series is Naruto Uzumaki, an energetic ninja who wishes to become Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure and holds a demon fox called the Nine-Tails sealed in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to Team 7, in which he meets his long-time rival Sasuke Uchiha, a taciturn and highly skilled &quot;genius&quot; of the Uchiha clan; and Sakura Haruno, who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto&#x27;s attention and Kakashi Hatake, the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series&#x27; antagonists, including Orochimaru, a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite rogue ninja of the criminal organization Akatsuki who seek out jinchuriki like Naruto and Gaara for the tailed beasts.

The character of the second series is Boruto Uzumaki, the son of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sarada Uchiha, Sasuke and Sakura&#x27;s daughter, Mitsuki, Orochimaru&#x27;s artificially created son, and the group&#x27;s leader Konohamaru, the Third Hokage&#x27;s grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child. Subsequently, Sarada is promoted to leader of the team in place of Konohamaru. Kawaki, a young boy with a traumatic past who is taken in by the Uzumaki family, becomes Naruto&#x27;s adopted son and Boruto&#x27;s adoptive brother.

As Kishimoto developed the series, he created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other &quot;shōnen&quot; manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous &quot;shōnen&quot; characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto&#x27;s work in the manga and anime adaptations.

==Creation and conception==
When Masashi Kishimoto was originally creating the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, he looked to other &quot;shōnen&quot; manga for inspiration while still attempting to make his characters as unique as possible. Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series as one of these influences, noting that Goku, the protagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality. To complement Naruto, Kishimoto worked on creating a rival that was a &quot;cool genius&quot;, as he believed this was &quot;the archetypal rival character&quot;. After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed Sasuke Uchiha. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a definite image of what a heroine should be&quot;. He eventually created Sakura Haruno, emphasizing &quot;her energy and flirtatious spirit&quot; as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main &quot;Naruto&quot; teams.

The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be &quot;extreme&quot;, having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched &quot;tokusatsu&quot; dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams to be different from the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were &quot;strong to the point of perfection&quot;. Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many role-playing games, and &quot;each character stands out better that way&quot;.

Kishimoto inserted villains into the story to counteract the lead characters&#x27; moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, &quot;I don&#x27;t really think about them in combat&quot;. The villains&#x27; physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, making it easier for a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains &quot;flamboyant&quot; with a &quot;showy costume&quot; is &quot;one of my guiding principles&quot;, as well as making them &quot;more memorable&quot;.

When drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of &quot;tankōbon&quot;, the cover of the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.

==Main characters==
===&quot;Naruto&quot;===
The protagonists of the &quot;Naruto&quot; series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake, who form of Konohagakure. After Sasuke Uchiha&#x27;s defection and Naruto&#x27;s departure from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, the team disbands. During Part II, the team reforms as with two new members: Sai, who occupies Sasuke&#x27;s position, and Yamato, who becomes the acting Captain. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Team 7 reunites to fight Madara Uchiha and then Kaguya Ōtsutsuki when she possesses the former. Once the War is over, Naruto and Sasuke have their final battle that allow them to resolve their issues with their group fully reunited soon after.

====Naruto Uzumaki====

Naruto Uzumaki (うずまき ナルト, &quot;Uzumaki Naruto&quot;) is the title character and main protagonist of the franchise. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often shunned by the Konohagakure villagers as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha. After being held back for several years in the Ninja Academy, which teaches ninjutsu and taijutsu skills, he finally passes the Ninja certification exam, and compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality as he developed his catchphrase &quot;Believe it!&quot; (～だってばよ, &quot;dattebayo&quot;), vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the strongest ninja leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers&#x27;s respect and be able to protect them. During a battle as a ninja, Naruto has mastered powerful various ninjutsu skills and abilities including the ability to create a massive and several clones of himself known as &quot;Shadow Clone Jutsu&quot;, the ability to use his wind nature as he&#x27;s able to master a powerful spiral chakra sphere known as the &quot;Rasengan&quot; for offensive purposes, and other numerous abilities like using Nine-Tailed Fox&#x27;s chakra that increases his speed, strength, agility, and even whenever Naruto was enraged and goes feral but later in Part II he managed to control the Nine Tails&#x27; chakra. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually leaves a positive influence on all their lives, which grants him worldwide fame. Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Seventh Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children: Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki. Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in Japanese, and by Maile Flanagan in English.

====Sasuke Uchiha====

 is Naruto Uzumaki&#x27;s main rival and best friend. He was designed by Kishimoto as a &quot;cool genius&quot; since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke&#x27;s older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their clan. Because of this, Sasuke&#x27;s sole ambition is to avenge his clan and kill his brother, developing a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, especially Sakura Haruno, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. When during the battle, Sasuke is a taijutsu expert and has mastered his ability to manipulate numerous fire techniques including known as &quot;Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu&quot;, manipulating a fury of lightning known as &quot;Chidori&quot; and as a member of the Uchiha clan, he uses the Sharingan that allows him to senses the opponent&#x27;s moves and attacks. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the &quot;Boruto&quot; franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure and a mentor for Naruto&#x27;s son, Boruto Uzumaki. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal.

====Sakura Haruno====

 is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura&#x27;s appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two grew, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. As a kunoichi, Sakura possesses superior strength to unleash her powerful punch towards the opponents when she is enraged by saying &quot;Cha!&quot; (しゃーんなろー！, &quot;Shānnarō&quot;!) and as a medical ninja, she can heal any wound. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as &quot;annoying&quot; and Naruto has feelings for her. Her perception of Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend and partner, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Chie Nakamura, and she is voiced by Kate Higgins in the English adaptation.

====Kakashi Hatake====

Kakashi Hatake is the easygoing, smart leader of Team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto&#x27;s success, training him to be a great ninja. Like Sasuke, Kakashi is also a master of the Sharingan, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha, and can manipulate the &quot;Lightning Blade,&quot; the technique which inspired Sasuke&#x27;s Chidori. Facing Obito after learning he survived and became an apprentice of Madara&#x27;s, Kakashi&#x27;s original eye was restored late by Naruto who used the power of Sage of the Six Paths into series&#x27;s second half, but he briefly regains the Sharingan when Obito aids him in spirit to help in the fight against Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the Sixth Hokage after the Fourth Great Ninja War have ended, with Naruto succeeding him as the Seventh Hokage years later.

===&quot;Naruto Shippūden&quot;===

====Sai====
 is a ninja who joins Team Kakashi/ Team 7 in Part II, carefully designed by Kishimoto to stand out as Sasuke&#x27;s replacement by having the two look similar. A member of &quot;The Foundation&quot; since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie, even after he killed his surrogate brother Shin under Danzo&#x27;s diabolical orders. He consequently gives people labels based on their status, and his label of Sasuke as a traitor antagonizes Naruto and Sakura. After the two discover his past and warm up to him, however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which becomes his primary goal in the series. Sai&#x27;s attempts to form bonds turn can be humorous as he tries giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as &quot;fatso&quot; for Choji and &quot;ugly&quot; for Sakura. He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach by calling Ino &quot;beautiful&quot;, causing Ino to fall for him. When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works, although he doesn&#x27;t name any of them. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, as he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life. In the series epilogue, Sai ends up marrying Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin. Of all the Naruto protagonists, Sai (is an only one boy character whose later to be) receives the least screen time (since New Era) in the (Boruto) series. Sai&#x27;s voice actor is Satoshi Hino in the &quot;Naruto: Shippūden&quot; anime, and his English voice actor is Benjamin Diskin except in &quot;Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Lucien Dodge.

====Yamato====
 is introduced during Part II of the series as an ANBU member who becomes a substitute leader in Team Kakashi. &quot;Yamato&quot; is not his real name, rather a codename assigned for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as , Yamato believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama&#x27;s Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato&#x27;s memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name . After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.

After Kakashi Hatake was wounded during his team&#x27;s mission to rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki, Tsunade places Yamato in Team Kakashi under the cover of acting leader so he can use his Wood Style whenever the need to suppress Kurama&#x27;s influence over Naruto arises. For possessing Hashirama&#x27;s DNA, Yamato gets captured by Kabuto to strengthen the White Zetsu army for the Fourth Great Ninja War. Yamato is eventually revealed to have been contained by the body of the White Zetsu known as Guruguru, until the altered human ejects him once Madara casts the Infinite Tsukiyomi. In &quot;Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring&quot;, Yamato is among the ninja assigned to keep tabs on Orochimaru. In the anime, Yamato is voiced by Rikiya Koyama in the Japanese version. In the English version, he was voiced by Troy Baker, with Matthew Mercer taking over the role since Episode 230; however, Baker reprises the role in &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4&quot;.

===&quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;===
The protagonists of the &quot;&quot; series are Naruto and Hinata&#x27;s son Boruto Uzumaki, Sasuke and Sakura&#x27;s daughter Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru&#x27;s son Mitsuki, and Konohamaru Sarutobi who form . Prior to their series, Konohamaru was a supporting character in the &quot;Naruto&quot; series while Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki were introduced in the &quot;Naruto&quot; epilogue.

====Boruto Uzumaki====

 is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga who attends Konoha&#x27;s ninja academy, inheriting his paternal family&#x27;s short blond hair, blue eyes and father&#x27;s verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal family&#x27;s Gentle Fist technique despite not inheriting the Byakugan, unlike his sister Himawari. Just as his father pulled pranks to have his existence acknowledged, Boruto commits mischief to get his father&#x27;s attention after his rise to Hokage, such as defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue. Boruto also admires his father&#x27;s rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student. In &quot;&quot;, and its retellings, Boruto joins the Chunin Exams with his best friend Shikadai and their teammates, and attempts to cheat his way through the exams. When Naruto gets abducted by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, Boruto makes peace with his father and helps him and Sasuke defeat the Otsutsuki, and is branded by the dying entity with a mark called Karma. He resolves to take Sasuke&#x27;s path to aid the Hokage from the shadows. While able to use a Rasengan, Boruto accidentally develops the Vanishing Rasengan as a signature attack. Boruto can activate the Jougan in his right eye, though only with the Karma activated. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; and by Yuuko Sanpei in all subsequent appearances. In the English version, he is voiced by Maile Flanagan in &quot;The Last&quot; and by Amanda C. Miller in all subsequent appearances.

====Sarada Uchiha====

 is the daughter of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother&#x27;s verbal tic and her father&#x27;s aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge and commend others. Sarada is the central character of &quot;&quot;, searching for her estranged father while mistakenly feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada feels hurt and betrayed when she incorrectly suspects being Karin&#x27;s biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family is not a matter of blood, Sarada eventually learns that Sakura is her real biological mother as Karin later explains she was Sakura&#x27;s midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her by poking her forehead, and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage, She finds him an annoying Boruto, but it is later hinted that she has a mutual crush on him. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese, while in the English version she is voiced by Laura Bailey in &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4&quot; and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances.

====Mitsuki====

 is a teammate of Boruto and Sarada, a mysterious boy with a calm mind and a penchant for making snide remarks. His backstory is explored in &quot;Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon&quot;, which reveals that Mitsuki is an artificial human created by Orochimaru, and a modified clone of him, gaining the name Mitsuki from the fact that he is a for the to inhabit. He tested by Orochimaru and another of his creations called to determine his allegiance; Mitsuki decided to follow his own path as the &quot;moon&quot; instead of a vessel, setting out toward the Hidden Leaf to find his &quot;sun&quot;: Boruto Uzumaki. Mitsuki can extend his limbs by using chakra to dislocate his joints, while the experimentation by Orochimaru allows him to access Sage Mode. He is voiced by Ryūichi Kijima in Japanese and by Robbie Daymond in the English dub.

====Konohamaru Sarutobi====
, named after Konohagakure, is the grandson of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi. He strives to replace his grandfather as Hokage so the villagers will recognize him by name, not simply as the Hokage&#x27;s grandson. He looks to Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the Rasengan and the Sexy Jutsu. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first. By the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is the captain of Team Konohamaru. Konohamaru&#x27;s design caused great difficulties for Masashi Kishimoto; he intended for Konohamaru to look like a &quot;punk&quot; smaller than Naruto, yet all of his attempts resulted in a recreation of Naruto. He eventually gave Konohamaru small, angry-looking eyes and was instantly happy with the design. While voiced in the Japanese anime by Ikue Ōtani and by Akiko Koike as a stand-in, Konohamaru&#x27;s adult self is voiced by Hidenori Takahashi. In the English version, Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey voices Konohamaru&#x27;s pre-adult self, and Max Mittelman voices his adult self.

==Secondary characters==
===Team 8===
 is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Kurenai Yuhi. The members of Team 8 primarily concentrate on tracking, with each of the members&#x27; unique abilities used in this role. During Part II, Team 8, excluding Kurenai due to her pregnancy, joins Naruto Uzumaki and Team 7 in their search for Itachi Uchiha and Sasuke Uchiha.

====Hinata Hyuga====

 is a member of Team 8 who suffers from a lack of self-confidence. Though born of the Hyuga clan&#x27;s main house and raised to become future head of the clan, Hinata&#x27;s shyness and inability to stand up for herself resulted in the strong disapproval of her father Hiashi after being defeated by her younger sister Hanabi, who became their father&#x27;s successor. Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi. Under Kurenai&#x27;s guidance, Hinata began training her strength in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father. Hinata&#x27;s growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto Uzumaki, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses, Hinata&#x27;s admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into true love. During Part II, Hinata confesses her romantic feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas&#x27; battle with the Ten-Tails. Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura Ōtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue. Her voice actress in the Japanese anime is Nana Mizuki, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh.

====Kiba Inuzuka====
 is a member of Team 8 from the Inuzuka Clan, a group of ninja with canine characteristics who train alongside their partners. In stark contrast to his teammates, Kiba is brash, impulsive, and loud-mouthed, and considers Naruto a rival after Naruto defeats him in the Chunin Exams. Despite this, he is very protective of his teammates, and displays the same loyalty to Akamaru, unwilling to abandon him and putting himself in harm&#x27;s way for Akamaru&#x27;s sake. In exchange for Kiba&#x27;s devotion, Akamaru fights with him in battle; he uses his heightened senses to Kiba&#x27;s advantage, and helps double-team opponents with volleys of physical attacks. Since Akamaru is naturally better equipped for combat, Kiba usually modifies his own abilities at the start of a battle, growing claws and running on four limbs to increase his speed. He can also drastically increase his sense of smell, and by the second half of the series he can use it to track things dogs cannot. In the series epilogue, Kiba ends up living with Tamaki, the granddaughter of the Uchiha Clan&#x27;s supporter Granny Cat, and the two house various dogs and cats. Kiba&#x27;s voice actor in the Japanese anime is Kōsuke Toriumi, and his English voice actor is Kyle Hebert.

====Akamaru====
 is Kiba Inuzuka&#x27;s ninja dog, best friend, and constant companion. At the start of the series, Kiba carries Akamaru around on his head or inside his jacket. By Part II of the &quot;Naruto&quot; storyline, Akamaru grows large enough for Kiba to ride atop his back, though Kiba comically fails to notice this drastic difference. With his heightened sense of smell, hearing, and ability to detect others&#x27; chakra levels, Akamaru acts as a valuable tool for Kiba in hostile situations. To help Kiba beat track of opponents, Akamaru uses scent marking, though in battle he relies on Kiba to provide the chakra for the combination attacks they execute, which require Akamaru to transform into a clone of Kiba. In the series epilogue, an aged Akamaru fathers a litter of puppies, among the assortment of animals living with Kiba and Tamaki. In the Japanese version of the anime, Akamaru is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, also the voice actor for Naruto Uzumaki, and Kōsuke Toriumi, who voices Kiba, when Akamaru transforms into a clone of Kiba. In the English adaptation of the anime, Akamaru&#x27;s vocal effects as a puppy are provided by Jamie Simone though Kyle Hebert provided the voice of Akamaru when he took Kiba&#x27;s form.

====Shino Aburame====
 is a member of Team 8 from the Aburame Clan, a group of ninja who formed a symbiosis with a special breed of insects known as by allowing the insects to use their bodies as hives. During a battle, Shino directs his bugs towards an opponent, boxing them in and absorbing their chakra once they have been surrounded. Shino&#x27;s merciless tendencies towards opponents, as well as his attachment to and collection of insects, have caused other characters to label him as &quot;creepy&quot;. Nevertheless, Shino cares deeply for his teammates, being acutely aware of their inner workings and always regretting when he is unable to help them; he is also capable of childish emotions, as shown in the anime when he sulks after Naruto (returning after two and a half years) fails to remember his name or recognize him. In the series epilogue, Shino becomes a Ninja Academy teacher. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Shinji Kawada. His first voice actor in the English anime was Sam Riegel, who voiced Shino in episodes 23 and 24, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Derek Stephen Prince.

====Kurenai Yuhi====
 is the leader of Team 8, a skilled user of genjutsu, particularly skilled with illusions involving plants. Of all her students, Kurenai is closest with Hinata, acting as a surrogate parent in the absence of Hinata&#x27;s father, and helping Hinata overcome her weaknesses. Whenever Kurenai appears in the series, she is usually accompanied by her childhood friend Asuma Sarutobi, and during Part II of the series, Kurenai is revealed to be pregnant with Asuma&#x27;s child. Several months after Asuma&#x27;s death, Kurenai gave birth to their daughter Mirai Sarutobi, who later becomes a kunoichi by the events of the series epilogue. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Rumi Ochiai. In the English adaptation of the anime, she was voiced by Saffron Henderson in episode three, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in all subsequent appearances.

===Team 10===
 is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Asuma Sarutobi. The fathers of the three team members Choji Akimichi, Shikamaru Nara, and Ino Yamanaka were also on a team together, and both generations refer to their team using the moniker &quot;Ino-Shika-Cho&quot;. During Part II, Asuma is slain in an encounter with members of Akatsuki, and Kakashi Hatake briefly assumes leadership of the team to hunt down those responsible for Asuma&#x27;s death. In the series epilogue, the three living members of Team Asuma are training their children to become the next &quot;Ino-Shika-Cho&quot; group.

====Shikamaru Nara====

 is a member of Team 10. Creator Kishimoto has noted that he &quot;likes&quot; Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha&#x27;s intelligent but abrasive personality. Shikamaru&#x27;s intelligence is such that Asuma Sarutobi, Team 10&#x27;s leader, is never able to defeat Shikamaru at games such as shogi or go, and he can devise complex strategies even in the heat of battle. However, his laziness frequently prevents him from effectively utilizing his intelligence. Shikamaru is a longtime friend of Choji Akimichi, choosing to look upon Choji as a person without considering his large girth. Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he is one of the few people to have acknowledged him as a person rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto&#x27;s close friends since then. In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and, by extending it into another person&#x27;s shadow, can force the target to mimic his movements. In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto&#x27;s advisor and is revealed to have married Temari, who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, and with whom he has a son, Shikadai. In the Japanese anime, Shikamaru&#x27;s voice actor is Showtaro Morikubo, although Nobutoshi Canna acted as a stand-in for Morikubo in episode 141. His English voice actor is Tom Gibis.

====Choji Akimichi====
 is a member of Team 10, typified by his affinity for food. Though his habit of always eating gives him a relatively portly appearance, Choji insists he is not fat, instead using explanations like being &quot;big-boned&quot;. If someone refers to him as fat, Choji instantly becomes hostile and increases his resolve to battle, even killing one of the Sound Four during one occurrence. Shikamaru Nara has never found an issue with Choji&#x27;s weight, instead choosing to look upon Choji&#x27;s inner strength. Because of this, Choji regards him as his best friend, stating he would willingly give his life to defend Shikamaru. In battle, Choji can increase the size of his body to improve the amount of damage his strikes deal upon impact. He can also use his clan&#x27;s signature which converts his body fat to chakra. In the series epilogue, Choji has married Karui of the Hidden Cloud Village and they have a daughter Chocho Akimichi. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Kentarō Itō and his English voice actor is Robbie Rist.

====Ino Yamanaka====
 is a member of Team 10 and Yamanaka Clan, and the only daughter of Inoichi Yamanaka, typified by her affinity of being fashionable and good looks, making her a popular girl in the academy. She is a childhood friend of Sakura Haruno, helping her to develop her own identity and defending her from bullies. When they discovered that they both liked Sasuke Uchiha, their friendship was ended. The two eventually make amends and rekindle their friendship, but still maintain a competitive attitude toward each other. In the anime, when Sakura begins to excel in healing techniques, Ino becomes motivated to learn Medical Ninjutsu, hoping to be even more useful to her friends and teammates as an able medical ninja. 
Ino and Naruto are good friends for most of the time, despite they are close comrades. At beginning of the story, she&#x27;s not happy with his ninja misbehavior, but later she finally understands about his good deeds, really accepting him as one of his friends. As they grew older, Naruto and Ino get along well and she respects who Naruto became, and during the anime she is shown to have more sympathy and loyalty towards him. After Pain&#x27;s defeat, Ino would also secretly remark that she could almost fall in love with Naruto who is a true hero. In terms of combat abilities, Ino specializes in mind-altering techniques. Ino can transfer her consciousness to her target&#x27;s mind, gaining control over their body and actions which she can then use to attack others, to spy or to immobilize/distract. She can also communicate telepathically by connecting minds of people around her, and in addition, she is a sensory ninja, able to detect chakra around her. During the death of her father, it was revealed that Ino was raised to embody the title of the &#x27;Purple Buschlover&#x27; represented in the Yamanaka Clan&#x27;s crest, which is a blunt and candid love that treasures bonds. In the series&#x27; epilogue, Ino has married Sai and they have a son, Inojin, and become the head of her clan and the Leader of the Village&#x27;s Sensory Unit as well as the owner of her family&#x27;s flowershop.

====Asuma Sarutobi====
 was the leader of Team 10 and son of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and uncle of Konohamaru Sarutobi. In battle, Asuma wielded trench knives that he could infuse with his wind nature chakra to extend the blades&#x27; length and sharpness. When he was younger, Asuma had a dispute with his father and briefly left Konohagakure in protest, gaining fame as a member of the Land of Fire&#x27;s Twelve Guardian Shinobi. Though Asuma eventually returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha&#x27;s next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen&#x27;s death. Asuma was usually seen smoking a cigarette, but would temporarily drop the habit when something was bothering him, such as when his father died. Among all his students, Asuma shared a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together. Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child. After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor&#x27;s ideals as he uses his knuckles to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife. Asuma&#x27;s voice actor in the Japanese anime is Jūrōta Kosugi, and he is voiced by Doug Erholtz in the English adaptation.

===Team Guy===
 is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Might Guy. The members of Team Guy primarily concentrate on physical attacks and weapons. They are a year older than the other members of Konohagakure&#x27;s teams, as Guy wanted to wait a year before they could take the test to advance in ninja rank and become Chunin. In Part II, Team Guy joins Team 7 in an attempt to save Gaara from the criminal organization, Akatsuki.

====Rock Lee====

 is a member of Team Guy and the favorite student of team leader Might Guy. In the ninja academy, Rock Lee was unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu techniques, but his persistence impressed Guy. Guy spends much of his free time training with Lee to help him accomplish his dream of becoming a respected ninja by using only taijutsu. Lee has adopted several of Guy&#x27;s habits because of this, such as his wardrobe and his perseverance. Guy has taught him a number of powerful, even forbidden, techniques. Because some of these techniques, such as the ability to open the eight chakra gates, can pose a severe risk to Lee&#x27;s body, he is only permitted to use them to protect something or someone dear to him. During the Chunin Exams, Lee loses use of both his left arm and leg, but his injuries are healed following Tsunade&#x27;s return to Konoha. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Yoichi Masukawa, and his voice actor is Brian Donovan in English.

====Neji Hyuga====
 was a member of Team Guy and a child prodigy of the Hyuga clan, as well as Hinata&#x27;s cousin. As he was the only ninja of his generation to be promoted to the rank of Jonin during Part II, he frequently acted as leader of his assigned teams and the secondary leader of Team Guy when Might Guy is absent. Though a member of the branch house, Neji displayed his title as a prodigy of the Hyuga throughout the series as a master of his clan&#x27;s Gentle Fist style of combat that he taught to himself. Originally, Neji believed in a fatalistic philosophy: that one&#x27;s destiny is inescapable and that a weak person will always be weak.

After being defeated in the Chunin Exams Final Round by Naruto Uzumaki, who defied his own &quot;fate&quot; and used Nine-Tailed-Fox&#x27;s chakra, Neji had a change of heart once Uncle Hiashi reveals the full story of his father&#x27;s death, Hizashi Hyuga, as an act of self-sacrifice in place of his twin brother. Neji then abandons his belief in determinism and resolves to get strong enough to never lose a battle and change the fates of his loved ones. As the series progressed, Neji refined his Gentle Fist and devised original variations that either increased their potency or fixed flaws such as the blind spot in his Byakugan. Neji also remedied the estranged relations between himself and the members of the main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I. Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrificed himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha&#x27;s attack, telling Naruto that he made the choice to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war&#x27;s conclusion, a memorial was held in Neji&#x27;s honor. Years after the war, Naruto paid tribute to Neji by naming his son Boruto Uzumaki whose name means &quot;bolt&quot; while Neji&#x27;s name means &quot;screw&quot;. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Kōichi Tōchika, and when he is featured as a child, he is voiced by Keiko Nemoto. His voice in the English anime is provided by Steve Staley, and Wendee Lee provides his child voice.

====Tenten====
 is a member of Team Guy. Of all the &quot;Naruto&quot; protagonists, Tenten (is an only one girl character whose) receives the least screen time in the series.. In battle, Tenten specializes in weaponry, ranging from projectiles to close-combat weapons and even explosives by the second part of the series. Tenten uses this expertise to help Neji Hyuga train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks. In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop. Her Japanese voice actress is Yukari Tamura, and her English voice actress is Danielle Judovits.

====Might Guy====
 is the leader of Team Guy who dedicates most of his time to his pupil Rock Lee, who emulates himself in his sensei&#x27;s image and ideals, including his &quot;My Rules&quot; philosophy, which involves setting tough self-imposed penalties for failure in the belief that the punishment will make him stronger. Like Lee, Guy relies on his mastery of taijutsu, but unlike his pupil he is fully capable of using ninjutsu and genjutsu. He taught Lee many of the techniques he learned from his father Might Duy, such as the ability to unlock the Eight Gates which safely restrict the flow of chakra through the body. When not teaching Lee, Guy is usually found competing with his self-proclaimed childhood rival, Kakashi Hatake. Throughout the series, Kakashi never displays a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat him. Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with Kisame Hoshigaki, beating him single-handedly on two occasions. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara. Though Naruto uses the power of the Sage of Six Paths to save his life, Guy&#x27;s right leg is too damaged to be fully healed. Though he is not wavered from his shinobi career, he remains in a paraplegic state by the events of the epilogue.

Series creator Masashi Kishimoto had likened Guy&#x27;s passionate personality to that of a physical education teacher he had in junior high school, but notes that the teacher was not a model for Guy&#x27;s character. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Masashi Ebara (who also voices Guy&#x27;s father, Duy), with Mayuki Makiguchi voicing him as a child. In the English anime, Guy is voiced by Skip Stellrecht (except in &quot;Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Matthew Mercer), with Todd Haberkorn voicing him as a child.

===Sand Siblings===
The are ninjas from the village of Sunagakure and the children of the Fourth Kazekage, the former leader of the village. They come to Konohagakure to participate in the biannual Chunin exams, and serve as antagonists in the subsequent invasion of Konohagakure. Because of their interactions with Naruto Uzumaki, and learning their father was murdered by their supposed ally Orochimaru, the Sand Siblings return as allies of Konohagakure, aiding Naruto&#x27;s group in their attempts to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha from Orochimaru&#x27;s forces. Kishimoto changed their costumes for their return due to the difficulty in drawing their original attire, as well as to symbolize their new friendship with Konohagakure. In Part II, Gaara becomes Kazekage with his older siblings serving under him as his bodyguards during the Kage Summit at the Land of Iron.

====Baki====
Baki is the Sand Siblings&#x27; instructor and a member of Sunagakure&#x27;s advisory council. He killed Gekko Hayate during the Konoha Crush.

====Gaara====

 is the youngest of the three siblings, created as a foil to Naruto Uzumaki, with a similar background yet a highly divergent personality. Before being born, Gaara was made into a weapon by his father by becoming the Jinchuriki of the Tailed Beast . This act caused the death of his mother during labor and Gaara was placed in the care of his mother&#x27;s younger brother. Like any other Jinchuriki and because his sand unconsciously attacked those around him when he was threatened, Gaara was tormented by his fellow villagers as well as his uncle. Unlike Naruto, however, Gaara comes to see himself as omnipotent and that anyone who challenges him or his power must die. When he battles Naruto during the invasion of Konoha, learning that he is also a Jinchuriki like himself, Gaara&#x27;s outlook changes as he resolves to help others and he succeeds his deceased father as Sunagakure&#x27;s Fifth Kazekage during Part II. Gaara&#x27;s Japanese voice actor is Akira Ishida and his English voice actor is Liam O&#x27;Brien.

====Kankuro====
 is the middle of the three siblings. For the first half of the series, he is frequently at odds with Gaara, though he tends to hold his tongue for fear of being killed. In Part II, once Gaara begins to reveal his dreams and motivations to Kankuro, Kankuro becomes very protective of Gaara; he lashes out at anyone who speaks poorly of Gaara and when Gaara is kidnapped, he readily risks his life to save him. Kankuro is a talented puppeteer, normally using his bladed attack puppet and trapping puppet in combination attacks. He also possesses the large puppet that provides him with combination defense and offense. After his puppets were destroyed by their creator, Kankuro gains a new puppet in Sasori&#x27;s lifeless body and modifies it for his use as a normal puppet. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, after defeating the reanimated Sasori and breaking Kabuto&#x27;s hold over him, Kankuro is entrusted with the Mother and Father puppets. In the series epilogue, Kankuro continues to serve as Gaara&#x27;s bodyguard. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Yasuyuki Kase, and his English voice actor is Michael Lindsay, until he was replaced by Doug Erholtz in 2013 (after the former retired the previous year).

====Temari====
 is the oldest of the three siblings. Unlike her more combat-loving brothers, Temari values peace, as she questions Sunagakure&#x27;s justifications for going to war with Konohagakure. This trait carries over to Part II, in which she begins acting as a liaison between Sunagakure and Konohagakure to help the two villages work together. In her time in Konohagakure, Temari is often seen walking with Shikamaru Nara, causing other characters to think they are dating, although both deny this. In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent&#x27;s strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy. During Part I of the series, Temari is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, in which she can summon a powerful scythe-wielding weasel called . In the series epilogue, Temari is revealed to have moved to the Hidden Leaf and married Shikamaru, with whom she has a son, Shikadai.

But during the events of &quot;Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring&quot;, Chocho becomes conscious of her weight while starting to think that she might be an adopted child. Chocho accompanies her friend Sarada in search of her father, Sasuke, believing the trip to be in search of her &quot;real&quot; father instead.

Zabuza possesses a sword called . After a failed coup d&#x27;état, wherein he tried to assassinate the Fourth Mizukage, Zabuza and his followers fled the village and began working as mercenary assassins. He also takes in a young boy, Haku, as his apprentice, mostly treating him as a tool although he ultimately does care for him. Zabuza is skilled in water-based abilities, but his area of expertise is in assassinations in areas covered by mist. His talents lead to his commission by a criminal named Gato to kill a man named Tazuna, which he is unable to perform due to interference by Tazuna&#x27;s bodyguard, Kakashi Hatake. Because he takes too long to complete the task, his contract is revoked, and his employer tries to have Zabuza killed. Having been redeemed by Naruto, Zabuza kills him first, though is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards. He is one of the shinobi resurrected by Kabuto to fight on the Akatsuki side and is defeated, being sealed during a rematch with Kakashi. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Unshō Ishizuka, and his English voice actor is Steven Blum.

===Haku===
 is Zabuza Momochi&#x27;s most faithful follower. Before he started working for Zabuza, Haku lived as an orphan. His father killed his mother when it was discovered that Haku possesses a genetic ability, , that allows him to mix wind and water elements to create ice, which was considered a threat. Haku then killed his father. After wandering from place to place, he was found by Zabuza, who recognized Haku&#x27;s talents and agreed to take him in as a tool. As a result, Haku becomes unquestioningly protective of and loyal to Zabuza, and only by being useful does he find a purpose in life. Haku later meets Naruto (who mistakes him for a girl) while he is training, and the two bond over their connections. On this same mission, Haku ultimately gives his life in his mission to save his master from Kakashi&#x27;s Lightning Blade, becoming the first casualty in the series. This is not in vain, however, as a saddened Naruto uses Haku&#x27;s death to redeem Zabuza.

 is a criminal who served as the principal villain of Part I, having previously affiliated with the Akatsuki. He was a former Hidden Leaf ninja and Hiruzen&#x27;s student alongside his teammates Jiraiya and Tsunade, who are revered as the Legendary Sannin. Orochimaru&#x27;s desire for immortality, so he can learn every jutsu in existence, led him to experimenting on fellow ninja before establishing his own ninja village, the Hidden Sound Village, as his personal laboratory, to continue his work while amassing a personal army to destroy Konoha. His immortality technique involves transferring his consciousness between different host bodies every few years, with his intent to acquire the body of Sasuke Uchiha being his driving motivations throughout most of the series. Following end of Part II, through kept under watch by Yamato, Orochimaru renounced his personal war against the Hidden Leaf Village. He has since created Mitsuki.

Kishimoto emphasized Orochimaru&#x27;s role as a villain by giving him a &quot;pasty and sickly&quot; complexion as part of his theme of distinguishing villains from the protagonists. Because of his different host bodies and the disguises he assumes, a panoply of voice actors are used for Orochimaru; his voice actor for his normal form in the Japanese anime is Kujira, and his corresponding English voice actor is Steven Blum, except in the spin off &quot;Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Vic Mignogna.

===Kabuto Yakushi===
 is a spy who works as Orochimaru&#x27;s right hand, though he acts on his own whims. As a child with no memory of his past, Kabuto was found on a battlefield by a nun from Konohagakure who raised him before he was recruited by the Foundation as their spy to infiltrate numerous countries and organizations. But after being labeled a risk to the Foundation for knowing too many secrets, Kabuto becomes Orochimaru&#x27;s spy after being promised an identity he can call his own. Using his former affiliations, and infiltrating the Akatsuki, Kabuto gathers intelligence on Orochimaru&#x27;s behalf; for instance, he participates in the bi-annual Chunin Exams as a Konoha representative to gather information on his fellow participants. Highly proficient with medical techniques and genetic manipulation, Kabuto devises means to heal wounds by reactivating dead cells to grow new ones, and can form a scalpel with chakra to deal surgical strikes to his opponents.

In Part II, after his mentor&#x27;s defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto integrates some of Orochimaru&#x27;s remains into his body to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again. Kabuto then masters snake Sage Jutsu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke upon victory against the Ninja Alliance. However, during the second day of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto&#x27;s control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke&#x27;s help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi&#x27;s Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself and his life, coming to the conclusion that he should save Sasuke. In the war&#x27;s aftermath, kept under surveillance by the Hidden Leaf, Kabuto returns to run the orphanage where he was held as a kid, together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.

===Sound Four===

 are Orochimaru&#x27;s elite bodyguards. The group was originally known as the &quot;Sound Five&quot;, but after Kimimaro became bedridden due to his unknown illness, the group resumed calling themselves the Sound Four. As a group they specialize in barriers, defensive walls, sealing techniques as well as possessing their own individual unique techniques and Curse Marks that increase their strengths. The group is composed of:
*, a large, and quick-tempered, man who specializes in absorbing chakra and close-quarters combat. He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Michael Sorich.
*, a six-armed ninja who can produce spider-webs to fight and specialized in ranged combat. He is voiced by Susumu Chiba in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Peter Lurie.

The Sound Four do not become a prominent part of the story until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke&#x27;s passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness in the midst of his battle against Gaara and Rock Lee. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war&#x27;s climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five&#x27;s DNA to access their abilities.

===Akatsuki===
The is an organization of rogue ninja that serves as the primary antagonistic force of the second part of the &quot;Naruto&quot; series. It was founded by Yahiko, Nagato and Konan. After Yahiko&#x27;s death, it was led by Nagato with Obito as his benefactor. The Akatsuki&#x27;s goal is world peace through the power of the nine Tailed Beasts, with Nagato assuming it would involve mass destruction giving way to a world without war. To achieve their goal of collecting all nine Tailed Beasts, the Akatsuki recruited several rogue ninjas, including Deidara, Sasori, and Hidan, among other notable Akatsuki members, to join their ranks. The actual goal is for Obito to enact Madara&#x27;s , which involves feeding the Tailed Beasts to the Gedo Statue, to revert it into the Ten-Tails with Obito as its Jinchuriki; empowered thus, he would project the Infinite Tsukiyomi on the moon&#x27;s surface, and bring all life into a utopic illusion. The members of the Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the &quot;Naruto&quot; universe. Aside from an attempt by members Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki to capture Kurama (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), the Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I. In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing Gaara and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as progressively capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts. Kishimoto called the Akatsuki&#x27;s members antiheroes as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series&#x27; protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains.

====Obito Uchiha====

, also known under his alias is the true leader of the Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi&#x27;s teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin after she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito&#x27;s right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter&#x27;s original left eye. Obito finds himself saved by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics, and is conditioned to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin&#x27;s death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara&#x27;s name following the latter&#x27;s death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko&#x27;s death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki. Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragedy prior to the series, most notably Kurama&#x27;s attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not protecting Rin. Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to cast Kamui in a fashion that renders him intangible and lets him teleport over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama&#x27;s cells.

====Zetsu====
 is the only member of the Akatsuki without a bespoke partner, the only nonhuman member, and Obito&#x27;s right-hand man. Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like parasitic entity known as to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history for one of them to manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he had created the entity. was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling to fend off her kinsmen, consisting of humans mutated into drones after being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya&#x27;s previous Infinite Tsukuyomi. Black Zetsu and White Zetsu operate in symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location, and use spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches. This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those the organization does not want found. Another of the White Zetsu retrieved from the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, later named , served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth got used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu goes into hiding, later merging itself onto Obito to force the human to resurrect Madara. Ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan runs its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit. Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha, while helping Kaguya fight Naruto and Sasuke. He is eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severs Kaguya&#x27;s arm. As Kaguya is sealed away once more, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator. Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style, before ejecting him once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is cast, crumbles away after the jutsu is canceled, with his former captive the only witness to his death.

As Kishimoto originally planned the Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, though both in the English &quot;Shippuden&quot; anime are voiced by Travis Willingham alongside Tobi and the White Zetsu Army.

====Kisame Hoshigaki====
 is a former ninja of Kirigakure and partnered to Itachi Uchiha, having a unique appearance with pale blue skin, a gill-like facial structure, and sharp acute angled triangle teeth. While he was loyal to Kirigakure, Kisame was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of violent ninja that use particularly large swords in battle. His sword, , is a living weapon covered in scales. Although it was covered in bandage like cloth in the Akatsuki arc (while he was travelling with Itachi Uchiha). That can absorb untold amounts of an opponent&#x27;s chakra. Only allowing those it sees as worthy to wield it, Samehada can provide the user with the chakra it holds, ensuring him an infinite amount of stamina. Kisame himself has massive amounts of chakra, and by fusing Samehada into him, Kisame can assume a shark-like form that increases his abilities. In battle, he frequently shapes water into the forms of sharks to damage opponents. After discarding Samehada when it chose Killer Bee over him, Kisame is decapitated by Killer Bee and the Raikage using Double Lariat. It is later revealed that the decapitation was just a shapeshifting technique performed by Zetsu; the real Kisame having hidden inside Samehada. He attempts to flee from the ninjas but is defeated by Might Guy and captured. Kisame then commits suicide by summoning sharks and allowing them to eat him, but not before using one of them to steal back the information he had compiled and send it to the Akatsuki. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Tomoyuki Dan; in English, he is voiced at first by Michael McConnohie, later by Kirk Thornton.

====Konan====
 is the only female ninja in the Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being the partner of Pain, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure&#x27;s many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as &quot;God&#x27;s angel&quot;. Under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan&#x27;s abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato&#x27;s death, Konan withdraws her position in the Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto. Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato&#x27;s Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, but is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato&#x27;s resting place. She last sees the endless rain of Amegakure stop for the first time. In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn.

====Nagato====
, primarily known under the alias of , is the recognized leader of the Akatsuki and partner of Konan, with Obito acting as his benefactor. The &quot;Pain&quot; most often seen in the series is the Deva Path, which is actually Nagato&#x27;s deceased friend, , one of six animated corpses collectively known as , all controlled by Nagato and using one sixth of his full power. The Pain Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a &quot;more dangerous&quot; appearance in relation to their name&#x27;s installation.

====Itachi Uchiha====

 is a former ninja of Konohagakure and the partner of Kisame Hoshigaki. Though having spent his early youth as the prodigy of the Uchiha clan, Itachi is treated as a villain for much of the series. He is initially portrayed as being solely responsible for the killing of his entire clan and family, sparing only his brother, Sasuke Uchiha, with the explanation that he was testing his abilities. Around the time of his death his villainous role is downplayed; not only is he revealed to offer help to Obito Uchiha in killing the clan, though it is revealed in part two that he performed the massacre under the orders of Konoha&#x27;s leadership so as to prevent an Uchiha coup d&#x27;état. In the Japanese anime, Itachi&#x27;s voice actor is Hideo Ishikawa. His first voice actor in the English anime was Skip Stellrecht, who voiced Itachi in episodes 29 and 30, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Crispin Freeman.

====Deidara====
 is a former ninja of Iwagakure, having left the village after bombing it. He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join the Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchiha throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes &quot;look down on his artwork&quot;. Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is replaced by Tobi after his death. Though he was annoyed by Tobi, Deidara becomes somewhat of a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being. Both of Deidara&#x27;s hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create &quot;sculptures&quot;, bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara&#x27;s bombs can take any form he chooses, and from the time of their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely. Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi&#x27;s younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt. He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto. In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by Quinton Flynn, and in the anime of &quot;Shippuden&quot; by Roger Craig Smith.

====Hidan====
 is the immortal, foul-mouthed, and sadomasochistic partner of Kakuzu and a former ninja of Yugakure, the Village Hidden in Boiling Water. He is a member of the religion which worships a deity of the same name and believes that anything less than death and utter destruction in battle is a sin. His religion&#x27;s experimentations have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent&#x27;s blood and drawing Jashin&#x27;s triangular symbol on the ground, Hidan can create a link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan&#x27;s body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Though his immortality keeps him from dying or suffer any impairment, Hidan feels his victims&#x27; suffering with an excitement bordering on arousal. After Hidan used this ability to kill Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara fights him to avenge his teacher. Their battle culminates in Hidan being blown up, and Shikamaru burying his still-speaking remains in a forest that the Akatsuki will never be able to reach. As such, Hidan is no longer considered a member by the rest of the Akatsuki. In the Japanese version of the anime, Hidan is voiced by Masaki Terasoma. In the English version, he is voiced by Chris Edgerly and in &quot;&quot; by Wally Wingert.

====Kakuzu====
 is the partner of Hidan and a former ninja of Takigakure, the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. Kakuzu is motivated by greed, and joins the Akatsuki to seek out valuable bounties. However, his extreme temperament and fits of rage leading to his eventual murder of whomever he was partnered with resulted in his pairing with the immortal Hidan. When Kakuzu still lived in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. As the strongest shinobi of his time, Hashirama was far too strong for Kakuzu, and the mission failed with Kakuzu barely escaping with his life. Kakuzu returned to his village, and, despite the overwhelming danger and risk he faced, he was dishonoured and severely punished. Gaining a violent hatred for his village because of this unfair treatment, Kakuzu escaped from prison and, in vengeance, stole his village&#x27;s forbidden techniques, and murdered the village elders (carving out their hearts), becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu&#x27;s body is composed of a large number of black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents and integrate their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart. Kakuzu&#x27;s hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi. After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu&#x27;s Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

====Sasori====
, primarily known as , is a former ninja of Sunagakure and partner of Deidara. When he was a child, Sasori&#x27;s parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, also known as the White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo, who taught Sasori the art of puppetry to cheer him up after his loss, which he refined to fit his needs over the years. However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any ninja abilities they possessed for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage years, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a puppet and using him as his main weapon. Sasori&#x27;s desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once. After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence. In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent much time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with the Akatsuki&#x27;s robe. After he and Deidara kidnap Gaara, Sasori ends up fighting Sakura and Chiyo, resulting in the destruction of his heart, the only part of his humanity he kept when converting himself to a puppet, resulting in his death. Before dying, he tells Sakura about his rendezvous with one of Orochimaru&#x27;s henchmen who had been working for him as a spy. After being resurrected by Kabuto, Sasori fights Kankuro, who convinces him to be at peace with himself. Sasori comes to terms with his life and is able to pass on and rest in peace. In the Japanese anime, Sasori is voiced by Akiko Yajima as a child and by Takahiro Sakurai as an adult. In the English version he is voiced by Kari Wahlgren as a child and as an adult he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. His scorpion-like puppet body, Hiruko, is voiced by Yutaka Aoyama in the Japanese version and in the English version by JB Blanc.

===Madara Uchiha===
 is one of the co-founders of the Hidden Leaf Village along with Hashirama Senju, the two later revealed to be reincarnations of their clans&#x27; founding ancestors Indra and Asura prior to Sasuke and Naruto. Madara is a cynical and vengeful man who holds grudges against the Senju Clan for slaughtering his brothers in the War. He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara&#x27;s overuse of Mangekyo Sharingan blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju. In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to have peace with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama. While working towards this goal, Madara captures Kurama the Nine-Tails and uses him in a scheme to destroy Konoha. Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama&#x27;s hand, but he survives and goes into hiding while taking a blood sample of Hashirama with him to awake his Rinnegan. During this time, Madara takes Obito Uchiha as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later.

During most of the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, Obito uses the name of &quot;Madara&quot;, until Kabuto Yakushi finds the real Madara Uchiha and reanimates him to force Obito into an alliance. Despite their agreement, Kabuto summons Madara to fight against the Shinobi Alliance. Madara manages to sever his connection to Kabuto&#x27;s technique by using the hand signs of the Reanimation Jutsu, defeating most of the Ninja Alliance forces. Madara manages to fully resurrect as planned by sacrificing Obito, becoming the Ten Tails&#x27;s host once he regains one of his Rinnegan. After regaining his other eye, Madara is able to complete the Eye of the Moon Plan before finding himself betrayed by Black Zetsu who proceeds to turn him into a vessel for Kaguya&#x27;s spirit. Though freed upon Kaguya being resealed, the ordeal placed a regretful Madara on the verge of death and dies being able to finally make peace with Hashirama. In the Japanese anime, Madara (and Obito in his Madara guise) is voiced by Naoya Uchida while Gou Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, Madara&#x27;s voice is supplied by Neil Charles Kaplan, with Xander Mobus voicing him as a child.

While Kaguya was revered as the , Kaguya was consumed by her power as eventually lost trust in humanity while converting humans assimilated by the Divine Tree into her personal army of White Zetsu as a defense against her kinsmen. This and the other horrifying acts that Kaguya resulted in the then-powerless people to denounce her as a . Later learning that some of her chakra passed on into her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya attempts to reclaim that power by merging into the Divine Tree and regress it into the . Hagoromo, aided by his brother Hamura, managed to defeat the monster and seal him in his body, becoming the first jinchūriki. Shortly before dying, the Sage decided to divide the demon&#x27;s chakra into nine parts and, through a technique known as &quot;perfect Izanagi&quot; of Yin-Yang, he gave birth to the bodies of the nine tailed beasts into which she infused all of her mother&#x27;s chakra her. She eventually sealed the Ten-Tails&#x27; soulless body with the Chibaku Tensei, trapping him in an enormous mass of rocks, which would later be known as the Moon. But Kaguya created Black Zetsu at the last second to orchestrate her return by influencing Hagoromo&#x27;s eldest son Indra and the Uchiha Clan. Having successfully manipulated Madara Uchiha into eventually casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi while having the Ten-Tails corpse absorbed by the Uchiha, Black Zetsu betrays Madara and converts him into a vessel for Kaguya to inhabit. From there, deeming Naruto and Sasuke a threat because they are the current reincarnations of her grandsons and because of their resemblance to her own children, Kaguya takes Team 7 and Obito into her dimensional realms to kill them there. But after being overpowered by Naruto and Sasuke with Sakura preventing her escape, Kaguya is resealed with the tailed beasts and Madara extracted from her body.

He is also considered by many to be the fastest ninja in the world following Minato&#x27;s death, up until when Naruto is able to dodge his attacks. A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates. After Killer Bee is seemingly abducted by Taka, A resolves to kill Sasuke and ridicules Naruto for trying to defend him. He and Sasuke later fight at the Five Kage Summit, during which A loses his left arm; after learning the truth about Killer Bee, he helps him defeat Kisame. A eventually becomes the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and after allowing Naruto and Killer Bee to fight in the war once they defeat him, fights and loses against Madara. Sometime between the war&#x27;s end and the series epilogue, he steps down as Raikage and is succeeded by Darui. A is voiced by Hideaki Tezuka in Japanese and by Beau Billingslea in English.

====Darui====
 is a Kumogakure ninja who serves as one of the bodyguards for the Fourth Raikage during the Kage Summit. In contrast to his master, he is easygoing and tends to apologize, which the Raikage chastises him for. He is taught by the Third Raikage on the arts of black lightning, shaping it in the form of black panther, and also possesses the Storm Style kekkei genkai, a mixture of lightning and water elements that forms flowing lightning. During the Fourth Ninja War, Darui leads the First Division specializing in mid-range battles. Sometime between the war&#x27;s end and the series epilogue, he becomes the . During Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Darui goes to the Leaf Village to oversee the Chunnin Exams. He is voiced by Ryota Takeuchi in the Japanese anime and Catero Colbert in the English dub, though Ogie Banks replaces the latter for the &quot;Ultimate Ninja Storm&quot; series of video games.

====A (Third Raikage)====
 is the . He is known as the greatest Raikage who dueled Eight-Tails, faced an army by himself.

====Karui====
 is one of Killer Bee&#x27;s subordinates, a part of Team Samui. She is greatly worried by her teacher&#x27;s disappearance following his fight with Taka and visits Konohagakure with her team in order to find him. A passionate and bold young woman, she quickly becomes involved in an altercation with Team Kakashi, blaming them for befriending and defending Sasuke Uchiha. She even proceeds to brutally punch Naruto in the face repeatedly after he allows her to do so as compensation for not giving up information on Sasuke. Karui is assigned as part of the Second Division during the Fourth Ninja War. Sometime after the war ends, she moves to Konohagakure and marries Choji Akimichi, giving birth to their daughter Chocho, who is an academy student in the series epilogue. Kauri is voiced by Yuka Komatsu in the Japanese anime. In the English dub, Danielle Nicolet voices the character in &quot;Naruto&quot; and Sascha Alexander in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;.

===Kirigakure===
====Mei Terumi====
 is the of the Kirigakure. She possesses two kekkei genkai: the Lava Style, a combination of fire and earth elements that allows her to spit lava, and Vapor Style, which mixes fire and water to create corrosive mist. She is apparently relatively new to the position and does not remember the previous leadership, which conducted witch hunts against kekkei genkai users like her, fondly. During the Kage Summit, Mei acts rather dodgy when asked about rumors that the Akatsuki formed in her village, and when she finds out Danzo is capable of mind control she suspects him of using it on the previous Mizukage. She manages to nearly kill Sasuke during the meeting and initially helps guard the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries during the preparation for the Fourth Ninja War. During the war, Mei fights the revived Madara Uchiha with the other Kages, though despite their impressive teamwork, they still end up losing to Madara&#x27;s might. Years after the war comes to an end and during some point at the epilogue, Mei passes down her title to her former bodyguard Chōjūrō. Despite being a beautiful woman in her thirties, she is never married, and the status of being one pains her. She is voiced by Yurika Hino in the Japanese anime, and by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in the English adaptation.

====Chojuro====
 is one of Mei Terumi&#x27;s bodyguards, with the other being Ao. He is one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, carrying the sword , but after Zabuza Momochi and Kisame Hoshigaki are killed, he becomes the only real one left of the Swordsmen; in addition, he is the only one affiliated with the village at the beginning of the series. Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help Naruto defeat Black Zetsu. He later becomes the sometime after the war. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Kouki Miyata, while Brian Beacock provides his voice in the English adaptation.

====Ao====
 is one of Mei Terumi&#x27;s bodyguards. He is a middle-aged ninja who wears an eyepatch on his right eye, a Byakugan he acquired from a main house Hyuga, and is often critical of Chōjūrō&#x27;s indecisiveness due to his upbringing during Hidden Mist Village&#x27;s &quot;Blood Mist&quot; days. When Mifune suggests Danzo Shimura to lead the inter-village effort against the Akatsuki, Ao reveals his Byakugan to confirm that Danzo&#x27;s eye and arm belonged to Shisui Uchiha, whom he fought and aware of the Uchiha&#x27;s ability to covertly manipulate others. Ao then goes after Danzo&#x27;s group when they flee during Taka&#x27;s attack, only to saved by Mei and Chōjūrō when he fell into a trap that Danzo&#x27;s men set up in an attempt to retrieve his Byakugan. Ao serves in the Allied Shinobi Forces as captain of the Sensor Division stationed in the Shinobi Alliance Headquarters in Kumogakure, barely surviving the Ten Tails&#x27; Tailed Beast Bomb when it obliterated their base. Later revealed to have survived in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;, his body has been augmented with Shinobi-Ware prosthetics that include a Type-3 Shinobi Gauntlet replacing his left forearm. Ao had become a sleeper agent for the Kara. He engaged Team Konohamaru and Katasuke, using one of the latter&#x27;s inventions to kill Mugino. A revenge-driven Boruto manages to outwit and overpower Ao, sparing the man&#x27;s life, and making him return to the Shinobi side. Ao ends up sacrificing himself to save Boruto from being crushed by Kashin Koji&#x27;s Boiler Toad. He is voiced by Tadahisa Saizen in the Japanese anime, while Steven Blum voices him in the English adaptation.

====Gengetsu Hozuki====
 was the of Kirigakure. A very tall mustached man with large poofy hair, curious way of dressing and with no eyebrows, he was laid back and very charismatic leader concerned with the welfare of his village. He loathed the Second Tsuchikage and their final confrontation with each other resulted in their mutual deaths. Gengetsu is brought back to life by Kabuto&#x27;s resurrection technique to face the Shinobi Alliance in the Fourth Ninja War. Like other members of the Hozuki clan, he mastered hydrification technique, which manifests itself as an oily, water like substance. He is voiced by Hideyuki Umezu in the Japanese anime, while Jamieson Price voices him in the English adaptation.

===Iwagakure===
====Onoki====
 was the of the Iwagakure, the grandson of the First Tsuchikage Ishikawa, and a protege of his predecessor Mu with longest reign as Kage that allowed him to personally meet many figures long dead in the present, including Madara Uchiha. He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty, and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki members. While Onoki justify hiring the Akatsuki as necessary in protecting his village during its demilitarization, both it and his advanced age kept him from being named leader of the Shinobi Alliance though Sasuke&#x27;s intrusion and Gaara&#x27;s conduct cause Onoki to regain some of more noble traits from his youth. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki&#x27;s techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. In the &quot;Boruto&quot; series, following an attack on his village by a rogue ninja a decade after the Fourth Great Ninja War that took the life of his grandson Kozuchi, Onoki began to develop the Akuta as a defense force to keep people safe and unharmed. He continued perfecting the process after receiving a White Zetsu&#x27;s remains, improving on the Akuta while creating Fabrications like his partial clone son Kū as he orchestrated Mitsuki&#x27;s abduction to refine the process. But upon seeing the extent the Fabrications would go to see his ideals realized, Onoki helps Boruto stop the artificial humans at the cost of his life. Onoki is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime and Steven Blum in the English adaptation.

====Kurotsuchi====
 is Onoki&#x27;s granddaughter and his bodyguard during the Kage Summit. She is a kunoichi who favors her village&#x27;s best interests greatly, even once advising Onoki to kill Naruto and Killer Bee so as to avoid seeing them fall to the Akatsuki. She was also an acquaintance of Deidara before his defection to the Akatsuki. Kurotsuchi participates in the Fourth Ninja War, serving in the Second Division under her father, Kitsuchi. She survives the war and becomes the by the series epilogue, replacing her ailing grandfather. She is voiced by Hana Takeda in the Japanese anime and Laura Bailey in the English adaptation and is also voiced by Cherami Leigh in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;.

====Akatsuchi====
 is one of Onoki&#x27;s bodyguards accompanying him for the Kage Summit. He is a portly and jovial man who is nevertheless loyal and dedicated to his master. Despite his big size, he moves fast and excels in Earth Style, using it to form golems. Like Kurotsuchi, he was a friend of Deidara before his defection to the Akatsuki. Akatsuchi participates in and survives the Fourth Ninja War, continuing to serve as the Tsuchikage&#x27;s personal bodyguard well over into Kurotsuchi&#x27;s reign. He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in Japanese and by Kyle Hebert in English.

====Mu====
 was the of Iwagakure.

===Kurama===
, often called the , is the most powerful of the Tailed Beasts. Used by Madara in his attempt to wipe out Konohagakure at the time of its foundation, Kurama is defeated and sealed within Hashirama&#x27;s wife and then transferred to Kushina Uzumaki two generations later. Through Obito&#x27;s scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, who seals the fox&#x27;s Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series&#x27; start. Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama&#x27;s immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age. But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama&#x27;s power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox&#x27;s chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.

During Naruto&#x27;s fight against Obito, seeing its host&#x27;s resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode. Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto&#x27;s life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki&#x27;s body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. During the events of &quot;Boruto&quot;, Kurama convinces Naruto to use Baryon Mode in the fight against Isshiki, which results in Kurama ceasing to exist with Naruto rendered a normal human. But due to his nature as a Tailed Beast, Kurama eventually reconstitutes within the body of Himawari Uzumaki as she becomes his new Jinchuriki.

Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the character with the same name from the manga series &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by Godzilla.

In the Japanese anime, Kurama&#x27;s voice actor is Tesshō Genda, and in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Paul St. Peter.

===Taka===
, originally named , is a group of shinobi formed by Sasuke originally to locate and kill Itachi Uchiha, but later allied with the Akatsuki to destroy Konohagakure. Each of them were forcibly taken in by Orochimaru and forced to serve under him as Otogakure shinobi along with Sasuke, ultimately seeking redemption by allying with Sasuke. The group gets split up after their attempt at terrorizing the Five Kage Summit, but they later reunite as part of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Following the war, they went back to Otogakure along with Orochimaru.

====Suigetsu Hozuki====
 is the first member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, his goal is to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the organization in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza&#x27;s sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin&#x27;s nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so. Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in &quot;Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.

====Karin====
 is the second member of Taka and a member of the Uzumaki Clan that Naruto, Kushina and Mito belongs to. She was originally from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal servant to him. After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side. Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura&#x27;s daughter, Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other&#x27;s chakra and feel a person&#x27;s aura that way, such as seeing Naruto&#x27;s chakra as &quot;bright and warm&quot;. She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by Kanako Tōjō up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by Ali Hillis except in &quot;Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals&quot;, where she is voiced by Michelle Ruff.

====Jugo====
 is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling. After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro&#x27;s reincarnation. Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in &quot;Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;.

===Danzo Shimura===
 is one of the oldest villagers in Konohagakure, and a moderately cantankerous war hawk who was Hiruzen&#x27;s rival whom he consequently opposed along with the other Hokage for placing world peace above their village&#x27;s best interests. As Hiruzen obtained the Third Hokage title, Danzo uses the Foundation and his own personal Root black ops to secretly oversee their village&#x27;s security along with his personal goal to become a Hokage. This led to Danzo being responsible for events that included Kabuto&#x27;s defection and orchestrating the Uchiha Massacre. The latter event result in him having the transplanted right eye of Shisui Uchiha, whom he killed, along with having Orochimaru using Shin&#x27;s genetic makeup to graft Danzo&#x27;s right arm with a large number of Sharingan eyes and Hashirama&#x27;s cells. Following Pain&#x27;s attack devastating Konohagakure, Danzo took advantage of Tsunade&#x27;s coma in convincing the Fire Country&#x27;s feudal lord to make him Acting and uses his position to decree Sasuke a wanted criminal before attaining the Five Kage summit to convince the formation of the Shinobi alliance with himself as its leader. But the plan fails as Danzo ends up being fatally wounded after being forced to fight Sasuke, using the last of his strength in an attempted sealing jutsu on his killer and Obito. Though the jutsu failed, Danzō destroyed Shisui&#x27;s Sharingan to ensure Tobi would not obtain it. With Danzo&#x27;s death, the Foundation was disbanded in the aftermath of the Fourth Great Ninja War with its members allowed to live in peace while integrating back into society. In the Japanese anime he is voiced by Hiroshi Ito and in the English version he is voiced by William Frederick Knight except in &quot;Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals&quot;, where he is voiced by Richard Epcar.

===Hanzo===
, also known as Hanzō of the Salamander (山椒魚の半蔵, Sanshōuo no Hanzō), was a legendary shinobi, and the leader of Amegakure during his lifetime.
He defeated Konoha&#x27;s Sannin effortlessly, and practically murdered thousands of shinobi and samurai, including Yahiko, which partly caused Akatsuki&#x27;s violent reborn.

===Rin Nohara===
 is a girl member of Team Minato and the teammate of Kakashi Hatake and Obito Uchiha, appearing only in person during the Kakashi Gaiden act. Rin acts as a medical ninja and had a crush on Kakashi, though she is unaware that she herself has the affection of Obito. When Team Minato is sent to sabotage Kannabi Bridge during the Third Great Ninja War, Rin is kidnapped by the Iwagakure ninja before the resulting rescue mission ends with Obito&#x27;s apparent death. Sometime afterward, Rin is captured by the Kirigakure ninja and made into Isobu&#x27;s Jinchuriki as part of a Trojan horse scheme to destroy Konoha. Rin realized the scheme while being rescued and jumped in the way of Kakashi&#x27;s Lightning Blade to save the village at the cost of her life, which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Madara to break Obito&#x27;s spirit. Obito later learns upon his death that Rin&#x27;s spirit has always been waiting for him, and later guides him to the other side after he metaphysically helps Kakashi one last time in his team&#x27;s battle against Kaguya. In the Japanese anime, Rin&#x27;s voice actress is Haruhi Nanao, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh.

===Kushina Uzumaki===
 is the mother of the series&#x27; protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki and the wife of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze. She is a host of Kurama, immediately preceding Naruto. While Naruto physically resembles his father, Minato, he inherits most of his personality from Kushina, who is brash, temperamental, likes ramen, and even has the verbal tic, which both her son and grandson inherit. Being a member of the Uzumaki Clan, Kushina possesses a special chakra that was distinguished even among her peers, causing her to be sent from her homeland to Konohagakure to be the host of Kurama, replacing Mito Uzumaki. In Konohagakure, Kushina met with Minato who became Kushina&#x27;s love after he saved her from a kidnapper, leading to their marriage. During her pregnancy, she had to be sent to a secretive place during labor to prevent Kurama&#x27;s seal being broken. However, the place was subdued by Obito Uchiha, and he released Kurama who ran rampant on Konoha. She and Minato both sacrifice their lives to seal Kurama to Naruto after the tailed beast is weakened from losing his yin-chakra, while also placing some of their chakra to their son as a fail-safe if he would break the seal. In Part II, Kushina&#x27;s chakra appears during Naruto&#x27;s subconscious battle with Kurama, helping her son to seal the fox and to tell him the truth behind Kurama&#x27;s attack sixteen years ago. Before disappearing, she thanks Naruto for forgiving her about the whole ordeal of the sealing of Kurama. In the Japanese anime, Kushina is voiced by Emi Shinohara. She was voiced by Cindy Robinson in the English version before Laura Bailey took over the role since episode 246 and onwards.

===Shisui Uchiha===
, known as , was one of the most talented of the Uchiha clan and Itachi&#x27;s best friend. Shisui possessed unique Mangekyo Sharingan that allow him to use the Kotoamatsukami ability, which allows him to manipulate others without their knowledge. Shisui intended to use Kotoamatsukami to stop the Uchiha&#x27;s coup when Danzo stole one of his eyes, giving his other eye to Itachi to protect the village to his stead as he commits suicide and later found on the river by Uchiha military policemen and assuming Shisui was murdered by Itachi. Danzo had the eye transplanted into him so he can manipulate others like Mifune to achieve his goals, later destroying it in his final moments to prevent Tobi from taking it. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and intended for it to be used by Naruto against Sasuke as a means to stop him from attacking the village. But a reanimated Itachi is forced to use it on himself to break free from Kabuto&#x27;s control, quickly destroying the eye to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hidenobu Kiuchi, while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye.

==Reception==
The characters of &quot;Naruto&quot; have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. &quot;Active Anime&quot; lauded the characters for not being &quot;simple cardboard cut-out characters&quot; due to their &quot;fleshed out personalities&quot; and &quot;underlying dramatic motivations&quot;, and praised the &quot;deeply moving emotional trials&quot; they undergo over the course of the series. Adam Cook of &quot;Anime Boredom&quot; agreed with this assessment, extolling the characters as &quot;well rounded&quot; and &quot;imaginative&quot;, and celebrated how the characters allowed the series to successfully incorporate comedy, action, and drama together in a believable manner. A review from Derrick Tucker, also of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; offered a positive view, commenting that Naruto Uzumaki combined the finer values of his &quot;shōnen&quot; predecessors, but lamented how the characters&#x27; personalities tended to fall between Naruto&#x27;s &quot;charisma and coolness&quot; and Sasuke&#x27;s &quot;blandness&quot;, making it difficult to think about the characters on &quot;any deep or meaningful level&quot;. Justin Rich of the entertainment website Mania asserted that the series lacked the &quot;tremendous depth in characters&quot; or &quot;the most flushed out backgrounds&quot; seen in other &quot;shōnen&quot; series, and believed the primary strength of the series was the fighting.

The visual appearances of the characters in the anime and manga have also received notice from reviewers. Carl Kimlinger of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; praised the characters&#x27; &quot;distinctive clothing, hair, faces and personalities&quot; that made them easily identifiable, as well as Kishimoto&#x27;s &quot;clear eye for geography, movement and the human form&quot; and &quot;impeccable visual timing&quot;. Tucker, on the other hand, described Kishimoto as &quot;an average artist at best&quot; and derided the poor transition of his artistic style into animation. Despite this, he admitted that when the animators were at their best, they produced &quot;artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga&quot;, but ultimately concluded the animation was &quot;a mixed bag&quot;.

<doc id="372806" wikidata="Q845653" url="?curid=372806" title="Et cetera">
<text>Et cetera (, ), abbreviated to etc., et cet., &amp;c. or &amp;c, is a Latin expression that is used in English to mean &quot;and other things&quot;, or &quot;and so forth&quot;. Translated literally from Latin, means , while means ; thus, the expression translates to .

&quot;Et cetera&quot; is a calque of the Koine Greek () meaning &#x27;and the other things&#x27;. The typical Modern Greek form is (), &#x27;and the remainder&#x27;.

== Spelling and usage ==
The one-word spelling &quot;etcetera&quot; appears in some dictionaries. The abbreviated form &quot;&amp;c.&quot; or &quot;&amp;c&quot; is still occasionally used—the ampersand ⟨&amp;⟩, derives from a ligature of .

The phrase &quot;et cetera&quot; is often used to denote the logical continuation of some sort of series of descriptions. For example, in the following expression:

We will need a lot of bread: wheat, granary, wholemeal, etc. on our menu.

In this case of a use at the end of a list without conjunction, a comma is typically written in front of the phrase (but see Serial comma). If etc. is used at the end of a sentence, the dot is not doubled. If it occurs at the end of exclamations, questions or a clause, the dot is not suppressed but followed by whatever punctuation marks are required to end or continue the sentence.
In blackletter (Gothic or Fraktur) typography, the r rotunda ⟨ꝛ⟩ is sometimes used for &quot;et&quot; in place of the similar-looking Tironian et ⟨⁊⟩, followed by &quot;c&quot;, to yield &quot;ꝛc&quot;.

==Similar Latin expressions==
* In lists of people, (abbreviated as &quot;et al.&quot;, meaning &quot;and others&quot;) is used in place of &quot;etc.&quot;
* In lists of places, may be used, which is also abbreviated &quot;et al.&quot;; means &quot;and elsewhere&quot;.
* In references to literature or texts in general, or &#x27;and the words etc. following&#x27; (abbreviated &quot;et seq.&quot;, plural &quot;et seqq.&quot;) are used to indicate that only the first portion of a known reference is given explicitly, with broad reference to the following passages which logically follow in sequence to the explicit reference. Hence &quot;Title VII, Section 4, Subsection A, Paragraph 1, &quot;et seq.&quot;&quot; might refer to many subsections or paragraphs which follow Paragraph 1. Legal briefs and legislative documents make heavy use of &quot;et seq.&quot; Notice that there is a functional difference between &quot;et seq.&quot; and &quot;etc.&quot; Et seq. and its variations refer specifically to known text; etc. may do so too, but is more likely to leave the reader to supply the unspecified items for himself. It would not be helpful to say: &quot;Various paragraphs of import similar to those in Title VII, Sections 4, 7, and 2 &quot;et seq.&quot; though it might make sense to use &quot;etc.&quot; in such a context.

==In popular culture==
In the 1956 film &quot;The King and I&quot;, Yul Brynner repeatedly used the expression &quot;...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...&quot;&quot; in his portrayal of King Mongkut of Siam, to characterize the king as wanting to impress everyone with his breadth of great knowledge and the importance of one with no need to expound. This reflected the usage in the novel, &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, which expressed that king&#x27;s playful understanding of innumerable things with the phrase, &quot;&amp;c., &amp;c.&quot;

== Other uses ==
&quot;Et cetera&quot; and derivatives such as &quot;etceteras&quot;, have long been used airily, humorously or dismissively, often as a cadigan. For example:

* ... he still wanted numberless appendages to make him a fine gentleman, such as a fashionable tailor and hairdresser, an unblushing confidence, together with a long train of etceteras. These fashionable introductories being wanting, Mr Whitmore was obliged to find a substitute... (1823)
* The cost of the locomotives and their etceteras, is to be $136000 – their wear and tear $75600. Etceteras $90000... (1834)
* The etceteras: asteroids, comets and interplanetary dust are chemically speaking, &quot;impurities&quot; and are just a minuscule fraction of planetary matter. (1989)
* Having tried &quot;to recover myth outside the books,&quot; the hidalgo crosses paths with common sense, everyday toils, and the religious dictates of the Counter-Reformation on a journey that tries to rescue chivalric etceteras of old. (2008)

<text>The Royal Canadian Mint () is the mint of Canada and a Crown corporation, operating under an act of parliament referred to as the &quot;Royal Canadian Mint Act&quot;. The shares of the mint are held in trust for the Crown in right of Canada.

The mint produces all of Canada&#x27;s circulation coins, and manufactures circulation coins on behalf of other nations. The mint also designs and manufactures precious and base metal collector coins; gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion coins; medals, as well as medallions and tokens. It further offers gold and silver refinery and assay services.

The mint serves the public&#x27;s interest but is also mandated to operate &quot;in anticipation of profit&quot; (i.e., to function in a commercial manner without relying on taxpayer support to fund its operations). Like private-sector companies, the mint has a board of directors consisting of a chair, the president and CEO of the mint, and eight other directors.

== History ==

For the first fifty years of Canadian coinage (cents meant to circulate in the Province of Canada were first struck in 1858), the coins were struck at the Royal Mint in London, though some were struck at the private Heaton Mint in Birmingham, England. As Canada emerged as a nation in its own right, its need for coinage increased. In 1890, building a branch of the Royal Mint in Ottawa was proposed and was eventually authorized in 1901.

The Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint was officially opened on January 2, 1908. During a short ceremony, Lord Grey and his wife, Lady Grey, activated the presses. The first coin struck was a 50-cent coin. When the facility first opened, it had 61 employees. Three years later, the mint began refining gold by electrolysis in its assay department. This method proved to be too time-consuming, and, in 1915, the mint introduced a new chlorination process developed in Australia to reduce processing times and increase the mint&#x27;s gold refining capacity.
In 1931, Canada became an independent dominion of the British Empire and the assets of the mint were transferred to the Canadian government. In December 1931, the mint was established as the Royal Canadian Mint and as a branch of the Department of Finance via an act of Parliament.

In 1960, Master of the Mint Norval Alexander Parker proposed a new facility to expand minting capacity. At this time, the Ottawa mint had reached capacity while a large number of Canadian 10¢ coins were produced in the Philadelphia Mint in the United States and all numismatic coins were produced in Hull, Quebec. A 1968 study also showed that the Ottawa Mint facility was antiquated. Funds were allocated for a new facility, but no space within Ottawa was found.

In April 1969, the Royal Canadian Mint was reorganized as a Crown corporation via the &quot;Royal Canadian Mint Act&quot; for the purpose of minting coins and associated activities. As a Crown corporation, the mint was no longer a branch of the Department of Finance but operated autonomously with its own board of directors and increased decision-making powers.

Then, in February 1970, Supply and Services Minister James Richardson proposed building the mint&#x27;s new facility in Winnipeg. This was controversial because the minister was himself from Winnipeg, and the facility would be more than from the Ottawa facility. A study showed that the proposal had merit because raw materials could be purchased from a supplier in Alberta, rather than a competitor outside of Canada. Eventually, it was agreed in December 1971 that the mint would build a facility in Winnipeg. In 1972, the land was purchased and construction began, and by 1976 the facility was officially opened.

In March 2012, the Canadian government decided to cease the production of pennies. The final penny was minted at the RCM&#x27;s Winnipeg plant on the morning of May 4, 2012.

In April 2012, the mint announced it was developing MintChip, a digital currency to allow anonymous transactions backed by the Government of Canada and denominated in a variety of currencies. On January 12, 2016, MintChip was sold to Toronto-based nanoPay.

In 2021, reports of racism and sexual harassment at the mint surfaced. A subsequent external report described the workplace culture as &quot;toxic&quot;.

== Operations and institution ==

Traditionally, the president of the Royal Canadian Mint is known as the master of the mint. Since 2018, Marie Lemay has held that position. The board of directors, through the chair, is accountable to the minister of finance. The minister serves as the link between the mint, Cabinet and Parliament.

The mint was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc. from 2007 to 2010.

=== Organizational structure ===

The Royal Canadian Mint is a Crown corporation and operates under the &quot;Royal Canadian Mint Act&quot;. In serving the public&#x27;s interest, a Crown corporation has greater managerial independence than other government entities, meaning it may operate in a commercial manner. Like private sector companies, the mint has a board of directors composed of a chairman, the president and CEO of the mint and eight other directors.

Traditionally, the president and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint is known as the master of the mint. The president is Marie Lemay (appointed in 2019), and the chairman of the board is Phyllis Clark. In descending chronological order, the people who have been the mint&#x27;s master engraver are: Cosme Saffioti, Sheldon Beveridge, Ago Aarand, Walter Ott, Patrick Brindley, Myron Cook, and Thomas Shingles.

The government department responsible for the Royal Canadian Mint is the Department of Finance. There are 10 members of the mint&#x27;s board of directors, and 12 members on its executive team. The Royal Canadian Mint has four lines of business: Bullion and Refinery Service, Canadian Circulation, Foreign Business, and Numismatics.


=== Facilities ===
==== Ottawa facility ====
The Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint was officially opened on January 2, 1908, by Lord Grey and his wife, Lady Grey.

When the facility first opened, it had 61 employees. The last surviving member of the mint&#x27;s original staff was Owen Toller. He started in the mint as a junior clerk and retired as an administrative officer after 45 years of service on January 6, 1953. Toller died in November 1987 at the age of 102.

In 1979, the Royal Canadian Mint building in Ottawa was designated a National Historic Site, on the grounds the building is representative of the federal government&#x27;s approach to using the Tudor-Gothic architectural style to create a distinctive identity in Canada&#x27;s capital, and of the patriation of control over Canada&#x27;s currency from Britain.

==== Winnipeg facility ====

The mint facility in Winnipeg was officially opened in 1976. The new facility was completely different in appearance from the facility in Ottawa. Architect Étienne Gaboury designed a striking triangular building that rises up dramatically from the surrounding prairie. Gaboury was design architect, in collaboration with the Number Ten Architectural Group led by partner-in-charge Allan Hanna. 

The Winnipeg facility produces circulation coins for Canada and other countries, while the Ottawa facility concentrates solely on collector coins.

=== Financial revenues ===
=== Security ===

Royal Canadian Mint Protective Services employs full-time and casual security officers who are responsible for the security and inspection of RCM facilities. They wear a distinctive black uniform with body armour and carry a 9 mm Glock Model 17 while on duty. Their duties include:

* Operating x-ray machines
* Inspection of garbage in high-security production area
* CCTV monitoring
* Access control
* Monitor shipments received and dispatched from RCM facilities
* Security escorts
* Parking management
* Evacuations

Recent issues concerning Royal Canadian Mint assets include:
* In 2000, the Royal Canadian Mint lent a series of the new plated 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ issues to the vending industry for testing purposes. These coins were issued with the letter P below the Queen&#x27;s effigy. Some of these coins were not returned to the RCM by the vendors and it is possible some were sold to collectors at a considerable premium.
* On June 2, 2009, the Auditor General of Canada reported a discrepancy between the mint&#x27;s 2008 financial accounting of its precious metals holdings and the physical stockpile at the plant on Sussex Drive in Ottawa. A review released on December 21 said that all of the misplaced gold was fully accounted for. A previously unaccounted was attributed to estimation errors, and a further was recovered through an extensive refining of slag within the mint.

=== Coin markings, including mint marks and privy marks ===
* A – Used on 2005 palladium test coin to signify the coins were struck from Lot A.
* B – Used on 2005 palladium test coin to signify the coins were struck from Lot B.
* C – Placed on sovereigns produced at the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint, between 1908 and 1919.
* Dot – In December 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in favour of his brother, who became King George VI. The problem was that the Royal Mint had been designing the effigy of King Edward VIII, and now a new effigy had to be created. The 1¢, 10¢ and 25¢ pieces in 1937 were struck from dies with a 1936 date on the reverse. To distinguish that these coins were issued in 1937, a dot mint mark was placed on the 1936 dies, beneath the year. These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready. While the 10¢ and 25¢ coins are more common, the 1¢ coins are rare, with about a half-dozen known to exist. The dot after the date on the 1937 5¢ coin is a minting error caused by a chip in the master dies.
* H – Used to identify coins that were struck for Canada by the Birmingham Mint, also known as the Heaton Mint, until 1907.
* Innukshuk – All circulation coins for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics have the Innukshuk mint mark on the obverse of the coin.
* International Polar Year – The obverse of the 2007 International Polar Year $20 numismatic coin has the logo for the International Polar Year on the obverse of the coin.
* Man Becomes Mountain (Symbol of Paralympics) – All circulation coins for the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics have the Paralympic Games logo on the obverse of the coin.
* Maple leaf – All coins with a maple leaf mint mark were struck in 1948 due to an emergency with coin toolage. The granting of India&#x27;s independence resulted in the removal of IND:IMP (meaning Emperor of India) from King George VI&#x27;s effigy. Due to the demand for circulation coins in 1948, coins for 1948 could not be struck until the new tools were received. The new tools would have the IND:IMP removed from them. In the meanwhile, coins were produced in 1948 with a year of 1947 on them. Referred to as the &quot;1947 Maple Leaf&quot;, a small maple leaf mint mark was struck beside 1947 on the reverse of all coins to signify the year of production.
* P – From 2001 to 2006, most 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and 50¢ coins issued for circulation were struck with a P mint mark to represent the Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s plating process.
* RCM Logo – At the CNA Convention in July 2006, the RCM unveiled its new privy mark to be used on all circulation and numismatic coinage. The agenda behind the implementation of this new privy mark was to help increase the RCM&#x27;s image as a brand. The aim of the logo is to educate coin users and coin collectors, respectively, that the RCM is minting Canada&#x27;s coins. The first circulation coin to have this new mint mark is the 10th anniversary $2 coin. The first numismatic coin to have this new marking is the Snowbirds coin and stamp set.
* T/É – In an effort to push the standard of quality higher, the RCM started to experiment with a gold bullion coin that would have a purity of 99.999%. The result was a gold maple leaf test bullion coin with the mint mark of T/É (to signify test/&quot;épreuve&quot;). The date on the obverse of the coin was 2007 and it had a mintage of 500.
* Teddy bear – When the RCM released its Baby Lullabies and CD Set, a sterling silver $1 coin was included in the set. The $1 coin included a privy mark of a teddy bear.
* W – Used occasionally on specimen sets produced in Winnipeg, starting in 1998.
* WP – Used on the special edition uncirculated set of 2003. The W mint mark indicates that the coin was produced in Winnipeg and the P indicates that the coins are plated.

=== Other notable innovations ===
==== Multi-ply plating ====
In 2000, the mint patented an improved, money-saving production method called multi-ply plating technology. Since that year, the mint has used this technique to produce 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and 50¢ pieces of Canadian circulation coinage, all of which were previously minted from nearly pure nickel alloys. Similarly, a copper-plated steel blank was used to produce the 1¢ coin until production ceased in 2012. Also in 2012, multi-ply plating was introduced for the $1 and $2 coins.

This particular plating process uses a steel core that is electro-magnetically plated with a thin layer of nickel, then a layer of copper and finally another layer of nickel. As a smaller quantity of copper and nickel is required, this process has reduced circulation coin production costs. The composition of plated coins is more durable, thereby reducing the number of damaged coins in circulation and increasing their overall efficiency. By varying the thicknesses of the alternating layers of nickel and copper, the mint can create coins with unique electromagnetic signatures, preventing fraud and producing the most secure circulation coins on the market.

==== Coloured coins ====
In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mint issued the world&#x27;s first coloured circulation coin. The 25¢ coins were produced at the mint&#x27;s facility in Winnipeg and feature a red-coloured poppy embedded in the centre of a maple leaf over a banner that reads: &quot;Remember / &quot;. The obverse features the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Susanna Blunt. The process of adhering colour to the coins surfaces involved the utilization of a high-speed, computer-controlled and precision inkjet process. Approximately 30,000,000 coins went into circulation in October 2004 and were available exclusively at Tim Hortons locations across the country. U.S. Army contractors travelling in Canada filed confidential espionage reports describing the coins as &quot;anomalous&quot; and &quot;filled with something man-made that looked like nano-technology&quot;.

In 2006, the mint produced a second colourized circulation coin in support of a future without breast cancer. The 25¢ coin features the pink ribbon symbolizing breast cancer awareness.

More recently, the mint produced two other 25¢ poppy circulation coins in 2008 and 2010, both of which feature colourized designs.

In 2008, the mint also produced 50-toea colourized coins for Papua New Guinea. These coins were manufactured using a robotic mechanism that oriented the coins in a way that ensured all the colourized designs faced the same direction.

This new technology was also used to produce the &quot;Top Three Moments&quot; coins. These 25¢ coins are part of the mint&#x27;s Vancouver 2010 circulation coin program and feature designs celebrating the top three favourite moments in Canadian Winter Games history. The men&#x27;s hockey gold medal at Salt Lake City in 2002 was voted by fans as the No. 1 Canadian Olympic Winter Games Moment of all time – out of 10 moments — in an online contest hosted in 2009 by the mint and Canada&#x27;s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium. Coming in at No. 2 was the Canadian women&#x27;s hockey gold medal at Salt Lake City 2002, followed by Cindy Klassen at No. 3 and her five long-track speed skating medals at Turin 2006. The coins marking these top three favourite moments were launched into circulation on September 29, 2009, November 17, 2009 and January 5, 2010, respectively.

==== Physical vapour deposition ====
The mint succeeded in extending the life of the die beyond that of past chrome-coated dies, with the adaptation of the physical vapour deposition (PVD) technology to coat its dies.

==== Glow-in-the-dark coins ====
In 2017, the mint released a set of circulation coins for the 150th anniversary of Confederation. In these circulation coins, the $2 coin has a coloured version which features some northern lights. When left under a normal source of light and then turning off the lights or when illuminated by a UV lamp, the northern lights glow turquoise. This coin was the first circulation coin in the world to glow in the dark. Around ten million coins were minted, but it was expected that around only one in ten Canadians would have one. However, this was not the first time that the mint worked with glow-in-the-dark technology. In 2012, a three-coin set of glow-in-the-dark dinosaur skeletons were released, but these coins were never for circulation; they were made for collection.

===== UFO-themed glow-in-the-dark coin =====
The Shag Harbour UFO incident on October 4, 1967, was commemorated in a glow-in-the dark coin launched October 1, 2019.

This coin is the second in the Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s &quot;unexplained phenomena&quot; series. The first coin in the series was released in 2018 and depicts the UFO encounter near Falcon Lake (Manitoba) in 1967.

The coin is not the first glow-in-the-dark coin released by the Royal Canadian Mint. The first coin depicts boaters gazing at the Northern Lights, and was released in 2017.

===== Barbados flying fish coin =====
As announced on November 26, 2020 the RCM produced a $1 glow-in-the-dark coin featuring a flying fish, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Barbados. It went into circulation on December 1, 2020. In 2022 this coin was announced at the 2022 Excellence in Currency Awards for Coins that the coin won the &#x27;Best New Commemorative or Test Circulating Coin&#x27; award for 2022 by the International Association of Currency Affairs (IACA) held in Amsterdam.

==== Mintshield ====
In 2018, the mint introduced Mintshield, a production technology for its silver maple leaf coins aimed at reducing &quot;milk spots&quot;, discolourations that can appear as white spots on the surface of silver bullion products. It is the only mint to offer technology specifically aimed at milk spots.

=== Activities ===
==== Bullion products and refinery ====
The mint produces and markets a family of high-purity gold, silver, palladium, and platinum maple leaf bullion coins, wafers, and bars for the investment market as well as gold and silver granules for the jewellery industry and industrial applications. The mint also provides Canadian and foreign customers with gold and silver processing, including refining, assaying, and secure storage.

Additionally, the Royal Canadian Mint operates a technically advanced refinery in which it refines precious metals from a variety of sources, including primary producers, industry, recyclers, and financial institutions. The mint refines raw gold to 995 fine through the Miller chlorination process. The gold is then cast into anodes for electrolytic purification to 9999 fine using the Wohlwill process.

The Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s bullion coin program consists of gold, silver, platinum and palladium maple leaf coins, as well as other products, such as MapleGrams. The Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s 1-ounce gold maple leaf coin was launched in 1979, and the 1-ounce silver maple leaf and 1-ounce platinum maple leaf coins were launched in 1988.

In May 2007, the mint produced the world&#x27;s first and only 99.999% pure gold maple leaf bullion (GML) coins. Offered in limited-edition gold bullion coins, three series of these special GML coins were produced (2007, 2008, 2009) in addition to the 99.99% pure GML coin, which is produced on demand. A 100 kg version of the 99.999% pure GML coin was produced as a promotional tool and was later sold as a product when interested buyers came forward.

===== Bullion coins =====
In 1979, the mint began producing its own branded bullion coins, which feature a maple leaf on the reverse. Since 1979, the fineness of the gold used to strike the gold maple leaf (GML) coins has increased from .999 to .9999, and finally, to .99999 (for a special series from 2007 to 2009). In addition, GMLs are produced in sizes that are fractions of a troy ounce: 1 oz,  oz,  oz,  oz,  oz,  oz,  oz, and in sets that combine some or all of these weights. Special-edition designs have commemorated the tenth anniversary of the GML (1989), the 125th anniversary of the RCMP (1997), and the 25th anniversary of the GML (1994). A three-coin set was released to commemorate the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games (2008–2010), and a fractional GML set was issued in 2011 to commemorate the centennial of the mint&#x27;s gold refinery. Renowned for its unrivalled purity, the mint&#x27;s gold maple leaf remains one of the world&#x27;s most popular bullion coins.

====== Silver maple leaf ======

The Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s silver maple leaf (SML) was first issued in 1988 and featured the same design as the gold maple leaf bullion coin. These coins are available to investors in 1 oz,  oz,  oz,  oz, and  oz sizes.

In 2004–05, the coins were sold in sets of four coins that featured two wildlife species: the Arctic fox (2004) and the Canada lynx (2005). Each coin was of a different value and depicted the animals in a separate pose. Colour and selective gold plating have also been applied to special issues of SML. Holograms have proved popular applications, having been featured on SML coins in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005.

In 2010, the mint introduced a new series of silver 9999 fine bullion coins featuring Canadian wildlife. The first coin, launched in late 2010, depicts a wolf, while the second features a grizzly bear. The third design, depicting a cougar, was released on September 24, 2011, for public sales. The fourth in the series was a moose, the fifth coin was the pronghorn antelope, and the sixth and final coin was the wood bison.

====== Platinum and palladium maple leaves ======

While the silver and gold maple leaves have proved enduringly popular among investors and bullion collectors, the mint has also produced limited numbers of platinum and palladium maple leaf coins. From 2005 to 2009, palladium maple leaf coins were offered in coins of .9995 fineness.

Platinum maple leaves were struck in 1 oz,  oz,  oz,  oz,  oz, and  oz weights, between 1988 and 1999 and again in 2009. In addition, the platinum maple leaves were sold in special issue sets in 1989 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the GML and in 2002 as a five-coin set featuring holograms. In 1999, the coins featured the polar bear design appearing on the inner ring of the $2 circulation coin.

==== Canadian circulation coins ====
Though the mint&#x27;s core mandate is to produce and manage the distribution of Canada&#x27;s circulation coinage and provide advice to the Minister of Finance on all matters related to coinage, the mint often introduces new commemorative designs which celebrate Canada&#x27;s history, culture and values. Recently, up to two billion Canadian circulation coins are struck each year at the mint&#x27;s facility in Winnipeg. While the effigy of the reigning monarch has appeared on every Canadian coin produced by the mint since 1908, reverse designs have changed considerably over the years. 

Since 2000, all of Canada&#x27;s circulation coins have been produced using the mint&#x27;s patented multi-ply plated steel technology except for the $1 and $2 circulation coins, which started using this technology as of April 10, 2012.

===== V nickel =====
World War II saw low mintages of most coins, as the metals (especially copper and nickel) were needed for the war effort. The composition of the 5¢ coin was changed to tombac in 1942; and the design was changed to a V for Victory in 1943. The composition was changed again to nickel-chromium-plated steel in 1944.

The concept for the V design came from Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous V sign, and the V denomination mark on the US 5¢ pieces of 1883–1912. A novel feature was an inscription of Morse code on the coin. This International Code message meant &quot;We Win When We Work Willingly&quot; and was placed along the rim on the reverse instead of denticles. The regular reverse and composition were resumed in 1946. Chromium-plated steel was again used for the 5¢ coin from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War, but the reverse was unchanged.

===== Centennial of Confederation =====
In 1967, the mint introduced a series of commemorative coins in honour of the Canadian centennial. Designed by Alex Colville, every coin produced that year featured a creature native to Canada: a rock dove on the 1¢ coin, a rabbit on the 5¢ coin, a mackerel on the 10¢ coin, a lynx on the 25¢ coin, a howling wolf on the 50¢ coin, and a Canada goose on the dollar. A commemorative gold $20 coin was also struck for collectors&#x27; sets, with a coat of arms on the reverse. It is worth noting the then Ottawa branch of the British Royal Mint wanted to commemorate Canada&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 1927 with variant coin designs.

===== Royal Canadian Mounted Police =====

For 1973, the usual 25¢ coin reverse depicting a caribou was replaced with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer astride a horse, to celebrate the centennial of the founding of the North-West Mounted Police (now the RCMP).

In 2007, the mint also released a $75 coloured gold coin featuring RCMP officers astride their horses, as part of an extensive program of collector coins celebrating the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. This coin, designed by Cecily Mok, is composed of 58.33% gold and 41.67% silver.

The mint also issued two bullion coins in celebration of the RCMP. The first is a 1997 gold coin, which was produced for the 125th anniversary of the RCMP. The second is a 2010 gold coin and was designed by Janet Griffin-Scott.

===== &quot;Loonie&quot; and &quot;toonie&quot; =====
The major change to Canadian coinage in the 1980s was the introduction of a circulating $1 coin, widely known as the loonie because of the common loon gracing its reverse. A voyageur canoe had been planned initially, but the master reverse die was lost in shipment between Ottawa and Winnipeg, so a new design was necessary. Introduced in 1987, the coin began to replace the $1 banknote in February 1989. In 1996, the mint introduced a $2 circulating coin (known widely as the toonie) that featured a polar bear on the reverse and replaced the $2 banknote. The $2 coin was also a first for the mint in that it used a bi-metallic structure – the coin&#x27;s centre is bronze-coloured and the circumference is nickel-coloured.

===== Saskatchewan Roughriders =====
In September 2010, the mint released 3million $1 circulation coins in celebration of the Saskatchewan Roughriders&#x27; centennial. This coin&#x27;s reverse is engraved with the Saskatchewan Roughriders&#x27; logo and a stylized &quot;100&quot; framed by the dates 1910 and 2010.

==== Foreign circulation coins ====

Many foreign countries have had coinage struck at the Royal Canadian Mint, including circulation coins, numismatic coins, and ready-to-strike blanks. In 1970, Master of the Mint Gordon Ward Hunter relaunched the Foreign Circulation division. A contract for Singapore was won in January 1970 to produce six million rimmed blanks in a copper–nickel alloy. This was the mint&#x27;s first export contract since a contract for the Dominican Republic 32 years earlier. The second contract came in April 1970 from the Central Bank of Brazil. The RCM produced 84million blanks for the 50-centavo piece. In August 1971, the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen placed an order for 2million five-fil pieces. This was followed by an order from Iceland for 2.5million one-crown pieces.

In October 1971, the Bank of Jamaica asked the RCM to produce a commemorative ten-dollar coin in silver and a twenty-dollar gold coin of proof quality. Also in 1971, the RCM made coins for the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Iran, and the Isle of Man. An order for 100million general-circulation five-centime and ten-centimo coins for Venezuela was received as well. By 1973, orders totalled 65million coins, and 70million blanks. By 1974, the Ottawa facility produced a facility record 1.2billion coins (foreign and domestic).

Two years later, the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority of Macau commissioned the Royal Canadian Mint to create a commemorative coin to recognize the transfer of the Macau region to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The coin is silver and features a gold cameo. The face value is 100 patacas, and the coin has a diameter of and a guaranteed weight of at least , while most 1 oz silver RCM coins weigh 31.3 grams. The Royal Canadian Mint item number is 644309 and the issue price is $102. The coin features a Portuguese ship and a Chinese barque sharing coastal waters. The historic Ma Gao Temple (Pagoda de Barra) appears in the cameo.

50million units of the 20¢ Australian coin featuring a platypus were minted in 1981. Other coins have included centavos for Cuba, kroner for Norway, fils for Yemen, pesos for Colombia, kroner for Iceland, rupiah for Indonesia, baht for Thailand, and a thousand-dollar coin for Hong Kong. Other client nations include Barbados and Uganda.

In 2005, the mint was awarded a contract valued at US$1.2million to produce 50million toea coins for Papua New Guinea. The circulation coins were produced in denominations of 5 toea, 10 toea and 20 toea, and were manufactured at the mint&#x27;s facility in Winnipeg. In 2005 alone, the RCM manufactured 1.062billion coins and blanks for 14 countries. From 1980 to 2005, the RCM has manufactured approximately 52billion coins for 62 countries. These coins were manufactured at the Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s facility in Winnipeg.

In 2007, the mint produced coins for a variety of other countries, such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

In 2008, the mint produced over 3million coloured 50-toea coins for Papua New Guinea. These were the world&#x27;s first coloured coins to circulate outside of Canada. In addition to adding a painted design to more than three million coins, the mint was required to identically orient the design on every coin. To accomplish this, the mint, in collaboration with Canadian robotic equipment manufacturer PharmaCos Machinery, developed its own robotic arm to &quot;pick and place&quot; each coin on the painting line, creating a new technical capability unique to the Royal Canadian Mint.

In 2009, the mint produced coins and blanks for 18 countries, including the (10-cent coin) for Panama.

=== Numismatic coins ===

In 2006, the Royal Canadian Mint issued the $50 Four Seasons 0.9999 silver coin. This was the first 5 oz pure silver coin issued by the mint, and had a limited mintage of only 2,000 coins worldwide. High-grade examples of this coin fetch $1500 to $5000 at auction. Demand for the coin was unprecedented, and it was the lowest mintage 0.9999 silver coin ever produced by the Royal Canadian Mint until the 2009 release of &quot;Surviving the Flood&quot;, a 0.9999 silver coin which has a worldwide mintage of only 1500.

On October 19, 2007, the Royal Canadian Mint issued ten new collector coins, including a 25¢ coin minted to commemorate the 60th wedding anniversary of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; and a $15 sterling silver coin bearing the effigy of Victoria, the first from the series of five coins illustrating the effigies of the previous Canadian monarchs.

==== Toronto Transit Commission tokens ====
From 1954 to 2006, the mint supplied the Toronto Transit Commission with 24million tokens. These tokens were taken out of service in 2007 for official use. The lightweight token was replaced due to the ease in duplicating counterfeit versions. Subsequent tokens for the TTC were manufactured in the United States by Osborne Coinage.

==== Canadian Tire ====
In October 2009, the mint produced trade dollars for Canadian Tire which temporarily replaced their regular $1 coupons. The initiative called for the production of 2.5million nickel-plated steel tokens, as well as 9,000 brass-plated steel tokens. As part of the limited-time offer, the trade dollars were distributed in 475 stores nationwide.

=== Notable medallions ===
Made of base and precious metals, several of the mint&#x27;s numismatic coins are enhanced by special technologies including holograms, enamelling, lasering and embedded crystals. The mint also produces medals, medallions and tokens as part of this business line.

The mint produces a great number of military decorations for the Department of National Defence including: the Sacrifice Medal, the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration and Clasp, the General Campaign Star, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Bars, the General Service Medal, the Special Service Medal, the Operational Service Medal, the Memorial Cross and the Canadian Victoria Cross. It also produces military decorations for Veterans Affairs Canada, as well as long-service medals for the RCMP and artistic achievement awards for the Governor General of Canada.

The mint also produced the athletes&#x27; medals of the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games and the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The mint produced 615 Olympic and 399 Paralympic medals at their headquarters in Ottawa for the 2010 Winter Games.

The mint also designed and produced the 4,283 medals for the Toronto 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am games.

* In 1983, the RCM issued a medallion to commemorate the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The composition of the medal is 50% pure silver and has a diameter of . The coin had a production limit of 100,000 and its issue price was $24.50.
* The RCM created a medallion to honour Elvis Presley. The medal features the word Graceland (above an image of the mansion and its gates) and an actual denomination of $10. The reverse of the medal features an engraving of Elvis, along with the words &quot;The Man/The Music/The Legend&quot;. The medallion itself is undated, but as the medal is , one would assume it was made for the 10th anniversary of the singer&#x27;s death. Additional information can be found in the certificate of authenticity which states this Elvis Presley medal was authorized by Legendary Coins and struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. The packaging bears a copyright date of 1987, and states the &quot;medal is for commemorative purposes only&quot; and is &quot;not legal tender&quot;.
* Medallions honouring hockey legends have also been created. To commemorate Mario Lemieux&#x27;s induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame, a special set honouring all the inductees was issued in 1997. In 1999, a nickel medallion was issued to honour Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s retirement. The issue price was $9.99 with a mintage of 50,000.

The mint makes collector coins and related products for collectors and enthusiasts in Canada and all over the world. Several of these coins have earned international industry awards and in 2010, the mint sold out the entire mintage of a record 25 collector coins.

==== Vancouver Olympics ====

In 2006, the mint entered a partnership with the Vancouver Olympic Committee and became an official supporter of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. As such, the mint ran a three-year program of circulation and collector coins in honour of both the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

Their Vancouver 2010 coin program included the largest circulation coin series in relation to the Olympic and Paralympic Games ever conceived by any mint worldwide. It included the production of 17 circulation coins, 15 of which were of the 25¢ denomination and two of which were $1 &quot;lucky loonies&quot;. The mint was the first in the world to commemorate the Paralympic Games on a circulation coin. These commemorative 25¢ coins were distributed across the country through participating Petro-Canada and Royal Bank of Canada locations.

Regarding the circulation coins, one of the novelties was that (&quot;&quot; &#x27;by the grace of God queen&#x27;) was removed from the Queen&#x27;s effigy, making the 25¢ coins the first &quot;godless&quot; circulating coins since the 2001 International Year of the Volunteer 10¢ piece. On the 1911 issue of King George V, the inscription was accidentally left off. The first circulating $1 coin was dated 2008 but the obverse is the standard effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Susanna Blunt with the wording &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; and with the Circle M privy mark.

In addition to its circulation coin program, the mint introduced a series of 36 collector coins ranging from multi-coloured sterling silver Lucky Loonies to premium gold coins. Most notably, two $2500 Kilo Gold Coins were produced as part of this program, marking the first time the mint issued a pure gold coin with a guaranteed weight of .

The program also included the production of two sterling silver Lucky Loonies in 2008 and 2010, with mintages of 30,000 and 40,000 respectively.

==== Vancouver 2010 Winter Games medals ====
The mint also produced the athlete medals for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The Vancouver 2010 gold medals are each made of sterling silver plated with six grams of 24-karat gold. The silver medals are sterling silver while the bronze medals are composed mostly of copper. Their composition is governed by International Olympic Committee regulations.

Each medal features a piece of one of two contemporary Aboriginal artworks and weighs 500 to 576 grams each. The design on each medal is based on two large master artworks of an orca whale (Olympic) and raven (Paralympic) by Corrine Hunt, a Canadian artist of Komoyue and Tlingit heritage based in Vancouver. Each medal features a unique, hand-cropped section of her artwork. The medals are also undulating rather than flat. They had to be struck nine times each to achieve this unusual shape.

The medals were on display throughout the 2010 Winter Games at the Royal Canadian Mint Pavilion in Vancouver. There, visitors waited in line, sometimes for over seven hours, to see and hold the medals. 
With so much interest generated by their Vancouver 2010 program, the mint opened an additional retail outlet in Vancouver. This store is at 752 Granville Street, between Georgia and Robson streets, and was closed in 2017.

<doc id="372824" wikidata="Q929062" url="?curid=372824" title="Gujrat, Pakistan">
<text>Gujrat () is the thirteenth largest city in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Located on the western bank of the Chenab River in northern Punjab&#x27;s Chaj Do&#x27;āb, it serves as the headquarters of the eponymous district and disvision; and is the 20th most populous in Pakistan, with a population of 390,533 in 2017. Along with Sialkot and Gujranwala, Gujrat forms part of the &quot;Golden Triangle of Punjab&quot;, as these industrial cities have export-oriented economies.

==History==
Gujrat is a place of some antiquity and abounds in important ancient sites. The city and district formed part of the kingdom of Porus who ruled primarily within the Chaj Doab. He was defeated by Alexander after a difficult campaign at the Battle of Hydaspes in May 326 BC. Alexander was impressed by his bravery and decided to reinstall him as a vassal of the Macedonian Empire. Instead of rehabilitating Gujrat, which had been affected during Alexander&#x27;s invasion, some local legends suggest that after the death of King Porus, a ruler named Raja Kula Chand (sometimes linked to Chandragupta) founded a new settlement near Jalalpur Jattan. This new city, reportedly comprising several smaller settlements, was named &quot;Kulachor&quot;.

With Alexander&#x27;s death in June 323 BC, Chandragupta Maurya (referred to in Greek sources as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;) who was of relatively humble origin possibly from the Punjab region, took control of the Punjab using it as a base for the founding of the Mauryan Empire. It remained under the Mauryas until shortly after the death of Ashoka in 231 BC, and later came under the sway of Demetrius I who founded the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Scythian invasion brought about by Maues in the latter half of the second century brought a change of rulers and the Indo-Scythian Kingdom was established shortly after. This would change in the early first century CE when a Parthian governor Gondophares declared independence from the Parthian Empire. He moved east in 19 CE, conquering territory from the Indo-Scythians and Indo-Greeks, thus forming his own Indo-Parthian kingdom. The domains of the Indo-Parthians were greatly reduced following the invasions of the Kushans in the second half of the 1st. century CE who formed a vast prosperous empire in Central and South Asia which oversaw a flowering of Buddhism. 

For several hundreds years, nothing is known about the area except between 455 and 550 CE when it was exposed to the ravages of the Alchon Huns. After the decline of the Alchon Huns, it became the main base of the new kingdom of Gurjara, under a certain Alakhana. According to the Rajatarangini, it was invaded between 883 and 902 CE by Sankaravarman of the Utpala dunasty in Kashmir who fought and defeated the Gurjara ruler Alakhana. The name Alakhana etymologically is in reference to the Alchon Huns. This may be the Ali Khan whom the present Gujjar tribe in Gujrat hail as their elder and founder of Gujrat. The putative Hunnic origin of the ruler Alakhana, remembered as Ali Khan in the tradition and memory of the Gujjars centuries after their conversion to Islam, led British historians to conclude that the Gujjars were originally from the stock of the Alchon Huns.

Gujrat was known and inhabited during the early 16th century when the Suri ruler Sher Shah toppled the Mughals under Humayun. The area was named Khwaspur&quot;,&quot; in honour of Suri&#x27;s Governor of Rohtas, Khwas Khan. The city came under the Mughal Empire and was further developed during the reign of Akbar in the latter half of the 16th century, who built the Gujrat Fort, and allowed Gujjars to settle in the fort who had been living within the district for centuries up to this time. The city and district was formally named in reference to the local Gujjar tribe. 

In 1605, Syed Abdul Kasim was granted the city as a fief by Akbar. During the reign of Jahangir, Gujrat was part of the route used by the Mughal family when visiting Kashmir. In the Mughal era, Gujrat was encircled by a wall with five gates, of which only the Shah Daula gate survives.

With the death of Aurangzeb, in 1707, the Mughal Empire began to weaken significantly. Mughal authority in Punjab remained in the hands of Mughal Nawabs, despite the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah leading an invasion in 1739 that resulted in the sacking of the capital Delhi. Nadir Shah&#x27;s invasion of India on November 18, 1738, brought devastation to Gujrat as well. With a massive army of two hundred and seventy thousand men, he crossed the Indus and entered the Punjab. His orders were to leave nothing standing within the reach of his troops&#x27; weapons, instilling fear particularly in Nawab Zakaria Khan, the Viceroy of Lahore. His forces crossed the Chenab River near the Shahdoula Shrine, entering Gujrat and pillaging the town. As part of his battle strategy, Nadir Shah stationed one of his generals, Mirza Nur Beg, with a contingent in Gujrat, while he himself led the bulk of his forces against the army of the Governor of Lahore, Mirza Kalandar Beg, who was stationed near Wazirabad at the Chenab River. 

Mughal rule collapsed in Punjab after Mir Mannu died in 1753. The Durrani Afghans under their new ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani annexed the region directly from the Mughals. The city suffered further from the eight invasions of the Durrani Afghans between 1748 and 1767 who fought the Sikhs for control of Punjab. In the ensuing chaos, the city was captured by local Gakhar Punjabi tribesmen from the Pothohar Plateau to the west.

In 1765, the city was overrun by the Sikh Bhangi Misl under Gujjar Singh who defeated the Ghakars under their chief Muqarrab Khan. In 1765, Chaudhry Rehmat Khan Warraich of Jalalpur Jattan wrote a letter to Gujjar Singh, urging him to attack Gujrat and overthrow Sultan Muqarrab Khan. This invitation marked a significant shift in alliances, as Rehmat Khan, once an ally of Adina Beg against the Sikhs, recognized the changing political dynamics in Punjab and extended a diplomatic gesture to the Sikhs. Diwan Shiv Nath Handa, an associate of Rehmat Khan from Jalalpur Jattan, also supported this move. 

Responding to the call, Gujjar Singh swiftly marched towards the northeast of Punjab, capturing 150 villages, including Wazirabad, Eminabad, and Sodhra, before reaching Gujrat in December 1765. Here, Chaudhry Rehmat Khan joined forces with Gujjar Singh against Sultan Muqarrab Khan. Despite Sultan Muqarrab Khan&#x27;s determined resistance, he was defeated in the battle and sought refuge in the Gujrat Fort. Following the intense clash with the Sikhs, the entire area from the vicinity of Mauza Dadupur Patala Sohian in Kunjah was in a state of chaos. 

The Sikhs swiftly laid siege to the fort of Gujrat, disrupting Sultan Muqarrab Khan&#x27;s supply lines and ultimately forcing him to abandon his stronghold. The Ghakkar chief, riding on an elephant, crossed a ravine known as Nali-e-Jou-e-Bar in Kunjah near Mauza Ghaidowal, located to the west of Gujrat, but he never emerged. The Sikhs defeated an Afghan force in a battle for Gujrat on 29 April 1797. In 1798, the Bhangi leader Sahib Singh pledged allegiance to the Sukerchakia Misl of Ranjit Singh who later established the Sikh Empire in 1799. By 1810, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s armies captured the city from Bhangi forces, thereby extending the rule of the Sikh Empire to the city.

Gujrat finally came under British control in 1849, following the collapse of the Sikh Empire in the wake of the Sikh defeat at the Battle of Gujrat on 22 February, which ended the Second Anglo-Sikh War. In 1867, Gujrat was constituted as a municipality. According to the census, the city had a population of 18,396 in 1881, 19,410 in 1901 and 21,974 in 1921.

<text>A company&#x27;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (commonly abbreviated EBITDA, pronounced ) is a measure of a company&#x27;s profitability of the operating business only, thus before any effects of indebtedness, state-mandated payments, and costs required to maintain its asset base. It is derived by subtracting from revenues all costs of the operating business (e.g. wages, costs of raw materials, services ...) but not decline in asset value, cost of borrowing and obligations to governments. Although lease have been capitalised in the balance sheet (and depreciated in the profit and loss statement) since IFRS 16, its expenses are often still adjusted back into EBITDA given they are deemed operational in nature. 

Though often shown on an income statement, it is not considered part of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) by the SEC, and hence the SEC requires that companies registering securities with it (and when filing its periodic reports) reconcile EBITDA to net income.

== History ==
The original concept of EBITDA was pioneered in the 1970s by billionaire investor John Malone. Early in his career, Malone developed EBITDA as a tool to evaluate the cash-generating ability of telecom companies. He advocated for its use over traditional metrics like Earnings per share (EPS), arguing that EBITDA offered a more accurate reflection of financial performance for high-growth, capital-intensive businesses. Originally, Malone used EBITDA to attract lenders and investors, positioning it as a key element of his growth strategy. By focusing on EBITDA, he showcased a company&#x27;s capacity to generate cash flow while effectively utilizing leveraged debt and reinvesting profits to minimize taxes—an approach that defined his investment philosophy. 

EBITDA regained popularity during the dot-com boom, gaining popularity as a benchmark for assessing the financial health of rapidly expanding, technology companies. 

==Usage and criticism==
EBITDA is widely used when assessing the performance of a company. EBITDA is useful to assess the underlying profitability of the operating businesses alone, i.e. how much profit the business generates by providing the services, selling the goods etc. in the given time period. This type of analysis is useful to get a view of the profitability of the operating business alone, as the cost items ignored in the EBITDA computation are largely independent from the operating business: The interest payments depend on the financing structure of the company, the tax payments in the relevant jurisdictions as well as the interest payments, the depreciation on the asset base (and depreciation policy chosen), and the amortisation on takeover history with its effect on goodwill among others. EBITDA is widely used to measure the valuation of private and public companies (e.g. saying that a certain company trades at x times EBITDA, meaning that the company value as expressed through its stock price equates to x times its EBITDA). In its attempt to display EBITDA as a measure of the underlying profitability of the operating business, EBITDA is often adjusted for extraordinary expenses, i.e. expenses that the company believes do not occur on a regular basis. These adjustments can include bad debt expenses, any legal settlements paid, costs for acquisitions, charitable contributions and salaries of the owner or family members. The resulting metric is called adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA before exceptionals. 

A negative EBITDA indicates that a business has fundamental problems with profitability. A positive EBITDA, on the other hand, does not necessarily mean that the business generates cash. This is because the cash generation of a business depends on capital expenditures (needed to replace assets that have broken down), taxes, interest and movements in working capital as well as on EBITDA. 

While being a useful metric, one should not rely on EBITDA alone when assessing the performance of a company. The biggest criticism of using EBITDA as a measure to assess company performance is that it ignores the need for capital expenditures in its assessment. However, capital expenditures are needed to maintain the asset base which in turn allows for generating EBITDA. Warren Buffett famously asked, &quot;Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?&quot;. A fix often employed is to assess a business on the metric EBITDA - Capital Expenditures.

== Margin ==
EBITDA margin refers to EBITDA divided by total revenue (or &quot;total output&quot;, &quot;output&quot; differing from &quot;revenue&quot; according to changes in inventory). 

== Variations ==
=== EBITA ===
Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) is derived from EBITDA by subtracting Depreciation. 

EBITA is used to include effects of the asset base in the assessment of the profitability of a business. In that, it is a better metric than EBITDA, but has not found widespread adoption. 

=== EBITDAR ===



=== EBIDA ===
Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation and Amortization (EBIDA) is a less well-known metric as opposed to EBITDA. It excludes factoring in the effects of taxes, but is considered a more conservative metric in that it makes fewer assumptions. EBIDA is not a Generally-Accepted Accounting Principles metric, and the way it is calculated is not universally standardised.

=== EBIDAX ===
Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, Amortization and Exploration (EBIDAX) is a non-GAAP metric that can be used to evaluate the financial strength or performance of oil, gas or mineral company.

Costs for exploration are varied by methods and costs. Removal of the exploration portion of the balance sheet allows for a better comparison between the energy companies.

=== OIBDA ===
Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) refers to an income calculation made by adding depreciation and amortization to operating income.

OIBDA differs from EBITDA because its starting point is operating income, not earnings. It does not, therefore, include non-operating income, which tends not to recur year after year. It includes only income gained from regular operations, ignoring items like FX changes or tax treatments.

Historically, OIBDA was created to exclude the impact of write-downs resulting from one-time charges, and to improve the optics for analysts comparing to previous period EBITDA. An example is the case of Time Warner, who shifted to divisional OIBDA reporting subsequent to write downs and charges resulting from the company&#x27;s merger into AOL.

=== EBITDAC ===
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and coronavirus (EBITDAC) is a non-GAAP metric that has been introduced following the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

EBITDAC is a special case of adjusted EBITDA. 

On 13 May 2020, the Financial Times mentioned that German manufacturing group Schenck Process was the first European company to use the term in their quarterly reporting. The company had added back €5.4m of first-quarter 2020 profits that it said it would have made were it not for the hit caused by &#x27;missing
contribution margin and cost absorption reduced by direct financial state support received majorly in China so far&#x27;.

Other companies picked up this EBITDAC measure as well, claiming the state-mandated lockdowns and disruptions to the supply chains distort their true profitability, and EBITDAC would show how much these companies believe they would have earned in the absence of the coronavirus.

Like other forms of adjusted EBITDA, this can be a useful tool to analyse companies but should not be used as the only tool.

<text>Gene Anthony Ray (May 24, 1962 – November 14, 2003) was an American actor, dancer, and choreographer. A native of New York City, Ray was best known for his portrayal of dancer Leroy Johnson in both the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot; and the &quot;Fame&quot; television series based upon the film which originally aired from 1982 until 1987.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in New York City, in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan on May 24, 1962, Ray grew up in the area of West 153rd Street and later became involved in street dancing at block parties. He performed in a dance class at the Julia Richman High School. He skipped school one day to audition for &quot;Fame&quot; choreographer Louis Falco. Ray attended the High School of Performing Arts, the inspiration for the film &quot;Fame&quot;, but was kicked out after just one year. &quot;It was too disciplined for this wild child of mine,&quot; Ray&#x27;s mother, Jean E. Ray, would later say.

===Career===
Ray won the part of Leroy Johnson in the film &quot;Fame&quot;, which was released in 1980. Much like his &quot;Fame&quot; character, Ray had little professional training, but he possessed a raw talent that won him his role for the film. Reports &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;Alan (Parker, the director) had to approach him very carefully. His mom was dealing drugs during the filming. It was not pretty.&quot; In 1981, Ray starred as Friday, alongside Michael York as Robinson Crusoe, in the 1981 TV adventure-comedy &quot;&quot; (alternative title: &quot;Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday&quot;).

Ray also starred in the television series based on the film, &quot;Fame&quot;. The series was produced by MGM Television from 1982 to 1987, and syndicated from 1983 to 1987. Additionally, he began touring the U.K. with the other members of the &quot;Fame&quot; cast as The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;; they performed at 10 venues, including a sell out performance at Royal Albert Hall. In 1984, &quot;USA Today&quot; reports: &quot;Ray was axed from the show after his mother was jailed for running a drug ring, and he failed to turn up for work 100 times.&quot; He struggled with addictions to alcohol and drugs, and worked only intermittently once the TV series ended. In 1985, Ray danced in The Weather Girls&#x27; music video for &quot;Well-A-Wiggy&quot;.

In 1987, he won the role of Billy Nolan in the ill-fated musical adaptation of &quot;Carrie&quot; by Stephen King. Ray played the role in the original opening in Stratford-Upon-Avon, which closed after less than a month. He then transferred to Broadway and continued to play the role until the musical closed after only 21 public performances. Ray also appeared in the 1995 film &quot;Out-of-Sync&quot;, which was directed by his &quot;Fame&quot; co-star Debbie Allen, in the 1996 Whoopi Goldberg comedy &quot;Eddie&quot; (for which he was also credited as associate choreographer), as well as in commercials for Dr Pepper and Diet Coke. His last video appearance was a one-hour BBC &quot;Fame&quot; reunion documentary, &quot;Fame Remember My Name,&quot; taped in Los Angeles in April 2003.

===Personal life and death===
As described in his &quot;Telegraph&quot; obituary, 
Ray &quot;remained a &#x27;frantic partygoer&#x27; with a self-confessed weakness for drink and drugs. As his life fell apart, he slept on park benches, and during a failed attempt to launch a &quot;Fame&quot;-style dance school in Milan, shared a flat there with a porn actress. In 1996, he was diagnosed HIV positive. Flamboyantly camp, he brushed aside questions about his sexuality. He never married.&quot;

Ray died on November 14, 2003, aged 41, from complications of a stroke he had suffered in June that year and complications from AIDS.

<doc id="372836" wikidata="Q185145" url="?curid=372836" title="Great power">
<text>A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers&#x27; opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.

While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is considerable debate on the exact criteria of great power status. Historically, the status of great powers has been formally recognized in organizations such as the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815 or the United Nations Security Council, of which permanent members are: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The United Nations Security Council, NATO Quint, the G7, the BRICS, and the Contact Group have all been described as great power concerts.

The term &quot;great power&quot; was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The &quot;Great Powers&quot; constituted the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot; and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Since then, the international balance of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during World War I and World War II. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power.

==Characteristics==
There are no set or defined characteristics of a great power. These characteristics have often been treated as empirical, self-evident to the assessor. However, this approach has the disadvantage of subjectivity. As a result, there have been attempts to derive some common criteria and to treat these as essential elements of great power status. Danilovic (2002) highlights three central characteristics, which she terms as &quot;power, spatial, and status dimensions,&quot; that distinguish major powers from other states. The following section (&quot;Characteristics&quot;) is extracted from her discussion of these three dimensions, including all of the citations.

Early writings on the subject tended to judge states by the realist criterion, as expressed by the historian A. J. P. Taylor when he noted that &quot;the test of a great power is the test of strength for war.&quot; Later writers have expanded this test, attempting to define power in terms of overall military, economic, and political capacity. Kenneth Waltz, the founder of the neorealist theory of international relations, uses a set of six criteria to determine great power: population and territory, resource endowment, military strength, economic capability, political stability and competence.

John Mearsheimer defines great powers as those that &quot;have sufficient military assets to put up a serious fight in an all-out conventional war against the most powerful state in the world.&quot;

===Power dimensions===

As noted above, for many, power capabilities were the sole criterion. However, even under the more expansive tests, power retains a vital place.

This aspect has received mixed treatment, with some confusion as to the degree of power required. Writers have approached the concept of great power with differing conceptualizations of the world situation, from multi-polarity to overwhelming hegemony. In his essay, &#x27;French Diplomacy in the Postwar Period&#x27;, the French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle spoke of the concept of multi-polarity: &quot;A Great power is one which is capable of preserving its own independence against any other single power.&quot;

This differed from earlier writers, notably from Leopold von Ranke, who clearly had a different idea of the world situation. In his essay &#x27;The Great Powers&#x27;, written in 1833, von Ranke wrote: &quot;If one could establish as a definition of a Great power that it must be able to maintain itself against all others, even when they are united, then Frederick has raised Prussia to that position.&quot; These positions have been the subject of criticism.

In 2011, the US had 10 major strengths according to Chinese scholar Peng Yuan, the director of the Institute of American Studies of the China Institutes for Contemporary International Studies. 
:1. Population, geographic position, and natural resources.
:2. Military muscle.
:3. High technology and education.
:4. Cultural/soft power.
:5. Cyber power.
:6. Allies, the United States having more than any other state.
:7. Geopolitical strength, as embodied in global projection forces.
:8. Intelligence capabilities, as demonstrated by the killing of Osama bin Laden.
:9. Intellectual power, fed by a plethora of US think tanks and the “revolving door” between research institutions and government.
:10. Strategic power, the United States being the world’s only country with a truly global strategy.
However he also noted where the US had recently slipped: 
:1. Political power, as manifested by the breakdown of bipartisanship.
:2. Economic power, as illustrated by the post-2007 slowdown.
:3. Financial power, given intractable deficits and rising debt.
:4. Social power, as weakened by societal polarization.
:5. Institutional power, since the United States can no longer dominate global institutions

===Spatial dimension===
All states have a geographic scope of interests, actions, or projected power. This is a crucial factor in distinguishing a great power from a regional power; by definition, the scope of a regional power is restricted to its region. It has been suggested that a great power should be possessed of actual influence throughout the scope of the prevailing international system. Arnold J. Toynbee, for example, observes that &quot;Great power may be defined as a political force exerting an effect co-extensive with the widest range of the society in which it operates. The Great powers of 1914 were &#x27;world-powers&#x27; because Western society had recently become &#x27;world-wide&#x27;.&quot;

Other suggestions have been made that a great power should have the capacity to engage in extra-regional affairs and that a great power ought to be possessed of extra-regional interests, two propositions which are often closely connected.

===Status dimension===
Formal or informal acknowledgment of a nation&#x27;s great power status has also been a criterion for being a great power. As political scientist George Modelski notes, &quot;The status of Great power is sometimes confused with the condition of being powerful. The office, as it is known, did in fact evolve from the role played by the great military states in earlier periods... But the Great power system institutionalizes the position of the powerful state in a web of rights and obligations.&quot;

This approach restricts analysis to the epoch following the Congress of Vienna at which great powers were first formally recognized. In the absence of such a formal act of recognition it has been suggested that great power status can arise by implication by judging the nature of a state&#x27;s relations with other great powers.

A further option is to examine a state&#x27;s willingness to act as a great power. As a nation will seldom declare that it is acting as such, this usually entails a retrospective examination of state conduct. As a result, this is of limited use in establishing the nature of contemporary powers, at least not without the exercise of subjective observation.

Other important criteria throughout history are that great powers should have enough influence to be included in discussions of contemporary political and diplomatic questions, and exercise influence on the outcome and resolution. Historically, when major political questions were addressed, several great powers met to discuss them. Before the era of groups like the United Nations, participants of such meetings were not officially named but rather were decided based on their great power status. These were conferences that settled important questions based on major historical events.

===&quot;Full-spectrum&quot; dimension===
Historian Phillips P. O&#x27;Brien, Head of the School of International Relations and Professor of Strategic Studies at the University of St. Andrews, criticizes the concept of a great power, arguing that it is dated, vaguely defined, and inconsistently applied. He states that the term is used to &quot;describe everything from true superpowers such as the United States and China, which wield the full spectrum of economic, technological, and military might, to better-than-average military powers such as Russia, which have nuclear weapons but little else that would be considered indicators of great power. &quot; O&#x27;Brien advocates for the concept of a &quot;full-spectrum power&quot;, which takes into account &quot;all the fundamentals on which superior military power is built&quot;, including economic resources, domestic politics and political systems (which can restrain or expand dimensions of power), technological capabilities, and social and cultural factors (such as a society&#x27;s willingness to go to war or invest in military development).

==History==

Various sets of great, or significant, powers have existed throughout history. An early reference to great powers is from the third century, when the Persian prophet Mani described Rome, China, Aksum, and Persia as the four greatest kingdoms of his time. During the Napoleonic wars in Europe, American diplomat James Monroe observed that, &quot;The respect which one power has for another is in exact proportion of the means which they respectively have of injuring each other.&quot; The term &quot;great power&quot; first appears at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Congress established the Concert of Europe as an attempt to preserve peace after the years of Napoleonic Wars.

Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, first used the term in its diplomatic context, writing on 13 February 1814: &quot;there is every prospect of the Congress terminating with a general accord and Guarantee between the Great powers of Europe, with a determination to support the arrangement agreed upon, and to turn the general influence and if necessary the general arms against the Power that shall first attempt to disturb the Continental peace.&quot;

The Congress of Vienna consisted of five main powers: the Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain. These five primary participants constituted the original great powers as we know the term today. Other powers, such as Spain, Portugal, and Sweden, which were great powers during the 17th century and the earlier 18th century, were consulted on certain specific issues, but they were not full participants.

After the Congress of Vienna, Great Britain emerged as the pre-eminent global hegemon, due to it being the first nation to industrialize, possessing the largest navy, and the extent of its overseas empire, which ushered in a century of &quot;Pax Britannica.&quot; The balance of power between the Great Powers became a major influence in European politics, prompting Otto von Bismarck to say &quot;All politics reduces itself to this formula: try to be one of three, as long as the world is governed by the unstable equilibrium of five great powers.&quot;

Over time, the relative power of these five nations fluctuated, which by the dawn of the 20th century had served to create an entirely different balance of power. Great Britain and the new German Empire (from 1871), experienced continued economic growth and political power. Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento era, Japan during the Meiji era, and the United States after its civil war. By 1900, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The Eight-Nation Alliance was an alliance of eight nations created in response to the Boxer Rebellion in China. It formed in 1900 and consisted of the five Congress powers plus Italy, Japan, and the United States, representing the great powers at the beginning of the 20th century.

===World Wars===


Shifts of international power have most notably occurred through major conflicts. The conclusion of World War I and the resulting treaties of Versailles, St-Germain, Neuilly, Trianon, and Sèvres made Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States the chief arbiters of the new world order. The German Empire was defeated, Austria-Hungary was divided into new, less powerful states and the Russian Empire fell to revolution. During the Paris Peace Conference, the &quot;Big Four&quot; – Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States – controlled the proceedings and outcome of the treaties more than Japan. The Big Four were the architects of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed by Germany; the Treaty of St. Germain, with Austria; the Treaty of Neuilly, with Bulgaria; the Treaty of Trianon, with Hungary; and the Treaty of Sèvres, with the Ottoman Empire. During the decision-making of the Treaty of Versailles, Italy pulled out of the conference because a part of its demands were not met and temporarily left the other three countries as the sole major architects of that treaty, referred to as the &quot;Big Three&quot;.

The status of the victorious great powers were recognised by permanent seats at the League of Nations Council, where they acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly of the League. However, the council began with only four permanent members – Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan – because the United States, meant to be the fifth permanent member, never joined the League. Germany later joined after the Locarno Treaties, which made it a member of the League of Nations, and later left (and withdrew from the League in 1933); Japan left, and the Soviet Union joined.

When World War II began in 1939, it divided the world into two alliances: the Allies (initially the United Kingdom and France, and Poland, followed in 1941 by the Soviet Union, China, and the United States) and the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan). During World War II, the US, UK, USSR, and China were referred as a &quot;trusteeship of the powerful&quot; and were recognized as the Allied &quot;Big Four&quot; in Declaration by United Nations in 1942. These four countries were referred as the &quot;Four Policemen&quot; of the Allies and considered as the primary victors of World War II. The importance of France was acknowledged by their inclusion, along with the other four, in the group of countries allotted permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.

Since the end of the World Wars, the term &quot;great power&quot; has been joined by a number of other power classifications. Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower, used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world. It was first coined in 1944 by William T. R. Fox and according to him, there were three superpowers: Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But after World War II Britain lost its superpower status. The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs. Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world.

===Cold War===
The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, which began following World War II. The term &quot;cold&quot; is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945.

During the Cold War, Japan, France, the United Kingdom and West Germany rebuilt their economies. France and the United Kingdom maintained technologically advanced armed forces with power projection capabilities and maintain large defense budgets to this day. Yet, as the Cold War continued, authorities began to question if France and the United Kingdom could retain their long-held status as great powers. China, with the world&#x27;s largest population, has slowly risen to great power status, with large growth in economic and military power in the post-war period. After 1949, the Republic of China began to lose its recognition as the sole legitimate government of China by the other great powers, in favour of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Subsequently, in 1971, it lost its permanent seat at the UN Security Council to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Aftermath of the Cold War===
China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are often referred to as great powers by academics due to &quot;their political and economic dominance of the global arena&quot;. These five nations are the only states to have permanent seats with veto power on the UN Security Council. They are also the only state entities to have met the conditions to be considered &quot;Nuclear Weapons States&quot; under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and maintain military expenditures which are among the largest in the world. However, there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to the current status of these powers or what precisely defines a great power. For example, following the Cold War and the two decades after it, some sources referred to China, France,&lt;ref name=&quot;European Security After 9/11&quot;&gt;P. Shearman, M. Sussex, &quot;European Security After 9/11&quot; (Ashgate, 2004) – According to Shearman and Sussex, both the UK and France were great powers now reduced to middle power status.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia and the United Kingdom as middle powers. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, its UN Security Council permanent seat was transferred to the Russian Federation in 1991, as its largest successor state. The newly formed Russian Federation emerged on the level of a great power, leaving the United States as the only remaining global superpower (although some support a multipolar world view).

Germany and Japan are widely considered great powers as well, due in large part to their highly advanced economies (as the two possess the third and fourth largest economies by nominal GDP respectively) rather than their strategic and hard power capabilities (i.e., the lack of permanent seats and veto power on the UN Security Council or strategic military reach). Germany has been a member together with the five permanent Security Council members in the P5+1 grouping of world powers. Like China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom; Germany and Japan have also been referred to as middle powers. In his 2014 publication &quot;Great Power Peace and American Primacy&quot;, Joshua Baron considers China, France, Russia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States as the current great powers.

Italy has been referred to as a great power by a number of academics and commentators throughout the post-WWII era. The American international legal scholar Milena Sterio writes: Sterio also cites Italy&#x27;s status in the Group of Seven (G7) and the nation&#x27;s influence in regional and international organizations for its status as a great power. Italy has been a member together with the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany in the International Support Group for Lebanon (ISG) grouping of world powers. Some analysts assert that Italy is an &quot;intermittent&quot; or the &quot;Least of the Great Powers&quot;, while some others believe Italy is a middle or regional power.

International relations academics Gabriele Abbondanza and Thomas Wilkins have classified Italy as an &quot;awkward&quot; great power on account of its top-tier economic, military, political, and socio-cultural capabilities and credentials - including its G7 and NATO Quint membership - which are moderated by its lack of national nuclear weapons and permanent membership to the UN Security Council.

In addition to these contemporary great powers mentioned above, Zbigniew Brzezinski considers India to be a great power. However, there is no collective agreement among observers as to the status of India, for example, a number of academics believe that India is emerging as a great power, while some believe that India remains a middle power.

The United Nations Security Council, NATO Quint, the G7, the BRICS, and the Contact Group have all been described as great power concerts.

A 2017 study by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies qualified China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia, and the United States as the current great powers.

===Emerging powers===
With continuing European integration, the European Union is increasingly being seen as a great power in its own right, with representation at the WTO and at G7 and G-20 summits. This is most notable in areas where the European Union has exclusive competence (i.e. economic affairs). It also reflects a non-traditional conception of Europe&#x27;s world role as a global &quot;civilian power&quot;, exercising collective influence in the functional spheres of trade and diplomacy, as an alternative to military dominance. The European Union is a supranational union and not a sovereign state and does not have its own foreign affairs or defence policies; these remain largely with the member states, which include France, Germany and, before Brexit, the United Kingdom (referred to collectively as the &quot;EU three&quot;).

Brazil and India are widely regarded as emerging powers with the potential to be great powers. Political scientist Stephen P. Cohen asserts that India is an emerging power, but highlights that some strategists consider India to be already a great power. Some academics such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and David A. Robinson already regard India as a major or great power.
Former British Ambassador to Brazil, Peter Collecott identifies that Brazil&#x27;s recognition as a potential great and superpower largely stems from its own national identity and ambition. Professor Kwang Ho Chun feels that Brazil will emerge as a great power with an important position in some spheres of influence. Others suggest India and Brazil may even have the potential to emerge as a superpower.

Permanent membership of the UN Security Council is widely regarded as being a central tenet of great power status in the modern world; Brazil, Germany, India and Japan form the G4 nations which support one another (and have varying degrees of support from the existing permanent members) in becoming permanent members. The G4 is opposed by the Italian-led Uniting for Consensus group. There are however few signs that reform of the Security Council will happen in the near future.

<text>Chinese Empire (or Empire of China) is a term referring to the realm ruled by the Emperor of China during the era known as Imperial China. It was coined by western scholars and used to describe the Ming and Qing dynasties (or imperial Chinese dynasties in general). Another term was &quot;Celestial Empire&quot;, in reference to the status of the emperor as the Son of Heaven. In 221 BC, China was unified under an emperor for the first time, and various dynasties or empires founded by hereditary monarchs ruled China for a total of two millennia since then, including the Qin, Han, Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing.

==Etymology and usage==

The word &quot;China&quot; has been used in English since the 16th century. China was previously known to Europeans as Cathay, as used in Marco Polo&#x27;s book on his travels in the 13th century (during the Yuan dynasty), and it took a while for most Europeans to be convinced that Cathay referred to China or North China. The term &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; first appeared in the 16th century (late Ming dynasty), and its usage increased during the following Qing dynasty.

=== Ming dynasty ===
As European explorers came into direct contact with the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) of China during their voyages in the early 16th century, the European intellectual community began to update its concept of the Chinese political system. Initially however the vast majority of them considered Ming China a kingdom rather than an empire. It appeared that it was Maximilianus Transylvanus who first considered China an empire in his work. In 1585, Juan González de Mendoza pointed out that Ming China was at the imperial level based on the multi-level system of the tribute system. Afterwards, Europeans like Matteo Ricci, Álvaro Semedo, Martino Martini and Philippe Couplet gradually constructed the name &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; by comparing the empire-kingdom level, translating European and Chinese concepts and constructing genealogies. However, popular adoption was a slow process. Even the 1615 book &quot;De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas&quot; by Matteo Ricci (one of the founding figures of the Jesuit China missions) more often referred to Ming China as a kingdom than an empire. By the last decade of the Ming dynasty though, an increasing number of Europeans began to refer to the Ming dynasty as &quot;Chinese Empire&quot;.

=== Qing dynasty ===
With the transition from Ming to Qing, Europeans began to apply the name &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; to the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; (or &quot;Empire of China&quot;) was commonly used during the Qing period, most notably in the western maps and international treaties. The Tsardom of Russia began official communications with the Qing dynasty in the 1650s, and Russian documents from that period referred to Qing China as &quot;Empire of China&quot;, &quot;Chinese state&quot; or the state of Bogda. In the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, the authoritative Latin text used the name &quot;Imperii Sinici&quot; (meaning &quot;Chinese Empire&quot;) to refer to the Qing realm. George Macartney, the first envoy of Great Britain to China in 1793, had famously said &quot;the Empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a fortunate succession of able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these hundred and fifty years past...&quot; shortly after his mission to China. While the Qing dynasty tried to maintain the traditional Chinese tributary system, by the second half of the 19th century it had become part of a European-style community of sovereign states. In the process, Qing dynasty&#x27;s geographical boundaries were redefined by western powers and Japan through diplomacy and warfare. The Qing administration made an effort to effectively manage its borders while modernizing itself, and its dependencies in Inner Asia (collectively known as Chinese Tartary at that time) were internalized and integrated into China&#x27;s imperial dominion as accepted by the western countries. Throughout the 19th century, western cartographers commonly included Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan), and Tibet, along with China proper separated by lines, as part of the &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; in published maps. In the last decade of the Qing dynasty, maps published in China caught up with Western cartography, and China&#x27;s Inner Asian frontiers were enclosed by fixed international boundaries and not separated from China proper by special demarcations.

===Continuous or separate empire(s)===
While the term &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; may be used to specifically mean the Ming or the Qing dynasties during the existence of these dynasties, it was often used in a sense to refer to a continuous empire ruled by various dynasties in Chinese history, as the traditional Chinese historiography conceives its history in terms of an unbroken sequence of dynasties (see dynastic cycle). For example, when Juan González de Mendoza talked about ancient China in his work in the late 16th century, he clearly stated in three places that the first (mythical) sovereign of China, the Yellow Emperor, made the Chinese kingdom an empire; since China was already an empire during the time of the Yellow Emperor, all dynasties from then on were regarded as the continuation of the &quot;empire&quot;. According to Matteo Ricci&#x27;s view of &quot;imperial power transfer&quot;, the name of the empire had not changed since ancient times, but it often had other names due to different ruling families; for instance, the name of &quot;German Empire&quot; would never change, but when the Austrian family ruled, it could also be called &quot;Austrian Empire&quot;. Likewise, according to the newspaper &quot;New York Herald&quot; published in 1853, &quot;during four thousand and sixty years, twenty-one dynasties have swayed the destines of the Chinese Empire, embracing, besides the present sovereign, two hundred and twenty Emperors, whose average reigns have been nearly nineteen years each&quot;.

On the other hand, modern scholars usually consider the imperial dynasties separate states or empires rather than a single continuous empire, especially since the end of Imperial China. Meanwhile, the English term &quot;Emperor&quot; nowadays generally corresponds to the Chinese term &quot;Huangdi&quot; (皇帝), also referred to as Emperor of China. For example, the Qin dynasty, which was the first to use the title Emperor or &quot;Huangdi&quot;, has been referred to as &quot;the first Chinese Empire&quot; in modern sources. On the other hand, the Qing dynasty is regarded as the last Chinese Empire. The dynasties in between them are similarly regarded as empires instead of a single continuous empire, and terms such as &quot;Sui-Tang transition&quot; and &quot;Ming-Qing transition&quot; were introduced in the second half of the 20th century to highlight the changes during transitions of these periods, While imperial dynasties are no longer considered a single empire, some dynasties may be grouped together by some scholars, such as the Qin and the Han dynasty that followed, collectively called the &quot;Qin-Han Empire&quot; by some researchers. Taken together, these two dynasties constitute the &quot;classical&quot; era of Chinese civilization, as did the Greeks and Romans in the West.

==General history==

The period of Imperial China lasted more than two millennia, connecting ancient and modern history. Although Chinese dynasties or empires rose and fell during those centuries, including during periods of strife and war, Imperial China endured with remarkable constancy. The defining characteristics of all Chinese empires were their large scale and the diversity of their peoples.

Originally emerged as a loose collection of various Han Chinese-speaking entities during the Warring States period, the Qin&#x27;s wars of unification brought most of the &quot;Huaxia&quot; realm into one single dynasty, establishing Qin as the first imperial dynasty in 221 BC, the year where the first Chinese empire was established. Imperial China would continue to expand even after the collapse of the Qin dynasty, with the Han dynasty expanding to the north, south and west. During the Tang dynasty four centuries later, China achieved a golden age in terms of its economic, military and political power. Tang&#x27;s territory spanned Central Asia, Northeast Asia and parts of Southeast Asia, until the dynasty ended following the An Lushan rebellion in the eighth century. Imperial China marked its revival under the Mongol-based Yuan dynasty, when Inner Asian territories such as Tibet and Mongolia were incorporated. The Qing dynasty, founded three centuries after the fall of the Yuan dynasty, laid ground to most of China&#x27;s modern border with its re-expansion into Inner Asia.

One year after the 1911 Revolution, the Qing monarchy was abolished following the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor (Puyi), thus putting an end to the era of Imperial China. Three years later, Yuan Shikai restored imperial rule with himself as the emperor. It lasted only 83 days before his own abdication due to mounting disapproval and revolts as well as Yuan&#x27;s declining health. In July 1917, Puyi was reinstalled by Zhang Xun but the restoration was reversed in less than two weeks.

<text>A writing table (French &quot;bureau plat&quot;) has a series of drawers directly under the surface of the table, to contain writing implements, so that it may serve as a desk. Antique versions have the usual divisions for the inkwell, the blotter and the sand or powder tray in one of the drawers, and a surface covered with leather or some other material less hostile to the quill or the fountain pen than simple hard wood.

In form, a writing table is a pedestal desk without the pedestals, having legs instead to hold it up. This is why such tables are sometimes called leg desks.

The writing table is often called a &quot;bureau plat&quot; when it is done in a French style such as Louis XVI, Art Nouveau, etc. When a writing table is supported by two legs instead of four, it is usually called a trestle desk.

The writing table is also sometimes called a library table, because it was often placed in a home library. This was the room in a house where a gentleman would keep literature and also do his business transactions. The library often housed, in addition, a round desk called a rent table and sometimes a drawing table. The term library table is sometimes applied indiscriminately to a wide variety of desk forms, in addition to being used for writing tables.

Some writing tables have additional drawers built above the surface. In this case they are often called bureau à gradin instead of writing table, unless they have a more specific form, such as that of a Carlton House desk.

A reading and writing table with an easel or double easel for books that was adjustable on a ratchet and a drawer fitted for writing implements was a mid-18th century English invention that lasted as long as the habit endured of reading while standing.

The writing tables are good for maintaining posture and help readers or writers to work longer, nowadays writing tables evolved into desk with desktop systems and other smart devices according to one&#x27;s need.

<doc id="372841" wikidata="Q27147" url="?curid=372841" title="Sapindaceae">
<text>The Sapindaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales known as the soapberry family. It contains 138 genera and 1,858 accepted species. Examples include horse chestnut, maples, ackee and lychee.

The Sapindaceae occur in temperate to tropical regions, many in laurel forest habitat, throughout the world. Many are laticiferous, i.e. they contain latex, a milky sap, and many contain mildly toxic saponins with soap-like qualities in either the foliage and/or the seeds, or roots. The largest genera are &quot;Serjania&quot;, &quot;Paullinia&quot;, &quot;Allophylus&quot; and &quot;Acer&quot;.

==Description==
Plants of this family have a variety of habits, from trees to herbaceous plants to lianas. The leaves of the tropical genera are usually spirally alternate, while those of the temperate maples (&quot;Acer), Aesculus&quot;, and a few other genera are opposite. They are most often pinnately compound, but are palmately compound in &quot;Aesculus&quot;, and simply palmate in &quot;Acer&quot;. The petiole has a swollen base and lacks stipules. Some genera and species have laurel forest foliage due to convergent evolution.
The flowers are small and unisexual, or functionally unisexual, though plants may be either dioecious or monoecious. They are usually found in cymes grouped in panicles. They most often have four or five petals and sepals (petals are absent in &quot;Dodonaea&quot;). The stamens range from four to 10, usually on a nectar disc between the petals and stamens, their filaments are often hairy. The most frequent number is eight, in two rings of four. The gynoecium contains two or three carpels, sometimes up to six. The usually single style has a lobed stigma. Most often they are pollinated by birds or insects, with a few species pollinated by wind.

Ripe fruits may be fleshy or dry. They may be nuts, berries, drupes, schizocarps, capsules (&quot;Bridgesia&quot;), or samaras (&quot;Acer&quot;). The embryos are bent or coiled, without endosperm in the seed, and frequently with an aril.

==Classification==

The Sapindaceae are related to the Rutaceae, and both are usually placed in an order Sapindales or Rutales, depending on whether they are kept separate and which name is used for the order. The most basal member appears to be &quot;Xanthoceras&quot;. Some authors formerly maintained some or all of Hippocastanaceae and Aceraceae, however this resulted in paraphyly. The former Ptaeroxylaceae, now placed in Rutaceae, were sometimes placed in Sapindaceae. The family is divided into four subfamilies, Dodonaeoideae (about 38 genera), Sapindoideae (about 114 genera), Hippocastanoideae (5 genera) and Xanthoceroideae (1 genus). The largest genera are &quot;Serjania&quot; (about 220 species), &quot;Paullinia&quot; (about 180 species), and &quot;Allophylus&quot; (about 200 species) in the tropical Sapindoideae and &quot;Acer&quot; (about 110 species) in the temperate Hippocastanoideae.

The largely temperate genera formerly separated in the families Aceraceae (&quot;Acer&quot;, &quot;Dipteronia&quot;) and Hippocastanaceae (&quot;Aesculus&quot;, &quot;Billia&quot;, &quot;Handeliodendron&quot;) were included within a more broadly circumscribed Sapindaceae by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. Recent research has confirmed the inclusion of these genera in the Sapindaceae.

==Notable species==

The Sapindaceae include many species of economically valuable tropical fruit, including the lychee, longan, pitomba, guinip/mamoncillo, korlan, rambutan, pulasan, and ackee. Other products include guaraná, soapberries, and maple syrup.

Some species of maple and buckeye are valued for their wood, while several other genera, such as &quot;Koelreuteria&quot;, &quot;Cardiospermum&quot;, and &quot;Ungnadia&quot;, are popular ornamentals. &quot;Schleichera trijuga&quot; is the source of Indian macassar oil. Saponins extracted from the drupe of &quot;Sapindus&quot; species are effective surfactants and are used commercially in cosmetics and detergents.

<text>is a subregion of the Chūbu region in Japan consisting of Yamanashi, Nagano, and Niigata prefectures.

The name Kōshin&#x27;etsu is a composite formed from the names of old provinces which are adjacent to each other — Kai (now Yamanashi), Shinano (now Nagano) and Echigo (now Niigata). The region is surrounded by the Sea of Japan to its north west, Hokuriku region to its west, Tōkai region to its south west, Kantō region to its south east, and Tōhoku region to its north east. The name for this geographic area is usually combined with Kantō region (as in &quot;Kantō-Kōshin&#x27;etsu&quot;); and it is sometimes combined with Hokuriku region (as in &quot;Kantō-Kōshin&#x27;etsu-Hokuriku&quot; or &quot;Hokuriku-Kōshin&#x27;etsu&quot;).

<doc id="372857" wikidata="Q295340" url="?curid=372857" title="Clyde Drexler">
<text>Clyde Austin Drexler (born June 22, 1962) is an American former professional basketball player who currently works as the commissioner of the Big3 3-on-3 basketball league. Nicknamed &quot;Clyde the Glide&quot;, he played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), spending a majority of his career with the Portland Trail Blazers before finishing with the Houston Rockets. He was a ten-time NBA All-Star, five time All-NBA Selection, and was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams. Drexler won an NBA championship with Houston in 1995, and earned a gold medal on the 1992 United States Olympic team known as &quot;The Dream Team&quot;. He was inducted twice into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2004 for his individual career and in 2010 as a member of the &quot;Dream Team&quot;. Drexler is widely considered one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooting guards of all time.

==Early years==
Drexler was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and lived in the South Park area in Houston, Texas. He attended Ross Sterling High School in Houston, where he was a classmate of tennis player Zina Garrison. As a sophomore, he made the varsity baseball team, and tried out for the basketball team but failed to make the cut. Drexler played as a center as a senior. He began receiving attention from college coaches following a 34-point, 27-rebound performance against Sharpstown High School during a 1979 Christmas tournament.

After graduating in 1980, he was recruited by New Mexico State University, Texas Tech University, and the University of Houston, the latter after childhood friend Michael Young told an assistant to head coach Guy Lewis that Drexler was the best player he had faced in high school. Houston was able to recruit them both due to Drexler&#x27;s friendship with Young and his desire to stay home. Drexler majored in finance and worked at a bank during the summer. Lewis recalled in 2003 that he initially received hate mail from Houston supporters and alumni for recruiting Drexler, as they felt that he was not good enough to play for the school.

==College career==
Drexler and Young, along with Larry Micheaux and new recruit Hakeem Olajuwon (known then as Akeem), comprised the &quot;Phi Slama Jama&quot; basketball fraternity that gained national attention for its acrobatic, above-the-rim play. New players were &quot;initiated&quot; into the fraternity by having to stand underneath the basket as Drexler drove in from halfcourt and threw down a tomahawk slam over them. Houston made the first of Drexler&#x27;s two straight Final Four appearances in 1982, where they lost to eventual champions North Carolina. He averaged 15.2 points and 10.5 rebounds (second in the Southwest Conference) per game as a small forward as Houston finished 25–8.

The 1982–83 campaign saw Houston return to the Final Four ranked No. 1. They were matched up against No. 2 Louisville and the &quot;Doctors of Dunk&quot; in the semifinals, which Houston won 94–81 following a brilliant dunking display by both sides, including a double-pump slam by Drexler that &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Curry Kirkpatrick called &quot;your basic play of the century&quot;. He finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists. In the championship game against North Carolina State, Drexler failed to make an impact after picking up four fouls before halftime, and scored only four points on one-of-five shooting and two free throws in NC State&#x27;s upset victory.

Drexler declared for the NBA draft as a junior, leaving Houston with career averages of 14.4 points, 3.3 assists and 9.9 rebounds in three seasons. In addition to being named the Southwestern Conference Player of the Year and a first-team All American his final season, he remains the only player in school history with combined totals of at least 1,000 career points, 900 rebounds and 300 assists; he is also Houston&#x27;s all-time steals leader with 268.

==NBA career==

=== Portland Trail Blazers (1983–1995) ===
In the 1983 NBA draft, Drexler was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 14th overall pick. He averaged 7.7 points in 17.2 minutes per game in his rookie season. These all improved with more playing time in his second season, to 17.2 points, 6 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game. In his third season Drexler made his first All-Star team, averaging 18.5 points, 5.6 rebounds, 8 assists and 2.6 steals. On January 6, 1989, Drexler scored a career-high 50 points during a double-overtime win over the Sacramento Kings.

In the 1989–1990 season, Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1990 NBA Finals, averaging 23.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.9 assists during the season. The Blazers (ranked 3rd in the Western Conference) made it to the Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. While Drexler only led in scoring in the final two games, the Blazers were bolstered by players such as Terry Porter and Jerome Kersey to a six-game series victory, with Drexler and Porter each scoring 23 in the 112–109 victory that gave Portland its first conference championship since 1977. In the Finals, they played the Detroit Pistons. Drexler led the Blazers with 21 points in Game 1, but they lost 105–99. In Game 2, Drexler scored 33 points and contributed the go-ahead points in overtime by hitting two free throws with 2.1 seconds to beat Detroit 106–105. It was the only win in the series for the Blazers, who lost narrowly in Game 4 by three and lost the final game after Detroit went on a 9–0 run. During the 1990–1991 season, Drexler led Portland to a franchise-best 63–19 record. He played in every game for the first time in four seasons and averaged 21.5 points per game while having 6.7 rebounds and six assists on average. Heavily favored to win the West, the Los Angeles Lakers upset the Trail Blazers by winning the Western Conference Finals.

In the 1991–92 season he made the All-NBA First Team and finished second to Michael Jordan in MVP voting, having averaged 25 points per game to go with 6.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists while playing slightly over 35 minutes a game; the Blazers finished 57–25, best in the Western Conference. The Blazers lost just twice in the first two rounds of the postseason, In the Conference Finals, they faced the Utah Jazz. Teammate Terry Porter cited Drexler decades later as the key guy to get the ball to when it came down to late in a game to make plays. Portland won the first two games at home before Utah responded with two victories in Utah. In Game 5, Portland won in overtime to set up a Game 6 in Utah. Porter and Drexler each scored 18 points in the pivotal Game 6 that the Blazers won 105–97 to clinch their second conference championship in three years. Drexler and the Blazers met Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the 1992 NBA Finals. In the Finals, Drexler was the leader or tied for the lead in scoring for the Blazers in each of the six games, leading all scorers once in Game 3 with 32 points in a 94–84 loss. Despite forcing a tie series twice, the Bulls pulled a comeback in the fourth quarter to turn a 15-point deficit into a win that clinched the series. In the six-game series against Chicago, Drexler averaged 24.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. Later that year, he was selected to the U.S. Olympic basketball team, nicknamed &quot;The Dream Team&quot;, which won the gold medal in Barcelona.

Drexler left as the all-time scoring leader for the Blazers with 18,040 points, which stood as a franchise record until Damian Lillard passed him in 2022.

=== Houston Rockets (1995–1998) ===
On February 14, 1995, with the Blazers out of serious contention for a championship, Portland honored Drexler&#x27;s request to be traded to a contender. They sent the Blazer great back home to the Houston Rockets, along with Tracy Murray in exchange for Otis Thorpe, the draft rights of Marcelo Nicola, and a 1995 first-round draft pick, right before the trade deadline. Despite finishing the regular season with a record of 47–35, which placed the Rockets 6th out of 8 playoff teams in the Western Conference, Drexler and long-time friend Hakeem Olajuwon helped propel them to an improbable second consecutive championship in 1995. On May 5, during the first round while down two games to one against the Utah Jazz, Drexler led the Rockets in scoring with 41 points while Olajuwon added 40 in a 123–106 win. Houston would go on to win the deciding Game 5, and then also win every remaining elimination game on their postseason run.
In the finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic. In his third and final NBA Finals appearance, Drexler averaged 21.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game.

Drexler played his last three full seasons with the Rockets. The 1995–96 season saw him average 19.3 points per game in 52 games played, owing to knee and ankle injuries. The Rockets dispatched their first-round opponent in the Lakers to face the Seattle SuperSonics. Drexler led the team in a variety of categories in the series such as rebounds (twice), points (twice), and assists (once), but the Sonics eliminated the Rockets in four games. The following year, the Rockets, having traded for Charles Barkley before the year started, went 21–2 to begin the year, but injuries would pile on the team, with Drexler having a hamstring injury; he was named to the All-Star Game, but he did not play in what ended up as his final selection. Drexler played a total of 62 games while averaging eighteen points a game with six rebounds and 5.7 assists. The Rockets finished 57-25 and made it all the way to the Conference Finals against the Jazz. The Rockets forced six games after winning Game 3 and 4, but the Jazz won in six to end the season. The 1997–98 season was his final season in the NBA. He played in 70 games and averaged 18.4 points a game with 4.9 rebounds (his lowest since his rookie year) and 5.5 assists. These totals led the team (which had less of Olajuwon due to injury), which staggered to a 41–41 record and a playoff spot. The Rockets played the Jazz in the opening round and held a series lead going into Game 4, but an injury to Barkley spelled the end of their chances, as Utah rallied to send Houston home in five games, the first opening round loss for Houston since 1991. Drexler retired at the age of 35, stating his reason as doing so because of his desire to leave on his own terms while still playing at a &quot;high level&quot;. At the time of his retirement, Drexler was one of only three players in history with 20,000 points, 6,000 assists and 6,000 rebounds. In fifteen seasons, he never missed the playoffs.

==Player profile==

Clyde &quot;The Glide&quot; Drexler, as he was nicknamed at the University of Houston and throughout his professional career, was famed for his speed and athleticism on the court and his easygoing and quiet demeanor off the court. At the University of Houston, Drexler became well known for his exceptional abilities as a finisher, but generally was not considered a great shooter. During his pro career Drexler developed a much more well-rounded game, even becoming an effective post player and more consistent outside shooter. His extraordinary leaping abilities allowed him to be an acrobatic dunker and Drexler participated in numerous NBA All-Star dunk contests during the late eighties.

Drexler was regarded as a versatile player, and he was consistently among the leaders at his position in points, rebounds, assists, and steals. He also posted a considerable number of blocked shots for a player his size, ranking third for his career totals among guards.

Drexler set a Trail Blazer record in 1989 by dunking on an 11&#x27; 1&quot; rim.

As of 2008, Drexler leads all guards with his career average of offensive rebounds with 2.4 per game.

In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Drexler as the 43rd greatest player in NBA history.

==College coaching career==
After retiring from the NBA following the 1997–98 season, he became the head men&#x27;s basketball coach at his alma mater, the University of Houston.

Drexler coached the Cougars in the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. After compiling a 19–39 record in his two seasons, Drexler decided to resign to spend more time with his family.

==Honors==

Drexler&#x27;s No. 22 jersey has been retired by the Cougars (&quot;pictured&quot;), Rockets, and Trail Blazers. He was inducted as a player into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 10, 2004, in his first year of eligibility. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and named to the league&#x27;s 75th anniversary team in 2021.

In 2004 Drexler co-authored his biography, &quot;Clyde the Glide&quot;, with &quot;Portland Tribune&quot; sports writer Kerry Eggers, and University of Houston classmate and CBS Sports broadcaster Jim Nantz providing the foreword.

==Personal life==

Drexler married his wife, Gaynell, on December 30, 1988. They divorced in 2011. He has four children: Erica, Austin, Elise, and Adam (the last three with Gaynell). In 2014 Drexler married his second wife, Tonya, whom he had met through fellow NBA star Dominique Wilkins. Drexler has owned homes in the River Oaks–Memorial neighborhood of Houston and in the Dunthorpe suburb of Portland.

His brother James and his two sisters, Denise and Virginia, run the family barbecue restaurants in Houston called Drexler&#x27;s World Famous BBQ &amp; Grill, which includes the &quot;22 Bar&quot;. His mother, Eunice Scott, also works at the downtown restaurant that was started by his uncle in 1967. There are two locations, downtown Houston and Bush Intercontinental Airport. Drexler also started investing in real estate in his rookie NBA season, and although he is now mostly retired, he does do some managing of his Drexler Holdings LLC, based in downtown Houston.

==Books==
Drexler is the subject of the book &quot;Clyde Drexler: Clyde the Glide&quot;. He also wrote the introduction to the children&#x27;s book &quot;Shrews Can&#x27;t Hoop&quot;.

==TV appearances==
Drexler made a guest appearance on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;Arliss&quot;, and was also a guest star in an episode of &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. In 2006, he made a cameo appearance in the basketball movie &quot;Like Mike 2: Streetball&quot;. That same year, Drexler participated in the first season of the Spike TV show &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;, which features three amateur contestants matching themselves against five professional athletes. Drexler was a member of the regular season Green Team and the season finale Orange Team.

On February 21, 2007, it was announced that Drexler would participate in the fourth season of the American version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with partner Elena Grinenko. Drexler was the fourth celebrity to be voted off in round five on April 17, 2007.

On April 11, 2010, Drexler appeared as a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; in which he helped the men&#x27;s team &quot;Rock Solid&quot; complete a task to create video advertisements for Right Guard.

<text>Chaudhary Charan Singh (23 December 1902 – 29 May 1987) was an Indian politician, peasant leader, author and an independence activist who briefly served as the prime minister of India from July 1979 to August 1979. Singh was principally known for his land and agricultural reform initiatives, and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Baghpat. During his premiership, he was a member of the Janata Party (Secular). He served as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh as a member of Bhartiya Kranti Dal. He also briefly served as the deputy prime minister of India from January 1979 to July 1979 as a member of the Janata Party. Singh is widely regarded as the &quot;Champion of Farmers&quot;, dedicated to advocating for the well being and rights of farmers.

Singh was born in Meerut district, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. He graduated from Agra College in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree, and then pursued Master of Arts in history in 1925. In 1927 he completed his Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from Meerut College. 

Singh entered politics as a part of Indian independence movement motivated by Mahatma Gandhi. Singh followed Gandhi in non-violent struggle for independence from the British Government, and was imprisoned several times. In 1930, he was sent to jail for 12 years by the British for contravention of the salt laws. He was jailed again for one year in November 1940 for individual Satyagraha movement. In August 1942 he was jailed again by the British under DIR and released in November 1943. He was a Congress member for most of his life, he later founded his own Lok Dal party. He is the first leader outside the Indian National Congress who formed government in the northern India and became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 2024.

== Early life and education ==
Singh was born on 23 December 1902 to Mir Singh and Netar Kaur in Nurpur village of Meerut district, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. His father was a farmer belonging to the Tewatia clan of Jats. Singh started his primary education in Jani Khurd village in Meerut. He did his Matriculation and Intermediate from the Government High School in 1921 and then he went to Agra College to pursue Bachelor of Science in 1923, Masters of Arts in History (British, European and Indian) in 1925. He then did Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from Meerut College in 1927. Singh have knowledge about European and Indian history as well as civil laws of British India as it affected the lives of village peoples.

His clansmen hail from the Haryana&#x27;s Gurgaon district, where they were revenue collectors during the Mughal period. But they shifted to Bulandshahr district of the present-day Uttar Pradesh after their downfall due to one of their prominent Raja Nahar Singh Ballabhgarh opposition to the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Singh entered politics as part of the Indian Independence Movement motivated by Mahatma Gandhi. He was active from 1931 in the Ghaziabad District Arya Samaj as well as the Meerut district Indian National Congress for which he was jailed twice by the British. Before independence, as a member of Legislative Assembly of the United Provinces elected in 1937, he took a deep interest in the laws that were detrimental to the village economy and he slowly built his ideological and practical stand against the exploitation of tillers of the land by landlords.

Between 1952 and 1968, he was one of &quot;three principal leaders in Congress state politics.&quot; He became particularly notable in Uttar Pradesh from the 1950s for drafting and ensuring the passage of what were then the most revolutionary land reform laws in any state in India under the tutelage of the then Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant; first as Parliamentary Secretary and then as Revenue Minister responsible for Land Reforms. He became visible on the national stage from 1959 when he publicly opposed the unquestioned leader and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s socialistic and collectivist land policies in the Nagpur Congress Session. Though his position in the faction-ridden Uttar Pradesh Congress was weakened, this was a point when the middle peasant communities across castes in North India began looking up to him as their spokesperson and later as their unquestioned leader. Singh stood for tight government spending, enforced consequences for corrupt officers, and advocated a &quot;firm hand in dealing with the demands of government employees for increased wages and dearness allowances.&quot; It is also worth noting that within the factional Uttar Pradesh Congress, his ability to articulate his clear policies and values made him stand out from his colleagues. Following this period, Charan Singh defected from the Congress on 1 April 1967, joined the opposition party, and became the first non-Congress chief minister of UP. This was a period when non-Congress governments were a strong force in India from 1967 to 1971.

As leader of the Bharatiya Lok Dal, a major constituent of the Janata coalition, he was disappointed in his ambition to become Prime Minister in 1977 by Jayaprakash Narayan&#x27;s choice of Morarji Desai.

During 1977 Lok Sabha Elections, the fragmented opposition united a few months before the elections under the Janata Party banner, for which Chaudhary Charan Singh had been struggling almost single-handedly since 1974. It was because of the efforts of Raj Narain that he became Prime Minister in the year 1979 though Raj Narain was Chairman of Janata Party-Secular and assured Charan Singh of elevating him as Prime Minister, the way he helped him to become Chief Minister in the year 1967 in Uttar Pradesh. However, he resigned after just 23 days in office when Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress Party withdrew support to the government. Singh said he resigned because he was not ready to be blackmailed into withdrawing Indira Gandhi&#x27;s emergency-related court cases. Fresh elections were held six months later. Charan Singh continued to lead the Lok Dal in opposition until his death in 1987.

==Early years – pre-Independence India==

Charan Singh&#x27;s ancestor was a prominent leader of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Raja Nahar Singh of Ballabhgarh (in present-day Haryana). Nahar Singh was sent to the gallows in Chandni Chowk, Delhi. In order to escape the oppression from the British Government following their defeat, the Maharaja&#x27;s followers, including Charan Singh&#x27;s grandfather moved eastward to district Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.

He received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1925 and a law degree in 1926 from Agra University. He started practice as a civil lawyer at Ghaziabad in 1928.

In February 1937 he was elected from the constituency of Chhaprauli (Baghpat) to the Legislative Assembly of the United Provinces at the age of 34. In 1938 he introduced an Agricultural Produce Market Bill in the Assembly which was published in the issues of The Hindustan Times of Delhi dated 31 March 1938. The Bill was intended to safeguard the interests of the farmers against the rapacity of traders. The Bill was adopted by most of the States in India, Punjab being the first state to do so in 1940.

Charan Singh followed Mahatma Gandhi in non-violent struggle for independence from the British Government, and was imprisoned several times. In 1930, he was sent to jail for 12 years by the British for contravention of the salt laws. He was jailed again for one year in November 1940 for individual Satyagraha movement. In August 1942 he was jailed again by the British under DIR and released in November 1943.

==Independent India==

Charan Singh opposed Jawaharlal Nehru on his Soviet-style economic reforms. Charan Singh was of the opinion that cooperative farms would not succeed in India. Being a son of a farmer, Charan Singh opined that the right of ownership was important to the farmer in remaining a cultivator. He wanted to preserve and stabilise a system of peasant proprietorship. Charan Singh&#x27;s political career suffered due to his open criticism of Nehru&#x27;s economic policy.

Singh is known for piloting pro-farmer legislation such as the Consolidation of Holdings Act of 1953 and the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari and Land Reforms Act, 1952. The latter led to the abolition of zamindari system in the state.He was also strict in dealing with the &#x27;Patwari strike crisis&#x27; in 1953. Land reforms resulted in empowering the tillers and providing the landless with ownership of land. It created a conducive atmosphere for the social and economic upliftment of the farmers. During the drought in 1966-1967, Singh offered the agriculturists a much higher procurement price than the prevailing market rates. The infrastructure he laid down led to the Minimum Support Price mechanism.

Charan Singh left the Congress party in 1967, and formed his own political party, Bharatiya Kranti Dal. With the help and support of Raj Narain and Ram Manohar Lohia, he became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1967, and later in 1970. In 1975, he was jailed again, but this time by then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, daughter of his former rival Nehru. She had declared the state of emergency and jailed all her political opponents. In the 1977 general elections, the Indian populace voted her out, and the opposition party, of which Chaudhary Charan Singh was a senior leader came into power. He served as Deputy Prime Minister, Home Minister and Finance minister in the Janata government headed by Morarji Desai.

=== First term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (1967–1968) ===
Charan Singh for the first time, became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on 3 April 1967 with the help of Samyukta Vidhayak Dal coalition. Samyukta Vidhayak Dal was formed after failure of negotiations between Charan Singh and Chandra Bhanu Gupta on the composition of Gupta&#x27;s ministry. Singh wanted some of his allies like Jai Ram Varma and Udit Narain Sharma to be included in the cabinet and removal of some of the men from the cabinet. As a result of failure of negotiations, Charan Singh with his 16 MLAs defected from Congress.

Samyukta Vidhayak Dal was coalition formed with the help of non-Congress parties like Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Samyukta Socialist Party, Communist Party of India, Swatantra Party, Praja Socialist Party, Republican Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist). Within months of his government formation disputes started to arise in SVD coalition. Samyukta Socialist Party, one of the constituent of this coalition, demanded to completely abolish the land revenue or at least abolish on uneconomic lands but Charan Singh refused to accept this demand as he was worried about the revenue generation and resources. Praja Socialist Party, another constituent in this coalition, demanded for the release of government employees held in preventive detention for their strikes but this demand also Singh refused to accept.

The disputes between Charan Singh and Samyukta Socialist Party became public when SSP decided to launch an agitation of &quot;Angrezi Hatao&quot; (get rid to English) and during this movement two of its ministers courted arrest. SSP withdrew from coalition on 5 January 1968. On 17 February 1968, Charan Singh submitted his resignation to the governor Bezawada Gopala Reddy and on 25 February 1968, President&#x27;s rule was imposed on Uttar Pradesh.

=== Second term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (1970) ===
After the split in Congress party, Chandra Bhanu Gupta resigned as Chief Minister on 10 February 1970. On 18 February 1970, Charan Singh became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh for the second time with the help of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress (R). After three Rajya Sabha members of Bharatiya Kranti Dal voted against the decision of Indira Gandhi to eliminate the Privy Purse, Kamalapati Tripathi announced the withdrawal of the support of Congress (R) for the Singh&#x27;s government. Charan Singh demanded the resignation of 14 Congress (R) minister but they refused to resign. On 27 September 1970, governor Bezawada Gopala Reddy accepted the resignation of ministers but also asked Charan Singh to resign.

On 1 October 1970, President&#x27;s rule was imposed on Uttar Pradesh by V. V. Giri from Kiev, who was on tour there. Just two weeks later with the recalling of the Uttar Pradesh assembly, Tribhuvan Narain Singh was elected the leader of the house and became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh with the support of Congress (O), Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Swatantra Party and Samyukta Socialist Party.

=== Minister of Home Affairs (1977–1978) ===
Charan Singh became Cabinet minister in Morarji Desai government and took the office as Minister of Home Affairs on 24 March 1977. As a Home Minister, Charan Singh took the decision to dissolve all the state assemblies which were under Congress rule. He argued that these assemblies no longer represent the will of the electorate of their respective states. Charan Singh wrote the letter to nine Chief Ministers to advise their governors to dissolve their state assemblies. Chief Minister of these states went to Supreme Court against this dissolution but the dismissals were validated by Supreme Court.

On 3 October 1977, Charan Singh got Indira Gandhi arrested from her 12 Willingdon Crescent residence. The charges against her were that during 1977 election, she misused her position to get jeeps for election campaigns and another charge was related to contract between the ONGC and the French oil company CFP. But the magistrate before whom she appeared, released her stating that there was no evidence to back up the arrest. By botching up the arrest, Singh prepared his resignation letter but Morarji Desai did not accept it.

On 1 July 1978, Charan Singh resigned from the cabinet of Morarji Desai because of growing differences between them over trial of Indira Gandhi. In December 1978, Singh wanted to undo Janata Party and wanted coalition government in place of Janata Party government. On 24 January 1979, Singh returned into cabinet and held two portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.

== Premiership (1979-1980) ==
Following the Janata Party victory in the 1977 general election, its MPs delegated the selection of a prime minister to Jayaprakash Narayan and Acharya Kripalani. Morarji Desai was chosen as the prime minister and subsequently appointed Charan Singh as home minister of India. However, due to disagreements with Desai, Singh was asked to resign on 1 July 1978. He was later reinstated as deputy prime minister on 24 January 1979. By 1979, the Janata Party faced internal divisions, particularly over the dual loyalties of some members to both the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

Singh, who had previously ordered the arrests of Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi as union home minister, capitalised on the growing discord by seeking the support of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress (I) party. Following significant defections from the Janata Party to Singh’s faction, Morarji Desai resigned as prime minister in July 1979. Subsequently, president Neelam Sanjiva Reddy appointed Singh as prime minister after Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi assured him of external support from Congress (I) under certain conditions. Singh was sworn in as prime minister on 28 July 1979, with Yeshwantrao Chavan of the Congress (Socialist) party serving as deputy prime minister.

Singh’s tenure as prime minister was short-lived. On 15 August 1979, he hoisted the national flag at the Red Fort on Independence Day, making history with his address to the nation. In his speech, he emphasised the importance of integrity, stating:

However, Charan Singh government soon faced a major setback. Indira Gandhi’s support was conditional upon the withdrawal of all charges against her and Sanjay Gandhi. Singh refused to comply, prompting Congress (I) to withdraw its support just before he was scheduled to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha. Consequently, he resigned as prime minister on 20 August 1979, after just 23 days in office, becoming the only Indian prime minister to never face Parliament.

Following his resignation, Singh advised president Reddy to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Janata Party leader Jagjivan Ram contested this move and sought time to gather support, but the dissolution proceeded. Singh remained in office as caretaker prime minister from 21 August 1979 to 14 January 1980, when fresh elections were held.

== Later years ==
On 26 September 1979, he formed Lok Dal by merging Janata Party (Secular), Socialist Party and Orissa Janata Party. He was elected president of Lok Dal and Raj Narain was elected as its working president. In August 1982, a major split occurred in Lok Dal, with one faction of Charan Singh and another consisted of Karpoori Thakur, Madhu Limaye, Biju Patnaik, Devi Lal, George Fernandes and Kumbha Ram Arya.

On 21 October 1984, Charan Singh founded a new party Dalit Mazdoor Kisan Party, by merging Lok Dal, Democratic Socialist Party of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, Rashtriya Congress of Ratubhai Adani and some leaders of Janata Party like Devi Lal. Later it changed its name back to the Lok Dal.
== Electoral history ==

His son Ajit Singh was the president of a political party Rashtriya Lok Dal and a former Union Minister and a many times Member of Parliament. Ajit Singh&#x27;s son Jayant Chaudhary was elected to 15th Lok Sabha from Mathura, which he lost to Hema Malini in the election of 2014, contested from Baghpat in 2014 and lost to Satyapal Singh Of BJP. He is now a Rajya Sabha M.P. from Uttar Pradesh and national president of Rashtriya Lok Dal.

== Awards and honours ==
** Bharat Ratna (9 February 2024, posthumous)

== Death ==
Singh initially suffered a stroke on 29 November 1985. He could not recover from that condition despite being treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, U.S. in March 1986. On 28 May 1987, Dr Jai Pal Singh along with other senior doctors from RML Hospital, New Delhi arrived at his residence around 11:35 p.m. (IST), after his respiration was found &quot;unsteady&quot;. 

Singh was then given oxygen support but efforts to revive him failed and was declared dead at 2:35 a.m. (IST) on 29 May 1987, due to &quot;cardiac arrest&quot; at the age of 85.

Following his death, the Government of India announced a four day mourning and a state funeral. On 31 May 1987, Singh was given a state funeral in Delhi. He was cremated at the Kisan Ghat in Raj Ghat, New Delhi. Many leaders arrived at Singh residence on Tuglaq Road to pay their last respects such as then PM Rajiv Gandhi, Natwar Singh, former president Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, Bansi Lal, Devi Lal, Ram Niwas Mirdha, N. D. Tiwari.

==Legacy==

Singh, often hailed as the ‘&quot;Champion of Farmers&quot;,’ left behind a rich legacy that continues to inspire and shape the agricultural landscape of India. His contributions to the welfare of the farmers and the rural community were profound and multifaceted.

Singh’s journey as a stalwart for farmers’ rights began with his instrumental role in piloting pro-farmer legislation such as the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act of 1950, which aimed to redistribute land from the zamindars to the tillers, and the Consolidation of Holdings Act of 1953, which sought to prevent the fragmentation of agricultural land.

Singh was the chief architect of land reforms in Uttar Pradesh, where he played a pivotal role in the formulation and finalisation of the Debt Redemption Bill 1939. This legislation brought significant relief to rural debtors, easing the burden of debts that had long plagued the agricultural community.

As Chief Minister of U.P., Singh was instrumental in enacting the Land Holding Act of 1960. This act aimed at lowering the ceiling on land holdings to make it uniform throughout the state, thereby promoting fairer land distribution and addressing the disparities in land ownership.

Singh’s birthday, 23 December, was declared as &quot;Kisan Diwas&quot; or &quot;National Farmers’ Day&quot; in 2001. This day is celebrated across India to honor his memory and his unwavering dedication to the agrarian community. To commemorate his second death anniversary, the Government of India issued a postage stamp on 29 May 1990. The stamp symbolises the nation’s respect for his contributions as the 5th prime minister of India and a champion of farmers’ rights. His commitment to the agricultural sector were further immortalised with the establishment of Kisan Ghat in 1987 as this memorial in New Delhi serves as a serene place where people pay their respects to the man who was often referred to as the ‘&quot;Champion of Farmers&quot;.’

Several monuments and institutions have been named after Singh to honour his legacy which includes the Chaudhary Charan Singh University in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and the Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, which was renamed in his honour. On 23 December 2023, a 51-foot statue of Singh was unveiled by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Bilari, Moradabad district coinciding Singh’s birth anniversary.

On 30 March 2024, Singh was posthumously honoured with the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award by President Droupadi Murmu, for his exceptional service and contributions to the agricultural sector, particularly in Uttar Pradesh. Singh’s multifaceted personality encompassed roles as a patriot, administrator, statesman, and a man of integrity and humanist values.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Kisan Kranti Ke Praneta – Ch. Charan Singh&quot; is a 1996 short documentary film directed by Ashok Vazirani and produced by the Films Division of India which covers the life and achievements of the prime minister including his contributions to the Indian agriculture sector. Charan Singh has also been portrayed by Anwar Fatehan in the 2013 television series &quot;Pradhanmantri&quot; (), which covers the tenures of Indian PMs, by Sundaram in the 2019 film &quot;&quot; which is based on the life of Indian actor-politician N. T. Rama Rao., and by Govind Namdeo in the 2021 film &quot;Main Mulayam Singh Yadav&quot; which charts the life of former Uttar Pradesh CM Mulayam Singh Yadav.

<doc id="372873" wikidata="Q2711388" url="?curid=372873" title="Ornate chorus frog">
<text>The ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata) is a species of chorus frog endemic to the Southeastern United States. Their distribution ranges from North Carolina, east to the very eastern part of Louisiana, and south to northern parts of Florida.

==Description==
It is in head-body length, with the record size being 4 cm. Its color varies depending on locale: normally having a reddish-brown or gray color, but a rare dominant allele can turn their background color bright green. It typically has a defined but broken stripe or spots leading from the nose down the side. The frog&#x27;s upper lip is marked with a clear light colored line and many individuals have a faded triangle marking on the very top of the head. It has a pure white belly, and usually has yellow spots located in front of the hind legs.

==Habitat==
Most commonly found in the Southern coastal plain. The ornate chorus frog is typically found in xeric habitats, including pine stands, sandhills, and pine savannahs. Woodland ponds, flooded fields, and roadside ditches can serve as breeding habitat, although ponds found within sandhills, and pine forests or plantations observe the most breeding. A site with an open canopy and herbaceous vegetation is also common for breeding. These frogs require seasonally flooded wetlands without fish for a three to four month period for tadpoles to develop completely.

==Behavior==
These chorus frogs are nocturnal and are rarely seen, except during mating season. They become more active as the temperature begins to decrease and begin migrating toward water for the mating season. Most observations of this frog are on winter nights during or after rain. Because of this, little is known about the adult ornate chorus frog. They spend the remainder of the spring and summer waiting out the warm temperatures in burrows, under logs, or buried under sandy soil.

They are a fossorial species that uses their forelimbs in order to burrow into the substrate. This is a unique behavior because most burrowing frogs will dig backwards with their hind limbs. One study suggests that this method of forward burrowing may have evolved to facilitate subterranean feeding. They prefer to burrow in easily penetrated sandy soils and will occasionally communicate underground through vocalizations. 

== Predator and prey relationships ==
Ornate chorus frogs are insectivores, eating small insects and larvae, as well as worms and other small invertebrates. These frogs are prey mainly to snakes, but also birds and sometimes raccoons. Because the ornate chorus frog is most active during the winter months, they are able to avoid many snake predators due to them already beginning their hibernation. The eggs and tadpoles can be preyed upon by fish, which is why these frogs prefer ephemeral ponds and wetlands to breed and lay their eggs Their dark markings and tendency for body coloring to vary depending on their habitat allows them a layer of camouflage as a defense tactic. However, even with this defense mechanism it has been observed that these frogs rarely live for longer than one to two breeding cycles because of predation. Adult mortality may also be due to intraspecies fighting. 

== Reproduction ==
Ornate chorus frogs reach sexual maturity around 1 year and reproduce through external fertilization. The female releases eggs at the same time that the male releases sperm and to ensure that the eggs are fertilized, they will sit in an axillary amplexus position. They mate from November to March. Eggs are laid in clusters ranging from 10 to 100 eggs attached to submerged vegetation. The eggs are abandoned after and neither parent provides any type of parental care to the eggs or hatched tadpoles. The eggs hatch between 1 and 2 weeks but hatch time is temperature dependent; colder temperatures indicate a longer period before hatching. After hatching, tadpoles have two yellow stripes on the sides of a dark back, as well as a high tail fin. Some may have a bicolored tail. It can take between two and four months for tadpoles to fully develop into frogs, with temperature playing a role in development time and frequency of color morphs.

==Taxonomy==
The ornate chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris ornata&quot;) was named and classified by American herpetologist John Edwards Holbrook in 1836.

==Etymology==
The name of the genus, &quot;Pseudacris&quot;, comes from the Greek &quot;pseudes&quot; (false) and &quot;akris&quot; (locust), probably a reference to the repeated rasping trill of most chorus frogs, which is similar to that of the insect. The specific name, &quot;ornata&quot;, is the feminine form of the Latin adjective, &quot;ornatus&quot; (decorated).

<doc id="372874" wikidata="Q165684" url="?curid=372874" title="Rogers Communications">
<text>Rogers Communications Inc. is a Canadian communications and media company operating primarily in the fields of wireless communications, cable television, telephony and Internet, with significant additional telecommunications and mass media assets. Rogers has its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario.

The company traces its origins to 1914, when Edward S. Rogers Sr. founded Rogers Vacuum Tube Company to sell battery-less radios, although this present enterprise dates to 1960, when Ted Rogers and a partner acquired the CHFI-FM radio station; they then became part-owners of a group that established the CFTO television station.

The chief competitor to Rogers is Bell Canada, which has a similarly extensive portfolio of radio and television media assets, as well as wireless, television distribution, and telephone services, particularly in Eastern and Central Canada. The two companies are often seen as having a duopoly on communications services in their regions, and both companies own a stake of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment. Rogers also competes nationally with Telus for wireless services.

Rogers Communications&#x27; acquisition of Shaw Communications in Western Canada was approved in 2023.

== History ==

In 1925, Ted Rogers Sr invented the world&#x27;s first alternating current (AC) heater filament cathode for a radio tube, which then enabled radios to be powered by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became a key factor in popularizing radio reception. He also established the CFRB radio station in Toronto (later acquired by outside interests). In 1931, he was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. On May 6, 1939, he was working on radar when he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage, at the age of 38. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (known as Ted). While his business interests were subsequently sold, his son later became determined to carry on his father&#x27;s legacy.

In 1960, Ted Rogers Jr and broadcaster Joel Aldred raised money to found Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting in order to purchase CHFI, an FM radio station in Toronto. Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting also became a part-owner of Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting (BARB), which established CFTO-TV, Toronto&#x27;s first private television station. In 1962, Rogers established CHFI (AM), an AM radio station that later became CFTR. In 1967, Rogers established Rogers Cable TV in partnership with BARB. In 1971, new CRTC regulations forced BARB to sell its 50% stake in Rogers Cable TV.

In 1979, Rogers acquired Canadian Cablesystems, and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a result. In 1980, Rogers acquired Premier Cablevision and became the largest cable company in Canada. In 1986, Rogers Cable was renamed Rogers Communications; it established operational control over Cantel, a wireless telephone company in which Rogers had a stake.

=== 21st century ===
Rogers Communications Inc. unveiled its new logo on January 17, 2000, marking the departure of its original logo.

In 2000, Rogers acquired Cable Atlantic from Newfoundland businessman (and future premier) Danny Williams.

In July 2001, Rogers Media acquired CTV Sportsnet, which was renamed as Rogers Sportsnet that November. The FAN 590 sports radio station joined Rogers Media in August 2001, along with 14 Northern Ontario radio stations.

In fall 2004, several strategic transactions were executed that significantly increased Rogers exposure to the potential of the Canadian wireless market. Rogers acquired the 34% of Rogers Wireless owned by AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. for $1.77 billion.

On December 2, 2008, Ted Rogers died of heart failure.

In 2012, Rogers Cable filed a complaint in an Ontario court against penalties levied under a &#x27;Truth in Advertising&#x27; law, claiming that the amount of the penalties, and the requirements imposed by the law, were in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The company also had to recognize the rising market trend of customers canceling or foregoing cable television service subscriptions in favour of cheaper priced alternate content delivery means, such as streaming media services like Netflix, a demographic called &quot;cord cutters&quot; and &quot;cord nevers&quot;. In response, Rogers acquired content with a speculated cost of $100 million to begin their own competing online streaming service, Shomi, much like the American Hulu Plus, which launched November 4, 2014. Shomi subsequently shut down after only 2 years of operation, on November 30, 2016.

In the summer of 2014, Rogers reported a 24% drop in profit compared to the previous year&#x27;s second quarter.

In August 2018, Rogers launched Ignite TV, a new cable television platform. The platform is licensed from Comcast&#x27;s &quot;X1&quot; platform.

==== Acquisition of Shaw, family dispute ====
On March 15, 2021, Rogers announced its intent to acquire Shaw Communications for $26 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. This proposed acquisition was criticized by public lobby groups like Open Media, as a move that would reduce national competition in Canadian wireless communication by removing one of the four major competitors from the market.

On September 29, chief financial officer Tony Staffieri left the company. On October 8, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that this came about following Edward Rogers&#x27; attempt to have Staffieri replace Joe Natale, a former Telus executive and the company&#x27;s third CEO since Ted Rogers&#x27; death in 2008. This attempt was opposed by Edward&#x27;s mother and sisters. Edward Rogers was then removed as chairman of the board, while remaining a board member, on October 21. However, a proposal to remove Edward as chair of the Rogers Control Trust, which holds the majority voting interest in Rogers Communications on behalf of the family, did not receive sufficient support from other members of the trust&#x27;s advisory committee.

The following day, Edward Rogers, in his capacity as chair of the Control Trust, announced he was unilaterally enacting a written shareholder resolution replacing five of the board&#x27;s independent directors, and two days later convened a meeting at which the &quot;reconstituted&quot; board re-appointed him as chair of the board of Rogers Communications. The legality of the resolution has been disputed by the board members that were purportedly replaced, and by other members of the Rogers family.

The CRTC approved the merger on March 24, 2022.

In May 2022, the Canadian Competition Bureau requested an order from the Competition Tribunal blocking Rogers&#x27;s takeover of Shaw Communications arguing that the deal would substantially lessen competition by eliminating Rogers&#x27; closest competitor in the wireless sector. It also requested an injunction to stop the cable companies from closing the deal until the application can be heard.

After two years since it was first announced, Rogers&#x27; acquisition of Shaw Communications received the last regulatory approval from the Industry Minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne. To appease concerns over a lack of competition arising, Shaw will be required to sell off its Freedom Mobile wireless business to Quebecor Inc.&#x27;s Videotron for $2.85 billion. In addition, Rogers and Videotron agreed to a number of conditions requiring the addition of 3,000 jobs in Western Canada, Videotron must also offer plans 20% lower than the competition and commit to spending $150 million in the next two years to upgrade the Freedom Mobile network. Rogers and Videotron would be liable to pay upwards of $1 billion and $200 million in penalties, respectively, if the commitments were not fulfilled.

In April 2024, Rogers announced a 10-year agreement with Comcast; expanding upon its Ignite TV partnership, the agreement gives Rogers access to Comcast-developed broadband, smart home, and home security hardware.

==== 2021 and 2022 outages ====
On April 19, 2021, &quot;wireless calls, SMS and data services were down across Canada for almost an entire day because of an issue with a software update&quot;. Rogers hardly reimbursed consumers for the inconvenience.

On July 8, 2022, millions of customers reported issues with Rogers mobile and Internet services, including some Canada government services, such as Service Canada, Canada Revenue Agency and passport offices, as well as Canadian interbank, money transfer network Interac, ATMs and 9-1-1 services. Rogers apologized for the mass outage and said it was trying to restore services. Rogers President and CEO Tony Staffieri issued an apology via Twitter about 17 hours after the start of the incident, acknowledging the issue to the public after a day of system outage. Staffieri acknowledged that the outage stems from a failed maintenance update. Rogers has offered credit as compensation for the outage.

A report by Cloudflare suggested that the outage was due to internal, rather than external, causes. It identified spikes in BGP updates, as well as withdrawals of IP prefixes, noting that Rogers was not advertising its presence, causing other networks to not find the Rogers network. Cause of the outage or expected downtime was initially not revealed. The outage was later said to be caused by a maintenance upgrade that caused routers to malfunction, similar to the outage which occurred a year prior.

On July 11, 2022, Canada federal government opened an investigation about the most recent outage and demanded telecoms companies to make communication protocols to keep customers better informed about possible disruptions. On the same day, Industry minister François-Philippe Champagne met the CEOs of Rogers, BCE Inc, Telus Corp, Shaw Communications Inc., Quebecor Inc.&#x27;s Videotron Ltd., SaskTel and Bragg Communications Inc.&#x27;s Eastlink. During that meeting, the Industry minister asked companies to implement an agreement in 60 days in which the companies will be able to help each other during an outage in one of their networks.

As a result of the mentioned investigation, as well as scrutiny and criticism over the glitch and the company itself, some traders said the chances of a merger deal between Rogers and Shaw Communications dropped to nearly 62% on July 11, 2022 from 88% in the week earlier.

Rogers CEO, Tony Staffieri, blamed the outage on the maintenance update, and offered a five day service credit to the customers as a sign of apology.

== Corporate governance ==
Rogers Communications is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker &quot;RCI&quot;.

Following the death of Ted Rogers in 2008, control of Rogers Communications passed to the Rogers Control Trust, a trust for which a subsidiary of Scotiabank serves as trustee. Ted&#x27;s son Edward Rogers and daughter Melinda Rogers serve, respectively, as chairman and vice-chair of the trust.

The current members of the board of directors of Rogers Communications are:
* Edward Rogers (Chair of the Board)

* Robert Gemmell
* Jake Custance Kerr, 
* Alan Horn, 
* Dr. Mohamed Lachemi

* Jack Cockwell, 
* Michael Cooper
* Ivan Fecan
* Jan Innes
* David Robinson
A previous composition of the board was disputed by Edward Rogers, who, in his capacity as chair of the Rogers Control Trust, announced on October 22 that Brooks, Clappison, Jacob, MacDonald, and Peterson had been replaced on the board by Michael Cooper, Jack Cockwell, Ivan Fecan, Jan Innes, and John Kerr. On October 24, this re-constituted board re-appointed Edward Rogers as chair of the board. Despite the Supreme Court of British Columbia&#x27;s legal affirmation of the changes, they had been described as &quot;invalid&quot; by the three other Rogers family members on the company&#x27;s board, as well as the replaced individuals.

In November 2021, Tony Staffieri succeeded Joe Natale and was appointed the new interim president and CEO. In January 2022, Staffieri was appointed to the position permanently.

The senior corporate officers of Rogers Communications currently are:

=== Rogers Sports &amp; Media ===
In addition to its ownership of Sportsnet, acquired from CTV, Sportsnet One and Sportsnet World, Rogers Sports &amp; Media operates the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team through Rogers Blue Jays Baseball Partnership and the Rogers Centre (previously known as &quot;SkyDome&quot;). Through Sportsnet, Rogers Sports &amp; Media also holds a 50% ownership in Dome Productions, a mobile production and distribution joint venture that is a leader in high-definition television production and broadcasting in Canada. Rogers also owns the naming rights to Rogers Arena, home of the Vancouver Canucks, as well as Rogers Place, the home of the Edmonton Oilers.
A joint venture between Rogers Communications and Bell Canada owns 75% of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association, Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, as well as their minor league farm teams, the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL), Raptors 905 of the NBA G League and Toronto FC II of MLS Next Pro, respectively.

On June 28, 2007, Rogers offered to sell the two religious-licensed OMNI stations in Winnipeg and Vancouver as part of the Citytv deal, although the company stated that it intended to retain the multilingual-licensed OMNI stations. In September 2007, Rogers applied to the CRTC to acquire 20 per cent of CablePulse 24, a local news channel in Toronto.

On August 25, 2012, Rogers Media agreed to acquire Score Media which includes The Score Television Network for $167 million, including a 10% stake of its digital business. The deal was completed on Oct. 19, 2012.

In 2012, Rogers purchased CJNT-DT Montreal and on February 3, 2013, it was rebranded as City Montreal.

==== National Hockey League ====

On November 26, 2013, Rogers Communications Inc, unveiled the details of a 12-year, C$5.2 billion partnership with the National Hockey League which began in the 2014–15 season. This gave Rogers the controlling stake for national broadcast and digital rights of the NHL and ultimately gave them the ability to stream all NHL feeds on all of their current platforms replacing both Bell Media and CBC Sports as the national broadcast and cable television rightsholders respectively. The effects of this deal shifted the balance of power in the country&#x27;s broadcast industry as it drove up demand for Rogers Cable TV subscriptions. This transaction marked the first time a first-class North American-wide sports league has allowed all its national right to one company on a long-term basis. As part of the deal, Rogers also took over Canadian distribution of the NHL Centre Ice and GameCentre Live services. National English-language coverage of the NHL is carried primarily by Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet group of specialty channels; Sportsnet holds an exclusive window for games played on Wednesday nights. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; was maintained and expanded under the deal, airing up to seven games nationally on Saturday nights throughout the regular season across CBC Television, the Sportsnet networks, Rogers-owned television network Citytv, and FX Canada. While CBC maintains Rogers-produced NHL coverage during the regular season and playoffs through a time-brokerage agreement with the company, Rogers assumes editorial control and the ownership of any advertising revenue from the telecasts. Citytv (and later Sportsnet) also airs a Sunday night game of the week, &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&quot;, which features a pre-game show originating from various Canadian communities. Sportsnet&#x27;s networks also air occasional games involving all-U.S. matchups.

Under a sub-licensing agreement with Rogers, Quebecor Media holds national French-language rights to the NHL, with all coverage airing on its specialty channel TVA Sports. TVA Sports&#x27; flagship broadcasts on Saturday nights focus primarily on the Montreal Canadiens.

Rogers sought to increase the prominence of NHL content on digital platforms by re-launching the NHL&#x27;s digital out-of-market sports package GameCentre Live as Rogers NHL GameCentre Live, adding the ability to stream all of Rogers&#x27; national NHL telecasts, along with in-market streaming of regional games for teams whose regional rights are held by Sportsnet. &quot;GamePlus&quot;—an additional mode featuring alternate camera angles intended for a second screen experience, such as angles focusing on certain players, net and referee cameras, and a Skycam in selected venues, was also added exclusively for GameCentre Live subscribers who are subscribed to Rogers&#x27; cable, internet, or wireless services.

In the lead-up to the 2014–15 season, Rogers began to promote its networks as the new home of the NHL through a multi-platform advertising campaign; the campaign featured advertising and cross-promotions across Rogers&#x27; properties, such as The Shopping Channel, which began to feature presentations of NHL merchandise, and its parenting magazine &quot;Today&#x27;s Parent&quot;, which began to feature hockey-themed stories in its issues. On May 28, 2014, Rogers announced a six-year sponsorship deal with Scotiabank, which saw the bank become the title sponsor for &quot;Wednesday Night Hockey&quot; and &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot;, and become a sponsor for other segments and initiatives throughout Rogers&#x27; NHL coverage.

On October 6, 2014, Rogers and NHL began their media sales venture in which Rogers will lead all Canadian national NHL media sales across its owned and operated broadcast and digital platforms as well as ad sales for League-owned digital assets in Canada.

=== Rogers Bank ===
Rogers Bank () is a Canadian financial services company wholly owned by Rogers Communications. Rogers applied to the Minister of Finance under the &quot;Bank Act&quot; for permission to establish a Schedule I bank (a domestic bank that may accept deposits) in summer 2011. At launch, Rogers Bank offered a Rogers-branded credit card targeted at existing customers. A companion card branded for Rogers subsidiary Fido was introduced in 2016. The bank offers three categories of credit card to Canadians: Fido Mastercard, Rogers Platinum Mastercard, and Rogers World Elite Mastercard.

== Former assets, products and services ==
=== Publishing ===
Prior to 2019, Rogers Publishing Limited published more than 70 consumer magazines and trade and professional publications, digital properties and directories in Canada, including &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Canada&#x27;s weekly newsmagazine; its French-language equivalent, &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot;; Sportsnet Magazine&quot;; Chatelaine&quot;; &quot;Flare&quot;; and a variety of other magazines and their companion websites. The publishing arm was once part of the Maclean-Hunter Publishing empire. Rogers did not have printing facilities and contracted out services in 2008 to Montreal-based TC Transcontinental to print magazines from their plants across Canada.

In March 2019, Rogers sold their magazine brands, including &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; and &quot;HELLO! Canada&quot;, to St. Joseph Communications for an undisclosed sum.

=== OutRank by Rogers ===

In 2011, a partnership was formed between Rogers Communications and Yodle, Inc to provide a suite of digital marketing services to Canadian small, medium, and enterprise size business. These are marketed under the name OutRank by Rogers and operate as a business unit within the company. Services include search engine optimization, mobile marketing, social media marketing, pay per click, and analytics. The opening was announced in January 2012 with the launch of their first client, Ontario-based CLS Roofing. OutRank by Rogers is a Google Premier SMB Partner and promotes responsive web design. The company is a donor to the Ronald Mcdonald House of Toronto.

=== Zoocasa ===
In 2008, Rogers Communications launched Zoocasa, an online real estate listing service. The company later became a licensed real estate brokerage and in May 2013, the website relaunched to allow homebuyers to find properties and agents. The service also provided rebates on real estate commissions to buyers and sellers. Zoocasa was shut down on June 22, 2015. The website&#x27;s domain and technology were purchased for $350,000 and the website relaunched on July 2, 2015, under new ownership.

=== Texture ===
Texture (previously known as Next Issue) was a digital magazine app introduced to the Canadian market by Rogers in 2013. The service had a monthly subscription fee that gave readers access to over 200 magazines in English and French.

Texture was purchased by Apple in 2018; in 2019, it was discontinued and integrated into Apple News+.

<text>Vidéotron is a Canadian integrated telecommunications company active in cable television, interactive multimedia development, video on demand, cable telephony, wireless communication and Internet access services. Owned by Quebecor, it primarily serves Quebec and Ottawa, as well as the Francophone communities of New Brunswick and some parts of Eastern Ontario. Its principal competitors are Bell Canada and Telus Communications.

Vidéotron is the fifth-largest wireless carrier in Canada, with nearly 1,700,000 mobile subscribers as of Q2 2022.

==History==
Vidéotron was established in 1964, under the name &quot;Télécâble Vidéotron Ltée&quot; as northern Montreal&#x27;s first cable television network. It started with 66 subscribers. André Chagnon served as the company&#x27;s founding president.

From 1966 to 1969, Vidéotron expanded by acquiring several cable networks in many regions of the province of Quebec.

In 1969, the company offered the first pay-per-view service under the name &quot;Sélecto-TV&quot;.

In 1974, a bi-directional network was created in Saint-Jérôme, one of the first in the world at the time.

By 1980, Vidéotron acquired Câblevision Nationale to become the largest teledistributor in Quebec. Vidéotron acquired Télé-Métropole in 1986, the largest private French-language television company in North America.

In 1989 the company opened the first video rental stores: Le SuperClub Vidéotron. Its first fiber optic network was created between the cities of Quebec and Montreal.
On January 24, 1990, Vidéotron launched terminals in Quebec, the first interactive television (ITV) system in North America.

From 1995, the company entered the Internet era and acquired its own Internet portal, InfiniT.com.

In 1997, CF Cable TV, which operated primarily on the western end of the Island of Montreal, southern Laval and Northern Ontario, was acquired by Vidéotron, further expanding its base. The Northern Ontario division was later sold to Regional Cablesystems.

On March 29, 1999, the company launched digital television in Montreal.
By the start of the 21st century, Rogers Communications struck an accord with the Chagnon family to purchase Vidéotron. However, citing cultural sovereignty concerns, the second-largest shareholder invoked its right to veto the purchase. Quebecor acquired Vidéotron instead, after months of legal proceedings. On May 23, 2001, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the transfer of broadcasting licences from Vidéotron to Quebecor.

Video-on-demand and high-definition television became available in 2003.
Vidéotron launched their wireless service in August 2006 and, two years later the company announced the launch of two new internet access services: Ultimate Speed Internet 30 and Ultimate Speed Internet 50 which deliver speeds of 30 Mbit/s and 50 Mbit/s respectively.
In the spring of 2010, Vidéotron launched IllicoWeb, an online television and video-on-demand service. In September, it launched a 3G+ wireless service, with plans to offer a quadruple play service with its existing cable services.
On December 30, 2017, assets from Vidéotron G.P. were transferred to Vidéotron Ltée, as the company underwent a corporate reorganization.

In September 2018, Vidéotron began beta testing for Fizz, a discount flanker brand on its network.

==Services==
Vidéotron serves 1,830,400 cable television customers, including over 1,517,600 digital cable subscribers. Vidéotron also has more than 1,408,200 high-speed cable Internet subscribers, the most in Quebec. As of September 2013, the company had activated 478,000 mobile phones, and was providing cable telephone service to nearly 1,281,200 customers. Vidéotron&#x27;s cable services are available in the greater areas of Montreal, Quebec City, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières and Saguenay. Vidéotron also serves areas in eastern Ontario, such as Rockland and the surrounding municipality of Clarence-Rockland, as well as parts of New Brunswick near the Quebec border.

Vidéotron offers broadband and IPTV-based digital cable television under the Helix and Illico brands, which is based on Comcast&#x27;s X1 platform and hardware. Helix serves as a successor to the company&#x27;s existing Illico TV digital cable platform. Vidéotron&#x27;s community channels are branded as MAtv.

The company offers a subscription video on-demand service known as Illico+ (formerly Club Illico). It has produced original series such as &quot;Escouade 99&quot;, &quot;Portrait-Robot&quot;, &quot;The Night Logan Woke Up (La nuit où Laurier Gaudreault s&#x27;est réveillé)&quot; and &quot;Mégantic&quot;.

Vidéotron cable services were once available in the United Kingdom, but were acquired and merged into Cable &amp; Wireless plc along with Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX Corporation in 1997. The company also used to operate in Africa and the United States. One of its previous subsidiaries – Videotron Telecom (not to be confused with Videotron Mobile) – was financed by the Carlyle Group.

Vidéotron has provided telecommunication services to business and governments since the integration of Vidéotron Télécom into Vidéotron Ltée. The services include dark fiber, SONET, ATM, and Ethernet links as well as video circuits used by various Quebec television networks.

===Cable telephone service===
On July 29, 2004, Vidéotron announced plans to launch a telephone service using VoIP technology by the first half of 2005. Vidéotron launched its cable phone service in late 2004 to compete with Bell Canada and Telus. Deployment of this service started on Montreal&#x27;s South Shore. By press release on January 24, 2005, Vidéotron announced that 300,000 customers on Montreal&#x27;s South Shore had access to this service and that deployment would continue all over Quebec throughout 2005. Vidéotron also announced that about 2,500 customers had already subscribed to this service, following a trial conducted in the fall of 2004.

Vidéotron was also the first cable provider in Canada to launch a cable phone service.

===Mobile network===
In July 2008, Videotron ltée and Quebecor acquired spectrum licences for advanced wireless services from an Industry Canada auction at a total cost of $554,559,000. The licences cover Quebec for an average of 40 MHz spectrum, Toronto with 10 MHz and south-east Ontario. The network was launched on September 9, 2010. Infrastructure work for a pre-4G HSPA+ wireless network was done over the span of three years, Videotron now having its own cellular communications resources.

Vidéotron was the only provider in Canada that sold the short-lived Garmin Nuvifone A50 smartphone.

In 2013, Rogers and Vidéotron struck a 20-year deal, enabling Vidéotron to share its network with Rogers Wireless. This network sharing agreement enabled Vidéotron to deploy LTE on its network in Quebec in 2014, in partnership with Rogers. The agreement also enabled Vidéotron customers to use the Rogers Wireless network as a Vidéotron partner network in order to allow texts to be sent or received, calls to be made and for data to be used across Canada. In 2016, Vidéotron revamped its plans, allowing customers to make unlimited calls, send and receive texts and use data in the United States as well, due to partnerships with US carriers.

Vidéotron began beta testing in 2018 for a new mid-range mobile flanker brand, Fizz Mobile, in Quebec and in Ottawa. In 2023, as an aspect of Rogers Communications&#x27; acquisition of Shaw Communications, parent company Quebecor acquired Shaw-owned Freedom Mobile.

===Technical support===
The major centres are located in Montreal, Longueuil, Quebec City, Gatineau, Joliette, Saguenay and St-Hubert. Vidéotron also has outsourced customer service centres that include Utopia, Gexel Telecom and Atelka. In 2007, Videotron formed a partnership with Xceed Contact Centre to outsource some of the call centres to Egypt.

==Controversy==
===High-Speed Extreme Internet===
On August 14, 2007, Videotron announced starting October 1 they would impose a 100-gigabyte-per-month download/upload limit with a penalty of $1.50 per extra gigabyte to their previously unrestricted High-Speed Extreme Internet service, even to existing subscribers. This decision created outrage among its Internet users, and led to a class action suit against Videotron by consumer advocacy group Union des Consommateurs. In September 2013, the court authorized the suit to proceed. Ultimately the Quebec Superior Court rendered a $1.2 million judgment in favour of the plaintiffs.

<doc id="372885" wikidata="Q7359331" url="?curid=372885" title="Rogers Plus">
<text>Rogers Plus was a brand name for the retail operations of Rogers Communications. It was formerly two separate brands, namely the Rogers Wireless chain of telecommunications stores previously operated by InterTAN under licence from Rogers, and the Rogers Video chain of video rental stores. In early 2007, Rogers retired the Rogers Video and Rogers Wireless brand names from its stores and re-branded them as Rogers Plus.

At its peak, there were over 300 Rogers Plus stores. Rogers Plus stores also provided sales and service for cable television, Internet, home phone service and wireless phone service in markets where they offered these services.

==History==
===1980s to 1990s: inception, acquisitions and expansion===
Rogers Video was established in 1988. The company&#x27;s operations grew considerably in the 1990s through take-overs of smaller, local chains. For example, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Rogers took over eight stores from TVS Video Superstore and Family Video (not to be confused with the Saskatoon-based Family Video chain that became VHQ) chains. 
These acquisitions allowed Rogers Video to gain the title of the fifth largest video rental shop chain in North America until its demise. In the country&#x27;s National Capital Region, which mainly consists of Ottawa, the rental chain agreed to provide services in both English and French. Rogers Video also received multiple &quot;Canadian Retailer of the Year&quot; awards in that decade and the next to come.

===2000s: DVD-by-mail service and rebranding===
In 2004, Rogers Video began a partnership with Zip.ca to provide a DVD-by-mail service called Rogers Video Direct. This allowed users to rent online and have DVDs delivered by mail. In December 2011, Rogers Video Direct closed and customers were redirected to the Zip.ca website. The company changed the name of their chain to Rogers Plus in 2007.

===2010s: rental business discontinued, another rebranding===
Rival home video retailer Blockbuster Video Canada shut down all of its Canadian video rental stores in 2011. Following this, Rogers Plus also announced plans to shut down its video rental operations. Rogers ceased rentals on April 16, 2012 and sold all of its previously viewed rental inventory at &quot;buy one, get one free&quot; prices to customers. The majority of the Rogers Plus stores would remain open and continue to offer cable TV, Internet, and wireless products and services, although most of these downsized and/or relocated to smaller spaces in the same mall/plaza, as the now-redundant space for rental operations took up over half of typical Rogers Plus store footprint. In May 2012, the company announced in stores and on their website that they would cease renting movies and games, encouraging customers to choose Rogers Anyplace TV or Rogers On Demand instead. In October 2012, the Rogers Plus brand name was phased out and remaining stores were simply branded as Rogers stores, similar to how Bell Canada, Telus Communications, and Shaw Communications stores are branded.

==Awards==
Rogers won multiple &quot;Canadian Retailer of the Year&quot; awards. Five were awarded by Premiere in 1992 and from 1994 to 1997 inclusive. Four more were awarded by Entertainment Merchants Association in 1993, 1995 and 1997.

<doc id="372888" wikidata="Q5463257" url="?curid=372888" title="Fly spray">
<text>Fly spray is a chemical insecticide that comes in an aerosol can that is sprayed into the air to kill flies. Fly sprays will kill various insects such as house flies and wasps.

==Principles==

Fly spray contains chemicals (including many organophosphate compounds) that bind to and permanently block the action of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. Acetyl choline (ACh) is the nerve transmitter substance released by motor neurones (at a site called the neuromuscular junction) to stimulate muscle contraction. The muscles relax (stop contracting) when the ACh is removed from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by the action of acetylcholinesterase.
By inhibiting the cholinesterase the insect can no longer break down ACh in the NMJ and so its muscles lock up in a state of tetany (continuous contraction) making flying and respiration impossible, and the insect then dies of asphyxiation.

The Fly spray is shown to be effective against black flies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a study detailing the effectiveness of black fly spray.

==Safety==

Like many insecticides, fly spray can be toxic to a host of other organisms including birds, fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants.

In the United States, fly sprays often contain the powerful insect toxin dichlorvos which is often targeted by environmental groups as a carcinogenic compound. While the small quantities found in fly spray may be negligible, the insect toxin can contaminate soil, water, turf, and other vegetation if disposed improperly.

<text>The recorded history of music in [[Estonia]] dates as far back as the 12th century.

==History==
The earliest mentioning of Estonian singing and dancing dates back to Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (c. 1179). Saxo speaks of Estonian warriors who sang at night while waiting for an epic battle.

The Estonian folk music tradition is broadly divided into 2 periods. The older folksongs are also referred to as runic songs, traditional songs in the poetic metre &quot;regivärss&quot; that are shared by all Finnic peoples. Runic singing was widespread among Estonians until the 18th century, when it started to be replaced by rhythmic folksongs. Professional Estonian musicians emerged in the late 19th century at the time of Estonian national awakening. The best known active Estonian composers is Arvo Pärt.

===Folk music===

Estonian epic poetry (Estonian: &quot;regilaul&quot;) has been extensively recorded and studied, especially those sung by women. They can come in many forms, including work songs, ballads and sung legends. Much of the early scholarly study of epic poetry was done in the 1860s by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald, who used &quot;regilaul&quot; themes to compose the Estonian national epic, &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;. By the 20th century, though, &quot;regilaul&quot; singing had largely disappeared from Estonia, with vibrant traditions existing only in Setumaa and Kihnu.

Traditional wind instruments derived from those used by shepherds, such as the karjapasun and vilepill, were once widespread, but are now more rarely played. Other instruments, including the fiddle, zither, concertina and accordion are used to play polka or other dance music. The &quot;kannel&quot; is a native instrument that is probably even more popular among the Estonian diaspora in North America than in its homeland, where well-known &quot;kannel&quot; musicians include Igor Tõnurist and Tuule Kann.

A notable example of an Estonian folk song is called &quot;The herring lived on dry land&quot;, or simply &quot;The herring song&quot;. According to its lyrics, in the ancient times the herring used to have legs and live on dry land. It used to destroy vermin, like rats and it was kept like a cat. One time a two masted sailing ship was transporting a large load of salt. Back then salt was expensive. Some unit of it called &quot;saam&quot; cost 100 of something in gold. There was a herring aboard the ship. The specific herring liked to eat salt, so it started to tunnel its way around the salt sacks. Eventually it accidentally chewed its way through the ships wooden hull, causing it to sink. This angered Neptune (the god of sea), who said to the herring: &quot;Hey herring, because you chewed a hole into the ship and sunk the new ship, you will now have to live in seawater as punishment.&quot; The salt from the ship was released into the sea, resulting in the seas now having a salt composition.

===National awakening===

After the Estonian national awakening the first professional Estonian musicians emerged. The most significant were Rudolf Tobias (1873–1918) and Artur Kapp (1878–1952). Other composers followed, such as Mart Saar (1882–1963), Artur Lemba (1885–1963), Heino Eller (1887–1970) and Cyrillus Kreek (1889–1962).

==20th century==

In the 1960s, the Soviet communist authorities began encouraging forms of ethnic folk art from various parts of the former USSR and Eastern Bloc. Local ethnographic bands were formed after Leiko, a choir from Värska, came together in 1964, while a less regionally distinct form of Estonian folk music was soon promoted, Estonian ring dance beginning with the formation of Leigarid in 1969. The 1950s and 60s also saw the publication of Herbert Tampere&#x27;s &quot;Eesti rahvalaule viisidega&quot; (&quot;Estonian folk songs with melodies&quot;), a collection of folk songs. The first LP of traditional music, &quot;Eesti rahvalaule ja pillilugusid&quot; (&quot;Estonian folk songs and instrumental pieces&quot;) was released in 1967. In the 1980s, a series of musical festivals took place that helped stimulate the increasing popular demands for freedom of expression (these included the 1985 conference of CIOFF, the 1986 Viru säru and 1989&#x27;s Baltica), leading to the nonviolent Singing Revolution of 1989, and Estonia&#x27;s bloodless regaining of independence in 1991.

In the 1950s, Estonian baritone Georg Ots rose to worldwide prominence as an opera singer.

Estonia also produced a number of classical composers of high repute during the twentieth century, including: Miina Härma (1864–1941), Rudolf Tobias (1873–1918), Heino Eller (1887–1970), Artur Kapp (1878–1952), Artur Lemba (1885–1963), Mart Saar (1882–1963), Lepo Sumera (1950–2000), Eduard Tubin (1905–1982), Veljo Tormis (1930–2017) and the living composers mentioned below.

==Today==
There are several yearly music festivals of Estonia.

These celebrations of traditional life have inspired multiple later composers who modernized traditional music, including Olev Muska and Coralie Joyce, Kirile Loo, Veljo Tormis and the Estonian-Australian choir Kiri-uu. Other modern Estonian musicians include the influential composers René Eespere (1953–), Ester Mägi (1922– 2021), Arvo Pärt (1935–), Jaan Rääts (1932–2020), Urmas Sisask (1960–2022), and Erkki-Sven Tüür (1959–). Conductor Neeme Järvi has had a long and distinguished international career. His sons Paavo Järvi and Kristjan Järvi are both also conductors, and his daughter Maarika Järvi is a flutist.

The indie folk rock band Ewert and The Two Dragons are among the best known Estonian bands, having had success in Europe and signing with Warner Bros. Records and winning the European Border Breakers Award in 2012. The girl band Vanilla Ninja were also one of the best-known Estonian bands before their hiatus. In addition, artists such as Hortus Musicus, Kerli, Vaiko Eplik &amp; Eliit, Iiris, NOËP, Miljardid and Trad.Attack! have gained popularity outside Estonia.

Metsatöll is a folk-metal band combining runo-song and traditional folk instruments with metal. Another Estonian folk metal group was Raud-ants.

Contemporary artists include Jüri Pootsmann, Tanel Padar and Ott Lepland. Today, many music festivals are held, such as Eesti Laul.

<text>Traditional Latvian music is often set to traditional poetry called &quot;dainas&quot;, featuring pre-Christian themes and legends, drone vocal styles, and Baltic psaltery.

==Dainas==

Traditional Latvian folklore, especially the dance of the folk songs, date back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.

Dainas are very short, which usually consist only one or two stanzas, are unrhymed, and are in a four-footed trochaic metre. Lyrically, dainas concern themselves with native mythology, but in contrast to most similar forms, do not have any legendary heroes. Stories often revolve around pre-Christian deities like the sun goddess Saule, the moon god Mēness and, most notably, the life of people, especially its three most important events – birth, wedding, and death (including burial). The first collection of dainas was published between 1894 and 1915 as &quot;Latvju Dainas&quot; by Krišjānis Barons.

&quot;Latvju tautas mūzikas materiāli&quot;, translated in English as the Materials of Latvian Folk Music, is the anthology and commentary of Latvian folk. It analysed 5999 items of Latvian ethnography published in 6 editions from 1894 to 1926 by the Latvian musicologist and composer Andrejs Jurjāns (1856–1922).

&quot;Latvju tautas mūzikas materiāli&quot; &quot;Sestā grāmata&quot; (the sixth book) was published posthumously in Riga, 1926. On page 1 &quot;latvju komponistu biedrības izdevums&quot; is inscribed, translated as the Latvian Society of Composers edition.

==Instrumentation==

Accompaniment to the village songs is played on various traditional instruments, the most significant of which is the kokles, a type of box zither related to the Lithuanian kanklės and other Baltic psalteries. In the 1970s, artists like Jānis Poriķis and Valdis Muktupāvels led a revival in kokles music, which had only survived in the Courland and Lettgallia regions. The Latvian-exile community abroad, especially in the United States, has also kept kokles traditions alive. In the last hundred years, a new kind of kokles was developed, with many more strings, halftones levelers and other improvements that expand the capacities of the instrument to play not only modal music but, in another point of view, displeased more traditional musicians. This modernized version of the instrument is called &quot;concert kokles&quot;. However, currently is the only remaining master concert kokles maker, although recently he has taken in two apprentices.

==Classical music==

Choir traditions are very strong in Latvia. Alongside many professional choirs, there are tens of thousands of Latvians who are part of different amateur choirs. Once every five years the Latvian National Song and Dance Festival takes place with around 20,000 singers taking part in it.

The 2014 World Choir Games took place in Riga.

This year (2019) Latvia hosts the inaugural Riga Jurmala Music Festival, a new festival in which world-famous orchestras and conductors perform across four weekends during the summer. The festival takes place at the Latvian National Opera, the Great Guild, and the Great and Small Halls of the Dzintari Concert Hall. This year features the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Russian National Orchestra.

Internationally famous Latvian musicians include conductors Arvīds Jansons and his son Mariss Jansons, Andris Nelsons, violinist Gidon Kremer, cellist Mischa Maisky, and soprano Kristīne Opolais.

==Popular music==
During the Soviet era, rock music became extremely popular, because it, as well as folk songs, offered a chance to rebel against the local authorities. Imants Kalniņš was the most important composer of the time, and his songs were extremely popular. He also wrote music for the movie &quot;Four White Shirts&quot;, which spoke about the need for freedom and was therefore banned. One of the most important social gatherings of the time was the annual Imantdiena (&#x27;The Day of Imants (Kalniņš)&#x27;), forbidden on grounds of interfering with hay-gathering. The tradition continued informally at the composer&#x27;s house.

The songs of Imants Kalniņš were best known as performed by the group which only played songs by this composer. Most of the members of the group moved on to form another group, Pērkons (&#x27;Thunder&#x27;) later. Pērkons was a symbol of rebellion. They played fascinating rock and roll bordering on hard rock music, composed by the band&#x27;s frontman , using poems mostly written by . Many of those were strongly disapproved by the Soviet authorities, as they implied the ridiculousness of the system. The most famous concert by Pērkons resulted in the destruction of a train compartment by the young people who had attended the concert. This, as well as other events, is portrayed in the movie &quot;Is It Easy to Be Young?&quot; by Juris Podnieks. Acts such as Pērkons certainly played an important role in the lives of the youth of the time and were a serious challenge to the Soviet system.

Nowadays, the pop music sphere is dominated by pop music (e.g., Prāta vētra) and alternative rock.

<text>Music of Lithuania refers to all forms of music associated with Lithuania, which has a long history of the folk, popular and classical musical development. Music was an important part of polytheistic, pre-Christian Lithuania – rituals were accompanied by music instruments and singing, deeds of the heroes and those who didn&#x27;t return from the war were celebrated in songs.

== History ==

Music was very important part of ancient Lithuanian polytheistic belief. It is known that, at the start of the 2nd millennium, Baltic tribes had special funeral traditions in which the deeds of the dead were narrated using recitation, and ritual songs about war campaigns, heroes and rulers also existed.

First professional music was introduced to Lithuania with travelling monks in the 11th century. After the christianization of Lithuania in 1387, religious music started to spread, Gregorian chant was introduced. Travelling musicians arranged concerts in the manors and castles of the Lithuanian nobleman, local cappellas were founded.

It is known, that Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great which had diplomatic relationships with the Teutonic Knights, who sent her expensive gifts, including clavichord and portative organ in 1408. Daughter of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, Aldona, when married to Casimir III of Poland, 1325 took her palace orchestra to Cracow. It had musicians which played lute, zither and lyre.

The first opera (&quot;Dramma per musica&quot;) in Lithuania was staged in the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in 1636. Marco Scacchi and Virgilio Puccitelli were the opera&#x27;s impresarios. The appearance of the opera in Lithuania is quite early, especially considering the fact that Italian opera phenomena was formed at about 1600 and first opera staged in Paris was just before 1650.

In the 17th century in Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, three Italian operas were staged – all by palace composer Marco Scacchi, to librettos by Virgilio Puccitelli - &quot;Il ratto d’Elena&quot; (&quot;The Elena Kidnapping&quot;) (1636), &quot;L&#x27;Andromeda&quot; (&quot;Andromeda&quot;) (1644), &quot;Circe Delusa&quot; (&quot;Disillusioned Circe&quot;) (1648). The scenography and stage machinery was made by Italian architects and engineers Agostino Locci, Bartolomeo Bolzoni and Giovanni Battista Gisleni. The cultural life of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania was especially intense during the reign of Sigismund II Augustus. The Vilnius residence was a place to host many chamber concerts, music and dance festivities and carnivals, and music has become an integral part of the public life of the Palace. Musicians from other countries, especially from Italy, were invited to Vilnius. Among the most notable was Hungarian composer and lutenist Bálint Bakfark, who came to Vilnius from Rome, Italian composer Diomedes Cato. Composer and lutenist Michelagnolo Galilei, brother of Galileo Galilei was playing in the court of Radvila in Vilnius in the 17th century. Approximately 100 musicians worked in Vilnius at the court of Mikalojus Radvila Juodasis, the Protestant Grand Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Palatine of Vilnius (1515–1565).

First printed Lithuanian book &quot;Catechismusa Prasty Szadei&quot; (&quot;The Simple Words of Catechism&quot;) in 1547 contained 11 religious hymns in Lithuanian with sheet music. Lithuanian jesuit Žygimantas Liauksminas (Sigismundus Lauxminus) published the first music handbook in Lithuania - &quot;Ars et praxis musica&quot; in 1667. It was a first book of the trilogy, devoted to Gregorian chant - other books include &quot;Graduale pro exercitatione studentium&quot; and &quot;Antifonale ad psalmos, iuxta ritum S. Romanae Ecclesiae, decantandos, necessarium&quot;. The books were published at the University of Vilnius - S.R.M. Academicis Societatis Jesu.

Recent findings - &quot;The Sapieha Album&quot; (&quot;Sapiegos albumas&quot;) and the &quot;Kražiai Organbook&quot; (&quot;Kražių vargoninko sąsiuvinis&quot;) demonstrated that the big part of the Lithuanian church music of the 17th century was directly influenced by the most prominent composers of Italy of that time - Girolamo Frescobaldi; Italian organ tablature notation prevailed, basso continuo was studied.

Lithuania and its turbulent history was a subject of operas long before the appearance of the national opera in Lithuania. &quot;Everardo II, re di Lituania&quot; (&quot;Everardo II, King of Lithuania&quot;), music by João de Sousa Carvalho, libretto by Gaetano Martinelli was written in 1782 to celebrate the birth of Pedro III, King of Portugal. &quot;I Lituani&quot; (&quot;The Lithuanians&quot;) - is an opera consisting by Amilcare Ponchielli to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on the historical poem Konrad Wallenrod written by Adam Mickiewicz. It premiered at La Scala in Milan on 7 March 1874.

One of the first professional Lithuanian musicians was Juozas Kalvaitis (1842-1900). He composed a four-voiced Mass in the Lithuanian language in Tilžė. In 1877, an oratorio The Creation by Joseph Haydn was translated to Lithuanian and performed in Vilnius.
The first national opera &quot;Birutė&quot; by composer Mikas Petrauskas (1873-1937), libretto - Gabrielius Landsbergis-Žemkalnis (1852-1916) was staged in 1906.

Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875-1911) is considered the greatest Lithuanian composer of his generation, and probably of all time.

== Folk music ==


Lithuanian folk music belongs to Baltic music branch which is connected with neolithic corded ware culture. In Lithuanian territory meets two musical cultures: stringed (kanklių) and wind instrument cultures. These instrumental cultures probably formed vocal traditions.
Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith.

=== Vocal music ===

There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: monophony, multi-voiced homophony, heterophony and polyphony. Monophony mostly occurs in southern (Dzūkija), southwest (Suvalkija) and eastern (Aukštaitija) parts of Lithuania. Multi-voiced homophony, widespread in entire Lithuania, is the most archaic in Samogitia. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO&#x27;s representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

==== Sutartinės (multipart songs) ====
Sutartinės (from the word &quot;sutarti&quot;—to be in concordance, in agreement, singular &quot;sutartinė&quot;) are highly unique examples of folk music. They are an ancient form of two and three voiced polyphony, based on the oldest principles of multivoiced vocal music: heterophony, parallelism, canon and free imitation. Most of the sutartinės&#x27; repertoire was recorded in the 19th and 20th centuries, but sources from the 16th century on show that they were significant along with monophonic songs. At present the sutartinės have almost become extinct as a genre among the population, but they are fostered by many Lithuanian folklore ensembles.

The topics and functions of sutartinės encompass all major Lithuanian folk song genres. Melodies of sutartinės are not complex, containing two to five pitches. The melodies are symmetrical, consisting of two equal-length parts; rhythms are typically syncopated, and the distinctly articulated refrains give them a driving quality.

Sutartinės can be classed into three groups according to performance practices and function:
*Dvejinės (“twosomes”) are sung by two singers or two groups of singers.
*Trejinės (“threesomes”) are performed by three singers in strict canon.
*Keturinės (“foursomes&quot;) are sung by two pairs of singers.

Sutartinės are a localized phenomenon, found in the northeastern part of Lithuania. They were sung by women, but men performed instrumental versions on the kanklės (psaltery), on horns, and on the skudučiai (pan-pipes). The rich and thematically varied poetry of the sutartinės attests to their importance in the social fabric. Sutartinės were sung at festivals, gatherings, weddings, and while performing various chores. The poetic language while not being complex is very visual, expressive and sonorous. The rhythms are clear and accented. Dance sutartinės are humorous and spirited, despite the fact that the movements of the dance are quite reserved and slow. One of the most important characteristics of the sutartinės is the wide variety of vocables used in the refrains (&quot;sodauto, lylio, ratilio, tonarilio, dauno, kadujo, čiūto&quot;, etc.).

==== Wedding songs ====

Different vocal and instrumental forms developed, such as lyrical, satirical, drinking and banqueting songs, musical dialogues, wedding laments, games, dances and marches.

==== War-historical time songs ====

Chronicles and historical documents of the 13th through 16th centuries contain the first sources about songs relating the heroics of those fallen in battle against the Teutonic Knights. Later songs mention the Swedes, there are frequent references to Riga and Battle of Kircholm; songs collected in the early 19th century mention battles with the Tatars. Songs from uprisings and revolutions, as well as sonf of Lithuanian anti-Soviet guerrilla resistance in 1945-1952 and songs of the deportees are also classified as wartime historical songs.

==== Calendar cycle and ritual songs ====

They were sung at prescribed times of the year while performing the appropriate rituals. There are songs of Shrovetide and Lent, Easter swinging songs, and Easter songs called lalavimai. The Advent songs reflect the mood of staidness and reflection. Christmas songs contain vocables such as &quot;kalėda, lėliu kalėda; oi kalėda kalėdzieka&quot;, while Advent songs contain vocables such as &quot;leliumoj, aleliuma, aleliuma rūta, aleliuma loda&quot; and others. There are several typical melodic characteristics associated with Christmas ritual songs, such as a narrow range, three-measure phrases, dance rhythms, a controlled slow tempo, and a tonal structure based on phrygian, mixolydian or aeolian tetrachords. Polyphonic St. John&#x27;s Feast songs are commonly called kupolinės, which include refrains and vocables such as &quot;kupolėle kupolio, kupolio kupolėlio, or kupole rože&quot;.

==== Work songs ====

Work songs vary greatly in function and age. There are some very old examples, which have retained their direct relation with the rhythm and process of the work to be done. Later work songs sing more of a person&#x27;s feelings, experiences and aspirations. The older work songs more accurately relate the various stages of the work to be done. They are categorized according to their purpose on the farm, in the home, and so on.

*Herding songs. Shepherd songs are sung by children, while nightherding songs are sung by adults. The shepherding songs reflect the actual tending of animals, the social situation of children, as well as references to ancient beliefs. The raliavimai or warbles are also recitative type melodies, distinguished by the vocable &quot;ralio&quot;, which is meant to calm the animals. The raliavimai have no set poetic or musical form being free recitatives, unified by the refrains. Some warbles end in a prolonged ululation, based on a major or minor third.
*Haymaking songs. Refrains are common in haymaking songs. The most common vocable used is &quot;valio&quot;, hence — &quot;valiavimas&quot;, the term for the singing of haymaking songs. The vocable is sung slowly and broadly, evoking the spacious fields and the mood of the haymaking season. The melodies of earlier origin are similar to other early work songs while more modern haymaking songs have a wider modal range and are structurally more complex. Most are in major and are homophonic.
*Rye harvesting songs. The harvesting of rye is the central stage in the agricultural cycle. The mood is doleful and sad, love and marriage are the prevailing topics in them. Family relationships between parents and children are often discussed, with special emphasis on the hard lot of the daughter-in law in a patriarchal family. Rye harvesting songs have rhythmic and tonal structures in common, which attests to their antiquity. Their unique melodic style is determined by close connection to ritual and the function of the work. The modal-tonal structure of some of these songs revolves around a minor third, while others are built on a major tetrachord.
* Oat harvesting, flax and buckwheat pulling and hemp gathering songs. Oat harvesting songs sing of the lad and the maid, of love and marriage as well as the work process: sowing, harrowing, cultivating, reaping, binding, stacking, transporting, threshing, milling, and even eating. In addition to the monophonic oat harvesting songs of Dzūkija, there are quite a few sutartinės from northern Aukštaitija, which are directly related to the job of growing oats.
*Milling songs. The genre can be identified by characteristic refrains and vocables, such as &quot;zizui malui&quot;, or &quot;malu malu&quot;. They suggest the hum of the millstones as well as the rhythm of the milling. Milling was done by women, and the lyrics are about women&#x27;s life and family relationships, as well as the work itself. Milling songs are slow tempo, composed, the melodic rhythm varies little.
*Spinning and weaving songs. In spinning songs the main topic is the spinning itself, the spinner, and the spinning wheel while weaving songs mention the weaving process, the weaver, the loom, the delicate linens. Some spinning songs are cheerful and humorous, while others resemble the milling songs which bemoan the woman&#x27;s hard lot and longing for their homes and parents. The texts describe the work process, while the refrains mimic the whirring of the spinning wheel. There are also highly unique spinning sutartinės, typified by clear and strict rhythms.
*Laundering songs. Sometimes the refrain imitates the sounds of the beetle and mangle — the laundering tools. The songs often hyperbolyze images of the mother-in-law&#x27;s outlandish demands, such as using the sea instead of a beetle, and the sky in place of a mangle, and the treetops for drying.
*Fishing and hunting songs. Fishing songs are about the sea, the bay, the fisherman, his boat, the net, and they often mention seaside place names, such as Klaipėda or Rusnė. The emotions of young people in love are often portrayed in ways that are unique only to fishing songs. The monophonic melodies are typical of singing traditions of the seaside regions of Lithuania. Hunting motifs are very clearly expressed in hunting songs.
*Berry picking and mushroom gathering songs. These are singular songs. Berry picking songs describe young girls picking berries, meeting boys and their conversations. Mushroom gathering songs can be humorous, making light of the process of gathering and cooking the mushrooms, describing the &quot;war&quot; of the mushrooms or their &quot;weddings.&quot;

=== Instrumental music ===

The &quot;rateliai&quot; (&quot;round dances&quot;) have long been a very important part of Lithuanian folk culture, traditionally performed without instrumental accompaniment. Since the 19th century, however, fiddle, &quot;basetle&quot;, &quot;lamzdeliai&quot; and kanklės came to accompany the dances, while modern groups also incorporate bandoneon, accordion, concertina, mandolin, clarinet, cornet, guitar and harmonica. During the Soviet occupation, dance ensembles used box kanklės and a modified clarinet called the &quot;birbynės&quot;; although the ensembles were ostensibly folk-based, they were modernized and sanitized and used harmonized and denatured forms of traditional styles.

The most important Lithuanian popular folk music ensembles included &quot;Skriaudžių kanklės&quot;, formed in 1906, and &quot;Lietuva&quot;. Such ensembles were based on traditional music, but were modernized to be palatable to the masses; the early 20th century also saw the spread of traditional musical plays like &quot;The Kupiškėnai Wedding&quot;.

== Classical music ==

Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis ( in Varėna— in Pustelnik near Warsaw) was a Lithuanian painter and composer. During his short life he created about 200 pieces of music. His works have had profound influence on modern Lithuanian culture.

Čiurlionis studied piano and composition at the Warsaw Conservatory (1894–1899). Later he attended composition lectures at the Leipzig Conservatory (1901–1902). His symphonic poems &quot;In the Forest&quot; (&quot;Miške&quot;) and &quot;The Sea&quot; (&quot;Jūra&quot;) were performed only posthumously.

&quot;The Čiurlionis String Quartet&quot; performs in Lithuania and abroad. Every several years junior performers from Lithuania and neighbouring countries take part in &quot;The Čiurlionis Competition&quot;.

Modern classical composers emerged in seventies - Bronius Kutavičius, Feliksas Bajoras, Osvaldas Balakauskas, Onutė Narbutaitė, Vidmantas Bartulis and others. Most of those composers explored archaic Lithuanian music and its harmonic combination with modern minimalism and neoromanticism.

Osvaldas Balakauskas (born 1937, Miliūnai) Graduated from the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute in 1961, attended Boris Lyatoshinsky&#x27;s composition class at Kiev Conservatory in 1969. From 1992 to 1994 Balakauskas was ambassador of Lithuania and in 1996 he was awarded with the Lithuanian National Award, the highest artistic and cultural distinction in Lithuania. He is currently head of the Composition Department of the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre. His output consists of symphonies, concertos, chamber and instrumental music.

Conductor and music director of City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla is known for her flamboyance and steely poise. She is also in top 5 of woman conductors.

In 1996 Music Information Centre Lithuania (MICL) was founded. It collects, promotes and shares information on Lithuanian musical culture.

== Opera ==

Although the first opera in Lithuania was staged just 30 years later after it appeared in Italy, the musical and cultural development was constantly interrupted with historical turmoils. The Russian invasion in 1655 was especially grueling - many manors were destroyed, Vilnius was looted and demolished. The war with Sweden was started as well. The period was called &quot;Tvanas&quot; (The Deluge). Eventually it led to a partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1785 in Vilnius was the first city theatre created, which hosted operas as well. Musical life continued in the saloons of the aristocrats and nobleman. The house of 
singer Kristina Gerhardi-Frank and physician Joseph Frank was especially well known in Vilnius.

Development of national Lithuanian opera is related with national revival in the 20th century. Themes of the operas were taken from the national history or mythology. Lithuanian language was considered as language of singing. 
First Lithuanian national opera &quot;Birutė&quot; by composer Mikas Petrauskas was staged in 1906 in Vilnius City Concert Hall. After regaining the Independence of Lithuania in 1918 opera &quot;Gražina&quot; (1933) by composer Jurgis Karnavičius (1884 - 1941) was the first staged in a new Kaunas State Musical Theatre. It was followed in 1937 by the next opera of J.Karnavičius &quot;Radvila Perkūnas&quot;.

In Boston in 1924 Lithuanian emigrants music lovers staged opera by M.Petrauskas &quot;Eglė žalčių karalienė&quot; (&quot;Eglė the Queen of Serpents&quot;). Vytautas Klova (1926 - 2006) created mostly national operas - (&quot;Pilėnai&quot; 1955, &quot;Vaiva&quot; 1957, &quot;Duktė&quot; (&quot;The Daughter&quot;) 1960, &quot;Du kalavijai&quot; (&quot;Two Swords&quot;) 1965, &quot;Amerikietiškoji tragedija&quot; (&quot;An American Tragedy&quot;), 1968, &quot;Ave vita&quot;, 1974). Operas based on historical thematic were created by Julius Juzeliūnas (1916 - 2001) (&quot;Sukilėliai&quot; (&quot;The Rebels&quot;) 1957, banned by soviet censorship, staged only in 1977), B. Dvarionas (&quot;Dalia&quot;, 1958).

Bronius Kutavičius wrote operas &quot;Kaulo senis ant geležinio kalno&quot; (&quot;The Old Man of Bone on the Iron Hill&quot;, 1976), &quot;Strazdas – žalias paukštis&quot; (&quot;Thrush, the Green Bird&quot;, 1981), &quot;Lokys&quot; (&quot;The Bear&quot;, 2000), &quot;Ignes et fides&quot; (&quot;Fire and Faith&quot;, 2003), combining opera, ballet and oratorio.

Most notable Lithuanian opera singers: Kipras Petrauskas (1885 - 1968), Virgilijus Noreika (1935 - 2018), Vaclovas Daunoras (b. 1937), Irena Milkevičiūtė (b. 1947), Violeta Urmana (b. 1961). Other singers performing on international scenes are: Aušrinė Stundytė, Asmik Grigorian, Vaidas Vyšniauskas (Kristian Benedikt), Edgaras Montvidas, Justina Gringytė, Indre Viskontas. Liudas Truikys (1904 - 1987) was a renowned scenic designer. Prominent theatre director Eimuntas Nekrošius has staged several operas in Lithuania (Otello) and Italy (Macbeth). Fashion designer Juozas Statkevičius (b. 1968) created costumes for numerous operas.

The diversity of the modern national opera is represented by: &quot;Lokys&quot; (&quot;The Bear&quot;, 2000), &quot;Geros dienos&quot; (&quot;Have a Godd Day!&quot;, 2011), &quot;Cornet&quot; (2014), &quot;Post Futurum&quot; (2018), &quot;Prūsai&quot; (The Prussians, 2018). Modern opera &quot;Sun &amp; Sea (Marina)&quot; (2019) was presented at Venice Biennale, Lithuanian pavilion and was awarded The Golden Lion for best national participation.

Currently operas are staged in Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, Vilnius City Opera, Kaunas State Musical Theatre, Klaipėda State Musical Theatre and by company &quot;Operomanija&quot; and by Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago. Opera is a highly popular genre in Lithuania, collecting full halls. The annual NOA (New Opera Action) - contemporary alternative opera and multidisciplinary art festival is being organized in Vilnius.

== Musicals ==

In 1971, despite being behind the Iron Curtain in Soviet occupied Lithuania Kęstutis Antanėlis has staged the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar - just one year after its album release.
In 1973 director , composer Vyacheslav Ganelin, and poet Sigitas Geda created &quot;Velnio nuotaka&quot; (&quot;Devil&#x27;s bride&quot;), the first Lithuanian musical film.
In 1974 the first Lithianian theatre musical &quot;Ugnies medžioklė su varovais&quot; (&quot;Fire Hunt with Beaters&quot;) (composer - Giedrius Kuprevičius, libretto - Saulius Šaltenis, Liudas Jacinevičius) was staged.

== Choral music ==

In Lithuania choral music is very important. Only in Vilnius city there are three choirs laureates at the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.
Vytautas Miškinis (born 1954) is a composer and choir director who is very popular in Lithuania and abroad. He has written over 400 secular and about 150 religious works.

== Rock music ==
The Communist government of the Lithuanian SSR criticized rock music, which was considered a decadent and corrupting cultural invasion from the West. The first local rock bands started to emerge around 1965 and included &quot;Kertukai&quot;, &quot;Aitvarai&quot; and &quot;Nuogi ant slenksčio&quot; (&quot;Naked On A Threshold&quot;) in Kaunas, and Kęstutis Antanėlis, &quot;Vienuoliai&quot; (&quot;The Monks&quot;), and &quot;Gėlių Vaikai&quot; (&quot;Flower Childs&quot;) in Vilnius, among others.

Radio Luxembourg was the most important source of information about the music on other side of the Iron Curtain. It was very common for Lithuanian hippies or band players to listen to this radio. Radio Luxemburg bears strong associations in Lithuania with the &quot;Romas Kalanta generation&quot; (&quot;Kalantos karta&quot;). Another means was to smuggle LPs of popular Western bands into Lithuania and copy them onto magnetic tape. The records then spread further by making recordings to the friends, classmates.

Unable to express their opinions directly, the Lithuanian artists began organizing patriotic Roko Maršai and were using metaphors in their songs&#x27; lyrics, which were easily identified for their true meanings by the locals. Postmodernist rock band Antis and its vocalist Algirdas Kaušpėdas were one of the most active performers who mocked the Soviet regime by using metaphors. For example, in the song &quot;Zombiai&quot; (Zombies), the band indirectly sang about the Red Army soldiers who occupied the state and its military base in Ukmergė. Vytautas Kernagis&#x27; song &quot;Kolorado vabalai&quot; (Colorado beetles) was also a favorite due to its lyrics in which true meaning of the Colorado beetles was intended to be the Soviets decorated with the Ribbons of Saint George.

In the early independence years, rock band Foje was particularly popular and gathered tens of thousands of spectators to the concerts. After disbanding in 1997, Foje vocalist Andrius Mamontovas remained one of the most prominent Lithuanian performers and an active participant in various charity events. Marijonas Mikutavičius is famous for creating unofficial Lithuania sport anthem &quot;Trys milijonai&quot; (Three million) and official anthem of the EuroBasket 2011 &quot;Nebetyli sirgaliai&quot; (English version was named &quot;Celebrate Basketball&quot;).

In the 1980s, rock bands Foje, Antis, and Bix made a big impact in Lithuania. Short-lived alternative rock group &quot;Šiaurės kryptis&quot; (&quot;The Northern Direction&quot;, 1986 - 1995) issued only one album &quot;Netiekto&quot;, but still considered one of the best groups of that time.

In 1987, 1988 and 1989 Lithuania saw several big rock festivals, such as Roko Maršas (Rock March). Roko Maršas was connected to the ideology of Sąjūdis and independence movement of Lithuania.

=== Punk rock ===
1986–1987 marked the appearance of the punk scene in Lithuania. Bands like &quot;Už Tėvynę&quot; (&quot;For the Fatherland&quot;), &quot;Genocidas Raudonajam Interventui&quot; (&quot;A Genocide for The Red Intervents&quot;), &quot;SKAT&quot;, and &quot;Erkė maiše&quot; were leaning towards the classic punk rock of the 1970s, while others like &quot;33% kiaulių pakeliui į Vatikaną&quot; and &quot;Turboreanimacija&quot; were more inclined towards hardcore punk (HC) stylistics. &quot;Turboreanimacija&quot; can be regarded as the most influential hardcore punk band of Lithuania, which in its time was well received by fanzines such as &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; in the United States. Their first up-tempo albums reminded listeners of early records from Scottish hardcore punk legends &quot;The Exploited&quot;, while later &quot;Turboreanimacija&quot; embarked on the power-punk road. &quot;Turboreanimacija&quot; disbanded in 1997 after granting a cult status among the Lithuanian underground. Post-punk group &quot;Kardiofonas&quot; (1986-1989) was highly popular with its hit &quot;Kalėdinė eglutė&quot; (&quot;Christmas tree&quot;).

More recent acts of this genre are ska-punk band &quot;Dr.Green&quot; (who are famous for their numerous DIY activities and intensive touring through the punk scenes of Europe), street-punkers &quot;Toro Bravo&quot; and hardcorists &quot;Bora&quot; and &quot;Mountainside&quot;.

== Pop music ==

Origins of Lithuanian pop music are in music of the cafes and restaurants of temporary capital of Lithuania - Kaunas in the 1930s. It was called &quot;estradinė muzika&quot; (estrade-music), &quot;lengvoji muzika&quot; (light music) and the phenomena sometimes named as &quot;mažoji scena&quot; (the little stage). Pop music bands &quot;Kopų balsai&quot; &quot;(Sounds of the dunes)&quot; (in the beginning influenced by Juozas Tiškus orchestra), created in 1957 and band &quot;Nerija&quot;, which started activity in 1970 became very popular in Lithuania.

From the 2000s on, one of the most popular band in Lithuania is SKAMP. Although some pop groups sing in English, pop music in Lithuanian language is very popular.

== Heavy metal ==
== Hip hop ==

== Electronic ==
The group &quot;Saulės laikrodis&quot; created in 1976, and &quot;Argo&quot; - in 1979 are considered the pioneers of electronic music in Lithuania. Sound director of &quot;Argo&quot;, Orūnas Urbonas constructed sound synthesizers &quot;(quasi-moog)&quot; for the group needs.

== Jazz music ==
Jazz was quite often mentioned in the press of Lithuania before the WWII. Back in Lithuania&#x27;s first period of independence (1918-1940), the country was part of swinging Europe. Nearly every Lithuanian town had its own jazz band, and traditional jazz repertoire was performed by prestigious orchestras under the leadership of Mykolas Hofmekleris 
(violinist), Abraomas Stupelis (violinist), Danielius Pomerancas (violinist). Jazz was played in the modern cafés and restaurants of &quot;interbellum&quot; Kaunas - &quot;Konradas&quot;, &quot;Monika&quot;, &quot;Aldona&quot;, &quot;Versalis&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;. In 1935 in the cinema &quot;Metropolitain&quot;, first concert of jazz orchestra took place. The jazz orchestra was assembled from leading musicians of Kaunas, most likely the basis was a band which played in the &quot;Konradas&quot; café in the Laisvės Alley.
In 1940 in Kaunas Radio (&quot;Kauno radiofonas&quot;) was the first official jazz orchestra launched and led by Abraomas Stupelis. He is considered the pioneer of the Lithuanian big band. Mykolas Hofmekleris in 1932 was decorated with the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas for his activity in the field of music.

Soviet occupation destroyed much of the vibrant cultural life, cafes were closed, jazz was considered as an ideologically and politically charged music of the West.
Jazz scene was active even during the years of Soviet occupation. First sign of revival was an orchestra of Kaunas Polytechnic Institute led by Juozas Tiškus. Juozas Tiškus formed a professional swing orchestra of 28 members. Juozas Tiškus is also considered one of the instigators of popular Lithuanian music.
The real breakthrough would occur in 1970–71 with the coming together of the Ganelin/Tarasov/Chekasin trio, the alleged instigators of the Vilnius Jazz School. The trio, known also as &quot;Ganelin Trio&quot; or &quot;GTCh&quot; combined free jazz with elements of Lithuanian folk and classic music. Café &quot;Neringa&quot; in Vilnius and café &quot;Tulpė&quot; (former &quot;Konradas&quot;) in Kaunas became places for jazz lovers and players.

Almost anything can be found on the jazz scene in Lithuania today, from Dixieland and a cappella groups, to all kinds of jazz fusion, nu-jazz and jazzcore.

There are quite a few international jazz festivals in Lithuania:
Jazz bands and performers:

== Music festivals and events ==

1924 saw the first &quot;Dainų šventė&quot; (The Lithuanian Song Festival), song festivals which were state-supported and helped to keep folk traditions alive; these were held every five years (every four since 1990). Similar festivals take place in Estonia and Latvia since the 1870s. The 1960s saw people rebelling against Soviet-controlled traditions, and led a roots revival that soon led to celebrations of Lithuanian identity in festivals and celebrations.

Lithuania is home to many folk music festivals. The &quot;Dainų šventė&quot; song festival is perhaps the most famous; it was first held in 1924, and has continued every five years since. Other major folk festivals include the &quot;Skamba skamba kankliai&quot; and the &quot;Atataria trimitai&quot;, both held annually; of historical importance is the &quot;Ant marių krantelio&quot;, which was held in the 1980s and was the first major festival of its kind. The Baltica International Folklore Festival is held in one of the Baltic states every year.

The GAIDA Festival, organised in Vilnius since 1991 is the largest and the most prominent festival of modern music in Lithuania and in all Baltic countries.

<doc id="372895" wikidata="Q3269344" url="?curid=372895" title="Oxyanion">
<text>An oxyanion, or oxoanion, is an ion with the generic formula (where A represents a chemical element and O represents an oxygen atom). Oxyanions are formed by a large majority of the chemical elements. The formulae of simple oxyanions are determined by the octet rule. The corresponding oxyacid of an oxyanion is the compound . The structures of condensed oxyanions can be rationalized in terms of AO&quot;n&quot; polyhedral units with sharing of corners or edges between polyhedra. The oxyanions (specifically, phosphate and polyphosphate esters) adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are important in biology.

==Monomeric oxyanions==
The formula of monomeric oxyanions, , is dictated by the oxidation state of the element A and its position in the periodic table. Elements of the first row are limited to a maximum coordination number of 4. However, none of the first row elements has a monomeric oxyanion with that coordination number. Instead, carbonate () and nitrate () have a trigonal planar structure with π bonding between the central atom and the oxygen atoms. This π bonding is favoured by the similarity in size of the central atom and oxygen.

The oxyanions of second-row elements in the group oxidation state are tetrahedral. Tetrahedral units are found in olivine minerals, , but the anion does not have a separate existence as the oxygen atoms are surrounded tetrahedrally by cations in the solid state. Phosphate (), sulfate (), and perchlorate () ions can be found as such in various salts. Many oxyanions of elements in lower oxidation state obey the octet rule and this can be used to rationalize the formulae adopted. For example, chlorine(V) has two valence electrons so it can accommodate three electron pairs from bonds with oxide ions. The charge on the ion is +5 − 3 × 2 = −1, and so the formula is . The structure of the ion is predicted by VSEPR theory to be pyramidal, with three bonding electron pairs and one lone pair. In a similar way,
The oxyanion of chlorine(III) has the formula , and is bent with two lone pairs and two bonding pairs.

In the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table, 6-coordination is possible, but isolated octahedral oxyanions are not known because they would carry too high an electrical charge. Thus molybdenum(VI) does not form , but forms the tetrahedral molybdate anion, . MoO6 units are found in condensed molybdates. Fully protonated oxyanions with an octahedral structure are found in such species as and . In addition, orthoperiodate can be only partially deprotonated, with 
:&lt;chem&gt;H3IO6^{2-} \ _{\longrightarrow}^{\longleftarrow} \ H2IO6^{3-} \ + \ H^{+}&lt;/chem&gt; having p&quot;K&quot;a=11.60.

===Naming===
The naming of monomeric oxyanions follows the following rules.

Here the halogen group (group 7A, 17) is referred to as group VII and the noble gases group (group 8A) is referred to as group VIII.

; If central atom is not in Group VII or VIII

; If central atom is in Group VII or VIII
== Condensation reactions ==

In aqueous solution, oxyanions with high charge can undergo condensation reactions, such as in the formation of the dichromate ion, :

:&lt;chem&gt;2 CrO4^2- + 2 H+ &lt;=&gt; Cr2O7^2- + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The driving force for this reaction is the reduction of electrical charge density on the anion and the elimination of the hydronium () ion. The amount of order in the solution is decreased, releasing a certain amount of entropy which makes the Gibbs free energy more negative and favors the forward reaction. It is an example of an acid–base reaction with the monomeric oxyanion acting as a base and the condensed oxyanion acting as its conjugate acid. The reverse reaction is a hydrolysis reaction, as a water molecule, acting as a base, is split. Further condensation may occur, particularly with anions of higher charge, as occurs with adenosine phosphates.

The conversion of ATP to ADP is a hydrolysis reaction and is an important source of energy in biological systems.

The formation of most silicate minerals can be viewed as the result of a de-condensation reaction in which silica reacts with a basic oxide, an acid–base reaction in the Lux–Flood sense.
:&lt;chem&gt;\overset{base}{CaO} + \overset{acid}{SiO2} -&gt; CaSiO3&lt;/chem&gt;

== Structures and formulae of polyoxyanions ==
A polyoxyanion is a polymeric oxyanion in which multiple oxyanion monomers, usually regarded as polyhedra, are joined by sharing corners or edges. When two corners of a polyhedron are shared the resulting structure may be a chain or a ring. Short chains occur, for example, in polyphosphates. Inosilicates, such as pyroxenes, have a long chain of tetrahedra each sharing two corners. The same structure occurs in so-called meta-vanadates, such as ammonium metavanadate, .

The formula of the oxyanion is obtained as follows: each nominal silicon ion () is attached to two nominal oxide ions () and has a half share in two others. Thus the stoichiometry and charge are given by:

:formula_1
:formula_2

A ring can be viewed as a chain in which the two ends have been joined. Cyclic triphosphate, is an example.

When three corners are shared the structure extends into two dimensions. In amphiboles, (of which asbestos is an example) two chains are linked together by sharing of a third corner on alternate places along the chain. This results in an ideal formula and a linear chain structure which explains the fibrous nature of these minerals. Sharing of all three corners can result in a sheet structure, as in mica, , in which each silicon has one oxygen to itself and a half-share in three others. Crystalline mica can be cleaved into very thin sheets.

The sharing of all four corners of the tetrahedra results in a 3-dimensional structure, such as in quartz. Aluminosilicates are minerals in which some silicon is replaced by aluminium. However, the oxidation state of aluminium is one less than that of silicon, so the replacement must be accompanied by the addition of another cation. The number of possible combinations of such a structure is very large, which is, in part, the reason why there are so many aluminosilicates.
Octahedral units are common in oxyanions of the larger transition metals. Some compounds, such as salts of the chain-polymeric ion, even contain both tetrahedral and octahedral units. Edge-sharing is common in ions containing octahedral building blocks and the octahedra are usually distorted to reduce the strain at the bridging oxygen atoms. This results in 3-dimensional structures called polyoxometalates. Typical examples occur in the Keggin structure of the phosphomolybdate ion. Edge sharing is an effective means of reducing electrical charge density, as can be seen with the hypothetical condensation reaction involving two octahedra:

:&lt;chem&gt;2 MO6^{\mathit{n}-}{} + 4H+ -&gt; Mo2O10^{(\mathit{n}-4) - }{} + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Here, the average charge on each M atom is reduced by 2. The efficacy of edge-sharing is demonstrated by the following reaction, which occurs when an alkaline aqueous solution of molybdate is acidified.

:&lt;chem&gt;7 MoO4^2- + 8 H+ &lt;=&gt; Mo7O24^6- + 4 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The tetrahedral molybdate ion is converted into a cluster of 7 edge-linked octahedra giving an average charge on each molybdenum of . The heptamolybdate cluster is so stable that clusters with between 2 and 6 molybdate units have not been detected even though they must be formed as intermediates.

==Heuristic for acidity==
The pKa of the related acids can be guessed from the number of double bonds to oxygen. Thus perchloric acid is a very strong acid while hypochlorous acid is very weak. A simple rule usually works to within about 1 pH unit.

== Acid–base properties ==
Most oxyanions are weak bases and can be protonated to give acids or acid salts. For example, the phosphate ion can be successively protonated to form phosphoric acid.

:&lt;chem&gt;PO4^3- + H+ &lt;=&gt; HPO4^2-&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;HPO4^2- + H+ &lt;=&gt; H2PO4-&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;H2PO4- + H+ &lt;=&gt; H3PO4&lt;/chem&gt;

The extent of protonation in aqueous solution will depend on the acid dissociation constants and pH. For example, AMP (adenosine monophosphate) has a p&quot;K&quot;a value of 6.21, so at pH 7 it will be about 10% protonated. Charge neutralization is an important factor in these protonation reactions. By contrast, the univalent anions perchlorate and permanganate ions are very difficult to protonate and so the corresponding acids are strong acids.

Although acids such as phosphoric acid are written as , the protons are attached to oxygen atoms forming hydroxyl groups, so the formula can also be written as to better reflect the structure. Sulfuric acid may be written as ; this is the molecule observed in the gas phase.

The phosphite ion, , is a strong base, and so always carries at least one proton. In this case the proton is attached directly to the phosphorus atom with the structure . In forming this ion, the phosphite ion is behaving as a Lewis base and donating a pair of electrons to the Lewis acid, .
As mentioned above, a condensation reaction is also an acid–base reaction. In many systems, both protonation and condensation reactions can occur. The case of the chromate ion provides a relatively simple example. In the predominance diagram for chromate, shown at the right, pCr stands for the negative logarithm of the chromium concentration and pH stands for the negative logarithm of  ion concentration. There are two independent equilibria. Equilibrium constants are defined as follows.

The predominance diagram is interpreted as follows. 
*The chromate ion, , is the predominant species at high pH. As pH rises the chromate ion becomes ever more predominant, until it is the only species in solutions with pH &gt; 6.75.
*At pH &lt; p&quot;K&quot;1 the hydrogen chromate ion, is predominant in dilute solution.
*The dichromate ion, , is predominant in more concentrated solutions, except at high pH.

The species and are not shown as they are formed only at very low pH. 

Predominance diagrams can become very complicated when many polymeric species can be formed, such as in vanadates, molybdates, and tungstates. Another complication is that many of the higher polymers are formed extremely slowly, such that equilibrium may not be attained even in months, leading to possible errors in the equilibrium constants and the predominance diagram.

<doc id="372896" wikidata="Q7593597" url="?curid=372896" title="St John's Gate, Clerkenwell">
<text>St John&#x27;s Gate, in Clerkenwell, Middlesex, now within central London, is one of the few tangible remains from Clerkenwell&#x27;s monastic past. It was built in 1504 by Prior Thomas Docwra as the south entrance to the inner precinct of Clerkenwell Priory, the English headquarters of the Knights of the Order of St John (known as the Knights Hospitaller).

The substructure is of brick, while the north and south façades are of stone. After centuries of decay and much rebuilding, very little of the stone facing is original. Heavily restored in the 19th century, the Gate today is in large part a Victorian recreation, the handiwork of a succession of architects—William Pettit Griffith, R. Norman Shaw, and J. Oldrid Scott.

== History ==
The Priory was established in the 1140s in Clerkenwell as the English headquarters of the Order. The Order was dissolved by King Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries when its lands and wealth were seized by the Crown. The Order was re-established for a brief period by that king&#x27;s Roman Catholic daughter, Queen Mary, who granted it a Royal Charter. However, when her Protestant half-sister Queen Elizabeth I succeeded her, the Order in England was dissolved once again. The Order was re-established in England during the Victorian era.

==Uses==
The building has many historical associations, most notably as the original printing-house for Edward Cave&#x27;s pioneering monthly, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and sometime workplace of Samuel Johnson. From 1701 to 1709 it was the childhood home of the painter William Hogarth, whose father Richard Hogarth in 1703 opened a coffee house there, known as &quot;Hogarth&#x27;s Coffee House&quot;, which offered Latin lessons together with coffee. For many years the building was used as a tavern. In 1831 John Frost established a medical hospital (St John&#x27;s Hospital) in the building, the original mediaeval usage of that word signifying a guest-house.

The Gate was acquired in the 1870s by the revived Order of St John and was gradually converted to serve as headquarters of both the Order and its subsidiary, the St John Ambulance Brigade. It now also houses the Museum of the Order of St John. Much of its Tudor-style interior, including the Council Chamber over the arch, is attributed to Scott&#x27;s Victorian restoration in the 1880s and 1890s.

St John&#x27;s Gate was voted an iconic landmark to represent Islington for the London Olympics 2012.
