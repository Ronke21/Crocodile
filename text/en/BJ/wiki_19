<text>Barracudinas are any member of the marine mesopelagic fish family Paralepididae: 50 or so extant species are found almost worldwide in deep waters. Several genera, including &quot;Holosteus&quot; and &quot;Drimys&quot;, are known only from fossils dating back to the Ypresian epoch.

The generic name &quot;Paralepis&quot; (for which the family is named) is from Greek - &quot;para&quot; meaning &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;scaled&quot;.

== Description ==
Barracudinas are elongated, slender fish with large eyes, and a pointed snout containing fang-like teeth. This gives them some superficial resemblance to barracudas (family Sphyraenidae), although the two groups are not closely related. Barracudinas are actually related to lizardfish (order Aulopiformes; suborder Alepisauroidei) and are most closely aligned with lancetfish (family Alepisauridae), hammerjaws (family Omosudidae) and daggertooths (family Anotopteridae). Like their close relatives, barracudinas lack swim bladders and are simultaneous hermaphrodites, a reproductive mode which is rare among vertebrates. The largest species of barracudina grow up to in length.
Barracudinas have some unique adaptations to life in the deep pelagic that are thought to help with camouflage: most barracudina species have a subdermal layer of guanine that imparts a kaleidoscopic color to their appearance in life and it is thought this refracts the dim light of mesophotic waters around their bodies. The smaller, more derived species of barracudinas in the genera &quot;Lestidiops&quot;, &quot;Lestidium&quot;, &quot;Lestrolepis&quot; and &quot;Stemonosudis&quot; possess very few scales and their skin is almost completely transparent, making it difficult for them to be seen underwater. Barracudinas, like many other deep-sea fishes, have darkly pigmented gut linings which are thought to help conceal bioluminescent prey such as lanternfish (family Myctophidae). Species in the genus &quot;Lestrolepis&quot; have a bioluminescent organ located ventrally along their stomachs which likely helps in countershading against downwelling light, camouflaging their silhouettes to would be predators below. Other species have a bioluminescent organ which have evolved from liver tissue.

== Ecology and life history==
Barracudinas are known to inhabit mesopelagic depths throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, and are predators of fish, shrimps, and squids. While many barracudina species can be found at depths of 2000 m, their highest abundances tend to occur between 200 and 1000 m. Barracudinas are not thought to participate in diel vertical migration. While they are rarely caught by fisheries, they are frequently documented in the guts of pelagic predators such as tuna, swordfish, lancetfish, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales, and blue sharks.

First-hand accounts from the &quot;Bathyscaphe Trieste&quot; reported behavioral observations of &quot;Lestrolepis intermedia&quot; rapidly swimming vertically through the water column like &quot;silvery javelins&quot; glowing &quot;a brilliant yellow&quot; from their bioluminescent organs. They were also observed hovering in the water and rapidly reorienting themselves from facing upwards to facing downwards as if scanning for predators and/or prey. If this behavior is common to all species of barracudina is not known, as it has not been observed since.


Very little is known of the spawning habits of these fish. While both sperm and eggs are present in gonads, spawning has never been observed. Planktonic disposition and transmission of their early larva indicate that the eggs are fertilized and dispersed in the plankton. While specific life histories differ among species and genera, postlarval barracudina size classes are found more frequently within proximity to continental shelf escarpments at certain times of the year. However, this could also be a sampling artifact, since barracudina are only rarely caught by fisheries-independent sampling.

<text>Kenneth Charles Marion Rexroth (December 22, 1905 – June 6, 1982) was an American poet, translator, and critical essayist. He is regarded as a central figure in the San Francisco Renaissance, and paved the groundwork for the movement. Although he did not consider himself to be a Beat poet, and disliked the association, he was dubbed the &quot;Father of the Beats&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Largely self-educated, Rexroth learned several languages and translated poems from Chinese, French, Spanish, and Japanese.

==Early life==
Rexroth was born Kenneth Charles Marion Rexroth in South Bend, Indiana, the son of Charles Rexroth, a pharmaceuticals salesman, and Delia Reed. His childhood was troubled by his father&#x27;s alcoholism and his mother&#x27;s chronic illness. His mother died in 1916 and his father in 1919, after which he went to live with his aunt in Chicago and enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago.

At age 19, he hitchhiked across the country, taking odd jobs and working a stint as a Forest Service trail crew hand, cook and packer at the Marblemount Ranger Station in the Pacific Northwest.

==Poetry career==
In the 1930s, Rexroth was associated with the Objectivists, a largely New York group gathered around Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen. He was included in the 1931 issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine dedicated to Objectivist poetry, and in the 1932 &quot;An “Objectivists” Anthology&quot;. Much of Rexroth&#x27;s work can be classified as &quot;erotic&quot; or &quot;love poetry&quot;, given his deep fascination with transcendent love. According to Hamill and Kleiner, &quot;nowhere is Rexroth&#x27;s verse more fully realized than in his erotic poetry&quot;.

With &quot;The Love Poems of Marichiko&quot;, Rexroth claimed to have translated the poetry of a contemporary, &quot;young Japanese woman poet&quot;, but it was later disclosed that he was the author, and he gained critical recognition for having conveyed so authentically the feelings of someone of another gender and culture. Linda Hamalian, his biographer, suggests that, &quot;translating the work of women poets from China and Japan reveals a transformation of both heart and mind&quot;.
With Rexroth acting as master of ceremonies, Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen performed at the famous Six Gallery reading on October 7, 1955. Rexroth later testified as a defense witness at Ferlinghetti&#x27;s obscenity trial for publishing &quot;Howl&quot;. Rexroth had previously sent Ginsberg (new in the Bay Area) to meet Snyder, and was thus responsible for their friendship. Lawrence Ferlinghetti named Rexroth as one of his own mentors. Rexroth was eventually critical of the Beat movement. Years after the Six Gallery reading, &quot;Time&quot; referred to him as &quot;Father of the Beats. Rexroth ostensibly appears in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; as Reinhold Cacoethes.

==Politics==
As a young man in Chicago, Rexroth was involved with the anarchist movement and was active in the IWW. Fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti recalled that Rexroth self-identified as a philosophical anarchist, regularly associated with other anarchists in North Beach, and sold Italian anarchist newspapers at the City Lights Bookstore.

Rexroth, a pacifist, was a conscientious objector during World War II.

==Painter==
Rexroth trained as an artist and was an avid painter into his 40s. His mediums were usually wax and silica on Masonite or board. In his introduction to an undated auction catalog of Rexroth&#x27;s paintings, critic Bradford Morrow observes that his early works were mainly abstract, often geometric reminiscent of Mondrian, but that as time went on, Rexroth turned to more figurative treatment of his subjects. 

==Last years==
Rexroth died in Santa Barbara, California, on June 6, 1982. He had spent his final years translating Japanese and Chinese women poets, as well as promoting the work of female poets in America and overseas. The year before his death, on Easter, Rexroth converted to Roman Catholicism.

<text>The MetLife Building (also 200 Park Avenue and formerly the Pan Am Building) is a skyscraper at Park Avenue and 45th Street, north of Grand Central Terminal, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States. Designed in the International style by Richard Roth, Walter Gropius, and Pietro Belluschi and completed in 1962, the MetLife Building is tall with 59 stories. It was advertised as the world&#x27;s largest commercial office space by square footage at its opening, with of usable office space. , the MetLife Building remains one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States.

The MetLife Building contains an elongated octagonal massing with the longer axis perpendicular to Park Avenue. The building sits atop two levels of railroad tracks leading into Grand Central Terminal. The facade is one of the first precast concrete exterior walls in a building in New York City. In the lobby is a pedestrian passage to Grand Central&#x27;s Main Concourse, a lobby with artwork, and a parking garage at the building&#x27;s base. The roof also contained a heliport that operated briefly during the 1960s and 1970s. The MetLife Building&#x27;s design has been widely criticized since it was proposed, largely due to its location next to Grand Central Terminal.

Proposals for a skyscraper to replace Grand Central Terminal were announced in 1954 to raise money for the New York Central Railroad and New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, the financially struggling railroads that operated the terminal. Subsequently, plans were announced for what later became the MetLife Building, to be built behind the terminal rather than in place of it. Work on the project, initially known as Grand Central City, started in 1959 and the building was formally opened on March 7, 1963. At its opening, the building was named for Pan American World Airways, for which it served as headquarters. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) bought the Pan Am Building in 1981 and used it as their headquarters before selling the building in 2005. The MetLife Building has been renovated several times, including in the mid-1980s, early 2000s, and late 2010s.

== Site ==
The MetLife Building is at 200 Park Avenue, between the two roadways of the Park Avenue Viaduct to the west and east, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The building faces the Helmsley Building across 45th Street to the north and Grand Central Terminal to the south. Other nearby buildings include One Vanderbilt and 335 Madison Avenue to the southwest; the Yale Club of New York City clubhouse to the west; The Roosevelt Hotel to the northwest; 450 Lexington Avenue to the east; and the Graybar Building to the southeast. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code—10166—and is one of 41 such buildings in Manhattan, .

In 1871, the New York Central Railroad built the Grand Central Depot, a ground-level depot at the intersection of Park Avenue and 42nd Street; it was succeeded in 1900 by Grand Central Station, also at ground level. The completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, which became known as Terminal City. The Grand Central Terminal complex included a six-story building for baggage handling just north of the main station building, on what is now the site of the MetLife Building. The baggage handling building was converted to an office building late in its history. The surrounding stretch of Park Avenue was developed with International Style skyscrapers during the 1950s and 1960s.

== Architecture ==
Designed in the International style by Richard Roth, Walter Gropius, and Pietro Belluschi, the MetLife Building was developed by Erwin S. Wolfson and completed in 1963 as the Pan Am Building. It is tall with 59 stories, containing both commercial and office space. , the MetLife Building is the 42nd-tallest building in New York City and 88th-tallest in the United States.

The Diesel Construction Company was the general contractor for the building; at the time of construction, Wolfson had owned that company. Numerous other engineers and contractors were involved in the building&#x27;s construction, including Hideo Sasaki as site planning consultant and landscape architect; Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles as MEP engineers; and James Ruderman as structural engineer. From the beginning, the building was intended for large firms, with in office floor area. In total, it has of gross floor area, according to The Skyscraper Center.

=== Form ===
The massing consists of a base and an octagonal tower. Contemporary sources describe the base as measuring nine stories tall, atop which rises 50 tower stories. However, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a conflicting measurement of 10 base stories and 49 tower stories. Exterior planted areas were planned for the sidewalks and above the roof of the base.

The tower stories&#x27; floor plates are designed in an elongated octagonal lozenge, with the longer axis running parallel to 45th Street. The north and south facades are divided into three broad segments, while the west and east facades are one segment each. The building&#x27;s form may have been influenced by the 1961 Zoning Resolution, a major change to New York City zoning code that was proposed just before construction started. The massing is similar to Le Corbusier&#x27;s unbuilt tower in Algiers, proposed between 1938 and 1942, as well as the nearly contemporary Pirelli Tower in Milan (completed in 1958). The architects intended for the octagonal shape and exterior curtain wall to reduce the building&#x27;s perceived sense of scale.

=== Facade ===

The facade of the first two stories and mezzanines is clad with granite, aluminum, marble, and stainless steel with glass windows. On Depew Place, an alley running below the eastern leg of the Park Avenue Viaduct, fifteen loading docks were constructed for trucks to conduct deliveries and loading. On the Vanderbilt Avenue side, a marquee was installed over the entrance in the 1980s. The third through seventh stories are exclusively sheathed in granite, with window inserts. The eighth and ninth floors, which are slightly set back, are clad in aluminum.

The 10th through 59th stories of the MetLife Building contain one of the first precast concrete exterior walls in a building in New York City. The building includes about nine thousand light-tan precast concrete Mo-Sai panels, each of which surrounds a window measuring wide by high. The panels themselves measure wide by high and weigh . Each panel is coated with a quartz aggregate to give texture to the facade. Vertical concrete mullions project about from the facade, separating the panels on every story. Flat concrete spandrels separate the windows between stories. Though Walter Gropius had considered a precast concrete facade to be more solid than a glass curtain wall, this only made the building appear bulkier. Furthermore, the appearance of concrete degraded over time; this effect could be seen in structures such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum but was more pronounced on the MetLife Building&#x27;s facade. During the building&#x27;s construction, the manufacturer of the Mo-Sai panels declared bankruptcy, forcing Diesel Construction to buy out that company to prevent delays in construction.

The facade is recessed at the 21st and 46th stories, where there is mechanical space. These recesses create the impression of deep shadows. Both mechanical stories are surrounded by a colonnade of columns, which are spaced apart on centers. The precast concrete curtain wall is recessed behind the columns.

The MetLife Building originally bore &quot;Pan Am&quot; displays on its north and south facades and globe logos on the east and west facades. This was swapped with neon &quot;MetLife&quot; displays to the north and south in 1992. These displays were changed again in 2017, being replaced with LED letters to conserve energy. The Pan Am Building was the last tall tower erected in New York City before laws were enacted preventing corporate logos and names on the tops of buildings. Modern New York City building code prohibits logos from being more than above the curb or occupying over on a blockfront. The sign replacements had been permitted because the city government considered the new signs to be an &quot;uninterrupted continuation of a use&quot; that was allowed before the zoning laws were changed.

=== Structural features ===
200 Park Avenue was built atop two levels of railroad tracks underground, which feed directly into Grand Central Terminal. The substructure of the building uses foundational columns that extend into the track levels, descending some below street level into the underlying bedrock. The substructure includes more than 300 columns, each across and clad with of concrete. Ninety-nine columns were built specifically for the Pan Am Building; these columns were installed within several inches of existing steel members such as third rails, but had to be isolated from the other steel. The new columns weighed between . Approximately two hundred existing columns, which supported the former baggage building on the site, were reinforced. The work involved abridging the tops of many existing columns and installing horizontal beams weighing up to . A &quot;triple decker sandwich&quot; made of lead, asbestos, and sheet steel was installed under each level of tracks to provide insulation.

The superstructure was constructed similarly to bridge spans. To fabricate the floor slabs, builders used a process called composite action, in which concrete was bonded with structural steel panels to create a stronger structure. Steel panels were fabricated, rather than concrete floors, because steel panels were lighter and could be constructed regardless of unfavorable weather. Over of steel panels are used in the floor plates, each of which contains wire and cable ducts. A standard floor slab could handle loads of . The building&#x27;s steel frame weighs over in total. The roof of the building contains NOAA Weather Radio Station KWO35, a National Weather Service radio station. Since 1990, there has also been a peregrine falcon nest on the building&#x27;s roof.

====Helipad ====
The initial plans for the Pan Am Building were altered in March 1961 to provide for a helipad on the east side of the roof. The helipad garnered controversy immediately after it was announced, and opponents of the plan cited noise and safety concerns. The heliport&#x27;s opening required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the city government, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Lawyers for the building&#x27;s owners applied for permission to operate the heliport in August 1963, and the New York City Planning Commission confirmed in early 1964 that the owners had sought a permit for the heliport. The New York City Board of Estimate gave final approval to the heliport in January 1965, and test flights began that March, amid continued opposition to the heliport.

Helicopter service started on December 22, 1965. The service was operated by New York Airways, which flew Vertol 107 helicopters from the rooftop helipad to Pan Am&#x27;s terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). There was a ticket office for the heliport at the base of the building. Passengers would check in at the ticket office, then take an express elevator to the 57th floor, an escalator to the heliport lounge, then another elevator to the roof. The flight to JFK lasted an average of six minutes and twenty seconds. The New York City government renewed the heliport&#x27;s operating license in 1966, despite continued opposition to the heliport. For a short period starting in March 1967, the company also offered service to Teterboro Airport. All helicopter service stopped on February 18, 1968, because of insufficient ridership, as well as disagreements over funding.

Though discussions to restart helicopter service were held in 1969, approval was not given until early 1977. Service to JFK resumed that February using Sikorsky S-61s. On May 16, 1977, about one minute after an S-61L landed and its 20 passengers disembarked, the right front landing gear collapsed, causing the aircraft to topple onto its side with the rotors still turning. One of the blades detached, killing four men who were waiting to board and a fifth person at ground level; two other people were seriously injured. Helicopter service was suspended that day and never resumed. The already-controversial building received further negative attention as a result of the incident, and both New York Airways and Pan Am suffered financially in subsequent years. During its short periods of operation, the heliport was largely perceived as a nuisance and danger, but its presence was also seen as satisfying what David W. Dunlap described as &quot;the consummate technological fantasy of airborne travel through skyscraping pinnacles&quot;.

=== Interior ===

==== Structural and mechanical features ====

A central telephone office was installed on the 20th and 21st stories, serving 30,000 telephones within the building. The system, costing $11 million, was the first of its kind in an office building in the United States. The central office, operated by New York Telephone, eliminated the need for tenants to have individual telephone offices and equipment rooms. To avoid interfering with the subterranean railroad tracks, the telephone conduits were routed through the roof of the railroad tunnel. On the two floors where the telephone office was installed, the floor slabs were strengthened to handle loads of , and floor heights were increased to provide clearance of at least .

A refrigeration plant, described at the time of construction as the world&#x27;s largest such plant, was installed on the roof with three steam-powered units each weighing . The plant was placed on the roof because the building has no usable basement, as all the subterranean space is part of Grand Central Terminal. The plant could melt up to of ice each day and could use 200,000 pounds of steam every hour. Large fan rooms were placed on the mechanical stories at the 21st and 46th floors, dispersing air to the other floors, and two individual air supply systems were placed on each story. The ventilation systems could deliver every minute. The pipes and ducts had to serve all the building&#x27;s floors, with an electrical system and water pressure system capable of serving all the building&#x27;s stories. At ground level was a room where wastepaper could be &quot;baled&quot; on-site to make easier to dispose of paper.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation also manufactured 65 elevators and 21 escalators for 200 Park Avenue, which at the time of construction was the largest-ever order for elevators. One bank of six elevators was able to travel , the fastest elevators in the world at the time of their installation. Five elevators were reserved for freight. The elevators rise from the second-story lobby because the elevator pits could not descend below the first story due to the presence of the tracks. The upper stories were served by 59 elevators. According to the Skyscraper Center, , the building has 85 elevators.

==== Lobby ====

The MetLife Building&#x27;s base contains a lobby across its lowest two stories. At ground level is a pedestrian passageway, enabling traffic flow between the Helmsley Building&#x27;s pedestrian arcades and Grand Central Terminal. The 45th Street entrance to the passageway is set back from the sidewalk. A entrance arcade is placed on Vanderbilt Avenue, with the doorways set about back from the sidewalk there. The building&#x27;s main office lobby is placed at the second story, at the level of the viaduct. The lobby was also designed with plantings and a enclosed plaza. The lobby contains 18 escalators in total. Four escalators lead to the Main Concourse at the southern end of the passageway, while fourteen more lead from the passageway to the office lobby.

Gropius was responsible for the original design of the lobby, which was largely austere. The building&#x27;s original anchor tenant, Pan Am, had a ticket office under a niche off the main lobby, measuring long and high, with circular counters and a wall with a relief map of the world. It was the world&#x27;s largest airline ticket office at the time of its opening, covering .

===== Renovations =====
During a 1980s renovation by Warren Platner, some of retail space were constructed in the lobby. Also installed was a staircase at the center of the lobby on 45th Street, which consisted of alternating travertine and gray-granite risers. The staircase ranged from wide at the ground floor to at an intermediate landing, where it split into two flights and reached a width of at the mezzanine. There were four triangular planters at the bottom of the staircase, which complemented an orange carpet with flower motifs at the mezzanine. The lobby also contained unusual semicircular discs that were either mounted atop poles or suspended from the ceiling. In addition, a security desk was added and the storefronts were expanded.

In an early-2000s renovation by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the lobby received tile and black travertine floors, the storefronts were moved to the side, and the central staircase was removed. The storefronts were removed in the late 2010s, when the lobby was re-clad in light-colored travertine. The renovated lobby has an oak-floored reception lounge overlooking the entrance.

===== Artwork =====
The Pan Am Building&#x27;s lobby was planned with several works of art, which comprised most of the original lobby&#x27;s decoration. One such artwork is &quot;Flight,&quot; a triple-story wire sculpture by Richard Lippold. The sculpture contains a sphere, representing the earth; a seven-pointed star, representing the seven continents and seas; and gold wires representing aircraft flight patterns. It measures wide, and deep. The composer John Cage, a friend of Lippold&#x27;s, had initially proposed a musical program to complement &quot;Flight&quot;, consisting of ten loudspeakers, which would have played works by Muzak whenever people walked in and out of the lobby. Lippold canceled the idea and management instead agreed to play classical music in the lobby.

At the Pan Am Building&#x27;s opening, the entrance from the Main Concourse was topped by &quot;Manhattan&quot;, a mosaic mural of red, white, and black panels by Josef Albers. That work was removed in a 2001 renovation, though Albers had left exact specifications for reproducing the work, and a replica was installed in 2019.

Suspended over the 45th Street entrance was a mural by György Kepes, consisting of two aluminum screens with concentric squares. Kepes&#x27;s mural measured wide and was placed on the balcony until it was removed in the 1980s. At Vanderbilt Avenue, Robert Berks sculpted a bronze bust depicting the building&#x27;s developer, Erwin S. Wolfson.

==== Other interior spaces ====
The MetLife Building was designed with a six-level parking garage with room for 400 cars. The garage contains entrances and exits from both roadways of the Park Avenue Viaduct. According to owner Tishman Speyer, , the building&#x27;s garage contains 248 spots across four levels.

A variety of commercial and office spaces were included in the Pan Am Building when it opened. Pan Am, the airline for which the building was originally named, contained a ticketing office at 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, similar in design to Eero Saarinen&#x27;s TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport. Office stories in the octagonal slab typically have between of usable space, with elevators and stairs at the center, as well as uneven column spacing. This arrangement allows a large amount of window-office space for tenants, as each story contains of outer perimeter walls. Different companies with full-floor leases designed their spaces in various manners. Some tenants placed private offices along the perimeter, with important executive offices at the far corners of the story. Other tenants placed open spaces at the west and east ends of the floor or in the center.

The Sky Club, a private luncheon club, had been on the 56th floor of the Pan Am Building. For several years the Sky Club had contained a private restaurant. Aircraft pioneer Juan Trippe, founder of Pan Am, was a member of this club. Trippe had commissioned a mural of clipper ships for the walls of the Sky Club; it was sent to Tucker&#x27;s Point resort in Bermuda after the club shuttered. On the 57th and 58th stories was the Copter Club, which was used by passengers of the short-lived helicopter service.

==History==
===Planning===
By the 1950s, passenger volumes at Grand Central Terminal had declined dramatically from the early 20th century, and there were proposals to demolish and replace the station. The New York Central Railroad was losing money, partially on paying taxes on the building&#x27;s air rights. New York Central wanted to sell the property or its air rights to allow the construction of a skyscraper above or on the terminal&#x27;s site. At the same time, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad retained a partial interest in the terminal&#x27;s operation.

==== Early plans ====

Initially, New York Central&#x27;s chairman Robert R. Young had been negotiating with developer Erwin S. Wolfson and their mutual friends Herbert and Stuart Scheftel to determine how the Grand Central site could be redeveloped. After these discussions broke down, two competing plans for the replacement of Grand Central Terminal were proposed in 1954. One design, by I. M. Pei, was suggested by Young along with developer William Zeckendorf. The proposal called for an 80-story, tower that would have succeeded the Empire State Building as the world&#x27;s tallest building. The other, by Fellheimer &amp; Wagner, was put forth by New Haven&#x27;s chairman Patrick B. McGinnis along with Wolfson. The plan envisioned a 55-story building, the largest office building in the world with . Both proposals were poorly received, with 235 architects cosigning a letter imploring Young and McGinnis to reject the plans. Neither plan was ultimately ever carried out.

Though the New Haven and New York Central continued to struggle financially, both railroads agreed to work with Wolfson, the New Haven&#x27;s developer. In February 1955, Wolfson, the Scheftels, and Alfred G. Burger proposed a 65-story tower called Grand Central City, which would replace a six-story baggage structure north of the terminal. Richard Roth of Emery Roth and Sons, who created the design, had agreed to participate only if the office building would not result in the passenger concourse&#x27;s demolition. The plans were widely circulated in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The proposal garnered significant opposition after architect Giorgio Cavaglieri expressed concerns about the effects of the proposed building on traffic congestion in the area.

Roth and Wolfson&#x27;s plan was effectively forgotten in March 1955 when Zeckendorf was named the partner for any new development in the vicinity of Grand Central. Zeckendorf and Pei modified the blueprints for their 80-story tower but never publicly announced the revised plans. Unpublished drawings indicate that Pei&#x27;s second design was supposed to be a hyperboloid-shaped tower. For various reasons, the hyperboloid tower never progressed past the planning stage. The building had faced extensive criticism from both professionals and the general public; the railroads faced significant financial shortfalls; and the economy as a whole had started to decline, leaving Zeckendorf unable to finance the project. Meanwhile, traffic around Grand Central Terminal worsened in the late 1950s.

==== Revival of plans ====
In January 1958, representatives of an unnamed large company, who were unaware of Grand Central City&#x27;s cancellation, notified Stuart Scheftel that they were interested in leasing space in the new building. Upon learning of the news, Young placed Scheftel in contact with his real estate agent. Although Young died by suicide shortly afterward, the remaining partners continued working on the project. A revised version of Roth&#x27;s plan was announced in May 1958. The plan called for a 50-story aluminum and glass tower parallel to Park Avenue, with of floor area; three theaters with a total capacity of 5,000; an open-air restaurant on the seventh floor; and a 2,000-spot parking garage. The New York Central and New Haven railroads were guaranteed at least $1 million a year from the agreement. Despite the presence of tracks under the building site, Wolfson said a survey of the site had &quot;no insurmountable problems&quot;. James Ruderman, the building&#x27;s structural engineer, had drawn up preliminary plans for a steel framework spanning the tracks. Wolfson hired James D. Landauer Associates Inc. to handle leasing at the proposed building, negotiating directly with tenants&#x27; brokers.

Wolfson found Roth&#x27;s revised plan to be unsatisfactorily modest for such a prominent site. He said in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that he wanted to &quot;avoid adding just another massive shape to an already developed midtown business community&quot;. In July 1958, architects Walter Gropius and Pietro Belluschi were announced as co-designers for Grand Central City. Wolfson expressed his hope that Gropius and Belluschi, both prominent architects in the Modern style, would be able to help devise an &quot;esthetic and functional design&quot;. Initially, Gropius and Belluschi were to serve a relatively minor advisory role. A week after being hired, Gropius suggested that the slab be oriented east–west, with a large plaza or courtyard in front of the tower, similar to the design of Lever House. Gropius also recommended that the building include a textured facade, rather than the metal-and-glass curtain walls commonly used by the Roth firm in its previous buildings. Gropius modified the plans in mid-1958; the facade would use simulated stone, the large plaza was dropped from the plans, and the tower was moved northward to 45th Street. That October, Wolfson traveled to Europe to study buildings and gain inspiration for the building&#x27;s design.

Gropius and the Roth firm continued to modify their design through early 1959. The revised final plans were announced in February 1959. While Wolfson had promised a &quot;modest&quot; redesign, the new plans were a radical change from Roth&#x27;s 1958 plan, calling for a 55-story octagonal tower parallel to 45th Street, with of space. The Roth firm said the octagonal massing could absorb &quot;different planes of light as on a diamond&quot;, while Gropius said the new alignment was easier for air conditioning. The octagonal building was smaller than the original plans, but Gropius&#x27;s team reasoned that a edifice would have been too large to rent out. The Roth firm expressed its concerns over the east–west orientation of the tower, since it would raise the cost of the superstructure by 50 percent compared to a slab oriented north–south. A model of the redesigned tower was exhibited publicly in November 1959.

=== Construction ===

==== Initial work ====
Five leases for a collective in Grand Central City were announced immediately after the final design was announced in February 1959. A contract for of structural steel was awarded to U.S. Steel&#x27;s American Bridge division that May; at the time, the contract was reportedly the most expensive ever awarded for an office building. Ruderman finalized his plans for the framework in September 1959. The next month British firm City Centre Properties invested $25 million and took a half interest in Grand Central City&#x27;s development, covering part of the project&#x27;s $100 million cost. It was the first British–American joint venture for a real estate development in the United States. Gordon I. Kyle, an appraiser who had calculated the valuations of more than two-thirds of Manhattan&#x27;s skyscrapers, concluded that the building would be worth twice as much as the Empire State Building. Wolfson and City Centre paid Kyle $50,000, which at the time was the highest single appraiser&#x27;s fee ever recorded.

The New York Central Railroad granted an 80-year lease for the air rights above the building, in exchange for a portion of the building&#x27;s gross revenue. This agreement added about $6 million to the construction cost. Final plans were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings on November 24, 1959. Construction on the structure officially started two days afterward on November 26, and Cushman &amp; Wakefield were named as leasing agents for Grand Central City the following month. This was followed by contracts for the building&#x27;s soundproofing and elevators in February 1960. James Ruderman had devised engineering plans for five other structures above the Park Avenue railroad tracks. As the Grand Central City site was impossible to excavate, the substructure had to be erected while the baggage building served as a staging area. Furthermore, as some materials would have to be delivered by railroad, material deliveries would be coordinated closely to avoid delays on the commuter rail lines entering Grand Central.

Construction of the substructure commenced in May 1960, during which the architects finalized plans for the entrances, lobbies, and facade lighting. Gropius was involved in all aspects of the building&#x27;s design, from traffic flow to minor architectural details, which sometimes led to conflicts with the project&#x27;s other architects and engineers. For example, he wanted the lobby&#x27;s bronze details to contain a matte finish, and he requested that the elevator penthouse be no higher than above the roof so that it did not &quot;look silly&quot;. Work on the tower itself was held up by a steel strike that lasted through much of 1960; the baggage handling building was ultimately demolished starting that June. Foundations for the building were sunk in August 1960.

==== Pan Am lease and completion ====
Pan Am founder Juan Trippe signed a 25-year, $115.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) lease for across 15 floors, plus a new main ticket office at 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, in September 1960. In an indication of the widespread interest surrounding this lease, the mayor and the governor of New York both congratulated Grand Central City&#x27;s builders after the lease was signed. Following this, Pan Am hired Ivan Chermayeff to design the building&#x27;s signage. Grand Central City officially became known as the Pan Am Building in December 1960, after its major lessee. Signs bearing the company&#x27;s name or logo were placed atop the four major facades. Originally, Trippe had wanted signs with the name &quot;Pan Am&quot; on all eight facades, but this was scaled down after Gropius objected that the large number of signs would decrease &quot;the dignity of the building&quot;. The Pan Am Building&#x27;s developers secured a $70 million mortgage loan and a $65 million construction loan during January 1961. At the time, the building was more than half rented.

The Pan Am Building&#x27;s construction involved over 200 engineers and 7,500 workers from 75 trades. Three derricks were installed to erect the steel for the tower, while four derricks were used for the base. Five to seven steel columns were installed every day during two shifts, with materials deliveries taking place mostly at night. The Pan Am Building&#x27;s structural steel topped out during May 1962. The facade cladding was installed in two ways. The facade of the base was bolted into place, down to the individual spandrels and mullions. The Mo-Sai panels for the tower were installed via an interior hoist. Wolfson, though recovering from surgery during mid-1962, continued to observe the building&#x27;s progress using a helicopter. When Wolfson died that June, James D. Landauer was selected to oversee the building&#x27;s completion. The lobby, the last part of the Pan Am Building to be completed, was built with cheap materials such as restroom tiles because the builders had run out of money toward the project&#x27;s completion.

=== Opening and Pan Am ownership ===

The as-yet-incomplete Pan Am Building was formally opened on March 7, 1963, with a ceremony attended by British and American officials, and tenants started moving into the structure the following month. The building had secured tenants for 91 percent of its office space upon opening, in large part to its central location. Within three months, the Pan Am Building was 92 percent rented and 70 percent occupied; by the first anniversary of its opening, the building was 97 percent leased with 241 tenants. This contrasted greatly with the smaller Empire State Building, which was only 25 percent rented when it opened and did not reach full occupancy for more than a decade afterward. At the time of its completion, the Pan Am Building was the largest commercial office development in the world by square footage, being surpassed nearly a decade later by 55 Water Street and the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. In the 15 years prior to the Pan Am Building&#x27;s opening, 147 office buildings had been completed in Manhattan, totaling of office space.

Initially, the airline only had a 10 percent ownership stake in its namesake building. Besides Pan Am, other early tenants included the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Alcoa, the Hammermill Paper Company, National Steel Corporation, Kodak, the Reader&#x27;s Digest Association, Mitsui, Chrysler, and the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation. The shops at the Pan Am Building&#x27;s base were opened in August 1963. The tenant selection process was rigorous, as Cushman and Wakefield examining the services and goods sold by potential tenants: for example, the firm&#x27;s vice president got haircuts from each of the six applicants for the lobby barbershop. Furthermore, average rents in the Pan Am Building were about , slightly higher than the average of in other Midtown Manhattan buildings.

Although the Pan Am Building&#x27;s completion averted the terminal&#x27;s imminent destruction, New York Central had experienced further decline, merging with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 to form the Penn Central Railroad. That year, Pan Am bought a 45 percent stake in the building from the estate of Jack Cotton, formerly chairman and co-owner of City Centre Properties. After Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970, it sought to sell its properties, including the land below the Pan Am Building. Among the building&#x27;s tenants during this time was the United Brands Company (now Chiquita Brands International), whose CEO, Eli M. Black, jumped from the 44th story to his death on February 3, 1975.

Pan Am was considering moving its headquarters from the building by 1978. That year, the airline bought the remaining 45 percent stake in the building from Wolfson, obtaining full ownership of the property. A Pan Am subsidiary, Grand Central Building Inc., acquired the underlying land for about $25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) the following year as part of a legal settlement with Penn Central. The airline sustained large financial losses during the early 1980s recession, leading it to announce in February 1980 that it was considering selling the building. About half the leases were scheduled to expire in three or four years. Many lessees were exempt from paying the building&#x27;s operating costs, which made the Pan Am Building only marginally profitable for the airline. Amid high fuel costs and a lack of income from airfare, Pan Am decided in April 1980 that it would definitely sell the building.

=== Sale to MetLife and renovations ===

When the Pan Am Building officially went on the market in May 1980, &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine predicted that it might be sold for as much as $200 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The sale was so complex that Landauer Associates published a 65-page brochure just to describe the terms of the sale. Nine bidders submitted offers, five of whom were selected for further consideration: the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), the Equitable Life Assurance Society; Donald Trump; Paul Milstein; and Olympia and York. In July 1980, Pan Am sold the building to MetLife for (equivalent to $ million in ). At the time, it was the highest-priced sale of an office building in Manhattan. This was attributed not only to a rezoning of the surrounding area, allowing developers to erect higher buildings there, but also to a strong office market. The sale price amounted to , more than any other office building in Manhattan. MetLife did not plan to move any offices to the building, and Pan Am planned to keep its headquarters there. As a condition of the sale, the building would retain Pan Am&#x27;s name until the airline ceased to be the building&#x27;s anchor tenant.

The sale was finalized in 1981 when Pan Am transferred stock in the building to MetLife, a move that let the airline avoid paying most of the estate transfer tax. Pan Am normally would have paid a $4 million tax, but it ultimately paid only $125. Cross &amp; Brown assumed the responsibility of leasing the building&#x27;s space. At the time, leases for much of the interior space were set to expire all at once during the early 1980s. Starting in 1984, MetLife renovated about half of the space as the original tenants&#x27; leases expired. The deteriorating lobby, used by 100,000 pedestrians a day, was extensively reconfigured by Warren Platner. In addition, some mechanical systems were upgraded to comply with building codes, and retail spaces were added. Asbestos fireproofing on the office stories was removed in advance of an anti-asbestos regulation passed by the city government in 1985. The lobby renovation had been completed by 1987 at a cost of $15 million.

By 1991, Pan Am&#x27;s presence had dwindled to four floors. MetLife preferred to refer to the building as 200 Park Avenue, its address. At the time, the Pan Am Building was 95 percent occupied, and the public variously referred to the building by the names of its large tenants, such as Mitsui, Dreyfus, and Rogers &amp; Wells. Pan Am moved its headquarters to Miami that year and closed down shortly afterward. In September 1992, MetLife announced that it would remove Pan Am signage from 200 Park Avenue and add letters bearing its own name. According to a MetLife spokesperson, the sign change was taking place because the airline had become defunct. The signs were changed in January 1993. Though 200 Park Avenue subsequently became known as the MetLife Building, its namesake was then headquartered in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. As a result, the Park Avenue structure was known specifically as the &quot;MetLife Building 200 Park Avenue&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
Further renovations to 200 Park Avenue&#x27;s exterior and lobby were undertaken during 2001 and 2002. Low-pressure compressed air was used to clean the facade, while Kohn Pedersen Fox renovated the lobby. In 2005, MetLife moved its board room from the Metropolitan Life Tower to 200 Park Avenue. The same year, the company considered selling 200 Park Avenue to pay for its acquisition of Travelers Life &amp; Annuity. Ultimately, MetLife sold the building that April for $1.72 billion, to a joint venture of Tishman Speyer Properties, the New York City Employees&#x27; Retirement System, and the New York City Teachers&#x27; Retirement System. At the time, the sale was the largest ever transaction involving an office building. The company still retained a boardroom and corporate suite at 200 Park Avenue.

MetLife announced in 2015 that it was consolidating its operations at 200 Park Avenue, with in its namesake building. At the time, Donald Bren, the billionaire owner of the real estate firm Irvine Company, held a 97.3 percent ownership stake in the building. While Tishman Speyer remained the managing partner of the property, its ownership stake had been reduced to less than 3 percent. Plans to renovate the lobby were devised in 2016. The next year, the neon light sources for the signs atop the building were swapped with LED light sources to conserve energy. A renovation of 200 Park Avenue&#x27;s lobby started in late 2018. The work included simplifying the lobby&#x27;s layout by removing storefronts and restoring direct connections to some of Grand Central&#x27;s platforms. Three restaurant owners leased space in the building in mid-2022, and MetLife extended its lease the next year.

CBRE took over as the building&#x27;s leasing manager in mid-2024. The building was 97 percent occupied by that October, at which point another restaurateur had leased space in the lobby. The Irvine Company refinanced the building in early 2025 with a $1.5 billion mortgage loan.

=== Contemporary commentary ===

When the octagonal design for 200 Park Avenue was first announced in 1959, it was controversial. Architectural historian Sibyl Moholy-Nagy wrote in &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; magazine that the original tower plans &quot;provided human scale and architectural personality&quot;, which were &quot;lost&quot; in the revision. Walter McQuade, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, found even the drawings for the building to be dissatisfying. Grand Central City was lambasted internationally by Italian critic Gillo Dorfles and Romanian architect Martin Pinchis. Architect Victor Gruen questioned the parking garage&#x27;s necessity given the site&#x27;s proximity to a major railroad terminal, while &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; editor Thomas H. Creighton suggested the space would be better left as an open plaza. Critics also expressed concerns that the building would burden existing transit infrastructure. The plan also had its defenders, such as Natalie Parry, who wrote in rebuttal to Moholy-Nagy that the plans preserved Grand Central&#x27;s &quot;star-studded&quot; Main Concourse, &quot;together with the precious air space above it&quot;. Historian Paul Zucker defended the building&#x27;s urbanism, and urban planner Charles Abrams and &quot;Architectural Record&quot; editor Emerson Goble also defended the plan as an addition to the cityscape.

Upon its completion, the Pan Am Building received largely negative feedback, in large part because of its central location. Most critics deprecated the building&#x27;s bulk, which was exacerbated by the design of the facade and its horizontal alignment. Gropius said the 1916 Zoning Resolution justified the building&#x27;s large size, telling television presenter Dave Garroway that &quot;every citizen has the right to use the law as far as he can&quot;; this only prompted further negative reviews. James T. Burns Jr. wrote in &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; that the placement of the base, tower, parking garage, and Grand Central Terminal were &quot;occasionally inexcusably jarring&quot; and considered the lobby to be a continuation of the exterior&#x27;s &quot;monolithism&quot;. Ada Louise Huxtable called the building &quot;a colossal collection of minimums&quot;, with the lobby artwork being a &quot;face-saving gimmick&quot;. Many observers viewed the monolithic design as obstructing vistas down Park Avenue. Art historian Vincent Scully, speaking in 1961, expressed his belief that the Pan Am Building was a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to Park Avenue&#x27;s continuity, while Claes Oldenburg mocked the building&#x27;s positioning on Park Avenue with his 1965 artwork &quot;Proposed Colossal Monument for Park Avenue, NYC: Good Humor Bar.&quot; The building&#x27;s own engineers had not expected any praise for the building, which had been developed solely for the purpose of making money.

Goble, a close friend of Gropius and Belluschi, defended the building in a 1960 &quot;New York Times&quot; article in which he praised the pedestrian passageways in and around the building. Goble was one of the few people speaking in favor of the Pan Am Building in its early years, and he wrote another article praising the building in 1962. Gropius himself wrote a speech in which he praised the building but provided few specific details. This speech was published in the June 1960 version of &quot;Architectural Record&quot; with no modifications. Gropius had asked Paul Zucker of the New School to write an article that responded to criticism of the building on &quot;an objective and professional level&quot;, although there is no evidence that Zucker ended up writing such an article.

=== Retrospective commentary ===
The Pan Am Building was also highly criticized after its 1980s lobby renovation. Carter Wiseman compared the new decorations as being gaudy in a similar manner to performer Liberace, except that &quot;even Liberace would have blushed at the vulgarity&quot;. Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that even though the previous design was &quot;stark and unwelcoming&quot;, the new decorations created &quot;a space that is so forced in its joy, so false and so disingenuous, that they make one yearn for some good old-fashioned coldness&quot;. In 1987, &quot;New York&quot; magazine conducted a poll of &quot;more than 100 prominent New Yorkers&quot;, asking which buildings they preferred to see demolished, and the Pan Am Building ranked at the top of that list. Architect Robert A. M. Stern said in 1988 that the building, a &quot;wrong-headed dream badly realized&quot;, warranted preservation from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, although he rhetorically suggested tearing down the building when the Pan Am sign was replaced several years later.

By the beginning of the 21st century, some onetime critics expressed ambivalence toward the building&#x27;s presence, while preservationists advocated the protection of mid-20th century buildings such as the MetLife Building. &quot;ArchDaily&quot; magazine described it in 2016 as &quot;commendable for its robust form and excellent public spaces, as well as its excellent integration into the elevated arterial roads around it&quot;. Furthermore, the building&#x27;s reputation and presence made it the setting of several films and TV shows during its history.

<doc id="359513" wikidata="Q2468773" url="?curid=359513" title="Visions of Cody">
<text>Visions of Cody is an experimental novel by Jack Kerouac. It was written in 1951–1952, and though not published in its entirety until 1972, it had by then achieved an underground reputation. Since its first printing, &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; has been published with an introduction by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg titled &quot;The Visions of the Great Rememberer.&quot;

==Origins==
&quot;Visions of Cody&quot; is derived from experimental spontaneous prose inserts that Kerouac added to the original manuscript of &quot;On the Road&quot; in 1951–52. Part of the novel is a fast-forward recapitulation of the events described in &quot;On the Road&quot;, which was also about Kerouac and Neal Cassady. When Kerouac appeared on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1959, he secretly read from the introduction to the then-unpublished &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; although he was supposedly reading from &quot;On The Road&quot;, the book he was holding.

Excerpts from the novel were published by New Directions in 1959 as a 120 page, signed limited-edition of 750 copies, the entire novel being &#x27;considered unpublishable&#x27; at the time.

==Book structure==
The first section of the book is essentially a collection of short stream-of-consciousness essays, which Kerouac called &quot;sketches&quot;, many simply describing elements of Duluoz&#x27;s (Kerouac&#x27;s) post-World War II New York City environment, from the texture and smells of a lunch counter to St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, or minor events like the decision to masturbate in a public restroom—all interlaced with Kerouac&#x27;s internal dialogue. Along the way through these descriptions, Duluoz meanders towards a decision to go visit Cody in San Francisco.

The second section consists mainly of the transcription of taped conversations between Kerouac and Cassady (and occasionally &quot;Evelyn&quot;—Cassady&#x27;s last wife, Carolyn and various friends) that extended over five nights as they drank and smoked marijuana. This is followed by a brief section entitled &quot;Imitation of the Tape,&quot; a writing experiment by Kerouac in which he attempted to work from the spontaneity and speech patterns of the tape. The remainder of the book contains Kerouac&#x27;s recounting of his travels with Cassady and the effect they had on their spiraling relationship.

==Character key==
Kerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.

==Themes and literary style==

The novel is heavily focused on his perception of and relationship to Neal Cassady, renamed &quot;Cody Pomeray.&quot; According to Kerouac, the book represented a vertical metaphysical study of Cassady as a character and its relationship to the general America. Continuing to experiment with the spontaneous prose method he had outlined in 1950, he aimed to find &quot;the wild form that can grow with my wild heart&quot;. The tape recorder transcriptions injects the presence of speech into the text. The style has been described as New Journalism fifteen years early. There are several meta passages in the book in which Kerouac in the words of Allen Ginsberg &quot;writes about writing&quot;, at one point in French. Donald Allen states that the book seems self-consciously unfinished in order to convey &#x27;an undisturbed flow from the mind of personal secret idea words&#x27;.

<doc id="359519" wikidata="Q2722826" url="?curid=359519" title="Pascual Orozco">
<text>Pascual Orozco Vázquez, Jr. (in contemporary documents, sometimes spelled &quot;Oroszco&quot;) (28 January 1882 – 30 August 1915) was a Mexican revolutionary leader who rose up to support Francisco I. Madero in late 1910 to depose long-time president Porfirio Díaz (whose eponymous era lasted from 1876 to 1911). Orozco was a natural military leader whose victory over the Federal Army at Ciudad Juárez was a key factor in forcing Díaz to resign in May 1911. Following Díaz&#x27;s resignation and the democratic election of Madero in November 1911, Orozco served Madero as leader of the state militia in Chihuahua, a paltry reward for his service in the Mexican Revolution. Orozco revolted against the Madero government 16 months later, issuing the Plan Orozquista in March 1912. It was a serious revolt which the Federal Army struggled to suppress. When Victoriano Huerta led a coup d&#x27;état against Madero in February 1913 during which Madero was murdered, Orozco joined the Huerta regime. Orozco&#x27;s revolt against Madero somewhat tarnished his revolutionary reputation, but his subsequent support of Huerta compounded the repugnance against him.

==Early life==
Orozco was born to a middle-class family on Santa Inés hacienda near San Isidro, Guerrero, in the state of Chihuahua. His father was Pascual Orozco Sr. His mother was Amada Orozco y Vázquez (1852–1948); the Vázquez family were second-generation Basque immigrants. The family was not rich, but had standing locally, where his father ran a village store and was a minor office holder. Pascual Jr. was educated in the local public school and began working as a muleteer, a hands-on job that was a vital link in transporting goods in northern Mexico and as a revolutionary gave him intimate knowledge of the terrain. Orozco, like fellow northern revolutionary Pancho Villa, worked a stint with foreign owned mining companies.
==Becoming a revolutionary==
In the mountainous region of Chihuahua, &quot;the outstanding leader in 1910-11 was Pascual Orozco, a tall, powerful, taciturn young man.&quot; He quickly rose to prominence once he had been recruited by Abraham González to the cause of Francisco I. Madero. Orozco was not so much a hard-line opponent of Porfirio Díaz, but rather the local strong man Joaquín Chávez, a client of the major power holder in Chihuahua, the Creel-Terrazas Family. One of his first actions after an early battle was to ransack Chávez&#x27;s house.

On 31 October of that year, Orozco was placed in command of the revolutionary forces in Guerrero municipality. He led his forces to a series of victories against Díaz loyalists, and by the end of the year most of the state was in the hands of the revolutionaries. At this point, Orozco was a hero in Chihuahua, with over 30,000 people lining the streets upon his return. Madero promoted him to colonel, and in March 1911 to brigadier general. These promotions were earned without any kind of military knowledge or military training. 

On 31 October 1910 he was named &quot;jefe revolucionario&quot; (revolutionary leader) of the Porfirio Díaz Anti Re-election Club in Guerrero District. A week after the beginning of the war, he obtained his first victory, against General Juan Navarro. After ambushing the federal troops in Cañón del Mal Paso on 2 January 1911, he ordered the dead soldiers stripped and sent the uniforms to Presidente Díaz with a note that read, &quot;Ahí te van las hojas, mándame más tamales&quot;. (&quot;Here are the wrappers, send me more tamales.&quot;)

On 10 May 1911 Orozco and colonel Pancho Villa seized Ciudad Juárez, against Madero&#x27;s orders. For revolutionaries who had fought for the overthrow of Díaz, the victory at Ciudad Juárez that forced Díaz to resign the presidency was sweet. However, dismaying the revolutionaries who had defeated the Federal Army, Madero entered into negotiations with the Díaz regime for a transfer of power that dismayed revolutionary fighters. The Treaty of Ciudad Juárez stipulated the resignations of Díaz and his vice president, allowing them to go into exile; the establishment of an Interim Presidency under Francisco León de la Barra, a diplomat and lawyer who was not part of the Díaz inner circle. Most galling was that the treaty kept the Federal Army intact and called for the demobilization of the revolutionary forces that brought success to Madero&#x27;s side.

With the settlement brokered by Madero with the Díaz regime, Orozco turned to business interests, involved in mining, retail commerce, and transport.

==Break with Madero==
After Díaz&#x27;s fall, Orozco became resentful at Madero&#x27;s failure to name him to the cabinet or to a state governorship. Orozco was particularly upset with Madero&#x27;s failure to implement a series of social reforms that he had promised at the beginning of the revolution. Orozco believed that Madero was very similar to Díaz, whom he had helped to overthrow. Orozco was then offered the governorship of Chihuahua, which he refused, and Madero finally accepted his resignation from the federal government.

When Díaz presented his resignation, Orozco was named to a relatively junior position, commander of the federal rural police &quot;(Los Rurales)&quot; in Chihuahua. In June 1911, Orozco decided to run for governor of Chihuahua for the Club Independiente Chihuahuense, an organization opposed to Francisco I. Madero. After receiving many admonitions by the revolutionary hierarchy, Orozco was compelled to resign his candidacy on 15 July 1911. Subsequently, he refused a request to command the troops fighting Emiliano Zapata in the south.

On 3 March 1912, he announced his intention to revolt against the government of President Madero. Orozco financed his rebellion with his own assets and with confiscated livestock, which he sold in the neighboring U.S. state of Texas, and where he bought weapons and ammunition even after an embargo proclaimed by U.S. president William Taft in March 1912.

==Revolt against Madero==

On 3 March 1912 Orozco decreed a formal revolt against Madero&#x27;s government. Orozco&#x27;s forces, known as the Orozquistas and Colorados (&quot;Red Flaggers&quot;), defeated the Federal Army under General José González Salas. Seeing the potential danger that Orozco posed to his regime, Madero sent General Victoriano Huerta out of retirement to stop Orozco&#x27;s rebellion. Huerta&#x27;s troops defeated the &quot;orozquistas&quot; in Conejos, Rellano and Bachimba finally seizing Ciudad Juárez.

After being wounded in Ojinaga, Orozco was forced to flee to the United States. After living for some months in Los Angeles, with his first cousin, Teodora Vázquez Molinar González (1879–1956) and husband, Carlos Díaz-Ferrales González (1878–1953) he was able to return to Chihuahua but extremely ill, affected with periodic rheumatism seizures.

After Huerta installed himself as President of Mexico in early 1913, Orozco agreed to support him if Huerta agreed to some reforms (such as payment of hacienda workers in hard money rather than company store scrip). Huerta agreed. Orozco led campaigns against the Constitutionalist Army that sought to oust Huerta in northern Mexico. Orozco&#x27;s successes had brought promotions. As Commanding General of all Mexican Federal forces, he led attacks against the revolutionaries, including Pancho Villa and he rose to the rank of division general. Orozco defeated the Constitutionalist Army at Ciudad Camargo, Mapula, Santa Rosalía, Zacatecas, and Torreón. With his successes against that revolutionary force came their vitriol against him as a betrayer.

After Huerta&#x27;s fall Orozco announced his refusal to recognize the government of the new president, Francisco S. Carvajal whom he viewed to be similar to Madero. After briefly leading a revolt financed with his own money where he took in Guanajuato where he won several successive engagements against the Constitutionalists, he was forced to retreat because he lacked sufficient manpower to hold the ground he won. He was again forced into exile and was named &quot;Supreme Military Commander.&quot;

== Orozco and Huerta ==

After General Huerta&#x27;s barracks coup (Ten Tragic Days), Orozco, upon learning of the murders of Madero and Pino Suárez, met with his representatives. As of March 7, 1913, the Orozquista troops were incorporated into the irregular militia.

==Government in exile==
In efforts to overthrow Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s government, Orozco and Huerta traveled throughout the United States, with the support of fellow exiles Gen. Marcelo Caraveo, Francisco Del Toro, Emilio Campa, and Gen. José Inez Salazar in Texas. Orozco traveled to San Antonio, St. Louis and New York. Eventually Enrique Creel and Huerta were able to strike a deal with the German government for the sale of $895,000.00 in weapons.

==House arrest in the United States==
In New York, Orozco and Huerta finalized plans to retake Mexico. En route to El Paso by train on 27 June 1915 the two were arrested in Newman, Texas, and charged with conspiracy to violate U.S. neutrality laws. He was placed under house arrest in his family&#x27;s home at 1315 Wyoming Avenue El Paso, Texas, but managed to escape.

==Orozco&#x27;s Last Ride==
Orozco successfully executed a planned escape to Sierra Blanca where he met up with leaders and future cabinet members (General José Delgado, Christoforo Caballero, Miguel Terrazas and Andreas Sandoval). The official U.S. report stated that Orozco and his men had crossed by Dick Love&#x27;s ranch and had coerced the cook to prepare him a meal and attend his horses, while Orozco and his men got ready to steal Love&#x27;s cattle. When the owner arrived, they fled on the rancher&#x27;s horses. The facts of this are often disputed because in other accounts it is believed that the horses belonged to Orozco and Love set up Orozco to seek revenge for an earlier dispute. Love used his accusations to persuade 26 members from the 13th Cavalry Regiment, 8 local deputies and 13 Texas Rangers to pursue the mysterious horse thieves whom he purposefully fails to mention by name to ensure their participation. The posse in pursuit converged at Stephan&#x27;s tank just west of High Lonesome in the Van Horn Mountains
 Orozco, and his four men (Delgado, Caballero, Terrazas and Sandoval) were camped in a box canyon above Stephan&#x27;s Tank where law enforcement caught and killed them. A Mexican version asserts that Orozco was murdered trying to resist the theft of his own horses by Love and his men. On 7 October a local hearing against the 40-plus Americans involved was initiated, but the court found the people involved innocent of all charges.

==Personal life==
Pascual Jr. married Refugia Frías and dedicated his youth to the transport of precious metals between the mining firms of the state. He was also the uncle of Maximiano Márquez Orozco, who participated in the Mexican Revolution as a colonel in the Villista Army. In the first years of the 20th century he was attracted by the ideas of the Flores Magón brothers and, in 1909 he started importing weaponry from the United States in the face of the imminent outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.

On 3 September 1915 Orozco&#x27;s remains were placed in space 13 of the Masonic Holding Vault at Concordia Cemetery in El Paso, Texas, at the decision of his wife, dressed in a full Mexican general&#x27;s uniform, with the Mexican flag draping his coffin, in front of three thousand followers and admirers. In 1925, his remains were returned to his home state of Chihuahua and interred in the &quot;Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres&quot; (Rotunda of Illustrious Persons), Panteón de Dolores, in Chihuahua.

==In popular culture==

<text>Joan Jett (born Joan Marie Larkin; September 22, 1958) is an American rock singer, guitarist, songwriter, and actress. Often referred to as the &quot;Godmother of Punk&quot; and the &quot;Queen of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, she is regarded as a rock icon and an influential figure in popular rock music.

Jett co-founded and performed with the Runaways from 1975 to 1979, with whom she released four albums. After their dissolution, she formed the independent record label Blackheart Records with producer Kenny Laguna. She founded Joan Jett and the Blackhearts as her backup band in 1979; during this time, she released her solo debut album. With the Blackhearts, Jett has released twelve albums, three of which have been certified platinum or gold. Additionally, eleven of their singles have appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Jett was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 2003 and 2023 lists of the greatest guitarists of all time. In 2015, she and the Blackhearts were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Outside of music, she headlined the film &quot;Light of Day&quot; in 1987 and has appeared in several television series. She is also recognized for her activism.

== Early life ==
Joan Marie Larkin was born on September 22, 1958, at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, to James and Dorothy Larkin. She is the oldest of three children. Her father was an insurance salesman and her mother was a secretary. Her family was Protestant, attending church and Sunday school, but were not strict in their religious beliefs.

In 1967, Jett&#x27;s family moved to Rockville, Maryland, where she attended Randolph Junior High School and Wheaton High School. She got her first guitar at the age of 13. She took some guitar lessons, but soon quit because the instructor kept trying to teach her folk songs. Her family then moved to West Covina, California, in Los Angeles County, providing Jett with the opportunity to pursue her musical interests. Shortly after the move, her parents divorced and she changed her name to Joan Jett, because she thought it had more of a rock star sound than her birth name. She has admitted in recent years that &quot;Jett&quot; was not actually her mother&#x27;s maiden name, even though that is what she used to tell people. In Los Angeles, Jett&#x27;s favorite night spot was Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s English Disco, a venue that provided the glam rock style she loved.

== Career ==

=== 1970s ===

At age 16, Jett became a founding member of the Runaways with drummer Sandy West. After the brief tenure of Micki Steele, who sang and played bass, Jackie Fox, Lita Ford, and Cherie Currie soon joined to complete the band which created the classic lineup. While Currie initially fronted the band, Jett shared some lead vocals, played rhythm guitar, and wrote or co-wrote some of the band&#x27;s material along with Ford, West, and Currie. This lineup recorded three albums.
The band toured around the world and became an opening act for Cheap Trick, Ramones, Van Halen, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. They found success abroad, especially in Japan. While the Runaways were popular in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and South America, they could not garner the same level of success in the United States. After Currie left the band, the band released two more albums with Jett handling the lead vocals: &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Night&quot; and &quot;And Now... The Runaways&quot;. While touring England with the Runaways in 1976, Jett first heard the song &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; when she saw Arrows perform it on their weekly UK television series &quot;Arrows&quot;. Altogether, they produced five albums from 1975 until they disbanded in the spring of 1979.

In 1979, she returned to Los Angeles, where she began fulfilling an obligation of the Runaways to complete a film that was loosely based on the band&#x27;s career entitled &quot;We&#x27;re All Crazee Now!&quot; Three actresses stood in for the departed band members, including Rainbeaux Smith, who was also a rock drummer. The plug was pulled on the project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film. Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called &quot;Du-beat-eo&quot;, which was produced by Alan Sacks, but not commercially released.

In 1979, Jett was in England pursuing a solo career. She recorded three songs there with the Sex Pistols&#x27; Paul Cook and Steve Jones, one of which was an early version of Arrows&#x27; &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. This version appears on the 1993 compilation album &quot;Flashback&quot;. While working on &quot;We&#x27;re All Crazee Now!&quot;, Jett met songwriter and producer Kenny Laguna, who was hired by her manager Toby Mamis to help Jett with writing some tracks for the film. They became friends and decided to work together and Jett relocated to Long Beach, New York, where Laguna was based.

Soon after, Jett produced the Germs&#x27; only album, &quot;(GI)&quot;. Jett produced several bands prior to releasing her debut, and her label Blackheart Records released recordings from varied artists such as thrash metal band Metal Church and rapper Big Daddy Kane.

=== 1980s ===
Jett and Laguna entered the Who&#x27;s Ramport Studios with the latter at the helm, and Jett&#x27;s self-titled solo debut was released by Ariola Records in Europe on May 17, 1980. In the US, after the album was rejected by 23 major labels, Jett and Laguna released it independently on their new Blackheart Records label, which they started with Laguna&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s college savings. Laguna remembers, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t think of anything else to do but print up records ourselves.&quot; With Laguna&#x27;s assistance, Jett formed the Blackhearts. It has undergone many lineup changes since its inception, with Jett and Laguna being its only consistent members.

Jett&#x27;s first appearance on film is in the 1981 live concert film &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;, performing &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; with the Blackhearts at the Ritz in New York City. A spring 1981 concert at the Palladium in New York City proved to be a turning point. Described by music journalists as a career-defining performance by Jett, it helped solidify a strong New York City following for Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. After a year of touring and recording, the Blackhearts recorded a new album entitled &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; for the label. Ambel was replaced by local guitarist Ricky Byrd during the recording. Byrd recalled in an interview with Guitarhoo!, &quot;One day I went to a studio to jam around a bit with Jett and everything clicked&quot;. The first single from the album was the title track, &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, which in the first half of 1982 was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for seven weeks in a row. It is &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 56 song of all time and has also been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016.

Jett released &quot;Album&quot; (1983) and &quot;Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth&quot; (1984). A string of Top 40 hits followed, as well as sellout tours with the Police, Queen, and Aerosmith, among others. She was among the first English-speaking rock acts to appear in Panama and the Dominican Republic. According to Jett and Laguna, a riot occurred during their visit to Panama and Manuel Noriega requested Jett spend the night with him at the Presidential Palace.

Jett next beat out a number of contenders to star in the movie &quot;Light of Day&quot; (1987) alongside Michael J. Fox as siblings who perform in a rock band. It was originally written by director Paul Schrader with Bruce Springsteen in mind; although Springsteen declined the role, he wrote the song &quot;Light of Day&quot; for the film. While the film received mixed reviews, Jett&#x27;s performance was critically acclaimed. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; believed she matched her acting to co-star Gena Rowlands, calling it &quot;the most surprisingly good performance.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Miss Jett is good too, snapping her way angrily through confrontational scenes and musical ones alike, and taking a sentimental turn just when the story does.&quot;

The next year, her next album, &quot;Up Your Alley&quot; (1988), went multi-platinum. This album contains the single &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and had been used as the theme song for Sunday Night Football NFL games in America (with altered lyrics, by two singers) during the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Jett co-wrote the song &quot;House of Fire&quot;, which appeared on Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Trash&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
Jett&#x27;s next album was &quot;The Hit List&quot;, which was an album consisting of cover songs. In 1990, the Blackhearts had a song on &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Long Live the Night&quot;, written by Jett with Randy Cantor and Michael Caruso. Her 1991 release, &quot;Notorious&quot;, which featured the Replacements&#x27; Paul Westerberg and former Billy Idol bass player Phil Feit, was the last with Sony/CBS, as Jett switched to Warner Bros. In 1993, Jett and Laguna released &quot;Flashback&quot;, a compilation of various songs on their own Blackheart Records. In 1994, the Blackhearts released the well-received &quot;Pure and Simple&quot;, which featured tracks written with Babes in Toyland&#x27;s Kat Bjelland, L7&#x27;s Donita Sparks and Bikini Kill&#x27;s Kathleen Hanna.

Jett returned to producing for the band Circus Lupus in 1992 and again, in 1994, for Bikini Kill. This recording was the &quot;New Radio +2&quot; vinyl 7-inch EP for which she also played and sang back-up vocals. A CD single of &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot; featuring Jett and Westerberg was also released during this time, and appeared in the song credits for the movie &quot;Tank Girl&quot;.

In 1997, Jett was featured on the &quot;We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute&quot; album. She performed a cover of the Johnny O&#x27;Keefe song &quot;Wild One&quot; (or &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;). Jett is a guest artist on Marky Ramone and the Intruders&#x27; 1999 album &quot;The Answer to Your Problems?&quot; on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;. She is a guest vocalist on Peaches&#x27; album &quot;Impeach My Bush&quot; on the tracks &quot;Boys Wanna Be Her&quot; and &quot;You Love It&quot;.

She has appeared in the 1990s independent films &quot;The Sweet Life&quot; and &quot;Boogie Boy&quot;. In 1992, she was a guest star in , a first-season episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. In 1997, she appeared on the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;, in the episode &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah&quot;, performing the title song.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Jett appeared in the Broadway production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in the role of Columbia. That same year, Jett appeared on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; as an ex-CIA agent turned assassin hired to kill Walker and Alex. In 2002, Jett appeared in the film &quot;By Hook or by Crook&quot; in the role of News Interviewee. From 2000 to 2003, Jett hosted a showcase of new film and video shorts, &quot;Independent Eye&quot;, for Maryland Public Television.

In 2004, Jett and Laguna produced the album &quot;No Apologies&quot; by the pop punk band the Eyeliners, after signing them. Jett also guested on the track &quot;Destroy&quot; and made a cameo appearance in its music video. Also in 2004, Jett narrated a short film, &quot;Godly Boyish&quot;, about two teenagers who share suicidal fantasies.

In 2005, Jett and Laguna signed punk rockers the Vacancies and produced their second album, &quot;A Beat Missing or a Silence Added&quot; (reaching the top 20 in CMJ Music Charts), and their third album in 2007, &quot;Tantrum&quot;. That same year, she was recruited by Steven Van Zandt to host her own radio show on Van Zandt&#x27;s &quot;Underground Garage&quot; radio channel on Sirius Satellite Radio. She hosted a four-hour show titled &quot;Joan Jett&#x27;s Radio Revolution&quot;, broadcast every Saturday and Sunday. The program moved from Sirius 25 (&quot;Underground Garage&quot;) to Sirius 28 shortly before being canceled in June 2008. Also in 2005, Jett and Laguna celebrated the 25th anniversary of Blackheart Records with a sellout show at Manhattan&#x27;s Webster Hall.

In June 2006, Jett released her album &quot;Sinner&quot;, on Blackheart Records. To support the album, the band appeared on the 2006 Warped Tour and on a fall 2006 tour with Eagles of Death Metal. Various other bands such as Antigone Rising, Valient Thorr, the Vacancies, Throw Rag and Riverboat Gamblers were to have joined the tour for a handful of dates each. Jett sang a duet with Chase Noles on &quot;Tearstained Letters&quot;, a song on the Heart Attacks&#x27; 2006 album, &quot;Hellbound and Heartless&quot;.

In 2008, Jett made a cameo appearance in Darren Lynn Bousman&#x27;s rock opera/file &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; as the guitarist in Shilo&#x27;s room during the piece &quot;Seventeen&quot;.

Jett was an executive producer for the film &quot;The Runaways&quot;, which chronicled the Runaways&#x27; career. It was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi, who has directed videos for Marilyn Manson, the White Stripes and David Bowie. Production of the movie began filming around &quot;Twilight&quot;&#x27;s Kristen Stewart&#x27;s filming schedule, (i.e. of the sequels &quot;New Moon&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot;). Stewart played Jett in the film. In order to prepare for the role, Stewart met Jett around January 2009. In an interview, Stewart revealed that she hoped to be able to sing some songs in the film. The film explores the relationship between Jett and Runaways&#x27; lead singer, Cherie Currie, played by Dakota Fanning, and premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2010. Joan Jett and the Blackhearts appeared at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, at Harry-O&#x27;s, to promote the film.

The books were released in November 2021.

== Other ventures ==

=== Activism and philanthropy ===

Jett has long supported animal rights activism and organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). For Valentine&#x27;s Day 2022, PETA created a (Black)Heart-Shaped Pizza as a limited-time collaboration with a Los Angeles pizza shop, PIZZANISTA!

Jett worked with members of the punk rock band the Gits, whose lead singer and lyricist, Mia Zapata, had been raped and murdered in 1993. The results of their collaboration was a live album, &quot;Evil Stig&quot; and a single, &quot;Bob&quot;, whose earnings were contributed to the investigation of Zapata&#x27;s murder. To this end, the band and Jett appeared on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, appealing to the public for information. The case was solved in 2004, when Zapata&#x27;s murderer, Jesus Mezquia, was brought to trial and convicted.

At an October 2001 9/11 benefit in Red Bank, New Jersey, Jett and Springsteen appeared together on stage for the first time and played &quot;Light of Day&quot;.

Jett is a sports fan and has remained actively involved in the sports world. &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; was used by Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey as her walkout song at the pay-per-view event UFC 157 and is her current theme music in WWE. In April 2019, Jett performed &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; at WWE&#x27;s WrestleMania 35 as Rousey was making her entrance.

Jett&#x27;s cover of &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; (the theme song of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;) was used by the NCAA to promote the Women&#x27;s Final Four, as well as the song &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, which was never commercially released. &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; gained substantial radio play and became the number one requested song without a supporting album. Jett supplied theme songs for the ESPN X Games premiere and has contributed music to all their games since. At Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s request she sang the U.S. national anthem at the Baltimore Orioles game in which he tied Lou Gehrig&#x27;s record for consecutive games played. She also sang the national anthem at the final game played at Memorial Stadium. From 2006 to 2015, the melody for her song &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot; was used as the theme music for &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; with re-worked lyrics and retitled &quot;Waiting All Day for Sunday Night&quot;. Beginning with the 2019 season, Jett performs the song with Carrie Underwood in the opener of Sunday Night Football games.

Though Jett supported Howard Dean in the 2004 election because of his opposition to the Iraq War, she has been a consistent supporter of the United States Armed Forces throughout her career and has toured for the United Service Organizations for over 20 years, and even performed at the United States Military Academy. She often explains that while she doesn&#x27;t like war, she loves the military.

In June 2016, as a response to the Pulse nightclub shooting which left 49 dead, Jett was the first to sign &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Open Letter on Gun Violence demanding that Congress enact gun control legislation, specifically universal background checks. Jett was followed by Lady Gaga and nearly 200 other musicians and music industry executives in their petition.

In 2024, Jett contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

=== Products and endorsements ===
In 2008, Gibson released the &quot;Joan Jett Signature Melody Maker&quot;. It differs from Jett&#x27;s model by having a single burstbucker 3 humbucking pickup, an ebony fretboard and a double-cutaway body in white with a black vinyl pickguard. It also features a kill switch in place of a pickup selector. It retails for $839. There is a &quot;Blackheart&quot; version of this guitar introduced in 2010. All specs are the same, but it is finished in black, with red and pearl heart inlays.

On November 19, 2009, Mattel released a Joan Jett Barbie doll. Her name and likeness were used with her permission.

In June 2019, Gibson announced and released a third signature guitar for Jett, which is a wine-colored ES-339. The guitar was released after two years of research and development with Jett.

== Artistry ==
Jett has a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Her signature guitar is a white Gibson Melody Maker, which she has played on all her hits since 1977. Jett bought her first Melody Maker from Eric Carmen, following the breakup of the Raspberries. In regard to her white Melody Maker, the singer once stated: &quot;In The Runaways I was using a blond Les Paul. It&#x27;s beautiful, and I still have it, but it&#x27;s heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our road crew that Eric Carmen from the Raspberries was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on &quot;Go All the Way&quot; and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, &quot;Do You Want to Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It&#x27;s so beautiful. It&#x27;s white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It&#x27;s an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don&#x27;t even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I&#x27;m actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It&#x27;s got a great heritage. It&#x27;s a guitar full of hits.&quot;

== Legacy and impact ==

The press touted Jett as the &quot;Godmother of Punk&quot; and the &quot;Original Riot Grrrl&quot;. Jett has also been described as the Queen of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll. The Riot Grrrl movement started in the early 1990s, and many of its participants credited Jett as a role model and inspiration.

In 1983, musical satirist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic released a parody of &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; entitled &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;, changing the singer&#x27;s passion for rock music with that for ice cream. In 1984 the comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot; included a character named Tess Turbo, with a backing band called the Blackheads. Jett enjoyed the joking sendup, saying &quot;I actually bought the original artwork of that, and it&#x27;s hanging in my office... I was honored he chose me to satirize.&quot; Her name appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song &quot;Hot Topic&quot;, released in 1999. The 1999 series &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; used the song &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; as the opening theme. In 2019 British blogger LadBaby released a parody of &quot;I love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, changing the singer&#x27;s passion for rock music with that for sausage rolls. &quot;I love Sausage Rolls&quot; became the Christmas No.1 in the UK.

In 2010, &quot;The Runaways&quot;, a movie about her previous band, was released, starring Kristen Stewart as Jett and Dakota Fanning as Currie. Jett was later the subject of a documentary, &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, which was released in theaters and streaming on September 28, 2018.

Gibson manufactured a signature model of her Melody Maker, a white double cutaway with a zebra humbucker and &quot;kill&quot; toggle switch.

Jett&#x27;s honors include being inducted in the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006), appearing on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 100 greatest guitarists of all-time list in 2003 and 2023, and being named West Hollywood&#x27;s Rock Legend in 2013. She also received the Nanci Alexander Activist Award for her work on behalf of animal welfare. In April 2014, Jett was the first woman to win the Golden God Award. Former bandmates Cherie Currie and Lita Ford supported her. On April 24, 2014, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine held its first-ever Alternative Press Music Awards, and Jett received the AP Icon Award. In 2015, she and the Blackhearts were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Jett has been a vegetarian since the late 1980s and supports animal rights.

For years Jett refused to either confirm or deny rumors that she is lesbian or bisexual. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Out&quot; magazine she said, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying no, I&#x27;m not saying yes, I&#x27;m saying believe what you want. Assume away—go ahead.&quot; In 2006, she responded to an interviewer who had asked her when she had &quot;come out&quot; as a lesbian by saying, &quot;I never made any kind of statement about my personal life on any level. I never made any proclamations. So I don&#x27;t know where people are getting that from.&quot;

In 2016, former Runaways guitarist Lita Ford revealed in her memoir that she temporarily quit the band because the other members were &quot;all gay,&quot; saying &quot;First I found out that Sandy, the one I had bonded with the most, was a lesbian. Then I found out that Cherie was messing around with Joan. I was so freaked out that I quit the band. When I found out that the girls were all gay in the band, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to take it. I didn&#x27;t know what it was.&quot;

In a 2018 interview with &quot;the New York Times&quot;, when asked about how an LGBT film festival did not want to show her documentary because she was not &quot;out&quot;, Jett said: &quot;They don&#x27;t want the movie there because I don&#x27;t declare? [Holding up her necklace] What the [expletive] is that? Two labryses, or axes, crossing each other, inside of two women&#x27;s symbols crossing each other. It&#x27;s not been off since I got it. And I wear this one every day. [She turns around, lifts her shirt and reveals a tattoo with similar female symbols on her lower back.] I don&#x27;t know how much more you can declare.&quot;

Jett lives in Long Beach, New York, and has been a New York resident since the late 1970s. She is an avid New York Liberty and Baltimore Orioles fan.

=== Kim Fowley rape allegation ===
In July 2015, attorney Jackie Fuchs (formerly Jackie Fox of the Runaways) alleged that Kim Fowley raped her on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1975, at a party following a Runaways performance at an Orange County club. Sixteen years old at the time, Fuchs was reportedly given Quaaludes by a man she thought was a roadie, and while she was incapacitated, Fowley allegedly raped her in full view of a group of partygoers and her bandmates Currie, West, and Jett; Ford was not present. &quot;Look Away&quot;, a documentary about sexual abuse in the rock music industry features Fuchs&#x27; story.

Fuchs said that her last memory of the night was seeing Currie and Jett staring at her as Fowley raped her. Kari Krome (co-founder and songwriter for the group) stated that she saw, &quot;Jett and Currie sitting off to the side of the room for part of the time, snickering&quot; during the rape. In 2015, Jett stated &quot;Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened. For a group of young teenagers thrust into &#x27;70s rock stardom there were relationships that were bizarre, but I was not aware of this incident. Obviously Jackie&#x27;s story is extremely upsetting and although we haven&#x27;t spoken in decades, I wish her peace and healing.&quot; Victory Tischler-Blue (Fuchs&#x27;s replacement in the group) said that all the members of the group &quot;have always been aware of this ugly event&quot;.

<text>Alfred-Felix Vaucher (March 18, 1887 – May 22, 1993) was an Italian theologian, church historian, and bibliographer. He was a pioneer in the history and study of Seventh-day Adventism.

Preaching his first sermon at age 14, Vaucher studied at a church in Paris. In 1903, he was engaged by the Adventist church, to which he devoted an active ministry of approximately eighty years.

Vaucher traveled around Europe, including Switzerland and Italy as a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist. He published over 1,100 articles and pamphlets on French church history and wrote a score of books, some of which are: &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du Salut,&quot; &quot;Le P. Manuel Lacunza y Diaz,&quot; &quot;L&#x27;Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Le Jour du Repos&quot;, and &quot;Le Jour Seigneurial&quot;. Vaucher also taught at Salève Adventist University, Collonges-sous-Salève, Haute-Savoie, a French biblical college, from 1921 to 1941 and 1945–1983.

He died at age 106.

<text>Cherie Ann Currie (born November 30, 1959) is an American singer, musician, actress, and artist. Currie was the lead vocalist of The Runaways, a rock band from Los Angeles, in the mid-to-late 1970s. She later became a solo artist. Currie and her identical twin sister, Marie Currie, released the album &quot;Messin&#x27; With The Boys&quot; in 1980 as Cherie &amp; Marie Currie. Their duet &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; reached number 95 on US charts. She is also known for her role in the 1980 film &quot;Foxes&quot;.

==Early life==
Currie was born to Don Currie and actress Marie Harmon. She was raised in Encino, California. She has an identical twin sister, Marie Currie, an elder sister, actress Sondra Currie, and a brother, Don Currie Jr.

Currie and her twin sister were given a role on an episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; at the age of two. They were due to sing &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; with Fred MacMurray but they froze during filming and their part was cut from the show. Before Currie and her twin sister rose to fame, they appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; as background dancers.

==Career==
===The Runaways===
In 1975, when she was 15 years old, Currie joined the all-female rock band The Runaways, performing as lead vocalist. Her bandmates were Joan Jett, Lita Ford, Sandy West, Jackie Fox and Vicki Blue. &quot;Bomp!&quot; magazine described her as &quot;the lost daughter of Iggy Pop and Brigitte Bardot&quot;.

===Solo===
Currie recorded three albums with The Runaways, &quot;The Runaways&quot;, &quot;Queens of Noise&quot; and &quot;Live In Japan&quot;. She signed a four-album deal with Mercury, but left The Runaways after the third album. To fulfil her contract, she recorded &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Only Skin Deep&quot; for Polygram Records as a solo artist. Marie Currie was featured on the track &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;.

===Cherie and Marie Currie===
After Cherie left The Runaways at age eighteen, she performed in clubs in Los Angeles. Marie joined her onstage for encores, which drew a positive response from audiences. When Marie joined Cherie on a promotional tour in Japan, they had the idea of recording an album together. They recorded &quot;Messin&#x27; With The Boys&quot; for Capitol Records, released in 1979. &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;, a cover of the Russ Ballard song, reached number 95 on the charts.

Cherie and Marie performed on television shows in the 1980s including &quot;Sha Na Na&quot;, The Mike Douglas Show, and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show.&quot; They wrote and produced songs for the soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;The Rosebud Beach Hotel&quot;. They acted and sang together in the film. In 1991, Cherie and Marie Currie performed a tribute concert to Paula Pierce, a member of The Pandoras. For the final song, the remaining Pandoras backed the Curries. Currie performed at The Runaways&#x27; reunion in 1994 with Jackie Fox and Sandy West. Her sister Marie joined the three Runaways on stage and performed with the band.

In 1998, Cherie and Marie held a concert at the Golden Apple, in support of their re-released version of &quot;Messin&#x27; With The Boys&quot;. Cherie&#x27;s ex-bandmate West joined Cherie on stage to perform some of the Runaways songs. The Curries and West signed autographs after the show. In 1998, the compilation &quot;Young and Wild&quot; was released. Another compilation, &quot;80s Collection&quot;, was released in 2000 by Times Square Productions.

===Film and television===
Cherie starred in the film &quot;Foxes&quot; in 1980 with Jodie Foster, and received strong reviews for her acting debut. She also appeared in &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Wavelength&quot;, &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, &quot;The Rosebud Beach Hotel&quot; (with Marie Currie), and &quot;Rich Girl.&quot; She made guest appearances on television series including &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. In 1984 Currie was cast as Brenda in &quot;Savage Streets&quot;, but was replaced by Linda Blair. She was also cast as the lead singer of the fictional band the Dose in the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, but her character was cut out of the film. Cherie was considered for a part in the 1985 film &quot;Explorers&quot; but, according to her autobiography, she was in the throes of drug dependency and couldn&#x27;t even make it to a meeting.

===Later years===
Currie was a guest vocalist on Shameless&#x27;s 2013 album, &quot;Beautiful Disaster&quot;. Currie released singles with ex-bandmate, Lita Ford and Glenn Danzig the same year. On October 19, 2013, Currie won the Rock Legend Award at the sixth annual Malibu Music Awards. The award was presented to her by ex-bandmate, Lita Ford. That night Currie and Ford played on stage together for the first time in 37 years. Currie released another studio album, &quot;Reverie&quot;, in 2015. The album features guest work from ex-bandmate, Lita Ford, Currie&#x27;s son, Jake Hays, and Currie&#x27;s ex-manager, Kim Fowley. Cherie toured the UK in November 2015, to support her new album. While in the UK, Currie recorded &quot;Midnight Music In London&quot;, a live album that features a special live appearance by Suzi Quatro. It was released in 2016. In late May and early June 2016 Currie toured Australia and New Zealand. In 2018, Currie and her son were nominated for the Marshall Hawkins Award for Best Original Score for the film &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;

In 2019, Currie&#x27;s album &quot;Blvds Of Splendor&quot; was released on April 13. The album featured guests including Slash, Billy Corgan, Juliette Lewis, and the Veronicas. On August 2, &quot;The Motivator&quot;, her album with Brie Darling, was released.

In 2020 Cherie Currie released an audio version of her memoir, Neon Angel. It reached number 1 on Amazon&#x27;s Best Biographies of Punk Rock Musician. In the same year, Currie contributed her vocals to the song &quot;Flatten the Curve&quot; for the band FTC.

Currie is now a wood-carving artist, using a chainsaw to create her works. She has been doing chainsaw art since 2002 and opened her own gallery in 2005 in Chatsworth, California. As a chainsaw artist, Currie has competed in and won awards at three world Chainsaw Art competitions.

==Personal life==
Currie struggled with drug addiction for much of her younger life, a major factor in the abrupt ending of her career. She wrote a memoir, &quot;Neon Angel&quot;, recounting life in the band and her traumatic experiences with drug addiction, sex abuse, and her broken family. In the 1980s, Currie began working in drug and psych facilities, later becoming a counsellor.

&quot;The Runaways&quot;, a 2010 biographical drama film executive-produced by Joan Jett, focuses on the group&#x27;s beginnings and explores the relationship between Currie and Jett. Dakota Fanning portrays Currie.

Currie married actor Robert Hays on May 12, 1990, and they had one son together, the musician Jake Hays. Currie and Hays divorced in 1997.

In January 2024, Currie began to express gender-critical views on social media. In May 2024, Currie expressed support for Gays Against Groomers and did a collaboration to sell merchandise with the group later that month.

==Influence on pop culture==
In 1979 an alternative cover photo of Currie&#x27;s album &quot;Beauty&#x27;s only Skin Deep&quot; appears in the background of the feature film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;. It appears when the Ramones are backstage.

Characters in the 1997 film &quot;Gummo&quot;, sisters Dot, Helen, and Darby (played by Chloë Sevigny, Carisa Glucksman, and Darby Dougherty) were influenced by the Currie twins. Writer and director Harmony Korine, stated that, &quot;Dot and Helen were based off a combination of Cherie and Marie Currie, home schooling, and &quot;the Shaggs&quot;.&quot;

In a season 3 episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, Marissa makes an entrance to &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;. She does so while dressed in a provocative schoolgirl outfit.

<text>The president of the Soviet Union (), officially the president of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (), abbreviated as president of the USSR (), was the executive head of state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from 15 March 1990 to 25 December 1991. 

Mikhail Gorbachev was the only person to occupy this office. Gorbachev was also General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union between March 1985 and August 1991. He derived an increasingly large share of his power from his position as president through his resignation as General Secretary following the 1991 coup d&#x27;état attempt.

== History ==
The idea of the institution of a sole head of state (instead of collegial leadership) first appeared during the preparation of the draft 1936 Soviet Constitution. However, at the suggestion of the informal first person of the USSR, Joseph Stalin, who could compete with the official head of state, the idea was rejected. He formally justified the reason for this rejection as &quot;[running] counter to the spirit of [the] Constitution&quot;, and elaborated:According to the system of our Constitution there must not be an individual president in the U.S.S.R., elected by the whole population on a par with the Supreme Soviet, and able to put himself in opposition to the Supreme Soviet. The president in the U.S.S.R. is a collegium, it is the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, including the President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, elected, not by the whole population, but by the Supreme Soviet, and accountable to the Supreme Soviet. Historical experience shows that such a structure of the supreme bodies is the most democratic, and safeguards the country against undesirable contingencies.Nonetheless, the establishment of a singular Presidency was considered during the elaboration of the next Soviet Constitution, both at the first attempt under Nikita Khrushchev in the early to mid-1960s and at the second, successful attempt under Leonid Brezhnev in the mid-to-late 1970s. The latter attempt at establishing a Presidency formed a part of Brezhnev&#x27;s attempts at sidelining Nikolai Podgorny, who, as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was the formal head of state and first-ranked in diplomatic protocol; an alternative path to making Brezhnev head of state, by establishing a collegial State Council similar to those of East Germany, Bulgaria, and Romania, of which he would be the chairman, was also considered. In both instances, the collegial Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was ultimately retained as the highest body of power in the country.

Members of the Communist Party voted on establishing a presidency on 7 February 1990. The first and only presidential election took place on 14 March 1990. The Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies decided that they would elect the first president into a five-year term, then turn over presidential elections to the public beginning in the planned 1995 presidential election.

==Powers==
The presidency was an executive post, based on a mixture of the US and French presidencies.

Prior to the creation of the post of president, the &quot;de jure&quot; head of state of the Soviet Union was the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, who was often called the &quot;president&quot; by non-Soviet sources. For most of the Soviet Union&#x27;s existence, all effective executive political power was in the hands of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the chairman of the Presidium exercising largely symbolic and figurehead duties. Starting with Leonid Brezhnev in 1977, the last four general secretaries—Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko, and Gorbachev—simultaneously served as &quot;de jure&quot; head of state during their time in office.

The president was initially elected by the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and served as &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of that body, but all future elections were to have been by popular vote. The president reported to the Supreme Soviet. On 24 September 1990, Gorbachev persuaded the Supreme Soviet to give him the power to rule by unrestricted decree (on the economy, law and order, and the appointment of government personnel) until 31 March 1992. Another power was the right to declare direct presidential rule in troubled areas and abolish democratic elected bodies if necessary. During the election of the president several candidates were nominated, among leading contenders were KGB Chairman Vadim Bakatin and Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.

The president&#x27;s powers were:
* Commander in chief of the armed forces
* The ability to propose and veto legislation
* The ability to appoint the Prime Minister (who would then have to be approved by the Supreme Soviet), or, if necessary, to dismiss the Prime Minister, among other government ministers and officials
* The declaration of states of emergency or martial law within the borders of the Soviet Union
* The nation&#x27;s top representative abroad, with the ability to sign international treaties
* The ability to call for national referendums on important issues
* The ability to assign military ranks and honorary titles
* The power to restore citizenship to exiles or internal dissidents
* The ability to overrule government decisions that violated the constitution or endangered citizens rights and freedoms
The vice president of the Soviet Union was the deputy head of state. If the president was killed or unable to be in office, the vice president would become president. The only person to hold this office was Gennady Yanayev, who the following year became the leader of the 
Gang of Eight which attempted the August coup, assuming the position of acting president of the Soviet Union on 19 August 1991. After three days the coup collapsed and Gorbachev was restored. 

Following the coup attempt, Gorbachev remained president until the country&#x27;s dissolution, when he resigned and declared his office to be extinct. The powers of the position were subsequently ceded to the new President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin.

==Oath==
With his right hand on a red bound copy of the Soviet Constitution, placed on a small table before the Congress, President-elect Gorbachev took the following oath:
&quot;I solemnly swear to faithfully serve the peoples of our nations, to strictly observe the Soviet Constitution, to guarantee the rights and freedoms of citizens and to conscientiously fulfill the high responsibilities placed in me as president of the Soviet Union.&quot;

<doc id="359534" wikidata="Q1631452" url="?curid=359534" title="R. Palme Dutt">
<text>Rajani Palme Dutt (19 June 1896 – 20 December 1974) was a British political figure, journalist and theoretician who served as the fourth general secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain during World War II from October 1939 to June 1941. His classic book &quot;India Today&quot; heralded the Marxist approach in Indian historiography.

==Early life==
Rajani Palme Dutt was born in 1896 on Mill Road in Cambridge, England. His father, Dr. Upendra Dutt, was an Indian surgeon, his mother Anna Palme was Swedish. Dr. Upendra Dutt belonged to the family of Romesh Chunder Dutt. Anna Palme was a great aunt of the future Prime Minister of Sweden Olof Palme. Rajani&#x27;s sister was the statistician Elna Palme Dutt, who went on to become an official of the International Labour Organization in Geneva. He, along with his older brother Clemens Palme Dutt, was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

Dutt was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge and Balliol College, Oxford where he obtained a first-class degree in Classics, after being suspended for a time because of his activities as a conscientious objector in World War I, during which his writing was deemed subversive propaganda.

Dutt married an Estonian, Salme Murrik, the sister of Finnish writer Hella Wuolijoki, in 1922. His wife had come to Great Britain in 1920 as a representative of the Communist International.

==Political career==

 Dutt made his first connections with the Socialist Movement in England during his school days, before the outbreak of the First World War. He was expelled from Oxford University in October 1917 for organising a socialist meeting. He joined the British Labour Movement as a full time worker in 1919, when he joined the Labour Research Department, a left-wing statistical bureau. Together with Harry Pollitt he was one of the founder members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1920. In 1921 he founded a monthly magazine called &quot;Labour Monthly,&quot; a publication that he edited until his death, and also visited India.

In 1922, Dutt was named the editor of the party&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the &quot;Workers&#x27; Weekly.&quot;

Dutt was on the executive committee of the CPGB from 1923 to 1965 and was the party&#x27;s chief theorist for many years.

Dutt first visited the Soviet Union in 1923, where he attended deliberations of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) relating to the British movement. He was elected an alternate to the ECCI Presidium in 1924.

Following an illness in 1925 which forced him to stand down as editor of &quot;Workers&#x27; Weekly,&quot; Dutt spent several years in Belgium and Sweden as a representative of the Comintern. He also played an important role for the Comintern by supervising the Communist Party of India for some years.

Palme Dutt was loyal to the Soviet Union and to the Stalinist line. In 1939, when the CPGB General Secretary Harry Pollitt supported the United Kingdom entering World War II, Palme Dutt promoted Joseph Stalin&#x27;s line and forced Pollitt&#x27;s temporary resignation. As a result, he became the party&#x27;s General Secretary until Pollitt was reappointed in 1941, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union cause a reversal in the party&#x27;s attitude on the war.

His book &quot;Fascism and Social Revolution&quot; presents a scathing criticism and analysis of fascism, with a study of the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy and other countries. He defined fascism as a violent authoritarian, ultranationalist and irrational theory: &quot;Fascism is antithetical to everything of substance within the liberal tradition.&quot;

After Stalin&#x27;s death, Palme Dutt&#x27;s reaction to Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech played down its significance, with Dutt arguing that Stalin&#x27;s &quot;sun&quot; unsurprisingly contained some &quot;spots&quot;. A hardliner in the party, he disagreed with its criticisms of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and opposed its increasingly Eurocommunist line in the 1970s. He retired from his party positions but remained a member until his death in 1974. According to the historian Geoff Andrews, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was still paying the CPGB around £15,000 a year &quot;for pensions&quot; into the 1970s, recipients of which &quot;included Rajani Palme Dutt&quot;.

The Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester has Palme Dutt&#x27;s papers in its collection, spanning from 1908 to 1971.

== India visit ==
In 1946 the British Indian Government permitted RPD to visit his father&#x27;s country for the first time since 1921, this time as a special correspondent for the Daily Worker. The visit lasted four months, during which he spoke at several rallies in different cities of India, all organised by the Communist Party of India. During this time he also interacted with many of that Party&#x27;s workers, along with senior leaders including PC Joshi. During this visit he also met several important leaders of India including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Stafford Cripps. He was also invited by newly-built All India Radio for a broadcast. His visit had such a profound effect upon Indian Communists that when they established the headquarters of their “People’s Publishing House (PPH)” in Jhandewalan, Delhi, between 1956 and 1958 they named the building the “R. Palme Dutt Bhawan” (Bhawan meaning Building) after RPD. On that building&#x27;s second floor stairwell hung a portrait of RPD taken during his 1946 visit to India, remaining there until very recently and now possibly hanging in the Party&#x27;s headquarters at Ajoy Bhawan.

<doc id="359541" wikidata="Q2051126" url="?curid=359541" title="Pragmatic Sanction of 1549">
<text>The [[Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1549 was an edict, promulgated by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, reorganising the Seventeen Provinces of the present-day Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg into one indivisible territory, while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces.

It was his plan to centralize the administrative units of the Holy Roman Empire. The Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the Habsburgs would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles&#x27; abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, Philip II of Spain.

The Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with particularism that contributed to the Dutch Revolt. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against heresy, stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the Dutch Revolt.

== Territories ==

The document was written in Middle French. The following territories, collectively called &quot;nos Pays de pardeçà&quot; (&quot;our Lands around here&quot;, meaning the Netherlands, as opposed to &quot;nos Pays de par delà&quot;, &quot;our Lands over there&quot;, meaning the Franche-Comté and originally also the Duchy of Burgundy) are mentioned in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549:
* &quot;Flandres&quot;: the County of Flanders (modern Dutch: &quot;Vlaanderen&quot;; modern French: &quot;Flandre&quot;)

* &quot;Brabant&quot;: the Duchy of Brabant
* &quot;Luxembourg&quot;: the Duchy of Luxembourg (modern Dutch/German: &quot;Luxemburg&quot;, modern Luxembourgish: &quot;Lëtzebuerg&quot;) 
* &quot;Gueldres&quot;: the Duchy of Guelders (modern Dutch: &quot;Gelre&quot;, predecessor of the province of Gelderland)
* &quot;Limbourg, Faulquemont, Daelhem et d&#x27;autres nos pays d&#x27;Outremeuse&quot;: the Duchy of Limburg, the County of Valkenburg (modern French: &quot;Fauquemont&quot;), the County of Dalhem and &#x27;our&#x27; [=Habsburg&#x27;s] other Lands of Overmaas
* &quot;Holland&quot;: the County of Holland
* &quot;Namur&quot;: the County of Namur (modern Dutch: &quot;Namen&quot;)
* &quot;Frize&quot;: the Lordship of Frisia (modern Dutch: &quot;Friesland&quot;; modern Frisian: &quot;Fryslân&quot;) 
* &quot;Overyssel et Groeninghe&quot;: the Lordship of Overijssel and the Lordship of Groningen
* &quot;Uytrecht&quot;: the Lordship of Utrecht
* &quot;Lille, Douay et Orchies&quot;: the castellanies of Lille (modern Dutch: &quot;Rijsel&quot;), Douai and Orchies

<doc id="359542" wikidata="Q377983" url="?curid=359542" title="Paul R. Ehrlich">
<text>Paul Ralph Ehrlich (born May 29, 1932) is an American biologist known for his failed predictions and warnings about the consequences of population growth, including famine and resource depletion. Many of Ehrlich&#x27;s incorrect predictions have been criticized widely for either partially or entirely failing to materialize as predicted. Ehrlich is the Bing Professor Emeritus of Population Studies of the Department of Biology of Stanford University.

Ehrlich became well known for the controversial 1968 book &quot;The Population Bomb,&quot; which he co-authored with his wife Anne H. Ehrlich, in which they asserted, ultimately incorrectly, that &quot;[i]n the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.&quot; Among the solutions suggested in that book was population control, including &quot;various forms of coercion&quot; such as eliminating &quot;tax benefits for having additional children&quot;.

Scholars, journalists and public intellectuals have mixed views on Ehrlich&#x27;s assertions on the dangers of expanding human populations. While Paul A. Murtaugh, associate professor of statistics at Oregon State University, believes that Ehrlich was at least partly correct, Ehrlich has been criticized for his approach and views, both for their pessimistic outlook and, later on, for the repeated failure of his predictions to come true. In response to Ehrlich&#x27;s assertion that all major marine wildlife would die by 1980, Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an &quot;irrepressible doomster&quot;. Ehrlich has acknowledged that &quot;some&quot; of what he predicted has not occurred, but nevertheless maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct and that human overpopulation is a major problem. Whereas American journalist Jonathan V. Last has called &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; &quot;one of the most spectacularly foolish books ever published&quot;, journalist Fred Pearce argues that overconsumption is the real problem.

==Early life, education, and academic career==

Ehrlich was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of William Ehrlich and Ruth Rosenberg. His father was a shirt salesman and his mother was a Greek and Latin scholar and public school teacher. Ehrlich&#x27;s mother&#x27;s Reform-Jewish German ancestors arrived in the United States in the 1840s, and his paternal grandparents emigrated there later from the Galician and Transylvanian part of the Austrian Empire. During his childhood his family moved to Maplewood, New Jersey, where he attended Columbia High School, graduating in 1949.

By training, Ehrlich is an entomologist specializing in Lepidoptera (butterflies). He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in zoology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953, an M.A. from the University of Kansas in 1955, and a Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 1957, supervised by the prominent bee researcher Charles Duncan Michener (the title of his dissertation: &quot;The Morphology, Phylogeny and Higher Classification of the Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)&quot;). During his studies he participated with surveys of insects in the areas of the Bering Sea and Canadian arctic, and then with a National Institutes of Health fellowship, investigated the genetics and behavior of parasitic mites. In 1959 he joined the faculty at Stanford University. He became well-known for popularizing the term coevolution in an influential 1964 paper co-authored with the botanist Peter H. Raven, where they proposed that an evolutionary &#x27;arms-race&#x27; between plants and insects explains the extreme diversification of plants and insects. This paper was highly influential on the then-nascent field of chemical ecology. He was promoted to professor of biology in 1966, and appointed to the Bing Professorship in 1977. 
In 1984, he founded the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Overpopulation debate==


A lecture that Ehrlich gave on the topic of overpopulation at the Commonwealth Club of California was broadcast by radio in April 1967. The success of the lecture caused further publicity, and the suggestion from David Brower the executive director of the environmentalist Sierra Club, and Ian Ballantine of Ballantine Books to write a book concerning the topic. Ehrlich and his wife, Anne H. Ehrlich, collaborated on the book, &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, but the publisher insisted that a single author be credited; only Paul&#x27;s name appears as an author.

Although Ehrlich was not the first to warn about population issues — concern had been widespread during the 1950s and 1960s — his charismatic and media-savvy methods helped publicize the topic. &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; had Ehrlich on as a guest more than twenty times, with one interview lasting an hour.

===Writings===
====&quot;The Population Bomb&quot; (1968)====

The original edition of &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; began with the statement: Ehrlich argued that the human population was too great, and that while the extent of disaster could be mitigated, humanity could not prevent severe famines, the spread of disease, social unrest, and other negative consequences of overpopulation.

Ehrlich has proposed different solutions to the problem of overpopulation. In &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; he wrote, &quot;We must have population control at home, hopefully through a system of incentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail. We must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control.&quot; Voluntary measures he has endorsed include the easiest possible availability of birth control and abortion.

Decades later, Ehrlich&#x27;s continued prominence and the failure of the book&#x27;s predictions to materialize led to renewed scrutiny and criticism. The New York Times said his &quot;apocalyptic predictions fell as flat as ancient theories about the shape of the Earth&quot;.

Science author Charles C. Mann wrote that the book&#x27;s predictions &quot;fueled an anti-population-growth crusade that led to human rights abuses around the world&quot;, including coercive population control policies and even forced sterilizations. Ehrlich&#x27;s pointed criticism of India in particular (for instance, emphasizing the overpopulation of Delhi rather than Paris, which had nearly triple Delhi&#x27;s population at the time of writing) has been criticized for focusing much more on &quot;feelings&quot; than on actual data.

Neither of the Ehrlichs have ever publicly renounced predictions, instead insisting that they were largely correct, despite the errors noted by many experts.

====&quot;The Population Explosion&quot; (1990)====
&quot;The Population Explosion&quot; argues that the population catastrophe outlined in the Ehrlichs&#x27; earlier work &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; had in fact come to pass, and that &quot;hunger is rife and famine and plague ever more imminent&quot;.

Many accepted the premise of a looming population problem, with the New York Times writing that &quot;it is not merely prudent but imperative that we confront population issues, and do so now&quot;. Notwithstanding this wide agreement, the Ehrlichs were criticized for an &quot;alarmist&quot; tone. The book was also criticised for its approach to family planning, arguing against increased family planning efforts aimed at empowering individuals and families. The Ehrlichs were accused of advocating the curtailment of reproductive freedoms and giving the state a larger role in such decisions, while leaving ambiguous &quot;just how authoritarian a solution they are willing to endorse.&quot;

Subsequent attention to the book scrutinized its descriptions of an unfolding overpopulation catastrophe. The book&#x27;s contention that global food production had already peaked proved to be incorrect. Similarly, the prediction that India faced catastrophic food shortage in the 1990s failed to materialize.

====&quot;Optimum Human Population Size&quot; (1994)====
In this paper, the Ehrlichs discussed their opinion on the &#x27;optimal size&#x27; for human population, given their assessment of the current technological situation. They referred to establishing &quot;social policies to influence fertility rates.&quot;
===After 2000===
During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich answered questions about the predictions he made in &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;. He acknowledged that some of what he had published had not occurred, but stated that he felt &quot;little embarrassment&quot; and reaffirmed his basic opinion that overpopulation is a major problem. He noted that, &quot;Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the world scientists&#x27; warning to humanity in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!&quot; Ehrlich also asserted that 600 million people were very hungry while billions were under-nourished and falsely insisted that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct. Retrospectively, Ehrlich said that &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, which predicted a widespread famine by 1985 that never materialized, was actually &quot;way too optimistic&quot;.

In a 2008 discussion hosted by the website &quot;Salon&quot;, Paul Ehrlich was more critical of the United States specifically, claiming that it should control its population and consumption as an example to the rest of the world. He still professed a belief that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example, a higher tax rate for larger families.

In 2011, as the world&#x27;s population passed the seven billion mark, Ehrlich argued that the next two billion people on Earth would cause more damage than the previous two billion, as humans now increasingly would have to resort to using more marginal and environmentally damaging resources. As of 2013, Ehrlich continued to perform policy research concerning population and resource issues, with an emphasis upon endangered species, cultural evolution, environmental ethics, and the preservation of genetic resources. Along with Dr. Gretchen Daily, he performed work in countryside biogeography; that is, the study of making human-disturbed areas hospitable to biodiversity. His research group at Stanford University examined extensive natural populations of the Bay checkerspot butterfly (&quot;Euphydryas editha bayensis&quot;).

The population-related disaster that Ehrlich predicted has failed to materialize, including the &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of starvation deaths in the 1970s and the tens of millions of deaths in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Slowing of population growth rates and new food production technologies have increased the food supply faster than the population. Nonetheless, Ehrlich continues to stand by his general thesis that the human population is too large, posing a direct threat to human survival and the environment of the planet. Indeed, he states that if he were to write the book today, &quot;My language would be even more apocalyptic.&quot; In 2018, he emphasized his view that the optimum population size is between 1.5 and 2 billion people. In 2022, he was a contributor to the &quot;Scientists&#x27; warning on population,&quot; published by &quot;Science of the Total Environment&quot;, which estimated that a sustainable population would be between 2 and 4 billion people.

==Reception==
During the 1960s and 70s when Ehrlich made his most alarming warnings, there was a widespread belief among experts that population growth presented an extremely serious threat to the future of human civilization, although differences existed regarding the severity of the situation, and how to decrease it.

In the decades since, critics have disputed Ehrlich&#x27;s main thesis about overpopulation and its effects on the environment and human society, and his solutions, as well as his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. 

A common criticism is that Ehrlich&#x27;s predictions routinely failed to come true, for instance Ronald Bailey of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine has termed him an &quot;irrepressible doomster ... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe.&quot; On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that &quot;[i]n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish.&quot; In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: &quot;By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people.&quot; &quot;If I were a gambler,&quot; Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, &quot; I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.&quot; When this scenario did not occur, he responded that &quot;When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They&#x27;re having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else.&quot; 

Ehrlich wrote in &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; that, &quot;India couldn&#x27;t possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.&quot; In 1967, Ehrlich called to cut off emergency food aid to India as &quot;hopeless&quot;. This position was later criticized, as India&#x27;s food production subsequently skyrocketed through the Green Revolution in India, and its per capita caloric intake rose significantly in the following decades, even as its population doubled.
Canadian journalist Dan Gardner, in his 2010 book &quot;Future Babble&quot;, argues that Ehrlich has been insufficiently forthright in acknowledging errors he made, while being intellectually dishonest or evasive in taking credit for things he claims he got &quot;right&quot;. For example, he rarely acknowledges the mistakes he made in predicting material shortages, massive death tolls from starvation (as many as one billion in the publication &quot;Age of Affluence&quot;) or regarding the disastrous effects on specific countries. Meanwhile, he is happy to claim credit for &quot;predicting&quot; the increase of AIDS or global warming. However, in the case of disease, Ehrlich had predicted the increase of a disease based on overcrowding, or the weakened immune systems of starving people, so it is &quot;a stretch to see this as forecasting the emergence of AIDS in the 1980s.&quot; Similarly, global warming was one of the scenarios that Ehrlich described, so claiming credit for it, while disavowing responsibility for failed scenarios is a double standard. Gardner believes that Ehrlich is displaying classical signs of cognitive dissonance, and that his failure to acknowledge obvious errors of his own judgement render his current thinking suspect.

Barry Commoner has criticized Ehrlich&#x27;s 1970 statement that &quot;When you reach a point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little time you have left. That point for me is 1972.&quot; Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book &quot;Famine 1975!&quot;. They had proposed a system of &quot;triage&quot; that would end food aid to &quot;hopeless&quot; countries such as India and Egypt. In &quot;Population Bomb&quot;, Ehrlich suggests that &quot;there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks&#x27; strategy as far as food distribution is concerned.&quot; Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.

===Left-wing critics===
Another group of critics, generally of the political left, argues that Ehrlich emphasizes overpopulation too much as a problem in itself instead of distribution of resources. Barry Commoner argued that Ehrlich emphasized overpopulation too much as the source of environmental problems, and that his proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because they would cost poor people disproportionately. He argued that technological, and above all social development would result in a natural decrease of both population growth and environmental damage. Ehrlich denies any type of racism, and has argued that if his policy ideas were implemented properly they would not be repressive.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ehrlich, while still proud of &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; for starting a worldwide debate on the issues of population, acknowledged weaknesses of the book including not placing enough emphasis on overconsumption and inequality, and countering accusations of racism. He argues &quot;too many rich people in the world is a major threat to the human future, and cultural and genetic diversity are great human resources.&quot; He advocated for an &quot;unprecedented redistribution of wealth&quot; in order to mitigate the problem of overconsumption of resources by the world&#x27;s wealthy, but said &quot;the rich who now run the global system — that hold the annual &#x27;world destroyer&#x27; meetings in Davos — are unlikely to let it happen.&quot;

Ehrlich and his colleague Rodolfo Dirzo argued in a 2022 perspective paper for the need to reduce fertility rates among &quot;the overconsuming wealthy and middle classes&quot;, and wasteful consumption in general, with the ultimate goal being to reduce &quot;the scale of the human enterprise&quot; in order to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis.

===Simon–Ehrlich wager===

The economist Julian Simon argued in 1980 that overpopulation is not a problem as such and that humanity will adapt to changing conditions. Simon argued that eventually human creativity will improve living standards, and that most resources were replaceable. Simon stated that over hundreds of years, the prices of virtually all commodities had decreased significantly and persistently. Ehrlich termed Simon the proponent of a &quot;space-age cargo cult&quot; of economists convinced that human creativity and ingenuity would create substitutes for scarce resources and reasserted the idea that population growth was outstripping the Earth&#x27;s supplies of food, fresh water and minerals. This exchange resulted in the Simon–Ehrlich wager, a bet about the trend of prices for resources during a ten-year period that was made with Simon in 1980. Ehrlich was allowed to choose ten commodities that he predicted would become scarce and thus increase in price. Ehrlich chose mostly metals, and lost the bet, as their average price decreased by about 30% in the next 10 years. Simon and Ehrlich could not agree about the terms of a second bet.

===Ehrlich&#x27;s response to critics===
Ehrlich has argued that humanity has simply deferred the disaster by the use of more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a sustainable future.

==Other activities==
Ehrlich was one of the initiators of the group Zero Population Growth (renamed Population Connection) in 1968, along with Richard Bowers and Charles Lee Remington. In 1971, Ehrlich was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. He and his wife Anne were part of the board of advisers of the Federation for American Immigration Reform until 2003. He is currently a patron of Population Matters, (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust).

Consistent with his concern about the impact of pollution and in response to a doctoral dissertation by his student Edward Goth III, Ehrlich wrote in 1977 that, &quot;Fluorides have been shown to concentrate in food chains, and evidence suggesting a potential for significant ecological effects is accumulating.&quot;

Ehrlich has spoken at conferences in Israel on the issue of desertification. He has argued &quot;true Zionists should have small families&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ehrlich has been married to Anne H. Ehrlich (née Howland) since December 1954; they have one daughter, Lisa Marie. He announced that he had had a vasectomy in 1963 after his child&#x27;s birth.

<text>Rüdiger Nehberg, also known as &#x27;Sir Vival&#x27;, (4 May 1935 – 1 April 2020) was a German human rights activist, author and expert. He was the founder and chairman of the anti-FGM organization TARGET, and chairman of the organizations Friends of Peoples Close to Nature (German section – &quot;)&quot; and &quot;&quot; (Save the Rainforest). He lived in Rausdorf near Hamburg, Germany. Nehberg described himself as having &quot;No astrological sign, no church, no hair, and no clip in the ear (the latter means: he is a )&quot;.

==Life and work==
Nehberg was born in Bielefeld. After school, Nehberg initially became a pastry chef by trade, but increasingly turned his attention to outdoor . He would finally sell his three bakeries and live from his books and lectures.

In 1972, together with two friends, one of whom was shot dead in an ambush, he became one of the first to travel the length of the Blue Nile in a home-made boat. Since 1980, he has been involved in defending the interests of the Yanomami Amerindian tribe. With his enterprise, &quot;The Tree&quot; (crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a fir-tree in 2000), he contributed to the provision of a protected reservation for the Yanomami. In 1981 – followed by a camera team – he crisscrossed Germany without any special equipment and relying for his sustenance solely on what he was able to find in nature. In 1987, Nehberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a pedal boat.

He was also one of the first to discredit the fraudulent &quot;Tatunca Nara&quot; story, which had gained publicity in the German and Brazilian media. A German worker named Hans Günther Hauck left his home near Nuremberg in 1967, moved into the Brazilian jungle, and proclaimed himself the leader of the secret Ugha-Mongulala tribe, which had lived hidden in the secret jungle city of Akakor for 15,000 years. Neither the city nor the tribe ever existed. Nevertheless, many filmmakers and adventure-loving men and women believed Nara, and three people even died during Tatunca-led jungle excursions. The circumstances that led to their deaths have never been fully revealed. In Nehberg&#x27;s book &quot;Der selbstgemachte Häuptling&quot; (&quot;The Self-Made Chieftain&quot;), the whole story of this mysterious man and his deeds can be read.

In September 2000, he founded the human rights organization TARGET to prevent the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). For his commitment to endangered peoples, Nehberg was awarded the &quot;Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot; (&quot;Federal Cross for Merit&quot;). In November 2006, TARGET organized and financed a conference under the patronage of the Egyptian Great Mufti Ali Gomaa at Al-Azhar University of Cairo. As a result of the conference, leading authorities of Islamic law denounced genital mutilation.

In March 2009, Rüdiger Nehberg and Tarafa Baghajati met Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi in Qatar, one of the best known Islamic contemporary authority scholars. They obtained a fatwa issued by the recognized legal scholar, stating that genital mutilation of girls is referred to and forbidden as &quot;devil&#x27;s work&quot; because it is directed against the ethics of Islam.

In August 2009 Nehberg married his second wife.

In February 2011, Rüdiger Nehberg and Tarafa Baghajati met with Sheikh Prof. Dr. Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti and obtained a similar fatwa against female genital mutilation. In 2014 he gave a TEDx talk about his work to prevent FGM.

<text>Harry Pollitt (22 November 1890 – 27 June 1960) was a British communist who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) from July 1929 to September 1939 and again from 1941 until his death in 1960. Pollitt spent most of his life advocating communism. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, Pollitt was an adherent particularly of Joseph Stalin even after Stalin&#x27;s death and disavowal by Nikita Khrushchev. Pollitt&#x27;s acts included opposition to the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and Polish–Soviet War, support for the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, both support for and opposition to the war against Nazi Germany, defence of the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, and support for the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary.

He contested a number of parliamentary elections, but never won, despite coming close in 1945. Throughout his time as leader of CPGB, he was in direct secret radio contact with Moscow as CPGB&#x27;s &quot;Code Holder&quot;, and was monitored by the British security services.

==Early life==
===Childhood and early career===
Pollitt was born on 22 November 1890 in Droylsden, Lancashire. He was the second of six children of Samuel Pollitt (1863–1933), a blacksmith&#x27;s striker, and his wife, Mary Louisa (1868–1939), a cotton spinner, daughter of William Charlesworth, a joiner. Pollitt&#x27;s parents were socialists, and his mother was a member of the Independent Labour Party before joining the Communist party when it was formed in 1920.

Three of his siblings died in infancy. The death of his younger sister Winifred particularly affected Pollitt, who said that he would &quot;pay God out. Pay everybody out for making my sister suffer&quot;. Pollitt began work at the age of 12, alongside his mother. The suffering of his mother, who regularly worked standing in water wearing only wooden clogs, also particularly affected Pollitt, who later said that he &quot;swore that when I grew up I would pay the bosses out for the hardships that she suffered&quot;. Pollitt later became a boilermaker and metal craftsman.

During the First World War, Pollitt was exempt from conscription as a skilled worker. Pollitt gained experience leading a strike in Southampton in 1915 and later described being inspired by the 1917 October Revolution, saying it showed that &quot;workers like me ... had defeated the boss class&quot;. By this time Pollitt was already a member of Sylvia Pankhurst&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation and had gained experience with public speaking.

===Communist campaigner===

In September 1919, Pollitt was appointed full-time national organiser of the Hands Off Russia campaign to protest against Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, for which Pankhurst had obtained funding from Moscow. Pollitt tired of his desk-bound job and went back to work in the Port of London. Whilst there, Pollitt helped convince London dock workers not to load the freighter on 10 May 1920, as she was bound with munitions for Poland, which at that time was fighting against Soviet Russia in the Polish–Soviet War. With support from Ernest Bevin, then a senior official in the dockers&#x27; union, the ship&#x27;s owners were forced by the dockers to unload her cargo of munitions, and she sailed on 15 May 1920 without them. Pollitt failed to prevent a number of other ships laden with arms for Poland, including the Danish steamer &quot;Neptune&quot; on 1 May 1920, and two Belgian barges.

In August 1920 the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was founded by an agreement unifying various left-wing bodies, including the British Socialist Party, of which Pollitt was a member in addition to his WSF membership. Pollitt, thus a founding member of the party, attended the CPGB&#x27;s founding &quot;Utility Convention&quot;. The following year Pollitt visited the Soviet Union. During his visit, he met and shook hands with Vladimir Lenin, an experience he later described as the greatest day of his life. According to the October 1921 issue of &quot;Freedom&quot;, on his return Pollitt stated that he had seen evidence that Russian anarchists were plotting to restore Tsarism and spoke approvingly of the suppression of anarchism in Russia.

Pollitt was involved in a criminal case against five men he accused of kidnapping him in March 1925 whilst he was on his way to address a meeting of communists in Liverpool. According to Pollitt, he had been taken off a train and held in Wales over a weekend in order to prevent him reaching Liverpool, though treated mildly. The men, who were all members of the British Fascists, were acquitted by the jury following testimony that characterised the &quot;kidnapping&quot; as unserious and a denial from the head of the Liverpool branch of the fascist party that they had authorised any kidnapping of Pollitt. The Labour party conference that year passed a motion condemning the acquittal by the jury of those accused of kidnapping Pollitt as an example of class-prejudice, and calling for representation of workers on juries.

On 10 October 1925, Pollitt married Marjorie Brewer at Caxton Hall, Westminster. Marjorie Edna Brewer (1902–1991) was a communist schoolteacher; the marriage eventually produced a son and a daughter. His best man and witness was fellow CPGB activist and organiser Percy Glading, who would later be convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and imprisoned. A week later, Pollitt was one of 12 members of the Communist Party convicted at the Old Bailey on charges of seditious libel and incitement to mutiny. Pollitt was given a 12-month sentence as a previous offender, which he served in Wandsworth prison. Historian C. L. Mowat described the trial as &quot;the chief instance of a purely political trial in the interwar years&quot;.

Pollitt travelled again to Moscow in October 1927, and attended a meeting at which the CPGB was roundly criticised for its failure to criticise the British labour movement. During the same visit, Pollitt met privately with Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin, who, over Pollitt&#x27;s protests, ordered that the CPGB should abandon its &quot;United Front&quot; policy and campaign as widely as possible at the next election, even where the CPGB stood no chance of winning and would draw votes away from the Labour candidate, thus allowing the Conservatives to win. This policy of attacking other left-wing organisations was known as the &quot;Class-against-Class&quot; policy, and remained in place until 1932 when, as leader, Pollitt was able to get it relaxed for trade unions, though it remained in place for other parts of the left.

In addition to his role in the CPGB, from the early 1920s Pollitt served as national secretary of the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions (AKA Profintern), an organisation aimed at countering the Amsterdam International and rallying militant trade unionists within existing unions to win those unions over to communism. The Comintern characterised the British Bureau as &quot;not an organisation of unions, but only of revolutionary minorities of unions&quot;. On the founding of the National Minority Movement (NMM) in 1924, the British Bureau was folded into it and Pollitt was made its national secretary, a position he remained in until 1929. As secretary of the NMM, Pollitt opposed trying to form new communist-oriented unions aimed at replacing established unions under the &quot;Class-against-Class&quot; policy.

==Leadership of the CPGB==
===Pre-World War II and the Great Purge===
In 1929 the CPGB elected Pollitt General Secretary with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personal approval. Pollitt replaced Albert Inkpin, who had attracted disapproval from the Comintern by opposing the &quot;Class-against-Class&quot; policy and perceived softness towards others on the left. On his appointment, Stalin told him, &quot;You have taken a difficult job on, but I believe you will tackle it all right&quot;. Pollitt was selected as he had impressed people both within the CPGB and in Moscow as a Comintern loyalist and effective organiser, particularly when representing the Comintern at a meeting of the Communist Party USA in March 1929. Pollitt stated that he saw his role as defending the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) &quot;through thick and thin&quot;. Unlike Inkpin, Pollitt was willing to criticise the Labour party as &quot;social-fascists&quot;.

Pollitt made clear in his public statements his loyalties to the Soviet Union and to CPSU General Secretary Joseph Stalin. He was a defender of the Moscow Trials, in which Stalin murdered or otherwise disposed of his political and military opponents. In the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; of 12 March 1936 Pollitt told the world that &quot;the trials in Moscow represent a new triumph in the history of progress&quot;. The article was illustrated by a photograph of Stalin with Nikolai Yezhov, whose likeness would be retouched out of the photograph following his 1940 fall from favour and subsequent execution.

In 1934 Pollitt and Tom Mann, then-treasurer of the National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement (NUWM), were summonsed on charges of sedition in relation to speeches they gave in Trealaw and Ferndale in Wales. Pollitt and Mann were both acquitted of all charges by Swansea assizes. The arrests took place on the eve of a meeting in Bermondsey which Mann and Pollitt were due to attend that was to be the culmination of the 1934 Hunger March.

Pollitt travelled again to Moscow in 1935. Whilst there he was invited to make a broadcast on the BBC radio programme &quot;The Citizen and His Government&quot;, commenting on the difference between the UK and the USSR. However, the invitation was withdrawn after opposition from the Foreign Office. He would not appear on BBC radio until the 1945 election.

When Pollitt&#x27;s personal friend Rose Cohen, to whom he had proposed marriage on a number of occasions, was put on trial in Moscow in 1937 during Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, the CPGB opposed efforts by the British government to get Cohen released, describing her arrest as an internal affair of the Soviet Union. Pollitt privately tried to intervene on her behalf, but by the time he did so she had already been shot. Pollitt placed himself at risk by questioning Cohen&#x27;s arrest in this fashion, as Béla Kun had, under torture, identified him as a &quot;Trotskyist&quot; and &quot;British spy&quot;, though Osip Piatnitsky had refused to confirm these accusations when arrested by the NKVD in 1937. Twenty years after Cohen&#x27;s death, Pollitt requested information from Moscow about whether she was still alive, stating, untruthfully, that there was press interest in Britain about her whereabouts.

In contrast to Pollitt&#x27;s concern over Rose Cohen, when CPGB member Freda Utley tried to get Pollitt to intercede with Moscow on behalf of her Russian husband, who was arrested and died in a labour camp in 1938, Pollitt refused. Pollitt also failed to intervene to help George Fles and his wife, Arcadi Berdichevsky and his wife, nor a number of other British communists who were arrested by the NKVD and tortured, shot, or imprisoned in the Gulag during Stalin&#x27;s purge.

Pollitt defied Moscow by opposing the introduction of conscription in Britain when it was introduced in 1939. Pollitt&#x27;s opposition to conscription led to protests from the French Communist Party, which had supported conscription in France.

===Spanish Civil War===

During the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War Pollitt visited the country five times, each time giving speeches to the British Battalion that was part of one of the International Brigades supporting the Republican side. Pollitt also played a role in approving or vetoing applications from British volunteers to join the International Brigades. One such veto was against George Orwell, who Pollitt believed to be politically unreliable. Pollitt was also tasked with writing letters of condolence to the families of British communists killed in Spain.

In August 1937, Pollitt intervened in a dispute between the leadership of the British Battalion regarding tactics, the reliability of Spanish Republican troops that had fought alongside the battalion, and other issues. He recalled the five leading members of the battalion involved in the dispute (Tapsell, Cunningham, Aitken, Copeman, and Williams) to Britain. Copeman and Tapsell, who had been critical of Spanish Republican forces and tactics, were ordered to return to Spain, whilst Cunningham, Williams, and Aitken were ordered to remain in Britain.

===Communications with Moscow and surveillance by MI5===
From 1933 until November 1939, Pollitt was in radio contact with Moscow as the CPGB&#x27;s &quot;code holder&quot;. Contact ceased when he resigned as leader of the CPGB, and the secret code used to communicate with him was changed, though it was re-established in 1941.

From 1931, Olga Gray, an MI5 agent, infiltrated the party, and was for a time Pollitt&#x27;s personal secretary. In Operation MASK (1934–1937), John Tiltman and his colleagues of the Government Code and Cypher School were able to crack the code and decrypt radio messages between Moscow and some of its foreign parties, such as the CPGB. They revealed the Comintern&#x27;s close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt, as well as the substantial financial support the CPGB received from Moscow. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German Communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was &quot;having difficulties&quot; getting British statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. &quot;At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign&quot;. Pollitt went on to complain that he &quot;kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow me to speak. Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal.&quot;

Pollitt also tasked Gray, whose class background would make her less conspicuous aboard an ocean liner than the CPGB&#x27;s mostly working-class membership, with delivering money, instructions, and a questionnaire to a contact in India. The strain of this mission caused Gray to resign as Pollitt&#x27;s secretary, though she remained in touch with Percy Glading, and in 1937 provided evidence that led to the conviction of Glading on spying charges.

CPGB members, including Harry Pollitt, were the subject of continual monitoring efforts by the British security services throughout the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s. These included the planting of a listening device in their King Street offices in 1942. MI5 also had an unidentified source close to Percy Glading who regularly reported Pollitt&#x27;s doings to them (including Pollitt&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Reg Birch), whilst both MI5 and Special Branch had sources at Pollitt&#x27;s 60th birthday celebrations.

===World War II===

With the outbreak of war between the UK and Nazi Germany in early September 1939, despite the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, Pollitt welcomed the British declaration of war on Nazi Germany, calling for a &quot;struggle on two fronts&quot;, involving the &quot;military defeat of Hitler and the political defeat of Chamberlain&quot; in his pamphlet &quot;How To Win The War&quot;, which was also ambivalent about rearmament. When this turned out to be contrary to the Comintern line received from Moscow on 14 September, and reiterated by the CPGB&#x27;s Comintern representative on 24 September (as Rajani Palme Dutt, who succeeded him as General Secretary, had warned him it would be), he was forced to resign. By November 1939, Pollitt had disavowed his previous pro-war position, saying that by supporting the war he had &quot;played into the hands of the class enemy&quot;.

During 1940–41, under instructions from Moscow, the party followed a policy of &quot;revolutionary defeatism&quot;. This was a strategy that assumed that the goals of the Communist Party could be accelerated by quickening the defeat of Britain in the war against Nazi Germany. Douglas Hyde stated that the attitude of those advocating this policy was to regard &quot;the almost inevitable defeat of Britain [...] as a magnificent opportunity&quot;. Pollitt criticised the war policies of the Chamberlain government, describing them as seeking to exploit the war against &quot;Hitler&#x27;s fascism&quot; to &quot;impose certain aspects of that same fascism on the workers&quot;. The anti-war position of the CPGB during 1939-41 was later cited by J. S. Middleton, along with the CPGB&#x27;s perceived lack of independence from Moscow, as a reason for refusing Harry Pollitt&#x27;s application to affiliate the CPGB with the Labour Party.

On instructions from Georgi Dimitrov in Moscow, Pollitt was retained in a six-member political bureau after his removal. He was reinstated as the leader of the CPGB after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, again in response to instructions received from Moscow. Moscow also overturned Dutt&#x27;s previous position of criticising the Churchill government and characterising the war as a struggle for socialism, instead endorsing Pollitt&#x27;s position of offering full support to the Churchill government and avoiding inflaming anti-socialist opinion. Dimitrov, however, had doubts about Pollitt&#x27;s reliability, and in 1942 questioned what he saw as Pollitt&#x27;s &quot;strange behaviour&quot; in allowing what he believed to be the penetration of the CPGB by the British security services, saying that he did not know whether Pollitt was doing this &quot;deliberately&quot; or if &quot;English intelligence is taking advantage of his lack of vigilance&quot;.

After Operation Barbarossa, Harry Pollitt became a strong supporter of the opening of a second front in Europe against Nazi Germany by the Western Allies. Pollitt also urged Jawaharlal Nehru to moderate his demands for Indian independence for the duration of the war. When strike action was proposed during the war, Pollitt was opposed to it as it would damage the war effort. Pollitt&#x27;s adherence to an electoral truce unilaterally called by the CPGB after Operation Barbarossa led to instances of CPGB campaigning in favour of Conservative candidates in wartime by-elections.

As the CPGB&#x27;s membership of the Comintern had been a barrier to affiliation with the Labour Party, Pollitt took the opportunity given by the dissolution of the Comintern in May 1943 to apply again to affiliate with the Labour Party. However, this was again rejected by Labour&#x27;s central committee, who again cited the CPGB&#x27;s previous opposition to the war against Nazi Germany. At the 1945 general election, Politt&#x27;s CPGB pursued a &quot;Progressive Majority&quot; strategy, and sought to coordinate its electoral strategy with the Labour Party, though the Labour Party did not reciprocate. As a result, rather than putting up 50 candidates as had been proposed, the CPGB put up candidates in only 21 seats, of whom only two were returned.

===Post WWII and later life===
Pollitt supported the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia, characterising it as the work of &quot;millions of lads&quot; who were &quot;led by their Shop stewards&quot; to overthrow capitalism. During 1948 Pollitt also condemned the Marshall Plan, calling it a war plan, and called for Ernest Bevin, the then Foreign Secretary, to be fired over what he described as the deliberate prolongation of the talks on the Marshall Plan and the economic impact of Bevin&#x27;s policies.

In 1951 the CPGB adopted &quot;The British Road To Socialism&quot; as their party programme, replacing &quot;For Soviet Britain&quot;. The programme, which was championed by Pollitt, committed the CPGB to independence from Moscow, and a constitutional or parliamentary (as opposed to revolutionary) path to power. Additionally, it stated that the CPGB was committed to decision-making through internal party democracy. In spite of these commitments, the programme had actually been personally dictated to Pollitt by Stalin in a series of secret meetings in the Kremlin.

On the death of Stalin, Pollitt wrote that he had been &quot;the greatest man of our time&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;[n]ever before in the history of humanity ha[d] there been such universal grief&quot; as the people of the world &quot;mourned him with tears in their eyes and with deep uncontrollable sorrow&quot;. Pollitt was also a member of the guard of honour at Stalin&#x27;s funeral.

The advent of Nikita Khrushchev presented the CPGB with problems. The CPGB had followed the Moscow line to attack Tito&#x27;s neutralist government in Yugoslavia; however, when Khrushchev visited Belgrade in 1955, the CPGB was forced to recant these attacks. Pollitt faced another crisis when Khrushchev, in his 1956 Secret Speech, attacked the legacy of Stalin. Pollitt&#x27;s embarrassment was heightened by the fact that he had been present in Moscow for the party congress at which the speech took place, but along with the other foreign delegates had been excluded from the session at which it had been given.

Pollitt, suffering from worsening health in his final years, resigned as General Secretary in May 1956, with John Gollan succeeding him, and was appointed CP Chairman. When Khruschev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin was formally made public the following month, Pollitt stated that he was &quot;too old to go into reverse and denigrate a man he had admired above all others for more than a quarter of a century&quot;. Pollitt also refused to take down a portrait of Stalin that hung in his living room, saying that &quot;He&#x27;s staying there as long as I&#x27;m alive&quot;.

The Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution of November 1956 made the CPGB crisis worse, particularly as the party had taken the position that the Eastern Bloc countries, of which Hungary was one, were allowed to do what they pleased. Pollitt supported the Soviet invasion of Hungary, stating that it had &quot;saved Hungary from fascism&quot;. Most of the party&#x27;s intellectual figures, including Doris Lessing and E. P. Thompson, and many ordinary members resigned. Others, for example Eric Hobsbawm, chose to stay in the party to try to reform it.

In 1959, when British communist journalist Alan Winnington (whom Pollitt had recruited to the CPGB) became disillusioned with Chinese politics, Pollitt arranged for him to travel from China to East Germany, where Winnington spent the remainder of his life as an author and film actor. Winnington was extremely grateful, and after Pollitt&#x27;s death he described him as &quot;the greatest Englishman I have known.&quot;

==Electoral record==
Pollitt contested a number of parliamentary elections, but did not win any. His first electoral outing was in the Durham, Seaham constituency in 1929, where he received 1,431 votes (2.9% of the total vote). He then contested the London East End Stepney, Whitechapel, and St. George&#x27;s constituency in 1930, where he received 2,106 votes (9.6% of votes). He contested the same constituency again in 1931 and received 2,658 votes (11.2% of vote). In 1933 he contested the Derbyshire, Clay Cross constituency and received 3,434 votes (10.6% of the vote). In a 1940 by-election in the Silvertown division of West Ham he received only 966 votes (6.2% of the vote) to the Labour candidate&#x27;s 14,343.

He stood as the CPGB candidate for election in Rhondda East in South Wales three times. In 1935, he lost to the Labour candidate 61.8% to 38.2%, with a margin of 8,433 votes. In the 1945 general election he came within a thousand votes of winning the seat from the Labour candidate, with 15,761 votes (45.5% of the vote) compared to the Labour candidate&#x27;s 16,733 votes (48.4% of the vote). In 1950 he suffered a heavy defeat, receiving only 4,463 votes (12.7% of the vote) compared to the Labour candidate&#x27;s 26,645 votes (75.9% of the vote).

==Death and legacy==

After years of worsening health, Pollitt died at age 69 of a cerebral haemorrhage while returning on the SS &quot;Orion&quot; from a speaking tour of Australia on 27 June 1960. The liner had departed from Adelaide en route to Fremantle, when, at 2 a.m., Pollitt suffered a stroke.
He was cremated at Golders Green on 9 July, and was survived by his wife and two children, Brian and Jean.

The Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester holds the collection of the Communist Party of Great Britain. This collection includes the papers of Pollitt, which covers the years 1920 to 1960.

In 1971, a Soviet-operated, East German-built Type 17 merchant ship was named after Pollitt. The ship was renamed &quot;Natalie&quot; in 1996 and scrapped the next year. A plaque dedicated to the memory of Pollitt was unveiled by the Mayor of Tameside on 22 March 1995 outside Droylsden Library. He is also commemorated in the song &quot;The Ballad of Harry Pollitt&quot;, which was originally written during his lifetime, and hence inaccurately describes his murder. The American folk band The Limeliters included the song on their 1961 album &quot;The Slightly Fabulous Limeliters&quot;. The song was heavily criticised in the April 1972 edition of &quot;Marxism Today&quot;, the official journal of the CPGB, as &quot;sickening&quot; and &quot;full of the vilest insults against the memory of Harry Pollitt&quot;.

<text>CBS News is the news division of the American television and radio broadcaster CBS. It is headquartered in New York City. CBS News television programs include &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, news magazine programs &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and &quot;48 Hours&quot;, and Sunday morning political affairs program &quot;Face the Nation&quot;. CBS News Radio produces hourly newscasts for hundreds of radio stations, and also oversees CBS News podcasts like &quot;The Takeout Podcast&quot;. CBS News also operates CBS News 24/7, a 24-hour digital news network.

Up until April 2021, the president and senior executive producer of CBS News was Susan Zirinsky, who assumed the role on March 1, 2019. Zirinsky, the first female president of the network&#x27;s news division, was announced as the choice to replace David Rhodes on January 6, 2019. The announcement came amid news that Rhodes would step down as president of CBS News &quot;amid falling ratings and the fallout from revelations from an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations&quot; against CBS News figures and Rhodes.

On April 15, 2021, CBS Television Stations and CBS News announced that their respective divisions would merge into one entity, to be named CBS News and Stations. It was also announced that Neeraj Khemlani (former executive vice president of Hearst Newspapers) and Wendy McMahon (former president of the ABC Owned Television Stations Group) were named presidents and co-heads. This transition was completed on May 3, 2021. On August 14, 2023, after Khemlani announced he was stepping down, CBS News named McMahon as its sole president and CEO. The next day on August 15, CBS News appointed Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews, who supervised the Washington, D.C. bureau as its president. She stepped down in July 2024.

==History==
In 1929, the Columbia Broadcasting System began making regular radio news broadcasts, which were five-minute summaries taken from reports from United Press, one of the three wire services that supplied newspapers with national and international news. In December 1930, CBS chief William S. Paley hired journalist Paul W. White away from United Press as CBS&#x27;s news editor. Paley put the radio network&#x27;s news operation at the same level as entertainment, and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted. Along with other networks, CBS chafed at the breaking news embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services, which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print. CBS disregarded an embargo when it broke the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, using live on-the-air reporting. Radio networks scooped print outlets with news of the 1932 presidential election.

In March 1933, White was named vice president and general manager in charge of news at CBS. As the first head of CBS News, he began to build an organization that soon established a legendary reputation.

In 1935, White hired Edward R. Murrow, and sent him to London in 1937 to run CBS Radio&#x27;s European operation. White led a staff that would come to include Richard C. Hottelet, Charles Collingwood, William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Bill Downs, John Charles Daly, Joseph C. Harsch Cecil Brown, Elmer Davis, Quincy Howe, H. V. Kaltenborn, Robert Trout, and Lewis Shollenberger.

&quot;CBS was getting its ducks in a row for the biggest news story in history, World War II&quot;, wrote radio historian John Dunning.

In 1940, William S. Paley recruited Edmund A. Chester from his position as Bureau Chief for Latin America at the Associated Press to coordinate the development of the international shortwave radio Network of the Americas, called &quot;Cadena de las Américas&quot;, in 1942. Broadcasting in concert with the assistance of the Department of State, the Office for Inter-American Affairs chaired by Nelson Rockefeller and Voice of America as part of President Roosevelt&#x27;s support for Pan-Americanism, this CBS radio network provided vital news and cultural programming throughout South America and Central America during the World War II era.

Through its operations in 20 nations, it fostered benevolent diplomatic relations between the United States and other nations in the region while providing an alternative to Nazi propaganda.

===Television===

After becoming commercial station WCBW (channel 2, now WCBS-TV) in 1941, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell (journalist). Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45 p.m. with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes. But that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 &quot;was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.&quot;

Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war. In May 1942, WCBW, like most television stations, sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily because much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts.

In May 1944, as World War II began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, and then by Everett Holles. After the end of World War II, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule – whose call letters were changed to WCBS-TV in 1946 – first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by Douglas Edwards. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring &quot;CBS Television News&quot;, a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30 p.m., and was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC&#x27;s WNBT, which is now WNBC, for a time in the early 1940s, along with Richard Hubbell, Ned Calmer, Everett Holles, and Milo Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City). NBC&#x27;s offering at the time, &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot; (which premiered in February 1948), was simply film footage with voice narration.

In 1948, CBS Radio journalist Edmund Chester emerged as the television network&#x27;s new Director of News Special Events and Sports.

In 1949, Chester collaborated with one of CBS&#x27; original Murrow Boys, Larry LeSueur, to produce the innovative news series &quot;United Nations In Action&quot;. Underwritten by Ford Motor Company as a public service, the broadcasts endeavored to provide live coverage of the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly from its interim headquarters in Lake Success, New York. They proved to be successful, and were honored with a George Foster Peabody Award for Television News in 1949.
In 1950, the name of the nightly newscast was changed to &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot;, and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting &quot;Good evening everyone, coast to coast.&quot; In 1962, the broadcast was renamed the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; when Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards. Edwards remained with CBS News, contributing to various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.

From the 1990s until 2014, CBS News operated its own production unit CBS News Productions, to produce alternative programming for cable networks, and CBS EyeToo Productions, later renamed CBS Eye Productions, a company that produced documentaries and nonfiction programs.

CBS News ran a cable channel, CBS Eye on People, from 1997 to 2000, and Spanish language channel CBS Telenoticias from 1996 to 1998.

In 2021, CBS News had set up its own production unit. See It Now Studios, which was headed by Susan Zirinsky.

In 2022, CBS News hired former Trump administration official Mick Mulvaney as a paid on-air contributor. Mulvaney&#x27;s hiring stirred controversy within the company due to his history of promoting Donald Trump&#x27;s false claims and attacking the press. CBS News co-president Neeraj Khemlani told CBS morning show staff, &quot;If you look at some of the people that we&#x27;ve been hiring on a contributor basis, being able to make sure that we are getting access to both sides of the aisle is a priority because we know the Republicans are going to take over, most likely, in the midterms&quot;.

President Donald Trump sued CBS News over a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, alleging that the network engaged in election interference through deceptive editing.
 The lawsuit, which seeks $10 billion in damages, claims that CBS violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by airing two different edits of Harris&#x27; response to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 As of February 6, 2025, CBS&#x27;s parent company, Paramount Global, is reportedly considering settling the lawsuit ahead of a planned merger with Skydance Media, despite the network&#x27;s initial statement that it would &quot;vigorously defend&quot; against the suit.

In 2025, Norah O&#x27;Donnell, who was based in the CBS News bureau in Washington, D.C., for over five years, departed, resulting in &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to once again be broadcast from the CBS Broadcast Center&#x27;s historic Studio 47 in New York City. &quot;Face the Nation&quot; host and CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan, however, continue to be based in Washington D.C.

==Broadcast history==

The information on programs listed in this section came directly from CBS News in interviews with the Vice President of Communications and NewsWatch Dallas.

According to the CBS News Library and source Sandy Genelius (Vice President, CBS News Communications), the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was the program title for both Saturday and Sunday evening broadcasts. The program title for the Sunday late night news beginning in 1963 was the &quot;CBS Sunday Night News&quot;. These titles were also seen on the intro slide of the program&#x27;s opening. The program airs on Saturday, and Sunday nights at 7:00 p.m.–7:30 p.m. UTC (Eastern Time) on CBS.

==CBS News Radio==

CBS News produces newscasts and features for radio stations through CBS News Radio, which is the oldest unit of CBS and tracings its roots to the company&#x27;s founding in 1927, and the news division took shape over the decade that followed. The list of CBS News correspondents (below) includes those reporting on CBS News Radio.

CBS News Radio produces the oldest daily news show on radio or television, the &quot;CBS World News Roundup&quot;, which first aired in 1938; in 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary. The &quot;World News Roundup&quot; airs twice every weekday, broadcasting a morning edition anchored by Steve Kathan and produced by Paul Farry, and a late edition anchored by Dave Barrett and produced by James Hutton. The evening &quot;Roundup&quot;, previously known as &quot;The World Tonight&quot;, has aired in its current form since 1956, and has been anchored by Blair Clark, Douglas Edwards, Dallas Townsend, and Christopher Glenn, Glenn also anchored the morning &quot;Roundup&quot; prior to his death in 2006.

CBS Radio Network provides newscasts at the top of the hour, regular updates at :31 minutes past the hour, the popular Newsfeeds for affiliates, including WCBS in New York City and KYW in Philadelphia, at :35 minutes past the hour, and breaking news updates when developments warrant, often at :20 and :50 minutes past the hour. Skyview Networks handles the distribution.

==CBS Newspath==
CBS Newspath is CBS News&#x27; satellite news-gathering service, similar in format to CNN Newsource. Newspath provides national hard news, sports highlights, regional spot news, features and live coverage of major breaking news events for affiliate stations to use in their local news broadcasts. The service has a team of domestic and global correspondents and freelance reporters dedicated to reporting for affiliates, and offers several different national or international stories fronted by reporters on a daily basis. CBS Newspath also relies heavily on local affiliates sharing content. Stations will often contribute locally obtained footage that may be of national interest. It replaced a similar service, CBS News NewsNet.

In late 1999, the news-gathering arms of CBS (Newspath), ABC (NewsOne) and Fox (NewsEdge) agreed to form a joint-venture footage sharing pool, known as &quot;Network News Service&quot;.

==CBS News 24/7==
CBS News 24/7 is a 24-hour streaming news channel which launched on November 4, 2014, as CBSN. At the time as CBSN, the channel features live news from 9a.m. to midnight on weekdays. The channel makes all of the resources of CBS News available directly on digital platforms with live, anchored coverage 15 hours each week. It is a first for a U.S. 24-hour news channel to forgo cable and be available exclusively only online and on smart devices such as smart TV&#x27;s Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire and others. The channel is based at CBS&#x27;s New York City headquarters.

The morning hours are typically anchored by Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers, with afternoons anchored by a rotating team including Lilia Luciano, Tony Dokoupil, Errol Barnett, Lana Zak and Elaine Quijano. Various correspondents in Washington D.C. anchor a late-afternoon political program titled, &#x27;America Decides&#x27; and John Dickerson anchors &quot;The Daily Report&quot;, which airs Mondays through Thursdays.

==Reporting partnerships==
In 2017, CBS News entered into a content-sharing agreement with BBC News, respectively replacing previous arrangements between the BBC and ABC News, and CBS and Sky News (which was partially controlled by 21st Century Fox until 2018 when ownership was then transferred to Comcast). The partnership includes the ability to share resources, footage, and reports, and conduct &quot;efficient planning of news gathering resources to increase the content of each broadcaster&#x27;s coverage of world events&quot;.

Although they do not have an official partnership, CNN and CBS News share correspondents and contributors, including Anderson Cooper and Sanjay Gupta.

In 2022, CBS News entered into a content-sharing partnership with The Weather Channel, where The Weather Channel meteorologists will appear on CBS News programs, and CBS News correspondents will appear during live coverage of weather events on The Weather Channel.

== Controversies ==

Throughout the years, numerous conservative activists have accused CBS News of perpetuating a liberal bias in its news coverage.

<text>Michael Hugh Meacher (4 November 1939 – 20 October 2015) was a British politician who served as a government minister under Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Tony Blair. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oldham West and Royton, previously Oldham West, from 1970 until his death in 2015.

Before entering politics, Meacher was a lecturer in social administration at the University of Essex and the University of York.

==Early life and education==
Meacher was born in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire on 4 November 1939, into a family with links to brewing and agriculture. He was the only child of (George) Hubert Meacher and his wife Doris (née Foxell). His father worked in finance, before a breakdown saw him return to the family farm. With the family having little money, his mother took in lodgers and worked for a local doctor; she had aspirations for Michael to become an Anglican priest. Hubert Meacher&#x27;s first cousin was the judge Clement Bailhache.

Meacher was educated at Berkhamsted School, at the time an all-boys independent school, to which he won a scholarship. He then studied at New College, Oxford where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in classics and divinity, and at the London School of Economics, where he gained a Diploma in Social Administration.

==Life and career==
Meacher became a researcher and lecturer in social administration at the Essex and York universities and wrote a book about elderly people&#x27;s treatment in mental hospitals. He was the Labour Party candidate for Colchester at the 1966 general election, and fought the 1968 Oldham West by-election following the resignation of Labour MP Leslie Hale but lost to Conservative candidate Bruce Campbell.

===In Parliament===

====Junior minister and Shadow Cabinet====
Meacher was first elected to Parliament in 1970 for Oldham West, reversing his previous defeat, and served as a junior minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan (Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Industry, 1974–75; Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health and Social Security, 1975–79).

During Labour&#x27;s time in opposition, he was in the Shadow cabinet for fourteen years, and concurrently lectured at the LSE. He was seen as a figure on the left and an ally of Tony Benn, and stood as the left&#x27;s candidate against Roy Hattersley in the 1983 deputy leadership election.

==== Blair Ministry ====
Meacher was an elected member of the Shadow Cabinet from 1983 to 1997, but Tony Blair refused to appoint him to the Cabinet, and instead made him Minister of State for the Environment, first at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1997–2001), then at the renamed Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2001–2003).

Despite Blair&#x27;s hostility, Meacher gained a reputation for being a politician who was on top of a complex brief and was one of the longest serving ministers in the same job in the Labour Government, from 1997 to 2003. He was criticised for hypocrisy when he condemned second home owners; according to the BBC and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot;, he and his wife owned more than five homes themselves.

==== Political activities after 2003 ====
Meacher was sacked in June 2003, and replaced by Elliot Morley. He subsequently attacked the Labour government on a number of issues, particularly over genetically modified food and the 2003 Iraq War, though in the run-up to the invasion he had accepted reports by the intelligence services and government, saying that Iraq had chemical weapons.

Meacher claimed that a supposed absence of prevention by United States authorities of the September 11 attacks was &quot;suspicious&quot; and &quot;offered an extremely convenient pretext&quot; for subsequent military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. This was seen as giving &quot;credence to conspiracy theories&quot; as claimed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Meacher also wrote a foreword for David Ray Griffin&#x27;s book &quot;The New Pearl Harbor&quot;.

In May 2005, Meacher introduced an early day motion on climate change, which called upon the government to commit to yearly CO2 emission reductions of 3%.

In June 2006 various articles appeared in the British media claiming Meacher would stand as a stalking horse against Tony Blair in order to initiate a leadership contest; others suggested, especially after Gordon Brown came out in support of the Trident missile programme and nuclear energy, that Meacher would challenge Brown from the left. 

On 23 September 2006, Meacher became the sixth Labour MP to start a blog. Meacher also wrote articles for ePolitix.com, which included criticism of Blair and Brown for perceived right-wing policies, including privatisation. He also called for a more conciliatory policy in the Middle East, attempts to tackle income inequality, and a greater commitment to reducing energy use.

On 22 February 2007, Meacher declared that he would be standing, challenging Brown and John McDonnell. However, on 14 May, after talks with McDonnell, he announced he would stand aside in order to back McDonnell as the &quot;candidate of the left&quot;.

In December 2013, Meacher attacked the firm Atos and its Work Capability Assessments of disabled people carried out on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions, in a sustained campaign documented through his blog. Meacher was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the leadership election of 2015.

==Leadership bid==
On 22 February 2007, Meacher declared his intention to stand for the leadership of the Labour Party. The decisions of both Meacher and John McDonnell to run for the leadership were controversial with many accusing Meacher of trying to split the nominations and keep McDonnell off the ballot paper, although neither candidate was thought to have any chance of winning the contest.

On 21 April 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that Meacher had the support of no more than three MPs and that his campaign was &quot;virtually dead in the water&quot;.

On 27 April 2007, it was reported that Meacher had reached an agreement with McDonnell that upon the day Blair announced his resignation, whichever of the two had fewer nominations would step aside and allow the other to challenge Gordon Brown. On 14 May 2007, Meacher agreed to stand aside to allow McDonnell to be the sole leadership candidate of the left. Subsequent articles reported that Meacher had 21 declarations of support while McDonnell had 24. In the Labour Party&#x27;s leadership nomination process, McDonnell received nominations from 29 MPs.

==Outside Parliament==
Meacher appeared as himself in one episode of the BBC drama serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1985).

In June 1988, Meacher lost a libel action against journalist Alan Watkins, who had written an article in November 1984 that included the remark that Meacher &quot;likes to claim that he is the son of an agricultural labourer, though I understand that his father was an accountant who retired to work on the family farm because the life suited him better.&quot;

Meacher was a member of Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth, which petitioned President Obama for an independent investigation into the September 11 attacks not led by &quot;individuals closely aligned with, or even employed by, the Bush-Cheney administration.&quot;

Meacher was a member of the Fabian Society.

==Personal life==

Meacher married Molly Reid in 1962; they had four children and divorced in 1987. The following year, he married Lucianne Sawyer. In January 2001, he faced claims of political hypocrisy, when it was revealed that he and Lucianne owned at least nine buy to let properties as investments.

Meacher died from lung cancer at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London on 20 October 2015, at the age of 75, and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>Philip Piratin (15 May 1907 – 10 December 1995) was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and one of the four CPGB Members of Parliament during the first thirty years of its existence. (The others were Shapurji Saklatvala, Walton Newbold and Willie Gallacher.)

==Political career==
Piratin was the son of a small local tradesman and attended Davenant Foundation School. He became a Communist activist, anti-fascist and defender of tenants&#x27; rights, a leading member of the Stepney Tenants Defence League. Of Jewish origin, he was the leader of the opposition to Oswald Mosley&#x27;s antisemitism and his British Union of Fascists&#x27; marches through East London. Piratin was elected to Stepney Borough Council in 1937 and was Chairman of the borough&#x27;s Communist Party. During World War II, he gained further notice by leading 100 people to shelter from the Blitz in the basement of the Savoy Hotel, to persuade the Government to open the London Underground stations to anyone sheltering from the bombing, a practice which the Government had previously ruled out, but which then became widespread.

Piratin was elected at the 1945 General Election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Mile End in Stepney, becoming one of the last two CPGB MPs. In Parliament, he worked with several left-wing Labour MPs, some of whom would be expelled by their party as crypto-communists and form the Labour Independent Group. He was defeated when he stood for re-election in 1950 in the new constituency of Stepney; his old seat of Mile End had been abolished due to boundary changes.

Until 1957, Piratin was the circulation manager of the communist newspaper &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, but he left early that year, ostensibly over a matter of process. However, in 1991 he told Alison Macleod about his doubts at the time: &quot;In 1956, Phil said, he drove to Oxford, to defend the Party line on Hungary at a meeting of undergraduates. He got as far as outside the hall, stopped – and drove home again. Phil remained in the Party, but he never again worked for it full time. Piratin later became a businessman.&quot;

<doc id="359558" wikidata="Q1639223" url="?curid=359558" title="John Stonehouse">
<text>John Thomson Stonehouse (28 July 192514 April 1988) was a British Labour and Co-operative Party politician, businessman and minister who was a member of the Cabinet under Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He is remembered for his unsuccessful attempt at faking his own death in 1974. It is alleged that Stonehouse had been an agent for Czechoslovak military intelligence.

==Early life and education==
John Thomson Stonehouse was born on 28 July 1925 in Southampton, the second son and youngest of four children of Post Office engineer and later dockyard engine-fitter William Mitchell Stonehouse, and Rosina Marie (née Taylor). His father was local secretary of his trade union; Stonehouse joined the Labour Party at the age of sixteen. His mother, a former scullery maid, was the sixth female mayor of Southampton and a councillor on Southampton City Council from 1936 to 1970. 

Stonehouse was educated at Taunton&#x27;s School (now Richard Taunton Sixth Form College), Southampton, and served as a Royal Air Force pilot from 1944 until 1946. He then attended the London School of Economics (LSE), where he read for a BSc (Econ.) degree. During his time at the LSE, he was chairman of both the chess club and the Labour society. The political scientist Bernard Crick, who was a contemporary of Stonehouse at university, recalls that his then nickname was &#x27;Lord John&#x27;, and that &quot;his conversation was openly and restlessly about how best to get a parliamentary seat.&quot;

==Political career==
Stonehouse stood unsuccessfully in Norwood at the 1949 London County Council election. He was first elected as the Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament (MP) for Wednesbury in Staffordshire in a 1957 by-election, having contested Twickenham in 1950 and Burton in 1951.

In February 1959, Stonehouse travelled to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on a fact-finding tour in which he condemned the white minority government of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Speaking to the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, he encouraged Rhodesian blacks to stand up for their rights and said they had the support of the British Labour Party. Stonehouse was promptly deported from Southern Rhodesia and banned from returning a year later.

Stonehouse served as a junior minister of aviation, where he was involved in the British Overseas Airways Corporation&#x27;s order of Boeing 707 aircraft from the United States, against his own recommendation that they should buy the Super Vickers VC10, a British-made aircraft. This led to accusations by Stonehouse against colleagues about the reasons for the decision. In March 1968, Stonehouse negotiated an agreement providing a framework for the long-term development of technological co-operation between Britain and Czechoslovakia providing for the exchange of specialists and information, facilities for study and research in technology, and such other forms of industrial co-operation which might be agreed.

Stonehouse&#x27;s rise continued while in the Colonial Office, and in 1967 he became Minister for Technology under Wilson. He later served as Postmaster General until the position was abolished by the Post Office Act 1969.

As Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in 1970, Stonehouse oversaw the controversial jamming of the offshore radio station Radio North Sea International. When Labour was defeated at the 1970 general election, he was not appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.

When the Wednesbury constituency was abolished in 1974, Stonehouse stood for and was elected to the nearby Walsall North constituency in the February general election. With Labour now governing in minority, another election was called in September, and Stonehouse was re-elected with an increased majority of nearly 16,000 in the October election, just six weeks before his disappearance. Stonehouse&#x27;s last Parliamentary contribution before his disappearance was at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 14 November 1974, a few days before leaving for Miami, Florida.

==Spy allegations==
Stonehouse allegedly began spying for Czechoslovakia in 1962. In a meeting with Harold Wilson in 1969, Stonehouse was informed of assertions that he was a Czechoslovak secret service agent; the informant was a defector from the Czechoslovak secret service, who had been debriefed by the US security services. At that time, Stonehouse successfully defended himself. In 2009, the spy allegation was substantiated in the official history of MI5, &quot;The Defence of the Realm&quot; (2009) by Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew. In December 2010, it was revealed that Margaret Thatcher had agreed to cover up revelations that Stonehouse had been a Czechoslovak spy in 1980, as there was insufficient evidence to bring him to trial. Until the 2012 exposure of Ray Mawby, briefly a member of a Conservative government, Stonehouse was the only Minister known to have been an agent for the former Eastern bloc.

==Business interests==
Having lost his ministerial salary in 1970, Stonehouse set up various companies in an attempt to supplement his salary as an MP. By 1974 most of these companies were facing financial trouble, and Stonehouse had resorted to deceptive creative accounting. Aware that the Department of Trade and Industry was looking at his affairs, Stonehouse decided that his best choice would be to flee the country. Secret government documents, declassified in 2005, indicate that Stonehouse spent months rehearsing his new identity as &#x27;Joseph Markham&#x27;, the deceased husband of a constituent.

== Disappearance ==
Stonehouse maintained the pretence of normality until he faked his death on 20 November 1974, leaving a pile of clothes on a beach in Miami to make it appear that he had suffered a fatal misadventure while swimming. Stonehouse was presumed dead, and obituaries were published in British newspapers despite the fact that no corpse had been found. In reality, Stonehouse was &quot;en route&quot; to Australia, some away, hoping to set up a new life with his mistress and secretary, Sheila Buckley.

Using false identities, Stonehouse set about transferring large sums of money between banks as a further means of covering his tracks. Under the name of &#x27;Clive Mildoon&#x27;, he deposited A$21,500 in cash at the Bank of New Zealand. The teller who handled the money later spotted &#x27;Mildoon&#x27; at the Bank of New South Wales. Inquiries led the teller to learn that the money was in the name of &#x27;Joseph Markham&#x27;, and he informed the local police. Stonehouse visited Copenhagen with Buckley around this time and returned to Australia unaware that he was now under surveillance. The Australian police initially suspected him of being Lord Lucan, who had disappeared a fortnight before Stonehouse, following the murder of his children&#x27;s nanny. They contacted Scotland Yard, requesting pictures of both Lucan and Stonehouse. On his arrest, the police instructed Stonehouse to pull down his trousers in an attempt to establish whether or not he was Lucan, who had a scar on the inside of his right thigh.

=== Arrest and aftermath ===
Stonehouse was arrested in Melbourne on 24 December 1974. He applied for the position of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds while still in Australia (one of the ways for an MP to resign), but decided not to sign the papers. On 17 July 1975, Stonehouse was extradited to the UK, escorted by Scotland Yard officers. He was remanded in Brixton Prison until August 1975 when he was released on bail. Stonehouse continued to serve as an MP; on 20 October 1975 he made a personal statement to the House of Commons, stating his reasons for his disappearance, his first Parliamentary oration since his disappearance almost a year earlier:

Although unhappy with the situation, the Labour Party did not expel Stonehouse as their parliamentary majority was very narrow. On 4 April 1976 Stonehouse attended a St George&#x27;s Day festival hosted by the English National Party; he later confirmed he had joined the party, making Labour a minority government.

Stonehouse conducted his own defence on twenty-one charges of fraud, theft, forgery, conspiracy to defraud, causing a false police investigation and wasting police time. His trial lasted 68 days. On 6 August 1976, Stonehouse was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud, and received a criminal bankruptcy order. He agreed to resign as a Privy Counsellor on 17 August 1976, becoming one of only three people to resign from the Privy Council in the 20th century. Stonehouse tendered his resignation via the Chiltern Hundreds route from the House of Commons on 27 August 1976. The subsequent by-election was won by Robin Hodgson, a Conservative. In October 1976, Stonehouse was declared bankrupt.

Stonehouse was imprisoned in HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs. On 30 June 1977, the House of Lords refused his appeal against five of the charges of which he was convicted. While he was in prison, Stonehouse complained that the prison workshop where he worked played a pop music radio station. He made acquaintance with Moors murderer Ian Brady, and the pair played chess together until Brady was transferred elsewhere. When his health deteriorated, Stonehouse was moved to HM Prison Blundeston in Suffolk.

==Health problems==
On 14 August 1979, Stonehouse was released early because of good behaviour and because he had suffered three heart attacks; he had the first on 18 April 1977, a second one four days later, and a massive heart attack on 13 August 1978. On 6 September 1978, Stonehouse suffered a coronary ischemia attack which required him to spend three days in hospital. He underwent open heart surgery on 7 November 1978 which lasted for six hours.

==After release==

From January 1980, Stonehouse was a volunteer fundraiser for the East London-based charity, Community Links. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which later amalgamated with the Liberal Party to become the Liberal Democrats. In June 1980, he was discharged from bankruptcy. 

Stonehouse wrote three novels and made numerous television and radio appearances during the rest of his life, mostly in connection with discussing his disappearance. In June 1986 he appeared on TVS&#x27;s &quot;Regrets&quot; programme and in December that year on the BBC Radio 4 interview programme &quot;In The Psychiatrist&#x27;s Chair&quot; with Anthony Clare.

==Personal life==

Stonehouse married Barbara Joan Smith in 1948, the marriage produced three children. After their divorce in 1978, Stonehouse married his mistress, Sheila Elizabeth Buckley (née Black), in Hampshire on 31 January 1981, the marriage produced one child.

Stonehouse&#x27;s daughter Julia published an account of her father&#x27;s life in 2021 entitled &quot;John Stonehouse, My Father: The True Story of the Runaway MP&quot;; it was released almost simultaneously with a book called &quot;Stonehouse: Cabinet Minister, Fraudster, Spy&quot;, by criminal defence solicitor Julian Hayes, who is Stonehouse&#x27;s great nephew through the author&#x27;s father, Michael Hayes, who was the MP&#x27;s nephew and his lawyer. Julia has an eponymous website in which she questions the veracity of other books and broadcasts about her father.

==Death==
On 25 March 1988, Stonehouse collapsed on set during an edition of &quot;Central Weekend&quot; in Birmingham during the filming of a programme about missing people. He was given emergency medical treatment at the studio and an ambulance was called. He was diagnosed as having suffered a minor heart attack and kept in the city&#x27;s general hospital overnight. Just under three weeks later, early on 14 April, he suffered a massive heart attack at his house at Dales Way in Totton, Hampshire, where he had moved six months earlier, having lived in London since his release from prison, his last address there having been at 20 Shirland Mews. This time Stonehouse could not be saved and he died in hospital at 2:30am, aged 62.

Stonehouse was cremated in Bassett Green, Southampton, on 22 April 1988. The former MP Bruce Douglas-Mann paid tribute. In 1989, his fourth novel was published posthumously.

==Television series==

The British ITV series &quot;Stonehouse&quot;, a dramatisation of Stonehouse&#x27;s story, was first broadcast from 2 to 4 January 2023. The series starred Matthew Macfadyen and Keeley Hawes and was directed by Jon S. Baird from a script by John Preston.

<text>Kosteletzkya pentacarpos, the seashore mallow, also known as the saltmarsh mallow, sweat weed, Virginia saltmarsh mallow, or hibiscus à cinq carpelles, is an herb found in marshes along the eastern seashore of North America, parts of coastal Southern Europe, southwestern Russia, and Western Asia.

== Taxonomy ==
This flowering plant is in family Malvaceae of the order Malvales. Populations in North America were previously known as &quot;Kosteletzkya virginica&quot; to distinguish them from the Eurasian &quot;K. pentacarpos&quot;, but both species were merged in 2008 due being morphologically identical to one another.

== Description ==
The pink-flowered seashore mallow is both a perennial and a halophyte, or salt-tolerant plant, that grows in areas where other plants cannot. The plant can grow to above 1 metre in height, the leaves are 6–14 cm long, cordate to lanceolate with toothed margins. The stems and leaves are hairy. Flowers are 5–8 cm across, with 5 petals surrounding a tube consisting of the fused stamens and style. It blooms from July to October with pale to deep pink flowers. It is occasionally planted in gardens.

== Distribution ==
This species is found throughout much of the Atlantic and Gulf coastlines of eastern North America, from New York south to Cuba, east to Bermuda, and west to Texas. It also has a fragmented distribution along the Mediterranean shoreline of southern Europe, including parts of coastal Spain &amp; Italy, the Balearic Islands, and Corsica. Populations in northern Italy are thought to be introduced. One very small population is known from Georgia, on the coast of the Black Sea. It is also found along the western and southern shorelines of the Caspian Sea in Iran and Azerbaijan. This species is also found along the Volga and Don Rivers in southwestern Russia, but it is unknown whether these populations have natural origins.

== Threats ==
While this species is common throughout its North American range, populations in Eurasia are rare and have been severely fragmented by agricultural and urban development, and over the past few decades it has been lost from many localities where it was previously known.

== Uses ==
In ancient Transcaucasia, &quot;K. pentacarpos&quot; and &quot;Hibiscus ponticus&quot; were abundant enough to be harvested in large numbers for their strong stem fibers, which were useful for making ropes and nets. In addition, studies indicate that &quot;K. pentacarpos&quot; is a potentially useful species for phytoremediation of saline soils polluted by metalloids, and can also facilitate the transition of coastal agricultural land to wetlands following sea level rise.

<doc id="359571" wikidata="Q591175" url="?curid=359571" title="The Life of David Gale">
<text>The Life of David Gale is a 2003 crime thriller film directed and co-produced by Alan Parker, written by Charles Randolph, co-produced by Nicolas Cage, and starring Kevin Spacey as the title character, a college professor and longtime activist against capital punishment who is sentenced to death for killing a fellow capital punishment opponent; Kate Winslet, Laura Linney, and Gabriel Mann co-star. The film, an international co-production between the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, was Parker&#x27;s final film before his retirement, and subsequent death in 2020.

Released in the United States on February 21, 2003, it received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed just $38.9 million against its $38 million budget.

==Plot==

David Gale is a former professor on death row in Texas. With only a few days until his execution, his lawyer negotiates a half-million dollar fee to tell his story to Bitsey Bloom, a journalist from a major news network. She has a reputation for keeping secrets and protecting her sources. He tells her his story revealed through a series of flashbacks.

In 1994, Gale is a successful intellectual and the head of the philosophy department at the University of Texas at Austin. He is an active member of DeathWatch, an advocacy group campaigning against capital punishment. At a graduation party, he encounters Berlin, a graduate student who has been expelled from the school. When Gale gets drunk, she seduces him and they have rough sex. She then falsely accuses Gale of rape. The next day, he loses a televised debate with the Governor of Texas when he is unable to name any innocent people executed during the governor&#x27;s term. Gale is arrested, but the charge is dropped when Berlin disappears. However, his marriage, career, and reputation are all destroyed. Gale struggles with alcoholism after his wife Sharon takes their son with her to Spain and disallows contact.

Constance Harraway, a fellow DeathWatch activist, is a close friend of Gale who consoles him after his life falls apart. However, Harraway is discovered raped and murdered, suffocated by a plastic bag taped over her head. An autopsy reveals Gale&#x27;s semen in her body and that she had been forced to swallow the key to the handcuffs, a Securitate&#x27;s torture technique which Gale previously wrote about. The physical evidence at the crime scene points to Gale, who is convicted of rape and murder and is sentenced to death.

In the present, Bloom investigates the case in between her visits with Gale. Gale maintains his innocence, claiming he and Harraway had consensual sex the night before her murder. Bloom comes to believe that the apparent evidence against Gale does not add up. She is tailed several times in her car by Dusty Wright, an alleged one-time lover and colleague of Harraway, whom she suspects was the real killer. Wright slips evidence to Bloom that suggests Gale has been framed, implying that the actual murderer videotaped the crime. Bloom pursues this lead until she finds a tape revealing that Harraway, who was suffering from terminal leukemia, had committed an elaborate suicide made to look like murder. Wright is seen on the videotape, acting as her accomplice, implying that they framed Gale as part of a plan to discredit the death penalty by conspiring to execute an innocent person, and subsequently releasing evidence of the actual circumstances.

Once Bloom and her aide find this evidence, only hours remain until Gale&#x27;s scheduled execution. She tries to give the tape to the authorities in time to stop the execution. She arrives at the Huntsville Unit just as the warden announces that the execution has been carried out. The tape is subsequently released, causing a media and political uproar over the execution of an innocent man. Later, Wright receives the money that Bloom&#x27;s magazine agreed to pay for the interview, and delivers it to Sharon, along with a postcard from Berlin confessing that the rape accusation that derailed Gale&#x27;s life and career was false. Sharon looks distraught, knowing Gale told the truth and that she effectively stole their child away from him.

Later, a videotape labeled &quot;Off the Record&quot; is delivered to Bloom. This tape shows Harraway&#x27;s suicide and Gale deliberately leaving his fingerprints on the plastic bag in the process. He then looks at the camera and ends the recording, leaving Bloom stunned with the truth that the couple deliberately sacrificed themselves to discredit capital punishment.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; was shot in multiple places, including several notable locations in Austin, Barcelona, and Huntsville, Texas, such as Sam Houston State University, Ellis Unit, The University of Texas at Austin, and Plaça Reial.

Laura Linney said the scene in the kitchen where she&#x27;s handcuffed naked was one of the roughest scenes she has ever done.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; holds an approval rating of 19% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Instead of offering a convincing argument against the death penalty, this implausible, convoluted thriller pounds the viewer over the head with its message.&quot; At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film a rare zero stars and stated in his review &quot;I am sure the filmmakers believe their film is against the death penalty. I believe it supports it and hopes to discredit the opponents of the penalty as unprincipled fraudsters.… Spacey and Parker are honorable men. Why did they go to Texas and make this silly movie? The last shot made me want to throw something at the screen – maybe Spacey and Parker.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s &quot;At the Movies&quot; co-host Richard Roeper positively reviewed the film calling it &quot;A dazzling mess.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack (composed by Alex and Jake Parker) has been used in various film trailers, specifically the tracks &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; and &quot;Almost Martyrs&quot;. The score has been used in the trailers for &quot;World Trade Center&quot;, &quot;Munich&quot;, &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot;, &quot;Milk&quot;, &quot;The Artist&quot; and &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;.

==Perceptions on capital punishment==
In the Philippines, long-time senator and 2022 presidential aspirant Ping Lacson credited this film in changing his mind on capital punishment. Lacson, who previously served as the nation&#x27;s chief of police, was a staunch advocate of capital offense for heinous crimes. However, after seeing the film on Netflix, he said that &quot;my eyes were opened…that it is more important to save the life of someone innocent and convicted than to execute someone who is really convicted and proven to have committed a crime.&quot; Afterwards, he withdrew his authorship of a bill proposing the death penalty for heinous crimes.

<doc id="359573" wikidata="Q2856095" url="?curid=359573" title="Wisconsin Public Radio">
<text>Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) is a network of 38 public radio stations in the state of Wisconsin. WPR&#x27;s network is divided into two distinct services, the &quot;WPR News Network&quot; and the &quot;WPR Music Network&quot;.

==History==
Wisconsin Public Radio has origins that date to 1914. For history prior to the formation of Wisconsin Public Radio, see WHA (AM). 

The first real steps toward the building of what would become Wisconsin Public Radio began in 1947, with the sign-on of WHA-FM (now WERN) as a sister station to WHA. Between 1948 and 1965, seven more FM stations signed on as part of what was initially dubbed Wisconsin Educational Radio. The network became Wisconsin Public Radio in 1971, when it became a charter member of National Public Radio. Shortly afterward, the merger of the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin State University systems into the present-day University of Wisconsin System greatly increased WPR&#x27;s reach.

==WPR News==

WPR News is devoted mostly to NPR syndicated programming and WPR produced media. During the week, the WPR News airs &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;On Point&quot;, &quot;1A&quot;, &quot;Science Friday&quot;, along with a mix of national programs including &quot;Reveal&quot;, &quot;Latino USA&quot; and &quot;The Moth Radio Hour&quot;, and overnight, the BBC World Service. 

In election years, expanded political coverage occurs, along with WPR often coordinating in part political debates for the state&#x27;s highest offices such as Governor and Attorney General, often with PBS Wisconsin (formerly Wisconsin Public Television).

On the weekend, it airs WPR-produced shows, such as &quot;Zorba Paster On Your Health&quot; and &quot;To the Best of Our Knowledge&quot;. Weekends also include NPR/PRI/APM entertainment programming such as &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, &quot;Ask Me Another&quot;, &quot;Radiolab&quot; and &quot;Live from Here&quot; (the former &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;) on Saturdays, with &quot;Says You!&quot;, &quot;A Way with Words&quot;, &quot;Milk Street Radio&quot;, &quot;Bullseye with Jesse Thorn&quot;, and &quot;This American Life&quot; on Sundays. Other WPR-originated programming on the weekends include: &quot;University of the Air&quot;, the folk music focused &quot;Simply Folk&quot;, and &quot;PRX Remix&quot;. 

The flagship station of the WPR News is WHA 970 AM in Madison, one of the oldest existing radio stations in the world, and WERN 88.7 FM in Madison. Most WPR News stations broadcast in analog monaural sound to provide those signals the largest coverage areas possible, while the HD Radio and Internet streaming feeds broadcast in stereo.

Prior to 2024, the network hosted two call in shows during the morning and evening drive times, &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and &quot;Central Time&quot;. &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, a program of world music hosted by Dr. Jonathan Overby, is broadcast on Saturday night on WHAD, WPR&#x27;s Ideas Network station in Milwaukee, and otherwise heard on WPR&#x27;s News &amp; Classical Music stations around the state. 

The network carried old time radio programming on weekend evenings, but discontinued doing so in June 2020 due to the racial and sexist views of the era proving outdated and offensive to general audiences.

Personalities hosting call-in talk shows on the Ideas Network (as of November 2017) included Kate Archer Kent (early morning weekdays), and &quot;Central Time&quot; with Rob Ferrett and various co-hosts (afternoon drive time). On the typical weekday, the Ideas Network broadcast over seven hours of live, Wisconsin-produced call-in talk shows.

==WPR Music==

The &quot;WPR Music&quot; network broadcasts locally produced and syndicated classical music program 24 hours a day. Local programs include &quot;Morning Classics with Stephanie Elkins&quot;, &quot;Midday Classics with Norman Gilliland&quot;, &quot;Afternoon Classics with Jason Heilman&quot;, &quot;Drivetime Classics with Jason Heilman&quot;, &quot;Classics by Request with Ruthanne Bessman&quot;, &quot;BETA&quot;, &quot;The Road to Higher Ground with Jonathan Overby&quot;, &quot;Wisconsin Classical with Lori Skelton&quot;, &quot;Simply Folk with Sile Shigley&quot;, &quot;The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra Broadcast Network&quot;, and &quot;Chapter A Day&quot;. Syndicated programming mostly includes content from Classical 24. Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts air during the opera season. Syndicated Jazz music is heard on Friday and Saturday nights. 

Prior to 2024, &quot;NPR News &amp; Music Network&quot;, formerly the &quot;NPR News &amp; Classical Network&quot;, was originally devoted to classical music, along with carrying the national NPR News programs &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, though its news and talk programs increased since the early 2000s. It carried the syndicated Classical 24 network in non-prime hours, while daily classical programming originated from Madison.

In addition to the programs above, this network carried &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, APM&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot;, the BBC World Service&#x27;s &quot;Newshour&quot;, and &quot;Live from Here&quot;. Other forms of music such as blues, new-age, and Native American music can be heard regionally. 

The NPR News &amp; Music network did not have a presence in Milwaukee until 2024. Flagship NPR programming was aired on WUWM, which is independent from Wisconsin Public Radio. Programming from the NPR News &amp; Music feed could be heard in Milwaukee on WHAD HD-2 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.. The network was partially available in western suburbs from WERN and in south shore suburbs from WGTD.

==Other digital services==
Wisconsin Public Radio operates a mobile app on the Apple and Android platforms. The app includes in-app readers of local and national news articles from WPR and NPR. The app also includes streaming media players for both WPR News and WPR Music networks, along with full program guides to each service.

Wisconsin Public Radio produces several podcasts available on their mobile app, website, and many podcasting platforms. 

A few stations broadcast on HD radio within the network. WERN airs WPR Music on the HD-2 channel, which is used to feed local analog translators on 90.5 and 107.9. WHAD airs WPR News on its HD-2 channel. WHRM airs the WPR Music on HD-2 to serve the Wausau area. WHHI airs WPR News on HD-2. Radio display information is limited to station identification only. 

WPR affiliate station WGTD HD-2 offers a 24/7 jazz, big band and blues service, and WGTD HD-3 provides a reading service for the blind and visually impaired. 

==Network stations==
WPR&#x27;s stations are licensed to several different organizations. Most stations are owned by either the University of Wisconsin System or by the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board, a state agency . The University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board stations are administered by WHA Radio, a department of the University of Wisconsin – Madison, for the UW System Board of Regents. Other stations are affiliates, owned by local school districts or colleges.

The network&#x27;s headquarters are located on the Madison campus where the majority of programs are produced. Some of WPR&#x27;s regional studios produce local programming. Not all UW-owned stations are part of Wisconsin Public Radio&#x27;s network; some are student-run, and others, like WUWM, are part of the UW-system, but not part of WPR. Two high school radio stations (one, WEPS, is located in the northwest Chicago suburb of Elgin, and its signal does not reach the Wisconsin state line) carry the network outside of school hours and summer periods, providing a form of license protection to those stations (WEPS began to program the Ideas Network in order to fend off a license challenge due to being off-air after school hours), while WLBL-FM in Wausau shares time on its frequency with WXPW, a repeater of independently owned NPR member WXPR in Rhinelander.

== 2024 Programming Restructure and Current Station List==
In April 2024, WPR announced a restructuring of its two analog networks, to take place on May 20 of that year. The Ideas Network was retired and its staff and most of its programming transferred to a new service called &quot;WPR News&quot;, while a new &quot;WPR Music&quot; service featured expanded schedules of classical music throughout the week, with jazz, world, and folk music heard on the weekends. Many WPR stations switched programming services; in Milwaukee, WHAD joined the WPR Music service (with NPR News programming continuing on WUWM) while WHA and WERN in Madison will join WPR News, with the low powered FM translators currently carrying the Ideas Network from WHA airing WPR Music going forward. 

Most syndicated NPR programming continued on WPR News. However, 1A Plus, As It Happens, Q, and Milk Street Radio were removed from the network. WPR network programs The Morning Show and Central Time were replaced with a one-hour show called Wisconsin Today. WPR regional news programs Route 51, Simply Superior, and Newsmakers were replaced with regional news updates during Morning edition on their local network stations. Syndicated classical programming Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin and Classical 24 will be removed from the program schedule, while Chapter a Day will move to WPR Music.

At the time of the announcement, no information was provided by WPR on changes to the All Classical Network or any of its HD radio services. Later, it was announced that The All Classical Network and most HD radio services would cease at the time of transition. WPR noted on their website, &quot;We are encouraging people to use online audio instead of HD because it is easier to find for most people&quot; 

Gateway Technical College&#x27;s WGTD affiliate confirmed its general alignment to WPR News, but stated all local programming would be preserved with slight schedule adjustments. Their Radio Reading Service would be preserved as well. WGTD also announced plans to create a new HD3 station, which would simulcast programming from WPR Music. 

==The former All Classical Network==
The &quot;All Classical Network&quot; service was available as an online stream and through HD Radio in select markets from 2007 to 2024. The All Classical Network exclusively featured classical music. The network included a simulcast of locally produced daytime classical programming, Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin, and syndicated Classical 24 programming. Stations with this HD-2 service included WERN Madison, WHAD Milwaukee, WHRM Wausau, WPNE Green Bay, WHHI Highland, and WHLA La Crosse. It was also available on analog translator W272CN 102.3FM in Ashland, rebroadcasting WHSA HD-2. W272CN, originally W275AF/102.9, was no longer needed after WPR constructed two full-power stations in the Chequamegon Bay area and was discontinued in June 2016 . On October 19, 2020, WPR discontinued HD service on KUWS Superior, WHSA Brule-Superior, WUWS Ashland, WHBM Park Falls, WHWC Menomonie, WHAA Wisconsin Rapids, and WHDI Sister Bay, due to low listenership. 

The All Classical Network streamed real-time live over most Internet streaming venues, along with WPR&#x27;s mobile app and website. Downloadable versions of WPR shows in MP3 were also available.

<text>Betty Boothroyd, Baroness Boothroyd (8 October 1929 – 26 February 2023), was a British politician who served as a member of Parliament (MP) for West Bromwich and West Bromwich West from 1973 to 2000. A member of the Labour Party, she served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1992 to 2000. She was previously a Deputy Speaker from 1987 to 1992. She was the first and as of 2025, the only woman to serve as Speaker. Boothroyd later sat in the House of Lords as, in accordance with tradition, a crossbench peer.

==Early life==
Boothroyd was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, in 1929, as the only child of Ben Archibald Boothroyd (1886–1948) and his second wife Mary (&quot;née&quot; Butterfield, 1901–1982), both textile workers. She was educated at council schools and went on to study at Dewsbury College of Commerce and Art (now Kirklees College). From 1946 to 1952, she worked as a dancer, as a member of the Tiller Girls dancing troupe, briefly appearing at the London Palladium. A foot infection brought an end to her dancing career and she entered politics, something then unusual, as the political world was heavily male-dominated and mostly aristocratic.

During the mid-to-late 1950s, Boothroyd worked as secretary to Labour MPs Barbara Castle and Geoffrey de Freitas. In 1960, she travelled to the United States to see the Kennedy campaign. She subsequently worked in Washington, DC as a legislative assistant to American Congressman Silvio Conte, between 1960 and 1962. When she returned to London, she resumed her work as a secretary and political assistant to various senior Labour politicians including Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Harry Walston. In 1965, she was elected to a seat on Hammersmith Borough Council, in Gibbs Green ward, where she remained until 1968.

==Member of Parliament==
Running for the Labour Party, Boothroyd contested several seats – Leicester South East in 1957, Peterborough in 1959, Nelson and Colne in 1968, and Rossendale in 1970 – before being elected Member of Parliament (MP) for West Bromwich in a by-election in 1973. She represented the constituency for 27 years.

In 1974, Boothroyd was appointed an assistant Government Whip. In 1975, she became a Government-appointed member of the then European Common Assembly (ECSC) until she was discharged in 1977. In 1979, she became a member of the Select committee on Foreign Affairs, until 1981, and of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen, until 1 January 2000. She was a member of the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC) from 1981 to 1987, and the House of Commons Commission from 1983 to 1987.

===Deputy Speaker and Speaker===
Following the 1987 general election Boothroyd became a Deputy Speaker to the Speaker Bernard Weatherill. She was the second female Deputy Speaker in British history after Betty Harvie Anderson. In 1992 she was elected Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold the position. There was debate about whether Boothroyd should wear the traditional Speaker&#x27;s Wig. She chose not to but stated that any subsequent Speakers would be free to choose to wear the wig or not; none have since done so. In answer to the debate as to how she should be addressed as Speaker, Boothroyd said: &quot;Call me Madam&quot;.

In 1993, the Government won a vote on the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty due to her casting vote (exercised in accordance with Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule). It was subsequently discovered that her casting vote had not been required, as the votes had been miscounted, and the Government had won by one vote. She was keen to get young people interested in politics, and in the 1990s appeared as a special guest on the BBC&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;. Her signature catchphrase in closing Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions each week was &quot;Time&#x27;s up!&quot;

On 12 July 2000, following Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Boothroyd announced to the House of Commons she would resign as Speaker after the summer recess. Tony Blair, then prime minister, paid tribute to her as &quot;something of a national institution&quot;. Blair&#x27;s predecessor, John Major, described her as an &quot;outstanding Speaker&quot;. She stepped down as Speaker and resigned as an MP on 23 October 2000.

===Life peerage and later activity===
Boothroyd was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Civil Law (Hon DCL) by the City University London in 1993. She was chancellor of the Open University from 1994 until October 2006 and donated some of her personal papers to the University&#x27;s archives. In March 1995, she was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University (DUniv). In 1999 she was made an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. Two portraits of Boothroyd have been part of the parliamentary art collection since 1994 and 1999, respectively.

On 15 January 2001, she was created a life peer, taking as her title Baroness Boothroyd of Sandwell in the County of West Midlands. Her autobiography was published in the same year. In April 2005, she was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an honour in the personal gift of the Queen.

Boothroyd was made an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Light and Lighting (Hon. FSLL) in 2009, and she was an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, and of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge. She was Patron of the Jo Richardson Community School in Dagenham, East London, and President of NBFA Assisting the Elderly. She was, for a period, Vice President of the Industry and Parliament Trust.

In January 2011, Boothroyd posited that Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg&#x27;s plans for some members of the upper house to be directly elected could leave Britain in constitutional disarray: &quot;It is wantonly destructive. It is destruction that hasn&#x27;t been thought through properly.&quot; She was concerned that an elected Lords would rival the Commons, risking power-struggles between the two.

==Personal life and death==
Boothroyd neither married nor had children. She took up paragliding while on holiday in Cyprus in her 60s. She described the hobby as both &quot;lovely and peaceful&quot; and &quot;exhilarating&quot;. In April 1995, whilst on holiday in Morocco, Boothroyd became trapped in the Atlas Mountains in the country&#x27;s biggest storm in 20 years. Her vehicle was immobilised by a landslide; she and a group of hikers walked through mud and rubble for nine hours before they were rescued. She is the sitter in eleven portraits at the National Portrait Gallery. 

Boothroyd died at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge on 26 February 2023, at the age of 93. Her death was announced the following day by Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House. Her funeral was held on 29 March at St George&#x27;s Church, Thriplow, Cambridgeshire; she had lived in the village in her later years. Hoyle, the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer were among those in attendance, and her close friend, actress Dame Patricia Routledge, sang.

==Arms==
==Honorary degrees==
Boothroyd received at least eight honorary degrees in recognition of her political career, including:
* 6 December 1993: Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from City, University of London 
* 1994: Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Cambridge 
* 18 March 1995: Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) from the Open University
* 1995: Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of Oxford
* 26 June 2003: Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of St Andrews

Boothroyd was additionally made an Honorary Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1994.

<doc id="359586" wikidata="Q17077762" url="?curid=359586" title="List of mathematical examples">
<text>This page will attempt to list examples in mathematics. To qualify for inclusion, an article should be about a mathematical object with a fair amount of concreteness. Usually a definition of an abstract concept, a theorem, or a proof would not be an &quot;example&quot; as the term should be understood here (an elegant proof of an isolated but particularly striking fact, as opposed to a proof of a general theorem, could perhaps be considered an &quot;example&quot;). The discussion page for list of mathematical topics has some comments on this. Eventually this page may have its own discussion page. This page links to itself in order that edits to this page will be included among related changes when the user clicks on that button.

The concrete example within the article titled Rao-Blackwell theorem is perhaps one of the best ways for a probabilist ignorant of statistical inference to get a quick impression of the flavor of that subject.

<text>Andrew Carthy (born 10 February 1972), known professionally as Mr. Scruff, is an English record producer and DJ. He lives in Stretford, Greater Manchester and studied fine art at the Psalter Lane campus of Sheffield Hallam University. Before he could make a living from his music alone, he worked as a shelf stocker in the Hazel Grove branch of Kwik Save.

His stage name was inspired by his scruffy facial hair as well as his trademark loose-lined drawing style. He has been DJing since 1992, at first in and around Manchester, then nationwide. He is known for DJing in marathon sets (often exceeding six hours), his eclectic musical taste, his love of a &quot;nice cup of tea,&quot; and the quirky home-produced visuals and animations associated with his music. In an interview, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s about putting a lot of effort in and paying attention to detail. I get annoyed if I don&#x27;t take risks. I&#x27;m very hard on myself.&quot;

==Career==
In his twenties, Mr. Scruff&#x27;s first 12&quot; vinyl, &quot;Hocus Pocus,&quot; was released on the small Manchester-based label Rob&#x27;s Records. Subsequent singles and his first album (&quot;Mr. Scruff&quot;) followed, released on Rob&#x27;s Records subsidiary Pleasure Music. After a brief spell working with Mark Rae, he moved to the larger Ninja Tune label and subsequently released the albums &quot;Keep It Unreal&quot; and &quot;Trouser Jazz&quot;.

His most notable hit, &quot;Get a Move On!&quot;, is built around &quot;Bird&#x27;s Lament (In Memory of Charlie Parker)&quot; by Moondog and has been used in several commercials, ranging from Lincoln and Volvo automobiles to France Télécom and GEICO insurance. The song also samples Shifty Henry&#x27;s &quot;Hyping Woman Blues&quot; and led to a renewal of interest in Henry&#x27;s compositions.

In 2004, Mr. Scruff released &quot;Keep It Solid Steel Volume 1&quot;, the first of what is intended to be a series of several DJ mixed compilation CDs for Ninja Tune&#x27;s &quot;Solid Steel&quot; series of artist mixes. These mixes are designed to recreate the eclectic genres one would expect to hear at a Mr. Scruff club night. In November 2006, Ninja Tune confirmed that the eighth &quot;Solid Steel&quot; record would be mixed by J Rocc and the ninth would be &quot;Volume 2&quot; from Mr. Scruff. Other &quot;Solid Steel&quot; mixes have been released by fellow Ninja Tune artists including The Herbaliser, Hexstatic, DJ Food, and Amon Tobin.

He has a wide array of remixes to his name and has also produced tracks for others – notably &quot;Echo of Quiet and Green&quot; for sometimes-collaborator Niko on her 2004 album &quot;Life on Earth&quot;. Niko returned the favour by appearing on the track &quot;Come Alive&quot; from the &quot;Trouser Jazz&quot; album.

Having performed regularly at The Big Chill Festival in Eastnor Castle deer park, Ledbury, Herefordshire, Mr. Scruff was asked in 2006 to select the tracks for the compilation album, &quot;Big Chill Classics&quot;.

July 2008 saw the release of &quot;Southport Weekender Volume 7&quot;, a double album released in the &quot;Southport Weekender&quot; series, recorded in a purpose-built holiday village in Southport, Merseyside. The first disc was mixed by German nu jazz DJs Jazzanova, and the second was mixed by Mr. Scruff, whose contribution is a mix of soul music.

In 2008, a new independent record label, Ninja Tuna, was founded, a collaboration between Mr. Scruff and the Ninja Tune label. Mr. Scruff&#x27;s most recent singles and the album &quot;Ninja Tuna&quot; were all released on the new label.

A US-only release of the album on MP3 came with 10 additional tracks from the &quot;Ninja Tuna&quot; recording sessions, under the title &quot;Bonus Bait&quot;. A CD version of this supplementary album was released in the UK in February 2009.

On 19 May 2014, Ninja Tuna released Mr. Scruff&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Friendly Bacteria&quot;.

==Style==

===Artwork===
Mr. Scruff&#x27;s album and single cover art, music videos, merchandise and his official website are noted for their whimsical cartoonish look; the cartoons are drawn by Mr. Scruff himself in what he calls &quot;potato style.&quot; The images and animations are also projected onto large screens during his gigs.
Scruff also drew cartoons for music magazines such as &quot;Jockey Slut&quot; in the 1990s.

===Tea===
Mr. Scruff began selling tea from a small room at the Manchester club, the Music Box (where he was resident DJ around 2000), with the proceeds going to charity. When he started touring, Mr. Scruff took the enterprise with him and gained a reputation for being the DJ with the teashop. When appearing at festivals, such as Big Chill and WOMAD, tea stalls or tents were erected and were open for the duration of the festivals. Mr. Scruff subsequently started an online tea company, Make Us a Brew, and produced his own range of fair trade teabags which used to be sold in department store chains Selfridges, Waitrose and Booths. His official website still sells branded tea-related paraphernalia including teapots, mugs and tea towels, but the tea is no longer sold as the Make Us a Brew company was dissolved in September 2013.

He was the joint owner (with his manager Gary McClarnan) of Teacup Kitchen, located in Thomas Street, Manchester, though this closed in March 2020 with the first COVID-19 lockdown and never reopened.

===Fish===
Most of Mr. Scruff&#x27;s studio albums contain tracks about fish, whales and other sea-life, which cut up recordings of voiceovers from children&#x27;s stories and nature documentaries to create surreal and silly stories. They began with the track &quot;Sea Mammal&quot; (featuring a sample from Boogie Down Productions&#x27; track &quot;Part Time Sucker&quot;), released on the single &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1995). It is also the opening track on Scruff&#x27;s first album. This was followed by &quot;Wail&quot; (as a homophone for &quot;Whale&quot;), also on his first album. &quot;Keep It Unreal&quot; (1999) featured the tracks &quot;Shanty Town&quot; and &quot;Fish,&quot; the latter of which features samples from the likes of David Attenborough and David Bellamy. The album &quot;Trouser Jazz&quot; (2002) closes with another cut-up track, &quot;Ahoy There!&quot;, noted as featuring an appearance from &quot;Albert Ross&quot; (albatross).

Mr. Scruff has stated that he is unlikely to record any further fish-based cut-up tracks. However, marine references continue in his work, including the track &quot;Shrimp&quot; from &quot;Trouser Jazz&quot; and the title and cover art of his albums, especially &quot;Ninja Tuna&quot; (2008) and its companion release, &quot;Bonus Bait&quot; (2009).

===Hot Pot===
Mr. Scruff and Treva Whateva (his Ninja Tune label-mate and friend from Stockport) recorded a weekly hour-long radio show (with frequent guest, Jon Hill), some episodes of which can still be found on samurai.fm.

<text>Jordan Taylor Hanson (born March 14, 1983) is an American musician best known as a member of the eponymous pop rock band Hanson. He was born in Jenks, Oklahoma, a suburb of Tulsa. He sings both lead and back-up vocals, and plays keyboard, percussion (including drums, bongos and the tambourine), guitar, harmonica, and piano. Taylor was the lead singer of supergroup Tinted Windows.

==Early life==
Hanson was born in a suburb of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the second of seven children born to Clarke Walker Hanson and Diana Frances (née Lawyer) Hanson. He has partial Danish ancestry.

==Music career==
Hanson sings and plays keyboard and the piano with the band Hanson. He and his older brother, Isaac, started the band with younger brother Zac in 1992, and were initially known as The Hanson Brothers (later changed to just Hanson). At the time, Isaac was eleven, Taylor was nine, and Zac was six. They performed as an a cappella group outside clubs in Tulsa. On May 6, 1997, the band released their first major studio album, &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, with Mercury Records. The first single, &quot;MMMBop&quot;, made it to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

May 6 has been declared Hanson Day in Tulsa in honor of the release of &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. Each year on this day the band hosts concerts and celebrations in Tulsa, and fans travel from around the world to attend.

In 2003 Taylor Hanson co-founded 3CG Records with brothers Isaac and Zac Hanson.

It was announced in early 2009 that Taylor Hanson, along with former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos and Fountains of Wayne bassist Adam Schlesinger, formed a new band called Tinted Windows. The band played their first publicized gig at SXSW in Austin, Texas on March 20, 2009. Their first album was released on April 21, 2009. Adam Schlesinger died in 2020 from COVID-19. A few months after Schlesinger&#x27;s death, Hanson mentioned that a Tinted Windows reunion had been in the works.

==Personal life==

On June 8, 2002, Hanson married Natalie Anne Bryant, whom he met in 2000. They have seven children; sons born in 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2018 and daughters born in 2005, 2012, and 2020.

In 2014, Taylor Hanson founded Food on the Move, a Tulsa based volunteer organization that acts to end food insecurity in the community. Food On The Move offers fresh produce, prepared meals, and access to community and health resources.

In 2021, as part of The Sound of Black Wall Street musical project, Taylor Hanson contributed to an album paying homage to the hundredth anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. His non-Hanson solo song, &quot;Sound Like Joy&quot;, was recorded in historic Vernon AME Church at the heart of Tulsa&#x27;s Black Wall Street.

<doc id="359603" wikidata="Q328739" url="?curid=359603" title="Simon of Cyrene">
<text>Simon of Cyrene (, Standard Hebrew &quot;Šimʿon&quot;, Tiberian Hebrew &quot;Šimʿôn&quot;; , &quot;Simōn Kyrēnaios&quot;) was the man compelled by the Romans to carry the cross of Jesus of Nazareth as Jesus was taken to his crucifixion, according to all three Synoptic Gospels: He was also the father of the disciples Rufus and Alexander.

Simon is not mentioned in the Gospel of John.

==Background==
Cyrene was a Greek city in the province of Cyrenaica, in eastern Libya, in northern Africa. It had a Jewish community, where 100,000 Judean Jews settled during the reign of Ptolemy Soter (323–285 BC), and was an early center of Christianity.

The Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue in Jerusalem, where many went for annual feasts.

==Biblical accounts==
Simon&#x27;s act of carrying the cross, &quot;patibulum&quot; (crossbeam in Latin), for Jesus is the fifth station of the Stations of the Cross. Some interpret the passage as indicating that Simon was chosen because he may have shown sympathy with Jesus. Others point out that the text itself says nothing, that he had no choice, and that there is no basis to consider the carrying of the cross an act of sympathetic generosity.

Mark 15:21 identifies Simon as &quot;the father of Alexander and Rufus&quot;. Tradition states that they became missionaries; the inclusion of their names may suggest that they were of some standing in the Early Christian community at Rome. Mark&#x27;s Gospel, which was written for a Roman audience, seems to suggest that the audience knew who these men were. It has also been suggested that the Rufus (in Greek: Ῥοῦφον or &quot;Rhouphon&quot;) mentioned by Paul in Romans is the son of Simon of Cyrene. Some also link Simon himself with the &quot;men of Cyrene&quot; who preached the Gospel to the Hellenized Jews (Greek: ) in Acts . On the other hand, Simon&#x27;s name alone does not prove he was Jewish, and Alexander and Rufus were both common names and may have referred to others.

A burial cave in the Kidron Valley discovered in 1941 by E. L. Sukenik, belonging to Cyrenian Jews and dating before AD 70, was found to have an ossuary inscribed twice in Greek &quot;Alexander son of Simon&quot;. It cannot, however, be certain that this refers to the same person..

==Gnostic and Islamic views==

=== Gnostic ===
According to some Gnostic traditions, Simon of Cyrene, by mistaken identity, suffered the events leading up to the crucifixion. This is the story presented in the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, although it is unclear whether Simon or another actually died on the cross. This is part of a belief held by some Gnostics that Jesus was not of flesh, but only took on the appearance of flesh (see also Basilides, and Swoon hypothesis).

Basilides, in his gospel of Basilides, is reported by Irenaeus as having taught a docetic doctrine of Christ&#x27;s passion. He states the teaching that Christ, in Jesus, as a wholly divine being, could not suffer bodily pain and did not die on the cross; but that the person crucified was, in fact, Simon of Cyrene. Irenaeus quotes Basiledes:

He appeared on earth as a man and performed miracles. Thus he himself did not suffer. Rather, a certain Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry his cross for him. It was he who was ignorantly and erroneously crucified, being transfigured by him, so that he might be thought to be Jesus. Moreover, Jesus assumed the form of Simon, and stood by laughing at them.Irenaeus, &quot;Against Heresies&quot;

=== Islamic ===
Orthodox Muslim theology teaches Jesus ascended to Heaven without dying on the cross.

==In popular culture==
According to the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, Simon was a pagan. The Romans recognized he was not a Jew by his clothes and then chose him to oblige him to help Jesus carry the cross.

Poet Ridgely Torrence wrote a play about him titled &quot;Simon the Cyrenian&quot;. A 1920 YWCA production of this play was directed by Dora Cole, sister of composer Bob Cole, and starred Paul Robeson.

Sidney Poitier was cast as Simon of Cyrene in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; that was directed by George Stevens and released in 1965.

In the 1979 comedy film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; is a vignette alluding to Simon of Cyrene. A seemingly pious and generous man offers to one of the condemned carrying a cross, &quot;Brother, let me shoulder your burden.&quot; Upon doing so, the condemned man runs off, leaving the generous man stuck with the cross and future crucifixion.

The film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; portrays Simon (Jarreth Merz) as a Jew who, having been forced by the Romans to carry the cross, is initially unwilling but comes to show compassion to Jesus and helps him.

French singer-poet Georges Brassens mentioned Simon in one of the verses of his famous song-poem &quot;La prière&quot; (The prayer): &quot;Comme la croix du fils sur Simon de Cyrène&quot; (Like the son&#x27;s cross on Simon of Cyrene). The song is based on an original poem called &quot;Rosaire&quot; by French poet Francis Jammes that also contains this verse.

==Movements==
Both the Simon Community, and the Cyrenian movement (which provides services to homeless and other disadvantaged groups in the UK) take their name from Simon of Cyrene.

<doc id="359614" wikidata="Q611686" url="?curid=359614" title="Crash Holly">
<text>Michael John Lockwood (August 25, 1971 – November 6, 2003) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) / World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 1999 to 2003 under the ring names Crash Holly or simply Crash.

Lockwood debuted in 1989 and spent a decade wrestling on the independent circuit before signing with the World Wrestling Federation in 1998, debuting the following year as Crash Holly. He formed a tag team with his kayfabe cousin Hardcore Holly, with whom he won the WWF World Tag Team Championship. The Holly Cousins was expanded into a stable with the addition of Molly Holly in 2000. During his WWF/WWE career, Holly established himself in the hardcore division by winning the WWF Hardcore Championship on 22 occasions, with many of his reigns coming during a period when the title was defended &quot;24/7&quot;. After being released from WWE in June 2003, Holly joined NWA Total Nonstop Action as Mad Mikey, where he remained until his death later that year.

Holly was also a one-time WWF European Champion and a one-time WWF Light Heavyweight Champion. In total, Holly had over 25 championship reigns in the WWF.

== Early life ==
Lockwood was born on August 25, 1971, in San Francisco, California. He was raised in Pacifica, California, where he graduated from Terra Nova High School. He became interested in professional wrestling in the eighth grade, inspired by Brady Boone. While training as a wrestler and working on the independent circuit, he worked a second job at Safeway.

== Professional wrestling career ==

===Early career (1989–1998)===
Lockwood debuted in 1989, as &quot;Johnny Pearson&quot; in Bay Area Wrestling for Woody Farmer, where he wrestled until 1994. He dislocated his shoulder about five times and took 18 months off to recover. He then wrestled on the independent circuit as &quot;&#x27;Irish&#x27; Erin O&#x27;Grady&quot;. In 1995, he appeared in Mexico with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre as &quot;Super Diablo&quot;. In 1996, he joined All Pro Wrestling (APW), where he became known as &quot;&#x27;The Leprechaun&#x27; Erin O&#x27;Grady&quot; and had several matches with Vic Grimes.

Lockwood joined the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion in November 1997 after ECW wrestler Taz viewed a tape of a match between O&#x27;Grady and Michael Modest and referred him to ECW owner Paul Heyman. Erin O&#x27;Grady lost four untelevised matches in ECW, including a dark match at November to Remember. Following his stint in ECW, Lockwood returned to APW where he performed until October 1998.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (1998–2003) ===

==== Developmental territories (1998–1999) ====
O&#x27;Grady wrestled Vic Grimes in a try-out match for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on January 20, 1998, and both were signed to contracts. In November 1998, Lockwood was sent to Power Pro Wrestling, the WWF&#x27;s developmental promotion, to train. Here, he won the Power Pro Wrestling Young Guns Championship and the PPW Tag Team Championship. WWF Talent Coordinator Bruce Prichard sent Lockwood to Mexico, to prepare him for the style of the WWF&#x27;s lucha libre show, &quot;WWF Super Astros&quot;. He wrestled in Monterrey for three months, under a mask, as &quot;The Green Ghost&quot; (a play on the word &quot;gringo&quot;).

==== Holly Cousins (1999–2000) ====

Lockwood debuted on WWF television as &quot;Crash Holly&quot;, the storyline cousin of Bob &quot;Hardcore&quot; Holly, on the August 16, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; They became known as the Holly Cousins. Their relationship was a strained one, and Hardcore frequently threatened Crash. When they took the gimmick of claiming to be &quot;super heavyweights&quot;, over 400 lb each, Crash would carry a scale to ringside to &quot;weigh in&quot; before matches.

Crash made his pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam in August, where the Holly Cousins wrestled in a Tag Team Turmoil match, won by the Acolytes Protection Agency. At Rebellion, the Holly Cousins competed against APA and Edge and Christian in a triangle match, which Edge and Christian won. On October 17, at No Mercy, the Holly Cousins defeated The New Age Outlaws by disqualification. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, they defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection for the WWF Tag Team Championship. They held the title until the November 4 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when they lost it to Mankind and his new partner, Al Snow.

At Survivor Series on November 14, the Holly Cousins teamed with Too Cool to defeat Edge &amp; Christian and the Hardy Boyz in a survivor series match. Later that month, the Holly Cousins began a short feud with Too Cool and Rikishi Phatu. At Armageddon on December 12, 1999, they defeated Phatu and Viscera. The feud continued into February 2000. At the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, both Hollys took part in the titular Royal Rumble match, with Crash Holly being eliminated by The Rock.

==== Championship reigns (2000–2001) ====
In February 2000, Crash Holly joined the hardcore division. On the February 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he defeated Test to begin his first of 22 Hardcore Championship reigns. He decreed that he must defend the championship twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, which later became known as the &quot;24/7 Rule&quot;. This meant that the title was permanently contested, not just in sanctioned matches, and could change hands anywhere, anytime anyone pinned the champion, so long as a WWF referee counted the fall. Holly was frequently attacked by other wrestlers in unlikely locations, including an airport, a funhouse, a circus, and his hotel room. Although he was often pinned, he usually immediately regained the title. His most common tactic was to sneak a pin, often after the champion had been beaten down by someone else, and quickly run backstage, away from possible challengers. This turned him into a crowd favorite and earned him the nickname &quot;The Houdini of Hardcore&quot;. He frequently defended the championship against non-wrestlers, including referees and road agents, like Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. He had a long feud with The Mean Street Posse (Pete Gas, Rodney and Joey Abs) over the title. He even lost, and quickly regained, the title against one of the Godfather&#x27;s hos.

At Rebellion, Crash defeated William Regal to win the European Championship. He lost the title to Regal two days later. In late 2000, another of Crash&#x27;s storyline cousins, Molly Holly, was introduced. In 2001, The Holly Cousins feuded with The Dudley Boyz. In the course of this feud, Molly began a romantic relationship with Spike Dudley, leading to internal disputes within each family, as well as a Romeo and Juliet-style angle between the six of them. On the March 18, 2001, episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Crash defeated Dean Malenko to win the Light Heavyweight Championship. He defended it on two episodes of &quot;Heat&quot;, against Funaki and Grandmaster Sexay, before dropping it to the debuting Jerry Lynn on the April 29 episode. In April 2001, Holly and Hardcore briefly reunited as a lower card team until December of that year.

In July 2001, Holly appeared with the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, briefly holding the IWA Hardcore Championship and IWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Throughout late 2001, he wrestled primarily on house shows and on &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. At Survivor Series on November 18, 2001, Holly took part in a battle royal that would guarantee the winner immunity from being fired that was won by Test. Throughout the remainder of 2001 and early 2002, Holly continued to wrestle primarily on house shows and the WWF&#x27;s secondary television shows.

==== Mattitude Follower (2002–2003) ====
When the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment and divided into two Raw and SmackDown! brands, Holly was assigned to the Raw roster, where he had little success. He jumped ship to SmackDown! on the September 2, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during a match with Jeff Hardy. Earlier, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff was informed that a Raw wrestler would leave to reunite with a relative on SmackDown!, and ordered a beatdown by 3-Minute Warning on Hardy, who he wrongly suspected of planning to join his brother, Matt Hardy, until Crash revealed that he was the one who was leaving, planning to join his cousin Hardcore Holly on SmackDown!. In his first &quot;SmackDown!&quot; match, on September 5, he defeated The Hurricane. He then feuded with Cruiserweight Champion Jamie Noble. On the October 3 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Noble defeated Holly to retain the title.

On the December 19 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly teamed with Bill DeMott to defeat Noble and Nunzio. After the match, DeMott turned on Holly and attacked him. This led to a match on the next &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which DeMott won. After being sidelined for three months, Holly returned on the April 24, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He soon joined Matt Hardy and Shannon Moore in the Mattitude Followers (abbreviated &quot;MF&#x27;er&quot;) stable. As Crash was Moore&#x27;s alleged apprentice, Hardy also referred to him as a &quot;Moore-on&quot;. His last several matches with the company were tag matches with Moore, as well as house show matches against newcomer Orlando Jordan. On June 30, 2003, Lockwood was released from WWE.

===NWA Total Nonstop Action; independent circuit (2003)===
Lockwood signed a contract with NWA Total Nonstop Action in July 2003 and debuted as &quot;Mad Mikey&quot; on July 23, accepting an open challenge from Elix Skipper and losing the match. Mad Mikey was angry at many things, on which he elaborated in promos. He wrestled on nine NWA-TNA weekly PPVs, lastly on October 1. He briefly wrestled for Pro Wrestling Iron in Hayward, California. On November 1, 2003, Mad Mikey and Rory Fox defeated Quiten Lee and The Human Time Bomb with Ricky Steamboat as the special guest referee for the Heartland Wrestling Association in what turned out to be Lockwood&#x27;s final match.

== Personal life ==
Lockwood met his wife, Christeena Wheeler, when she escorted Mark Henry to the ring at Unforgiven 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They married on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1999. The couple had one child together, a daughter. In 2002, he opened &quot;Crash Holly&#x27;s School of Professional Wrestling&quot; in Salisbury, North Carolina, where Wheeler grew up.

==Death==

Lockwood died on November 6, 2003, at his friend and fellow wrestler Stevie Richards&#x27; house in Florida. He was 32 years old. He was found partially clothed with a pool of vomit around his face. Empty bottles of the prescription drug carisoprodol and a partially consumed bottle of alcohol were found nearby. He had recently received divorce papers from his wife. His death, caused by choking on his own vomit, was officially ruled a suicide. He was buried in China Grove in Rowan County, North Carolina.

In August 2005, Nora Greenwald, who performed alongside Lockwood as Molly Holly, released an autobiographical DVD titled &quot;Nora Greenwald: Shootin&#x27; the Shi Crap&quot;, and a portion of the profits from the sale of the DVD went to Lockwood&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s education fund. In March 2005, the New Breed Wrestling Association held the &quot;Mike Lockwood Memorial Tournament&quot;, which was won by Michael Modest. At ECW One Night Stand in 2005, Lockwood was one of the deceased former ECW wrestlers honored in a video package.

The butterfly stroke boasts a higher peak velocity than the front crawl, owing to the synchronous propulsion generated by the simultaneous pull/push of both arms and legs. However, due to the pronounced drop in speed during the recovery phase, it is marginally slower than the front crawl, especially over extended distances. Furthermore, the butterfly stroke demands a different level of physical exertion, contributing to its slower overall pace than the front crawl.

== History ==

=== Origins of the butterfly kick ===
The earliest mention of the butterfly kick can be attributed to George Corsan, who, according to the International Swimming Hall of Fame introduced it by demonstration to David Armbruster in 1911. Corsan called it a &quot;fishtail kick&quot;. A perhaps independent discovery of the fishtail kick was made by Volney Wilson some time before 1938, Wilson was a young physicist and swimmer who had analyzed the motions of swimming fish. Another discovery of the butterfly kick was made by Jack Sieg, who, while being watched by David Armbruster, went underwater, lay on his side and performed the butterfly kick in imitation of a fish. Armbruster was reminded of the time in 1911 when George Corsan had previously demonstrated it to him, and noticed the speed that Sieg was able to achieve. Armbruster got Sieg to demonstrate it on his front, and Sieg was even faster. Sieg was even able to beat the best flutter kickers at the University of Iowa using the fishtail kick. Initially, Corsan and Armbruster thought that the &quot;fishtail kick&quot; could be a possible alternative to the flutter kick in freestyle, but in 1933 it began to dawn on Armbruster that it would perhaps be more effective in breaststroke. Armbruster began to experiment with Sieg on using the butterfly kick in breaststroke and had excellent results. Presumably to reflect this, he also began referring to the previously named &quot;fishtail kick&quot; as the &quot;dolphin breaststroke kick&quot;. He published his results in 1935 in an article called &quot;The Dolphin Breast Stroke&quot; in &quot;The Journal of Health and Physical Education&quot; where, due to its potential to be faster than the traditional whip kick, Armbruster was enthusiastic to have it legalized within the breaststroke rules, to &quot;offer this new type of stroke for exploitation as a competitive racing-speed stroke&quot;. Armbruster followed this appeal with another longer article in the 1937 NCAA Swimming and Diving Guide called &quot;The New Dolphin Breast Stroke on Trial&quot;, which further urged the NCAA to allow the kick in the rules for the extra speed. Unfortunately for Armbruster, this would not come to fruition, as in a FINA meeting in October 1938, the bureau unanimously agreed to prohibit up-and-down movements of the legs in the vertical plane.

=== Origins of the butterfly arm ===
Prior to 1935, the breaststroke rules from both FINA and the NCAA stated that the arms had to be simultaneously pushed forward on recovery. Since the rules did not state that the arm recovery had to be underwater, a few swimmers came up with the idea of an overarm recovery, which was initially called the &quot;flying fish&quot;. The International Swimming Hall of Fame credits Sydney Cavill with creating the overarm recovery, but it is also possible that Erich Rademacher independently discovered it in 1927 Germany. Rademacher generally used the flying fish coming out of the turns, which was dubbed the &quot;flying breaststroke turn&quot; and at the end of the race, which was dubbed the &quot;flying finish&quot;. Rademacher insisted that this did not break the rules, and continued to use it in the late 1920s and early 1930s in the US. Sources conflict as to whether he used it in the 1928 Olympics, with the International Swimming Hall of Fame saying he did but Francois Oppenheim&#x27;s book &quot;The History of Swimming&quot; saying he didn&#x27;t. In 1935, presumably for the removal of ambiguity, the NCAA changed the rule regarding the breaststroke recovery to use the word &quot;moved&quot;, rather than &quot;pushed&quot;. Other early adoptees of the &quot;flying breaststroke turn&quot; were Walter Spence and then Wallace Spence, who went on to dominate the breaststroke events using it. The next notable swimmer to further innovate on the butterfly arms was Henry Myers, who in early December 1933 used the flying fish for the whole of the breaststroke leg of a three-stroke medley head, winning against Wallace Spence in spectacular fashion. The reaction to this performance was mixed. Though the officials did not disqualify him, the Brooklyn Central YMCA&#x27;s magazine wrote a &quot;vitriolic article&quot; that made disparaging remarks about &quot;the sportsmanship of young Myers who observed the letter but not the spirit of the breaststroke rules&quot;. Furthermore, Wallace Spence withdrew from the finals of the event alleging that Myers was swimming freestyle and he should &quot;learn how to swim breaststroke properly&quot;. Despite this, Myers was very proud of his creation, saying: &quot;It [is] uninteresting to watch a breaststroke race, in time, the old breaststroke would have become as passe as the English sidestroke, as far as racing is concerned. A butterfly-breaststroke race is a very exciting race to watch. The splashing and violent arm-motion seems to be quite conducive to spectator enthusiasm.&quot; Myers interested two teammates of his: Lester Kaplan and Paul Friesel, in the overarm recovery. Kaplan and Friesel went on to set new personal bests in breaststroke by over 3 seconds using it. As the overarm recovery caught on more, a swimmer called John Herbert Higgins, in February 1936 at the 1936 National AAU Indoor Swimming Championships swam a time of 1:10.8 for the 100 metre breaststroke event, and became the first swimmer to set a world record using exclusively the flying fish. This technique of continuous flying fish would come to be known as &quot;butterfly-breaststroke&quot;. Later at the 1936 US Olympic Trials, Higgins set a new 200 metre American Record of 2:44.1. In the 1936 Berlin Olympic 200m breaststroke finals, Higgins finished fourth while using the butterfly-breaststroke technique. Though the butterfly-breaststroke was gaining traction, it was almost prohibited as a style of breaststroke in an October 1938 FINA Executive Bureau meeting where it was &quot;supported by four votes out of seven to prohibit the butterfly arm recovery in the breaststroke event. However, since alterations to the technical rules required a two-thirds majority before adoption, the motion was declared not carried&quot;. In the 1948 London Olympics, all but one of the finalists used the butterfly-breaststroke technique, and the only finalist who did not use it (Bob Bonte of the Netherlands) finished last. This dominant display of butterfly-breaststroke led to the idea of separating breaststroke into two breaststroke events, consisting of traditional breaststroke and butterfly-breaststroke. However, the IOC president Sigfrid Edstrom decided not to add any events to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, due to the chaotic situation after World War II. Despite this, FINA did add a definition of the two styles of breaststroke to the rules which named traditional breaststroke style &quot;A&quot; and butterfly-breaststroke style &quot;B&quot;. A consequence of this was competitors were not able to swim both of the styles in the same race.

=== Origins of the full butterfly stroke ===
By 1952, the argument for separating the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; styles of breaststroke was gaining momentum, and hence in 1953, breaststroke was separated into two different events. Furthermore, while traditional breaststroke required the whip kick, the new butterfly stroke allowed the use of butterfly kick. Now the butterfly stroke was its own separate event. The butterfly stroke was first seen in the Olympics at the 1956 games, where the Men&#x27;s 200 metre butterfly event was won by William Yorzyk, and the Women&#x27;s 100 metre Butterfly event was won by Shelley Mann.

== Technique ==
The butterfly technique with the dolphin kick consists of synchronous arm movement with a synchronous leg kick. Good technique is crucial to swim this style effectively. The wave-like body movement is also very significant in creating propulsion, as this is the key to easy synchronous over-water recovery and breathing.

The swimmer is face down at the start, arms out front, and legs extended behind.

=== Arm movement ===
The butterfly stroke has three major parts, the pull, the push, and the recovery. These can also be further subdivided. The arm movement starts very similarly to the breaststroke from the initial position. In the beginning, the hands sink a little bit with the palms facing outwards, and slightly down at shoulder width, then the hands move out to create a Y. This is called catching the water. The pull movement follows a semicircle with the elbow higher than the hand and the hand pointing towards the center of the body and downward to form the traditionally taught &quot;keyhole&quot;.

The push propels the palm backwards through the water, starting beneath and ending at the side of the body. The swimmer only pushes the arms 1/3 of the way to the hips, making it easier to enter into the recovery and making the recovery shorter and making the breathing window shorter. The movement increases speed throughout the pull-push phase until the hand is the fastest at the end of the push. This step is called the release and is crucial for recovery. The speed at the end of the push is used to help with the recovery.

In the recovery, the arms are swung sideways across the water surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward from the end of the underwater movement; the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forward quickly and relaxedly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, the arm recovery is a ballistic shot, letting gravity and momentum do most of the work. The only way to lift the arms and the shoulders out of the water would be by dropping one&#x27;s hips. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, is in no way relaxed . It is important not to enter the water too early because this would generate extra resistance as the arms move forward against the swimming direction. However, during longer distances, this is not easy to avoid, and it is more important to avoid dropping one&#x27;s hips. A high elbow recovery, akin to that observed in the front crawl, would prove detrimental to the efficiency of the butterfly stroke due to the resultant undulations and the diminution of momentum generated by the triceps extension. Limitations of shoulder movement in the human body make such a move unlikely. The hands should enter the water with a narrow V shape (at 11 and 1 o&#x27;clock, if viewed like a clock) with thumbs entering first and pinkies last.

The arms enter the water with the thumbs first at shoulder width. A wider entry loses movement in the next pull phase, and if the hands touch, it will waste energy. The cycle repeats with the pull phase. However, some swimmers prefer to touch in front as it assists them in grasping the water. As long as they can perform this action efficiently, they do not incur any disadvantage.

=== Leg movement ===
The legs move together using different muscles. The shoulders rise with a strong up and medium down kick, then lower with a strong down and up kick. A fluid undulation connects the motion.

The feet are pressed together to avoid loss of water pressure. The feet naturally point downwards, give thrust downwards, move up the feet, and press down the head.

There is no stipulation in competitive butterfly rules that a swimmer makes a fixed number of pulses in butterfly–the swimmer may kick as little or as much as they wish. While competitive rules allow such a choice, the typical method of swimming butterfly is with two kicks.

As butterfly originated as a variant of breaststroke, it would be performed with a breaststroke or whip kick by some swimmers. While breaststroke was separated from butterfly in 1953, the breaststroke kick in butterfly was not officially outlawed until 2001. However several Masters swimmers were upset with the change since they came from a time when butterfly was usually swum with a breaststroke kick. FINA was then convinced to allow a breaststroke kick in Masters swimming. Given the option, most swimmers use a dolphin-kicking action. However, there still is a small minority of swimmers who prefer the breaststroke kick for recreational swimming and even for competition.

=== Breathing ===
There is only a short window for breathing in the butterfly. If this window is missed, swimming becomes very difficult. Optimally, a butterfly swimmer synchronizes the taking of breaths with the undulation of the body to simplify the breathing process; doing this well requires some attention to butterfly stroke technique. The breathing process begins during the stroke&#x27;s underwater &quot;press&quot; portion. The body naturally rises toward the water&#x27;s surface as the hands and forearms move underneath the chest. The swimmer can lift the head to fully break the surface with minimum effort. The swimmer breathes in through the mouth. The head goes back in the water after the arms come out of the water as they swing forward over the surface. If the head stays out too long, the recovery is hindered.

Normally, swimmers take a breath every other stroke, which can be maintained over long distances. Often, breathing every stroke slows the swimmer down. (At a certain level, a breathing stroke becomes just as fast as a nonbreathing stroke; therefore, highly experienced competitors, such as Michael Phelps, may breathe every stroke.) Elite swimmers practice breathing intervals such as the &quot;two up, one down&quot; approach. They breathe for two successive strokes, then keep their head in the water on the next stroke for easier breathing. Swimmers with good lung capacity might also breathe every 3rd stroke during sprints for the finish. Some swimmers can even hold their breaths for an entire race (assuming it is short). To swim with the best results, keeping one&#x27;s head down when taking a breath is important. If the swimmer lifts their head too high, the swimmer&#x27;s hips often drop, creating drag, thus slowing the swimmer down. The closer one&#x27;s head is to the water; the better one swims the general technique used by swimmers.

=== Body movement ===
The proper utilization of the core muscles, in conjunction with precise timing and fluid body movement, greatly facilitates the execution of the butterfly stroke. The body moves in a wave-like fashion, controlled by the core, and as the chest is pressed down, the hips go up, and the posterior breaks the water surface and transfers into a fluid kick. During the push phase, the chest goes up, and the hips are at their lowest position. In this style, the second pulse in the cycle is stronger than the first one, as the second one is more in flow with the body movement.

Although butterfly is very compatible with diving, the resulting reduction in wave drag does not lead to an overall drag reduction. In the modern style of the butterfly stroke, one does only a little vertical movement of the body.

=== Start ===
Butterfly uses the regular start for swimming, if in a competition the swimmer would start off a diving block. After the start, a gliding phase follows underwater, followed by dolphin kicks swimming underwater. Swimming underwater reduces the drag from breaking the surface and is very economical. Rules allow for 15 m underwater swimming before the head breaks the surface and regular swimming begins.

=== Turn and finish ===
The turn and finish requires the swimmer to touch the wall &quot;with both hands separated and simultaneously&quot;. Both hands must simultaneously touch the wall during turns and finish while the swimmer remains swimming face down. The swimmer touches the wall with both hands while bending the elbows slightly. The bent elbows allow the swimmer to push themself away from the wall and turn sideways. One hand leaves the wall to be moved to the front underwater. At the same time, the legs are pulled closer and moved underneath the body towards the wall. The second hand leaves the wall to be moved to the front over water. It is commonly referred to as an &quot;over/under turn&quot; or an &quot;open turn&quot;. The legs touch the wall, and the hands are at the front. The swimmer sinks underwater and lies on the breast, or nearly so. Then the swimmer pushes off the wall, keeping a streamlined position with the hands to the front. Like the start, the swimmer is allowed to swim 15 metres underwater before the head breaks the surface. Most swimmers dolphin kick after an initial gliding phase.

=== Styles ===
There are four styles of the butterfly stroke.

Two main styles of butterfly stroke seen today are: &quot;arm pull up simultaneous with dolphin kick&quot; and &quot;arm pull down simultaneous with dolphin kick&quot;.

&quot;Arm pull up simultaneous with dolphin kick&quot;:
After the head goes underwater, both arms go underwater but are still higher than the head. After the first dolphin kick, &quot;pull both arms immediately with downward motion&quot;. While pulling, arms and legs are relaxed, and both knees and waist are slightly bent to prepare the dolphin kick. After the arms push the water backwards, pull the arms up simultaneously with a dolphin kick. In this style, the turning point from drowning to floating is at the time of downward arm motion.

&quot;Arm pull down simultaneous with dolphin kick&quot;:
After the head goes underwater, both arms go underwater until lower than the head. After the first dolphin kick, &quot;raise both arms with relax&quot;. While rising arms, bend both knees and waist to send the body back to the surface and prepare a dolphin kick. Pull both arms downward while executing the dolphin kick. After this sequence, immediately push the water backward. In this style, a turning point from drowning to floating is at the time of the waist bend.

Two additional styles of butterfly stroke are similar to the two styles above but without a &quot;second&quot; dolphin kick. This allows the swimmer to conserve energy and be more relaxed.

== FINA butterfly stroke rules ==

As of the 1st January 2023, the FINA rules for the butterfly stroke state the following rules:

SW 8.1 From the beginning of the first arm stroke after the start and each turn, the body shall be kept on the breast. It is not permitted to roll onto the back at any time, except at the turn after the touch of the wall where it is permissible to turn in any manner as long as the body is on the breast when leaving the wall.

SW 8.2 Both arms shall be brought forward simultaneously over the water and brought backward simultaneously under the water throughout the race, subject to SW 8.5.

SW 8.3 All up and down movements of the legs must be simultaneous. The legs or the feet need not be on the same level, but they shall not alternate in relation to each other. A breaststroke kicking movement is not permitted.

SW 8.4 At each turn and at the finish of the race, the touch shall be made with both hands separated and simultaneously, at, above or below the water surface.

SW 8.5 At the start and at turns, a swimmer is permitted one or more leg kicks and one arm pull under the water, which must bring him to the surface. It shall be permissible for a swimmer to be completely submerged for a distance of not more than 15 metres after the start and after each turn. By that point, the head must have broken the surface. The swimmer must remain on the surface until the next turn or finish.

<doc id="359626" wikidata="Q217200" url="?curid=359626" title="Second Industrial Revolution">
<text>The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, was a phase of rapid scientific discovery, standardisation, mass production and industrialisation from the late 19th century into the early 20th century. The First Industrial Revolution, which ended in the middle of the 19th century, was punctuated by a slowdown in important inventions before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its events can be traced to earlier innovations in manufacturing, such as the establishment of a machine tool industry, the development of methods for manufacturing interchangeable parts, as well as the invention of the Bessemer process and open hearth furnace to produce steel, later developments heralded the Second Industrial Revolution, which is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the beginning of World War I).

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of technological systems such as telegraph and railroad networks, gas and water supply, and sewage systems, which had earlier been limited to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of colonialism and globalization. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly electrical power and telephones. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory electrification and the production line; it ended at the beginning of World War I.

Starting in 1947, the Information Age is sometimes also called the Third Industrial Revolution.

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, but also in France, the Low Countries, Italy and Japan. It followed on from the First Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe. It came to an end with the start of the World War I. While the First Revolution was driven by limited use of steam engines, interchangeable parts and mass production, and was largely water-powered, especially in the United States, the Second was characterized by the build-out of railroads, large-scale iron and steel production, widespread use of machinery in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the telegraph, use of petroleum and the beginning of electrification. It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large-scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by Patrick Geddes, &quot;Cities in Evolution&quot; (1910), and was being used by economists such as Erich Zimmermann (1951), but David Landes&#x27; use of the term in a 1966 essay and in &quot;The Unbound Prometheus&quot; (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by Alfred Chandler (1918–2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use. In 2003, Landes stressed the importance of new technologies, especially the internal combustion engine, petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and chemicals, electricity and communication technologies, such as the telegraph, telephone, and radio.

One author has called the period from 1867 to 1914, during which most of the great innovations were developed, &quot;The Age of Synergy&quot; since the inventions and innovations were engineering and science-based.

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads. Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives. This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.

=== Iron ===
The hot blast technique, in which the hot flue gas from a blast furnace is used to preheat combustion air blown into a blast furnace, was invented and patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. Falling costs for producing wrought iron coincided with the emergence of the railway in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium. Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. Edward Alfred Cowper developed the Cowper stove in 1857. This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem. The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces. The Cowper stove is still used in today&#x27;s blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with coke using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.

=== Steel ===
The Bessemer process, invented by Sir Henry Bessemer, allowed the mass-production of steel, increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from pig iron by oxidation with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The &quot;acid&quot; Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce hematite ore which is low in phosphorus. Sidney Gilchrist Thomas developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the phosphorus from iron. Collaborating with his cousin, Percy Gilchrist a chemist at the Blaenavon Ironworks, Wales, he patented his process in 1878; Bolckow Vaughan &amp; Co. in Yorkshire was the first company to use his patented process. His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.

The next great advance in steel making was the Siemens–Martin process. Sir Charles William Siemens developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens–Martin process complemented rather than replaced the Bessemer process. Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, skyscrapers, and ships. Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were steel cable, steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, armored fighting vehicles and naval ships.

=== Rail ===

The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that railways could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. Wrought iron was soft and contained flaws caused by included dross. Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and were damaged by hammer blow. The first to make durable rails of steel rather than wrought iron was Robert Forester Mushet at the Darkhill Ironworks, Gloucestershire in 1857.

The first of Mushet&#x27;s steel rails was sent to Derby Midland railway station. The rails were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily. This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of railways throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.

The first commercially available steel rails in the US were manufactured in 1867 at the Cambria Iron Works in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Steel rails lasted over ten times longer than did iron, and with the falling cost of steel, heavier weight rails were used. This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads. Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world, producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.

=== Electrification ===

The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist Michael Faraday. Through his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current, Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.
In 1881, Sir Joseph Swan, inventor of the first feasible incandescent light bulb, supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. Swan&#x27;s lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the first electrical street lighting installation in the world. This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home. The first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882 and later at Pearl Street Station in New York City.
The first modern power station in the world was built by the English electrical engineer Sebastian de Ferranti at Deptford. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) alternating current, it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage AC power that was then &quot;stepped down&quot; with transformers for consumer use on each street. Electrification allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the assembly line and mass production.

Electrification was called &quot;the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century&quot; by the National Academy of Engineering. Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. Frank J. Sprague developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric street railways were either using his equipment or in planning. The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920. The AC motor (Induction motor) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the electrification of industry. Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. Fluorescent lighting was commercially introduced at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair.

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of electro-chemicals, such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.

=== Machine tools ===
The use of machine tools began with the onset of the First Industrial Revolution. The increase in mechanization required more metal parts, which were usually made of cast iron or wrought iron—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was John Wilkinson&#x27;s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in James Watt&#x27;s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to Henry Maudslay and refined by Joseph Whitworth. Standardization of screw threads began with Henry Maudslay around 1800, when the modern screw-cutting lathe made interchangeable V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, Joseph Whitworth created a design that, through its adoption by many British railway companies, became the world&#x27;s first national machine tool standard called British Standard Whitworth. During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of machine tools to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the Ford Model T used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity. Henry Ford is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.

=== Paper making ===

The first paper making machine was the Fourdrinier machine, built by Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers in London. In 1800, Matthias Koops, working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.

It was in the 1840s, that Charles Fenerty in Nova Scotia and Friedrich Gottlob Keller in Saxony both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper. This started a new era for paper making, and, together with the invention of the fountain pen and the mass-produced pencil of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary printing press, wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the clerk, or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The petroleum industry, both production and refining, began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist James Young set up a tiny business refining the crude oil in 1848. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named &quot;paraffine oil&quot; because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax. In 1850 Young built the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world at Bathgate, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture naphtha and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

Cable tool drilling was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells. The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine. Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil, Edwin Drake&#x27;s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first &quot;modern oil well&quot;. Drake&#x27;s well touched off a major boom in oil production in the United States. Drake learned of cable tool drilling from Chinese laborers in the U. S. The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters. Similar developments around Baku fed the European market.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil. Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the gas mantle. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. Gasoline was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the Burton process for thermal cracking doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.

=== Chemical ===

Synthetic dye was discovered by English chemist William Henry Perkin in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin&#x27;s accidental discovery was that aniline could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new &quot;mauveine&quot;, and commercialized it as the world&#x27;s first synthetic dye.

After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe. Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The screw propeller was introduced in 1835 by Francis Pettit Smith who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller. The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith&#x27;s SS &quot;Archimedes&quot;, the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven and the paddle steamer ; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6 km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by Horseley Ironworks and named the &quot;Aaron Manby&quot;. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the surface condenser, which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The &quot;Great Western&quot;
, built by engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was the longest ship in the world at with a keel and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel&#x27;s strength. In addition to its steam-powered paddle wheels, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the &quot;Great Britain&quot;, launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel. Brunel&#x27;s vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient multiple expansion steam engines began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight. The oscillating engine was first built by Aaron Manby and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. To achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term &quot;oscillating&quot;.

It was John Penn, engineer for the Royal Navy who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the grasshopper beam engine. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the Admiralty yacht, with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of Boulton &amp; Watt and Maudslay, Son &amp; Field. Penn also introduced the trunk engine for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. (1846) and (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn&#x27;s death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern battleships in the 1870s, evolved from the ironclad design of the 1860s. The &quot;Devastation&quot;-class turret ships were built for the British Royal Navy as the first class of ocean-going capital ship that did not carry sails, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The vulcanization of rubber, by American Charles Goodyear and Englishman Thomas Hancock in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of rubber tyres

John Boyd Dunlop developed the first practical pneumatic tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop&#x27;s newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre&#x27;s first ever races in Ireland and then England.
 Dunlop&#x27;s development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of road transport and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer Harry John Lawson in 1876, although it was John Kemp Starley who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later. Its popularity soon grew, causing the bike boom of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the Macadam method pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam, and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern tarmac was patented by British civil engineer Edgar Purnell Hooley in 1901.

===Automobile===
German inventor Karl Benz patented the world&#x27;s first automobile in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages&#x27; wooden ones) with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator. Power was transmitted by means of two roller chains to the rear axle. It was the first automobile entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle, advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen, in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

Henry Ford built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903. Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford&#x27;s vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker. The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with machine tools and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the assembly line, the complete process being called mass production. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year. The savings from mass production methods allowed the price of the Model T to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.($ in dollars)

===Applied science===
Applied science opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of thermodynamics and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of physical chemistry. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of metallurgy was advanced through the work of Henry Clifton Sorby and others. Sorby pioneered metallography, the study of metals under the microscope, which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength. This paved the way for Henry Bessemer and Robert Forester Mushet to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as chromium, molybdenum, titanium, vanadium and nickel which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. Vanadium steel, for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel. Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s. Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery. Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of Justus von Liebig and August Wilhelm von Hofmann laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the &quot;father of the fertilizer industry&quot; for his discovery of nitrogen as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company which produced the Oxo meat extract. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the Royal College of Chemistry, introduced modern conventions for molecular modeling and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of thermodynamics was developed into its modern form by Sadi Carnot, William Rankine, Rudolf Clausius, William Thomson, James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and steam turbines. The work of Michael Faraday and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of electricity.

Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell was particularly influential—his discoveries ushered in the era of modern physics. His most prominent achievement was to formulate a set of equations that described electricity, magnetism, and optics as manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely the electromagnetic field. The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by Hughes, Marconi and others.

Maxwell himself developed the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of control theory. Control theory is the basis for process control, which is widely used in automation, particularly for process industries, and for controlling ships and airplanes. Control theory was developed to analyze the functioning of centrifugal governors on steam engines. These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by James Watt. Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders. However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the set point. James Clerk Maxwell wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory. The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
Justus von Liebig was the first to understand the importance of ammonia as fertilizer, and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to plant nutrition. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating phosphate of lime in bone meal with sulfuric acid. Another pioneer was John Bennet Lawes who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.

The discovery of coprolites in commercial quantities in East Anglia, led Fisons and Edward Packard to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at Bramford, and Snape in the 1850s. By the 1870s superphosphates produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at Ipswich.

The Birkeland–Eyde process was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist Kristian Birkeland along with his business partner Sam Eyde in 1903, but was soon replaced by the much more efficient Haber process,
developed by the Nobel Prize-winning chemists Carl Bosch of IG Farben and Fritz Haber in Germany. The process used molecular nitrogen (N2) and methane (CH4) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of ammonia (NH3). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of nitric acid.

===Engines and turbines===
The steam turbine was developed by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884. His first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kW (10 hp) of electricity. The invention of Parson&#x27;s steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare. By the time of Parson&#x27;s death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations. Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine&#x27;s first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used internal combustion engine was the Otto type of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention. The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today&#x27;s common gasoline engine.

The diesel engine was independently designed by Rudolf Diesel and Herbert Akroyd Stuart in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world&#x27;s most efficient prime mover.

===Telecommunications===

The first commercial telegraph system was installed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in May 1837 between Euston railway station and Camden Town in London.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first undersea telegraph cable being built by John Watkins Brett between France and England.
The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in London in 1856 to undertake construction of a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. This was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, captained by Sir James Anderson after many mishaps along the away. From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line.

The telephone was patented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell, and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. David Edward Hughes and Heinrich Hertz both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.

It was Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century. He founded The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company in Britain in 1897 and in the same year transmitted Morse code across Salisbury Plain, sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from Poldhu, Cornwall to Signal Hill, Newfoundland. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.

The key development of the vacuum tube by Sir John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. Lee De Forest&#x27;s subsequent invention of the triode allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern business enterprise by scholars such as Alfred Chandler. Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement. Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough. A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather. A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform. This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority. When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines along the railroads to keep track of trains.

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous. Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs. For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight. They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time. This led to what was called &quot;railroad accounting&quot;, which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.

Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, Frederick Winslow Taylor and others in America developed the concept of scientific management or Taylorism. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as time-and-motion studies, but the concepts evolved into fields such as industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, and business management that helped to completely restructure the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor&#x27;s core principles included:

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing &quot;detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker&#x27;s discrete task&quot;
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==

The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in productivity. This caused unemployment and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.

&quot;The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a century -or during the present generation of living men- have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world&#x27;s history&quot;.
Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from public health initiatives, such as the construction of the London sewerage system in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies—(the Metropolis Water Act introduced regulation of the water supply companies in London, including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power. Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.

Improvements in steam efficiency, like triple-expansion steam engines, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade. Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the Jevons paradox.

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships. This, plus the opening of the Suez Canal, led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods. This led to many business failures and periods that were called &quot;depressions&quot; that occurred as the world economy actually grew. See also: Long depression

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in Britain by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the Low Countries) in the 1830s and &#x27;40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% and the vast majority of the British population was urbanized. This milestone was reached by the Low Countries and the US in the 1950s.

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in free trade throughout this period. The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life. They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII. Major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, combustion turbines (jet engines) and the Green Revolution. Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

==United Kingdom==

New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in steam engine design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The chemical industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques after 1910 greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe&#x27;s industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe Long Depression of 1873–1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low – and falling – profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century. The Gilded Age in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and coal mining. The iconic event was the opening of the First transcontinental railroad in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation&#x27;s financial market in Wall Street. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry—a few large corporations, some organized as &quot;trusts&quot; (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the Bessemer process. The first billion-dollar corporation was United States Steel, formed by financier J. P. Morgan in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by Andrew Carnegie and others.

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.

==Germany==
The German Empire came to rival Britain as Europe&#x27;s primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German concern system (known as &quot;Konzerne&quot;), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital. Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany&#x27;s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France&#x27;s industrial base.

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemical. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies &quot;the world&#x27;s first truly managerial industrial enterprises&quot;. There were many spin offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.

==Belgium==
Belgium during the Belle Époque showed the value of the railways for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it broke away from the Netherlands and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.

==Alternative uses==

There have been other times that have been called &quot;second industrial revolution&quot;. Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of medieval technology in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the Tang dynasty, or of ancient Roman technology, as first. &quot;Second industrial revolution&quot; has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after World War I.

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the Atomic Age were more intense and lasting than those over the Space age but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the 21st century the term &quot;second industrial revolution&quot; has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical molecular nanotechnology systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today&#x27;s modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy. Subsequent industrial revolutions include the Digital revolution and Environmental revolution.

<doc id="359633" wikidata="Q1656923" url="?curid=359633" title="Charles Gibson">
<text>Charles deWolf Gibson (born March 9, 1943) is an American broadcast television anchor, journalist, and podcaster. Gibson was a host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1987 to 1998 and again from 1999 to 2006, and the anchor of &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot; from 2006 to 2009.

In 1965, Gibson worked as the news director for Princeton University&#x27;s student-run radio station, a radio producer for RKO, and a reporter for local television stations. In 1975, he joined ABC News, where he worked as a general assignment reporter and a correspondent from Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
Gibson was born on March 9, 1943, in Evanston, Illinois, to Georgianna Law and Burdett Gibson, and is a great-nephew of graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson. He grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended the Sidwell Friends School, a private college-preparatory school in Washington.

In 1965, Gibson graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University, where he was News Director for WPRB-FM, the university radio station, and a member of Princeton Tower Club. Gibson completed a senior thesis titled &quot;The Land and Capital Problems of Pre-Famine Ireland.&quot; In 1966, he served in the United States Coast Guard.

==Career==

===Early career===
Gibson joined RKO General in 1966 as a producer and later worked as a reporter and anchor for WLVA (now WSET) television in Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1970, he moved to WMAL-TV (now WJLA) television, the ABC network affiliate in Washington, D.C. Gibson joined the syndicated news service Television News Inc. (TVN) in 1974. For TVN, he covered the Watergate scandal investigations and the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

===ABC News===

====Field correspondent====
Gibson joined ABC News in 1975, where he worked as its White House correspondent from 1976 to 1977, a general assignment reporter from 1977 to 1981, and House of Representatives correspondent from 1981 to 1987. Gibson was a correspondent and fill-in anchor for &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot; anchored &quot;ABC World News Saturday&quot; and substitute anchor on the late-night hard and soft news program &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;World News This Morning&quot;.

====&quot;Good Morning America&quot;====

On February 23, 1987, Gibson first became a co-anchor of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, alongside Joan Lunden. From 1985 to 1995, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; was the most-watched morning show on American television.

Gibson hosted and narrated the Maryland Public Television documentary &quot;Lucky Number&quot;, a program about problem gambling, in 1990.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Vice President Dan Quayle used part of an interview between Gibson and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot to claim that Perot displayed contempt towards the United States Constitution. On the October 22, 1991, edition of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Gibson asked Perot what Perot would advise President George H. W. Bush to do to &quot;jump-start the economy&quot;. Perot stated that the U.S. helped Germany and Japan write their respective nations&#x27; constitutions: &quot;This was at a time when the Industrial Revolution had occurred. Our Constitution was written 200 years ago, before it occurred.&quot; He added that those nations &quot;have an intelligent relationship between business and government.&quot; Vice President Quayle responded: &quot;Mr. Perot, we do not need a new constitution. Our Constitution has served us well.&quot; When Gibson interviewed Democratic presidential candidate and then-Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton on June 28, 1992, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Gibson repeatedly pressed Clinton to name his vice presidential candidate. Gibson interviewed President Bush on October 9 that year; Bush stated that he questioned Clinton&#x27;s judgment, not patriotism, in traveling to the Soviet Union in 1969.

On May 1, 1998, Gibson left the program and ABC replaced him with Kevin Newman. Newman began hosting &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on May 4, 1998. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; then began losing viewers to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. In May 1996, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; averaged 4.17 million viewers daily, and &quot;Today&quot; averaged 4.43 million; that gap expanded to 3.12 for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and 5.26 for &quot;Today&quot;. ABC reinstated Gibson to &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on January 18, 1999, with Diane Sawyer as co-host. He remained as co-anchor until June 28, 2006, when he left to anchor World News Tonight, after having spent 19 years with the morning program. In 1998 and 1999, he was a co-anchor, with Connie Chung, on the Monday edition of the ABC newsmagazine program &quot;20/20&quot;.

On September 11, 2001, Gibson was anchoring &quot;Good Morning America&quot; with Diane Sawyer when coverage of the World Trade Center attacks began. Both anchors turned coverage over to colleague Peter Jennings moments after the second plane hit the South Tower.

During the 2004 U.S. presidential-election campaign, Gibson moderated the second presidential debate in St. Louis, Missouri, between the two nominee candidates – Republican incumbent U.S. President George W. Bush and Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry. That debate took place on October 8, 2004.

====&quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot;====
In the summer of 2005, Gibson began substitute anchoring &quot;World News Tonight&quot; (its name at the time) regularly after long-time anchor Peter Jennings&#x27;s treatment for lung cancer prevented him from anchoring. On August 7, 2005, Gibson announced Jennings&#x27;s death and the following day anchored &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, and was eventually offered the job.

Though Gibson was a leading choice to replace Jennings, he could not agree with David Westin, President of &quot;ABC News&quot;, over how long he would be anchor. On January 2, 2006, Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff, veteran &quot;ABC News&quot; journalists, were chosen to be Jennings&#x27;s permanent replacements. They had both been interim anchors. Vargas had been designated by Peter Jennings as his only favored choice as back up anchor on September 11, 2001.

Following Woodruff&#x27;s severe injury on January 29, 2006, while on assignment in Iraq, and Vargas&#x27;s announcement that she was pregnant, some critics questioned whether Vargas could sustain the program on her own, pointing to falling ratings. In July 2006, Cindy Adams of the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Gibson would become Woodruff&#x27;s &quot;Temporary Permanent Replacement&quot; on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. According to some reports, while GMA co-host Diane Sawyer had coveted the &quot;World News Tonight&quot; anchor chair, Gibson had one year on his contract left and threatened to retire if he didn&#x27;t get that position, and as GMA was ABC News&#x27; most lucrative show, it would be badly damaged if it lost both Sawyer and Gibson.

On May 23, 2006, Gibson was named sole anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, effective May 29, 2006, after Vargas announced her resignation from the program. She cited her doctors&#x27; recommendation to reduce considerably her workload because of her upcoming maternity leave, and her wish to spend more time with her new baby. She would return to anchor &quot;20/20&quot;.

During the summer of 2006, the program&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he had previously planned to retire from &quot;ABC News&quot; on June 22, 2007, but remained to anchor the newscast.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential-election campaign, Gibson was a co-moderator with George Stephanopoulos, another &quot;ABC News&quot; journalist, for the April 16, 2008, Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential-election debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama; it was broadcast exclusively by &quot;ABC News&quot;. Both moderators were later criticized in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other media outlets for their selection of insubstantial, &quot;gotcha&quot;-style questions. Stephanopoulos acknowledged the legitimacy of the concerns over the order of the questions, but said they were regarding issues in the campaign that had not been covered in previous debates. ABC had sought out a woman who opposed Obama and aired a video of her asking a trivial question, repeated by Stephanopolous, about why Obama wasn&#x27;t wearing a flag pin. The question brought widespread criticism from the media. He moderated both the Republican and the Democratic ABC, Facebook debates at Saint Anselm College on January 5, 2008.

On September 11, 2008, Gibson interviewed Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee candidate, her first interview after being named as presidential nominee John McCain&#x27;s running mate. The interview received criticism from some political commentators, specifically surrounding Gibson&#x27;s question regarding the term &#x27;Bush Doctrine&#x27; due to its having a variety of differing meanings.

During Gibson&#x27;s tenure, &quot;World News&quot; was a solid competitor and sporadically beat &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, anchored by Brian Williams, in the program ratings during 2007, the first time in several years, and the ABC program became much more distant second place after he retired. The two programs have taken turns at the top of the ratings among household viewers and the 25–54 age group prized by advertisers. Katie Couric&#x27;s &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; remained a distant third. During his last few months as anchor, Gibson also worked on a special documentary about the oil industry entitled &quot;Over a Barrel: The Truth About Oil,&quot; which was a critical and ratings success and earned him several awards.

According to reports, while ABC tried to persuade Gibson to stay on as anchor, he decided to retire. On September 2, 2009, &quot;ABC News&quot; announced that Diane Sawyer would replace Gibson at the &quot;World News&quot; anchor chair following his retirement from ABC News. Gibson anchored his final edition of World News on December 18, 2009.

==Recent work==
In December 2010, Gibson participated as a speaker on Voices in Leadership, an original Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health webcast series, in a discussion titled, &quot;Lessons Learned as an ABC News Anchor,&quot; moderated by Dr. Robert Blendon.

In 2016, he appears as a news anchor in season 4 of the Netflix original series &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

During ABC News&#x27; live presidential election coverage on November 8, 2016, Gibson appeared as a contributor.

On May 2, 2022, Gibson returned to ABC where he hosted a podcast for ABC Audio with his daughter Kate. The podcast, titled The Bookcase was designed to feature authors, book industry insiders and local independent bookstores. The first episode featured Oprah Winfrey who discussed the impact of her bookclub, how she picks her choices and her own reading habits.

==Awards and honors==
In 1973, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded him a National Journalism Fellowship. The Radio Television Digital News Association awarded Gibson the Paul White Award in 2006, and in 2008 Quinnipiac University awarded him the Fred Friendly First Amendment Award.

==Personal life==

Gibson&#x27;s wife, Arlene Gibson, is an educator who retired in 2006 as head of school at The Spence School in New York City. She has also held positions at other schools in New York City and New Jersey, and was previously the head of the middle school at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland, in the 1980s. She is on the board of trustees at her &quot;alma mater&quot;, Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

They have two daughters, Jessica and Katherine. On March 14, 2006, Jessica gave birth to Gibson&#x27;s first grandchild.

Gibson has resided with his family in Summit, New Jersey.

Beginning in 2006, Gibson was a member of the board of trustees of Princeton University, until his term expired in 2015.

He was also presented with a doctor of humane letters, an honorary degree.

On June 17, 2007, Gibson delivered the commencement address to the class of 2007&#x27;s graduation ceremony at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Gibson also received an honorary doctor of humane letters, as well as a framed copy of his father&#x27;s 1923 college yearbook entry. His father, Burdett Gibson, grew up in Schenectady and graduated from the college in 1923. Gibson contributed an estimated US$75,000 to the college to help create the Burdett Gibson Class of 1923 Scholarship, which is awarded annually to a deserving student in need.

<doc id="359635" wikidata="Q160712" url="?curid=359635" title="German cruiser Admiral Scheer">
<text> () was a heavy cruiser (often termed a &quot;pocket battleship&quot;) which served with the (Navy) of Nazi Germany during World War II. The vessel was named after Admiral Reinhard Scheer, German commander in the Battle of Jutland. She was laid down at the shipyard in Wilhelmshaven in June 1931 and completed by November 1934. Originally classified as an armored ship () by the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers.

The ship was nominally under the limitation on warship size imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, though with a full load displacement of , she significantly exceeded it. Armed with six guns in two triple gun turrets, and her sisters were designed to outgun any cruiser fast enough to catch them. Their top speed of left only a handful of ships in the Anglo-French navies able to catch them and powerful enough to sink them.

 saw heavy service with the German Navy, including a deployment to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, where she bombarded the port of Almería. Her first operation during World War II was a commerce raiding operation into the southern Atlantic Ocean; she also made a brief foray into the Indian Ocean. During the operation, she sank of shipping, making her the most successful capital ship surface raider of the war. Following her return to Germany, she was deployed to northern Norway to interdict shipping to the Soviet Union. She was part of the abortive attack on Convoy PQ 17 and conducted Operation Wunderland, a sortie into the Kara Sea. After returning to Germany at the end of 1942, the ship served as a training ship until the end of 1944, when she was used to support ground operations against the Soviet Army. She moved to Kiel for repairs in March 1945, where she was capsized by British bombers in a raid on 9 April 1945 and partially scrapped; the remainder of the wreck was buried when the inner part of Kiel dockyard was filled in after the war.

==Design==

 was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of , though the ship was officially stated to be within the limit of the Treaty of Versailles. was powered by four sets of MAN nine-cylinder double-acting two-stroke diesel engines. The ship&#x27;s top speed was , at . At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 33 officers and 586 enlisted men, though after 1935 this was significantly increased to 30 officers and 921–1,040 sailors.

″s primary armament was six SK C/28 guns mounted in two triple gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The ship carried a secondary battery of eight SK C/28 guns in single turrets grouped amidships. Her heavy anti-aircraft battery consisted of three twin 8.8 cm L/78 guns. These guns were directed by three SL-4 director posts, installed on each side of the funnel and above the signal bridge. Her middle and light anti-aircraft armament consisted of four twin-mounted C/30 guns and ten single Flak 30 guns. During her refit in 1939-40 the 8.8 cm guns were replaced by three twinC/33 guns, two single 2 cm were landed and two quad 2 cm were added. In 1944 her light anti-aircraft armament consisted of five quad and nine single 2 cm guns By 1945, the anti-aircraft battery had again been reorganized and comprised six 4 cm guns, eight 3.7 cm guns, and thirty-three 2 cm guns.

The ship also carried a pair of quadruple deck-mounted torpedo tubes placed on her stern. The ship was equipped with one Heinkel He 60 seaplane and one catapult. ″s armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 80 mm thick sides. Radar initially consisted of a FMG 39 G(gO) set, though in 1941 this was replaced with an FMG 40 G(gO) set and a FuMO 26 system.

==Service history==
 was ordered by the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; from the shipyard in Wilhelmshaven. Naval rearmament was not popular with the Social Democrats and the Communists in the German , so it was not until 1931 that a bill was passed to build a second . The money for , which was ordered as , was secured after the Social Democrats abstained to prevent a political crisis. Her keel was laid on 25 June 1931, under construction number 123. The ship was launched on 1 April 1933; at her launching, she was christened by Marianne Besserer, the daughter of Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the ship&#x27;s namesake. She was completed slightly over a year and a half later on 12 November 1934, the day she was commissioned into the German fleet. The old pre-dreadnought battleship was removed from service and her crew transferred to the newly commissioned .

At her commissioning in November 1934, was placed under the command of (&quot;KzS&quot;) Wilhelm Marschall. The ship spent the remainder of 1934 conducting sea trials and training her crew. In 1935, she had a new catapult and landing sail system to operate her Arado seaplanes on heavy seas installed. From 1 October 1935 to 26 July 1937 her first officer was Leopold Bürkner, later to become head of foreign intelligence in the Third Reich. By October 1935, the ship was ready for her first major cruise, when on 25–28 October she visited Madeira, returning to Kiel on 8 November. The following summer, she cruised out through the Skagerrak and the English Channel into the Irish Sea, before visiting Stockholm on the return voyage.

===Spanish Civil War===
″s first overseas deployment began in July 1936 when she was sent to Spain to evacuate German civilians caught in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. From 8 August 1936 she served together with her sister ship on non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. She served four tours of duty with the non-intervention patrol through June 1937. Her official objective was to control the influx of war materiel into Spain, though she also recorded Soviet ships carrying supplies to the Republicans and protected ships delivering German weapons to Nationalist forces. During the deployment to Spain, Ernst Lindemann served as the ship&#x27;s first gunnery officer. After was attacked on 29 May 1937 by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft off Ibiza, was ordered to bombard the Republican-held port of Almería in reprisal. On 31 May 1937, the anniversary of the Battle of Jutland, , flying the Imperial War Flag, arrived off Almería at 07:29 and opened fire on shore batteries, naval installations and ships in the harbor. On 26 June 1937, she was relieved by her sister ship , allowing her to return to Wilhelmshaven on 1 July. She returned to the Mediterranean between August and October, however. In September 1936 &quot;KzS&quot; Otto Ciliax had replaced Marschall as the ship&#x27;s commanding officer.

===World War II===
At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, remained at anchor in the Schillig roadstead outside Wilhelmshaven, with the heavy cruiser . On 4 September, two groups of five Bristol Blenheim bombers attacked the ships. The first group surprised the anti-aircraft gunners aboard , who nevertheless managed to shoot down one of the five Blenheims. One bomb struck the ship&#x27;s deck and failed to explode, and two detonated in the water near the ship. The remaining bombs also failed to explode. The second group of five Blenheims were confronted by the alerted German defenses, which shot down four of the five bombers. emerged from the attack undamaged. In November 1939, &quot;KzS&quot; Theodor Krancke became the ship&#x27;s commanding officer.

 underwent a refit while her sister ships set out on commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. was modified during the early months of 1940, including the installation of a new, raked clipper bow. The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.

====Atlantic sortie====
 sailed in October 1940 on her first combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her radio intercept equipment identified the convoy HX 84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. ″s Arado seaplane located the convoy on 5 November 1940. The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued a report of the German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy, which was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. ″s first salvo scored hits on &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen. sank &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; within 22 minutes, but the engagement delayed the German ship long enough for most of the convoy to escape. sank only five of the convoy&#x27;s 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy&#x27;s dispersal.

On 18 December, encountered the refrigerator ship &quot;Duquesa&quot;, . The ship sent off a distress signal, which the German raider deliberately allowed, to draw British naval forces to the area. Krancke wanted to lure British warships to the area to draw attention away from , which had just exited the Denmark Strait. The aircraft carriers and , the cruisers , , and , and the armed merchant cruiser converged to hunt down the German raider, but she eluded the British.

Between 26 December and 7 January, rendezvoused with the supply ships &quot;Nordmark&quot; and , the auxiliary cruiser , and the prizes &quot;Duquesa&quot; and &quot;Storstad&quot;. The raiders transferred some 600 prisoners to &quot;Storstad&quot; while they refueled from and . Between 18 and 20 January captured three Allied merchant ships totalling , including the Norwegian oil tanker . She spent Christmas 1940 at sea in the mid-Atlantic, several hundred miles from Tristan da Cunha, before making a foray into the Indian Ocean in February 1941.

On 14 February, rendezvoused with the auxiliary cruiser and the supply ship about east of Madagascar. The raiders resupplied from and exchanged information on Allied merchant traffic in the area, parting company on 17 February. then steamed to the Seychelles north of Madagascar, where she found two merchant vessels with her Arado floatplanes. She took the oil tanker &quot;British Advocate&quot; as a prize and sank the Greek-flagged &quot;Grigorios&quot;. A third ship, the &quot;Canadian Cruiser&quot;, managed to send a distress signal before sank her on 21 February. The raider encountered and sank a fourth ship the following day, the Dutch steamer &quot;Rantaupandjang&quot;, though she too was able to send a distress signal before she sank.

The British cruiser , which was patrolling in the area, received both messages from ″s victims. &quot;Glasgow&quot; launched reconnaissance aircraft that spotted on 22 February. Vice Admiral Ralph Leatham, the commander of the East Indies Station, deployed the carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; and cruisers , , , , and the Australian to join the hunt. Krancke turned to the south-east to evade his pursuers, reaching the South Atlantic by 3 March. The British, meanwhile, had abandoned the hunt on 25 February when it became clear that had withdrawn from the area.

 then sailed northwards, breaking through the Denmark Strait on 26–27 March and evading the cruisers and . She reached Bergen, Norway on 30 March, where she spent a day in the Grimstadfjord. A destroyer escort joined the ship for the voyage to Kiel, which they reached on 1 April. In the course of her raiding operation, she had steamed over and sunk seventeen merchant ships for a total of . She was by far the most successful German capital ship commerce raider of the entire war. After returning to Germany, Krancke left the ship and was replaced by &quot;KzS&quot; Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken in June 1941. The loss of the battleship in May 1941, and more importantly, the Royal Navy&#x27;s destruction of the German supply ship network in the aftermath of the operation forced a planned Atlantic raiding operation for and her sister at the end of 1941 to be abandoned. From 4 to 8 September, was briefly moved to Oslo. There, on 5 and 8 September, No. 90 Squadron RAF, equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, mounted a pair of unsuccessful attacks on the ship. On 8 September, the ship left Oslo and returned to Swinemünde.

====Deployment to Norway====
On 21 February 1942, , the heavy cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , and steamed to Norway. After stopping briefly in Grimstadfjord, the ships proceeded on to Trondheim. On 23 February, the British submarine torpedoed , causing serious damage. The first operation in Norway in which took part was Operation Rösselsprung, in July 1942. On 2 July, the ship sortied as part of the attempt to intercept Arctic convoy PQ-17. and formed one group while and composed another. While en route to the rendezvous point, and three destroyers ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. was detached to join and in Altafjord. The British detected the German departure and ordered the convoy to scatter. Aware that surprise had been lost, the Germans broke off the surface attack and turned the destruction of PQ-17 over to the U-boats and Luftwaffe. Twenty-four of the convoy&#x27;s thirty-five transports were sunk.

In August 1942, she conducted Operation Wunderland, a sortie into the Kara Sea to interdict Soviet shipping and attack targets of opportunity. The length of the mission and the distances involved precluded a destroyer escort for the operation; three destroyers would escort until they reached Novaya Zemlya, at which point they would return to Norway. Two U-boats — and — patrolled the Kara Gate and the Yugorsky Strait. The Germans originally intended to send with her sister ship , but since the latter had run aground the previous month, she was unavailable for the operation.

The operational plan called for strict radio silence to ensure surprise could be maintained. This required Meendsen-Bohlken to have total tactical and operational control of his ship; shore-based commands would be unable to direct the mission. On 16 August, and her destroyer escort left Narvik on a course to pass to the north of Novaya Zemlya. Upon entering the Kara Sea, she encountered heavy ice; in addition to searching for merchant shipping, the Arado floatplane was used to scout paths through the ice fields. On 25 August, she encountered the Soviet icebreaker . sank the icebreaker, but not before she sent a distress signal. The German ship then turned south, and two days later, arrived off the port of Dikson. damaged two ships in the port and shelled harbor facilities. Meendsen-Bohlken considered sending a landing party ashore, but firing from Soviet shore batteries convinced him to abandon the plan. After breaking off the bombardment, Meendsen-Bohlken decided to return to Narvik. She reached port on 30 August without having achieved any significant successes.

On 23 October , and the destroyers , , , , and left Bogen Bay and proceeded to Trondheim. There, stopped for repairs, while and &quot;Z28&quot; continued on to Germany. Ernst Gruber served as the ship&#x27;s acting commander at the end of November. In December 1942, returned to Wilhelmshaven for major overhaul, where she was attacked and slightly damaged by RAF bombers. Consequently, moved to the less exposed port of Swinemünde. In February 1943, &quot;KzS&quot; Richard Rothe-Roth took command of the ship. Until the end of 1944, was part of the Fleet Training Group.

====Return to the Baltic====
&quot;KzS&quot; Ernst-Ludwig Thienemann, the ship&#x27;s final commander, took command of in April 1944. On 22 November 1944, , the destroyers &quot;Z25&quot; and , and the 2nd Torpedo Boat Flotilla relieved the cruiser and several destroyers supporting German forces fighting the Soviets on the island of Ösel in the Baltic. The Soviet Air Force launched several air attacks on the German forces, all of which were successfully repelled by heavy anti-aircraft fire. The ship&#x27;s Arado floatplane was shot down, however. On the night of 23–24 November, the German naval forces completed the evacuation of the island. In all, 4,694 troops were evacuated from the island.

In early February 1945, stood off Samland with several torpedo boats in support of German forces fighting Soviet advances. On 9 February, the ships began shelling Soviet positions. Between 18 and 24 February, German forces launched a local counterattack; and the torpedo boats provided artillery support, targeting Soviet positions near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug. The German attack temporarily restored the land connection to Königsberg. The ship&#x27;s guns were badly worn out by March and in need of repair. On 8 March, departed the eastern Baltic to have her guns relined in Kiel; she carried 800 civilian refugees and 200 wounded soldiers. An uncleared minefield prevented her from reaching Kiel, and so she unloaded her passengers in Swinemünde. Despite her worn-out gun barrels, the ship then shelled Soviet forces outside Kolberg until she used up her remaining ammunition.

The ship then loaded refugees and left Swinemünde; she successfully navigated the minefields on the way to Kiel, arriving on 18 March. Her stern turret had its guns replaced at the Deutsche Werke shipyard by early April. During the repair process, most of the ship&#x27;s crew went ashore. On the night of 9 April 1945, a general RAF bombing raid by over 300 aircraft struck the harbor in Kiel. was hit by bombs and capsized. She was partially broken up for scrap after the end of the war, though part of the hull was left in place and buried with rubble from the attack when the inner harbors were filled in post-war. The number of casualties from her loss is unknown.

In 2024, an industrial archeologist and a geophysicist, along with a team of researchers using reflection seismology, examined a parking lot of a navy arsenal in Kiel where they suspected the wreck was buried. Some 70 percent of were located, including the main guns and superstructure.

The 2020 population of Lakeview was 103,050 residents, making it the second-largest Chicago community area by population.

West Lakeview is composed of smaller neighborhood enclaves such as Lincoln Hub and Southport Corridor. Lakeview East, also known as the Greater Lakeview area, hosts the Central Lakeview Business District, Sheridan Station Corridor, Wrigleyville, Broadway Corridor and North Halsted. It is famous for its large LGBT population and holds a pride parade each June and Northalsted Market Days. Wrigleyville surrounds Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs. Lakeview is home to the Belmont Theater District, showcasing over 20 theaters and live performance venues located near the Belmont ‘L’ station. In 2013, &quot;Money Magazine&quot; named Lakeview number three in its top ten big-city neighborhoods in its Best Places to Live rankings.

==History==
===Settlement===
Lakeview was used as a camp and trail path for the Miami, Ottawa, and Winnebago Native American tribes. In 1837, Conrad Sulzer of Winterthur, Zürich, Switzerland, became the first known European settler to live in the area. In 1853, one of the first permanent structures was built by James Rees and Elisha Hundley on the corner where present-day West Byron Street (or West Sheridan Road) meets North Lake Shore Drive. It was called the Hotel Lakeview, named for the hotel&#x27;s unobstructed view of the shore of Lake Michigan. It gained what was characterized as a resort atmosphere.

The early settlement continued to grow amongst the English settlers, assisted by increased immigration of farming families from Germany, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Lakeview experienced a population boom as Chicago suffered a deadly and devastating cholera outbreak. The Hotel Lakeview served as a refuge for many Chicagoans but became filled to capacity. Homestead lands were sold, and housing was built. Access to the new community was provided by a wooden plank road connected to present-day West Fullerton Parkway, which was called Lakeview Plank Road and is present-day North Broadway. With infrastructure and a growing population, residents realized it was time to organize formal governance to provide essential public services.

===Lakeview Township===

According to the Lakeview East Chamber of Commerce, Lakeview was an incorporated Illinois civil township with a charter granted by the Illinois General Assembly, independent of neighboring Chicago. Lakeview&#x27;s first township election was held in 1857. The main building was Town Hall at the intersection of present-day West Addison and North Halsted streets. A building still bearing that name stands today as the former headquarters of the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s 23rd District. Lakeview Township included all land east of Western Avenue, between Devon Avenue and North Avenue, generally encompassing the community areas of Edgewater, Uptown, Lakeview and Lincoln Park, as well as the eastern sections of what are now the community areas of North Center and Lincoln Square.

During the Civil War, the present-day bustling intersection of North Broadway, North Clark Street and West Diversey Parkway was home to Camp Fry. When the camp opened in May 1864, it served as a training facility for the volunteer 132nd and 134th Illinois Infantry regiments. Shortly after their deployment to Columbus, Kentucky, the camp was converted to a prison for Confederate soldiers, where conditions were markedly different from those of many other prisoner-of-war camps. The few residents of the area known as Lakeview Township often complained of rebel sing-alongs held in the camp from time to time.

Lakeview&#x27;s early industry was farming, especially crops of celery, and at the time it was considered a celery-growing capital. From 1870 to 1887, the population of the township grew from 2,000 citizens to 45,000. As a result, there was growing need of more public-service access, and Lakeview was absorbed into Chicago in 1889 as a way of meeting those demands. In 1889, a real estate boom became a major economic stimulant. According to the Lakeview East Chamber of Commerce, over forty percent of the neighborhood&#x27;s present-day buildings were constructed during that time.

===Streets===
West Addison Street was named after Thomas Addison, an English doctor who first described Addison&#x27;s disease.
West Barry Avenue was named after the commander of the Continental Navy ship &quot;Lexington&quot; during the Revolutionary War, John Barry. West Belmont Avenue was named after the American Civil War&#x27;s Battle of Belmont on November 7, 1861, in Mississippi County, Missouri. North Broadway, which used to be called Evanston Avenue after the nearby municipality of Evanston, Illinois, was renamed after Broadway in New York City. North Clark Street was named after the legendary frontier explorer George Rogers Clark. West Diversey Parkway was named after beer brewer Michael Diversey. William Butler Ogden, the first mayor of Chicago, named North Halsted Street after financiers William H. and Caleb Halsted. It was formerly called Dyer Street, in honor of Thomas Dyer, mayor of Chicago. West Irving Park Road was named after the author Washington Irving.

Philip Sheridan features prominently on the corner of West Belmont Avenue and North Lake Shore Drive, memorialized as a towering statue depicting Sheridan on horseback. The U.S. Army general is the namesake of North Sheridan Road, which heads north to Racine, Wisconsin. In 1871, he brought troops to Chicago in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire and was authorized by Mayor Joseph Medill to take control of the city under martial law. He was later made commanding general of the U.S. Army by President Chester A. Arthur.

==Communities==
Lakeview is divided into Lakeview East and Lakeview West, with Lakeview East having distinctive areas that include Wrigleyville, and North Halsted with the latter including Boystown, the city&#x27;s gay village. Lakeview East expanded borders to also include the Central Lakeview area which is home to Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs. The boundaries of Lakeview are 1800 west to the west, Montrose to the north and Clark to the east north of Irving Park, but the rest is of Irving Park to the north, Lake Michigan to the east, and Diversey to the south.

===Lakeview (East)===

Lakeview East is considered part of the Greater Lakeview area. Lakeview East expanded its boundaries in 2017 to include the Central Lakeview area which is home to Wrigley Field. Lakeview East boundaries are defined as: Lake Shore Drive on the East, Racine on the West, Diversey Parkway on the South and Irving Park on the north. Lakeview East area consists of two of the largest entertainment districts in Chicago, Boystown and Wrigleyville. Lakeview East is notable for its Jewish population and has Four synagogues, Chabad of East Lakeview Anshe Sholom B&#x27;nai Israel (Modern Orthodox), Anshe Emet Synagogue (Conservative), and Temple Sholom (Reform and largest synagogue in the Chicago area).

Lakeview, especially along the Lake Shore Drive and Broadway corridors, consists of upscale condominiums and higher-rent mid-rise apartments and lofts. Small businesses, boutiques, restaurants and community institutions are found along North Broadway and North Halsted Street.

Gentrification, diversification and population shift have changed Lakeview, with new developments and new businesses such as Mariano&#x27;s and Target. Historic churches remain preserved as integral parts of the community, such as Lakeview Presbyterian Church and Saint Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church is the residence of an episcopal vicar and auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. It is also the mother church of the local vicariate and the Archdiocesan Gay and Lesbian Outreach, controversially created by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, which is one of the largest of the few gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Catholic welcoming congregations created and authorized by a diocese in the United States.

The Lakeview Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is in southeastern Lakeview, as is the Newport Avenue District, which spans Newport Avenue between Halsted Avenue and Clark Street and includes the historic Vautravers Building.

====Wrigleyville====
Formerly a working-class neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the nickname of the neighborhood directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Wrigley Field is the home of the Chicago Cubs. Within Lakeview East, its borders run from north to south, Grace Street to Cornelia Avenue and from east to west, Wilton Avenue to Racine Avenue.

Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with all you can eat and drink service. Proprietors are able to do so under special agreements with the Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy&#x27;s Bleachers, Casey Moran&#x27;s, Merkle&#x27;s, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.
====Boystown====

The Boystown section of Lakeview holds the distinction of being the nation&#x27;s first gay village officially recognized by a big city government. In 1998, then Mayor Richard M. Daley endeavored to create a $3.2 million restoration of the North Halsted Street corridor, and the city erected rainbow pylon landmarks along the route. In 2012, the Legacy Project began the ongoing process of installing plaques on the pylons that commemorate important people and milestones in LGBT history. It is also the cultural center of one of the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities in the nation. Boystown has grown into a cultural center for the LGBT residents living within the Chicago metropolitan area.

The area caters to Chicago nightlife, featuring more than 60 gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender bars, restaurants and nightclubs. It is now home to Center on Halsted, an LGBT community center that hosts an array of public programs open to the public that provide fun, educational and enlightening opportunities for members of the LGBT community and allies.

The area is host to the Chicago Pride Parade, one of the largest gay pride parades in the nation, which takes place in Lakeview on the last Sunday of each June. The community area has also been host to several other major events: In 2006 it played host to an international sports and cultural festival, Gay Games VII, with its closing ceremonies held at Wrigley Field and headlined by Cyndi Lauper. The area also holds the Northalsted Market Days, an annual two-day festival event geared toward the LGBT community. Northalsted also includes some of Chicago&#x27;s off-Loop theater, specialty restaurants, greystone and brownstone walk-up buildings and other historic architecture, trendy fashion outlets, wine boutiques, chain stores, and independent shops.

The district&#x27;s informal boundaries, overlapping with Lakeview East, are Irving Park Road on the north, Broadway on the east, Wellington Avenue on the south, and Sheffield Avenue on the west. The Center on Halsted, an LGBT community center, is also located in this area.
In November 2020, the Chicago Reader, an alternative newspaper, published an article criticizing the area for focusing on &quot;gay men.&quot; This resulted in the Boystown name being dropped by some businesses and some community organizations in exchange for &quot;Northalsted&quot;, a more neutral name styled by the area business association in 2021. Despite the renaming efforts, the area is still colloquially called Boystown. Some residents have voiced concern that the name change will dilute the neighborhood&#x27;s history as a haven for the gay community.

===Lakeview (West)===
West Lakeview is located along the border of the Roscoe Village community area. West Lakeview Neighbors, a residential organization, defines West Lakeview as the area bounded by West Addison Street on the north, West Diversey Parkway on the south, North Southport Avenue on the east and North Ravenswood Avenue on the west. Affordable real estate and popular culture, such as that found along busy Southport Avenue, draws young adults from all over the city for quiet living or casual dining. A historic destination that opened just north of West Lakeview on August 22, 1929, is the Music Box Theatre, which opened as a new technology sound film venue. The theater brands itself today as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s year-round film festival&quot;. Dinkel&#x27;s Bakery, which was located in West Lakeview near Lincoln and Roscoe, operated in the neighborhood for a century (1922–2022).

===Sheridan Station Corridor===

Sheridan Road, from Irving Park Road to the North and Byron/W. Sheridan Street to the South, is the home of the CTA&#x27;s Sheridan station. The neighborhood name, although only comprising a small area, helps to differentiate this particular Sheridan Road from the other parts of Sheridan Road in Lakeview, Uptown, Edgewater and Rogers Park (and into the North Shore suburbs). This area was once known colloquially as &quot;Restaurant Row&quot;. The strip itself has been located at various times in either the 44th or 46th ward. It is distinguished by the Sheridan &quot;L&quot; Station as well as its proximity to Wrigley Field. Neither technically East, West or Central Lakeview, it is seen as the gateway between Uptown to the North and Lakeview to the South. The residential neighborhood organization is Lakeview East Neighbors Association and the business district has recently been enveloped by Lakeview East Chamber of Commerce.

==Government and politics==
===Elected officials===

Lakeview belongs to four Chicago City Council wards, electing four aldermen as representatives of these wards. Business owner Thomas Tunney represents the 44th Ward. Social worker James Cappleman represents the 46th Ward and Scott Waguespack represents the 32nd Ward. A small portion of the Lakeview community (which includes Lakeview H.S., the Graceland West neighborhood and a small part of the Southport Neighbors Association) is represented by Matt Martin of the 47th Ward. Tunney is the first openly gay alderman to serve in the Chicago City Council.

Lakeview residents are represented in the Illinois Senate by Sara Feigenholtz of the state&#x27;s 6th District. The residents also elect members of the Illinois House of Representatives: Ann Williams of the 11th District, Yoni Pizer of the 12th District and Greg Harris of the 34th District.

Lakeview is represented in the United States Congress by former Cook County Commissioner Mike Quigley, elected from the 5th Congressional District, and by a former consumer rights advocate, Jan Schakowsky, elected from the 9th Congressional District.

===Neighborhood councils===
Thirteen independent neighborhood organizations made up of residents serve as vehicles for direct neighborhood involvement and provide input to municipal and commercial leaders. The Lakeview Citizens&#x27; Council was formed in 1952 and is composed of: Belmont Harbor Neighbors, Central Lakeview Neighbors, East Lakeview Neighbors, Hamlin Park Neighbors, Hawthorne Neighbors, Sheil Park Neighbors, South East Lakeview Neighbors, South Lakeview Neighbors, Southport Neighbors Association, Triangle Neighbors, West DePaul Neighborhood Association and West Lakeview Association.

Two of these organizations do not all fall in the Lakeview Community Area. West DePaul Neighborhood Association is in the Lincoln Park Community Area and Hamlin Park Neighbors is in the North Center Community Area. All others fall within Lakeview&#x27;s boundaries.

Another community group, the Lakeview Action Coalition, is composed of 44 institutional members. They include religious congregations of various denominations, social service agencies, banks, and merchants.

===Presidential elections===
The Lake View community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Lake View cast 40,357 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 5,646 votes for Donald Trump (82.75% to 11.58%). In the 2012 presidential election, Lake View cast 32,004 votes for Barack Obama and cast 10,172 votes for Mitt Romney (73.89% to 23.49%).

===Health===
Lakeview is an important area of the city for health and medicine as it is home to several hospitals and other related institutions. Despite the comparative affluence of the community area, Lakeview social services are also geared toward those needing affordable care, such as displaced youth living on the streets.

Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center and Saint Joseph Hospital of Resurrection Health Care serve residents throughout Chicago and its suburbs.

The Howard Brown Health Center, with several branch locations throughout Lakeview, provides health services for the gay, lesbian and transgender communities as well as for the poor. It offers specialized assistance in HIV, AIDS, domestic violence, therapy and various youth services such as the Broadway Youth Center and the PATH Program for HIV+ Youth.

Center on Halsted, formerly Horizons Community Services, is also a major source of comprehensive social services for the gay and lesbian community. The Illinois Department of Public Health contracts the services of Center on Halsted for a telephone hotline for HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.

===Parking===

Automobile parking is at a premium in Lakeview, especially during special events such as Chicago Cubs home games at Wrigley Field. Special residential parking permits are required for parking on some Lakeview streets; in commercial areas, limited metered parking is available. High-priced public parking lots are available for visitors and baseball fans but are hard to come by. Lakeview residents on blocks with parking restrictions may purchase temporary parking permit slips, available at aldermanic constituent offices, for guests invited to private residences.

===Transportation===
A majority of Lakeview&#x27;s public transportation needs are met by the Chicago Transit Authority, which provides resident and visitor access to the Red Line, Purple Line and Brown Line services of the Chicago Elevated railway rapid transit. Lakeview is served by six L stations: Addison (Red Line), Belmont (Red, Brown, Purple Lines), Paulina (Brown Line), Sheridan (Red Line), Southport (Brown Line), and Wellington (Brown and Purple Lines).

The Chicago Transit Authority also operates numerous bus routes in Lakeview, the busiest being those running along North Lake Shore Drive with express services to downtown Chicago, including the Loop, via North Michigan Avenue and its Magnificent Mile. Bus routes entering and leaving Lakeview are 8 Halsted, 9 Ashland, 22 Clark, 36 Broadway, 77 Belmont, 134 Stockton–LaSalle Express, 135 Clarendon–LaSalle Express, 136 Sheridan–LaSalle Express, 143 Stockton–Michigan Express, 146 Inner Drive Express, 147 Outer Drive Express, 148 Clarendon–Michigan Express, 151 Sheridan, 152 Addison, and 156 LaSalle.

Private entities also offer many transportation services. I-GO and Zipcar have several locations in Lakeview. Private companies offer trolley and bus services to certain destinations in the city from Lakeview. Taxi and limousine services are plentiful in the Lakeview area, as well as non-traditional modes of transportation. Bicycle rickshaws can be found especially near Wrigley Field. Bike paths are becoming more and more available on some major streets as well as on some smaller side-streets as part of the City and 44th Ward&#x27;s &quot;greenway&quot; bike path initiative. For those who prefer to walk or run, manicured walking and running paths are found throughout the community area, with a special path designed for Chicago Marathon training along the lakefront.

The Chicago Marathon training path curves around the Belmont Harbor marina, belonging to the Chicago Park District and managed by contracted companies. There are ten transient slips, several stalls, and finger dock, star dock, and other mooring facilities where boats and yachts can be kept. It is the home of the Belmont Yacht Club.

====Libraries====
As one of the most populated community areas in the city of Chicago, Lakeview has many outlets for education. The John Merlo Branch of the Chicago Public Library (CPL) houses one of the city&#x27;s largest collections of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender literature and large collections called the African American Heritage Collection, Chicago History Collection, Judaica Collection, and Large Print Collection. The Chicago Public Library classifies Merlo&#x27;s Drama and Theatre Collection as very large in size compared to other branches. Although not in Lakeview proper, the Conrad Sulzer Regional Library is host to a special Ravenswood–Lakeview Historical Collection. CPL also states that the Uptown Branch in Uptown provides services to people in Lake View.

==Kwagulth Totem Pole==

In the Lakeview section of Lincoln Park, overlooking the intersection of North Lake Shore Drive, and West Addison Street is a totem pole of Kwanusila, the Thunderbird of the Kwagu&#x27;ł Native American tribe. A plaque below the totem pole reads:

Kwanusila the Thunderbird, is an authentic Kwagu&#x27;ł totem pole, carved in Red Cedar by Tony Hunt of Fort Rupert, British Columbia. The crests carved upon the totem pole represent Kwanusila the Thunderbird, a whale with a man on its back, and a sea monster. Many people do not realize that totem poles were only regionally used by First Nations along the coastal areas of British Columbia. Kwanusila is an exact replica of the original Kraft Lincoln Park totem pole, which was donated to the City of Chicago by James L. Kraft on June 20, 1929, and which stood on the spot until October 9, 1985. It was discovered some years before the pole was moved, that a pole of this type did not exist in the types at the Provincial British Columbia Museum located in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Arrangements were made for a duplicate of the Chicago original to be made by the same Amerindian tribe that made the original. A request was made and approved by the Chicago Park District for the original totem pole which existed here to be presented back to British Columbia. Kwanusila is dedicated to the school children of Chicago, and was presented to the City of Chicago by Kraft, Inc. on May 21, 1986.

Prominently visible from Lake Shore Drive, the totem pole is highlighted on Chicago city maps as a place of interest, visited by residents and tourists alike. The totem pole stands in front of the Jarvis Migratory Bird Sanctuary.

==Events==
A major portion of the Bank of America (formerly LaSalle Bank) Chicago Marathon, one of the largest road races in the world, winds through Lakeview East. The marathon packs spectators onto the sidewalks of Lakeview to cheer race competitors. The route of the annual Bike the Drive noncompetitive bicycle event, which allows participants to bike on Lake Shore Drive, also travel through Lakeview East.

Lakeview hosts many art events. Each spring, the Lakeview East Chamber of Commerce supports gallery tour groups, taking participants through several area art galleries. September brings visitors to the Lakeview East Festival of the Arts on North Broadway between West Belmont Avenue and West Roscoe Street. More than 150 juried artists exhibit their works along with live entertainment, fine food and a variety of performers.

Paramount among Lakeview&#x27;s events, drawing the largest crowds, is the annual Chicago Gay Pride Parade held on the last Sunday of each June along North Broadway, North Halsted Street, and West Diversey Parkway. In addition, for one weekend each August, the North Halsted Street corridor is closed off to automobile traffic for Northalsted Market Days, a popular street fair featuring nationally prominent bands and other entertainment. Food and merchandise booths line the temporary pedestrian thoroughfare.

Lakeview hosts a solemn vigil and march each October, gathering at the intersection of West Roscoe and North Halsted streets, in honor of Matthew Shepard. Each year at the Matthew Shepard March Against Anti-Gay Hate, participants focus on several activist themes. In the past, they have marched against hate crimes and anti-gay social policy or have offered support for gay youth. As the event reflects its socially liberal agendas, political organizations such as the Green Party and Democratic Party have shown an increased presence. Socially liberal Republicans also participate to a smaller degree.

Small but popular Lakeview events take place throughout the year. Each July, the Lakeview Garden Walk takes visitors on trolley tours and walks throughout the neighborhood to over eighty garden exhibits. Each exhibit is prepared and presented by individual residents of Lakeview. Once an event that focused on West Lakeview gardens, the exhibits now span the entire Lakeview area. Families with children are drawn to Nettelhorst Elementary School on Easter weekend for an egg hunt and visit with the Easter bunny. They return on Halloween weekend for a costume parade and story-telling.

Halloween is also the time for a major costume competition that takes place on North Halsted, from Belmont to Cornelia, with an annual theme and categories from children and pets to adult groups from humorous to scary.

<text>In economics, market saturation is a situation in which a product has become diffused (distributed) within a market; the actual level of saturation can depend on consumer purchasing power; as well as competition, prices, and technology.

==Theory of natural limits==
The &quot;theory of natural limits&quot; states: &quot;Every product or service has a natural consumption level. We just don&#x27;t know what it is until we launch it, distribute it, and promote it for a generation&#x27;s time (20 years or more) after which further investment to expand the universe beyond normal limits can be a futile exercise.&quot; —Thomas G. Osenton, economist

Osenton introduced the theory in his 2004 book, &quot;The Death of Demand: Finding Growth in a Saturated Global Economy&quot;; it states that every product or service has a natural consumption level that is determined after a number of years of sales- and marketing-investment (usually around 20 to 25 years). In effect, a relative universe of regular users is naturally established over time, after which any significant expansion of that universe becomes extraordinarily difficult. The point at which these natural limits are reached is known as &quot;innovation saturation&quot;.

===Example===
For example, Time Inc. launched the American weekly consumer-magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1954 with 400,000 subscribers and the numbers of purchasers grew through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s until it reached 3.5 million subscribers in the late 1980s, where it has remained ever since. With some estimates of up to 100 million sports-fans in the United States, many at Time Inc. believed that the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; subscription-base could have increased much more. However, after many years of investment, the sports weekly reached its natural (and most profitable) consumption-level – where it remained for more than 20 years.

==&quot;Flooding the market&quot;==
When suppliers abruptly offer large quantities for sale and saturate the market, this is known as &quot;flooding the market&quot;. 

For example, in advanced economies, more than 97% of households own refrigerators. Hence, the diffusion rate is more than 97%, and the market is said to be saturated; i.e. further growth of sales of refrigerators will occur basically only as a result of population growth and in cases where one manufacturer is able to gain market share at the expense of others.

To give another example, in advanced western households (and depending on the economy), the number of automobiles per family is greater than 1. To the extent that further market growth (i.e. growth of the demand for automobiles) is constrained (the main buyers already own the product), the market is said to be basically saturated. Future sales depend on several factors including the rate of obsolescence (at what age cars are replaced), population growth, societal changes such as the spread of multi-car families, and the creation of new niche markets such as sports cars or camper vans.

<text>A wage is payment made by an employer to an employee for work done in a specific period of time. Some examples of wage payments include payments such as &quot;minimum wage&quot;, &quot;prevailing wage&quot;, and &quot;yearly bonuses,&quot; and payments such as &quot;prizes&quot; and &quot;tip payouts.&quot; Wages are part of the expenses that are involved in running a business. It is an obligation to the employee regardless of the profitability of the company.

Payment by wage contrasts with salaried work, in which the employer pays an arranged amount at steady intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked, with commission which conditions pay on individual performance, and with compensation based on the performance of the company as a whole. Waged employees may also receive tips or gratuity paid directly by clients and employee benefits which are non-monetary forms of compensation. Since wage labour is the predominant form of work, the term &quot;wage&quot; sometimes refers to all forms (or all monetary forms) of employee compensation.

==Origins and necessary components==
Wage labour involves the exchange of money for time spent at work. As Moses I. Finley lays out the issue in &quot;The Ancient Economy&quot;:
:The very idea of wage-labour requires two difficult conceptual steps. First it requires the abstraction of a man&#x27;s labour from both his person and the product of his work. When one purchases an object from an independent craftsman ... one has not bought his labour but the object, which he had produced in his own time and under his own conditions of work. But when one hires labour, one purchases an abstraction, labour-power, which the purchaser then uses at a time and under conditions which he, the purchaser, not the &quot;owner&quot; of the labour-power, determines (and for which he normally pays after he has consumed it). Second, the wage labour system requires the establishment of a method of measuring the labour one has purchased, for purposes of payment, commonly by introducing a second abstraction, namely labour-time.
The wage is the monetary measure corresponding to the standard units of working time (or to a standard amount of accomplished work, defined as a piece rate). The earliest such unit of time, still frequently used, is the day of work. The invention of clocks coincided with the elaborating of subdivisions of time for work, of which the hour became the most common, underlying the concept of an hourly wage.

Wages were paid in the Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and ancient Rome. Following the unification of the city-states in Assyria and Sumer by Sargon of Akkad into a single empire ruled from his home city circa 2334 BC, common Mesopotamian standards for length, area, volume, weight, and time used by artisan guilds were promulgated by Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BC), Sargon&#x27;s grandson, including shekels. &quot;Codex Hammurabi&quot; Law 234 (c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated a 2-shekel prevailing wage for each 60-gur (300-bushel) vessel constructed in an employment contract between a shipbuilder and a ship-owner. Law 275 stipulated a ferry rate of 3-gerah per day on a charterparty between a ship charterer and a shipmaster. Law 276 stipulated a 2-gerah per day freight rate on a contract of affreightment between a charterer and shipmaster, while Law 277 stipulated a -shekel per day freight rate for a 60-gur vessel.

==Determinants of wage rates==

Depending on the structure and traditions of different economies around the world, wage rates will be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), labour organisation, legislation, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan.

===Wage differences===
Even in countries where market forces primarily set wage rates, studies show that there are still differences in remuneration for work based on sex and race. For example, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2007 women of all races made approximately 80% of the median wage of their male counterparts. This is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations. Similarly, white men made about 84% the wage of Asian men, and black men 64%. These are overall averages and are not adjusted for the type, amount, and quality of work done.

==Effects==
===Corruption===
It is known that the wage level of employees in the public sector affects the frequency of corruption, and that higher salary levels for public sector workers help reduce corruption. It has also been shown that countries with smaller wage gaps in the public sector have less corruption.
==Wages in the United States==

Seventy-five million workers earned hourly wages in the United States in 2012, making up 59% of employees. In the United States, wages for most workers are set by market forces, or else by collective bargaining, where a labor union negotiates on the workers&#x27; behalf. The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes a minimum wage at the federal level that all states must abide by, among other provisions. Fourteen states and a number of cities have set their own minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal level. For certain federal or state government contacts, employers must pay the so-called prevailing wage as determined according to the Davis–Bacon Act or its state equivalent. Activists have undertaken to promote the idea of a living wage rate which account for living expenses and other basic necessities, setting the living wage rate much higher than current minimum wage laws require. The minimum wage rate is there to protect the well being of the working class.

In the second quarter of 2022, the total U.S. labor costs grew up 5.2% year over year, the highest growth since the starting point of the serie in 2001.

==Definitions==
For purposes of federal income tax withholding, 26 U.S.C. § 3401(a) defines the term &quot;wages&quot; specifically for chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code:

&quot;For purposes of this chapter, the term “wages” means all remuneration (other than fees paid to a public official) for services performed by an employee for his employer, including the cash value of all remuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium other than cash;&quot; In addition to requiring that the remuneration must be for &quot;services performed by an employee for his employer,&quot; the definition goes on to list 23 exclusions that must also be applied.

<doc id="359650" wikidata="Q244408" url="?curid=359650" title="Diclofenac">
<text>Diclofenac, sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth), inserted rectally as a suppository, injected intramuscularly, injected intravenously, applied to the skin topically, or through eye drops. Improvements in pain last up to eight hours. It is also available as the fixed-dose combination diclofenac/misoprostol (Arthrotec) to help protect the stomach; however, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole are typically first-line since they are at least as effective as misoprostol, but with better tolerability.
Common side effects include abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulceration. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. Diclofenac is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandins, like other drugs in this class.
In 2022, it was the 51st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12million prescriptions. It is available as its acid or in two salts, as either diclofenac sodium or potassium.

==Medical uses==
Diclofenac is used to treat pain related to arthritis, dysmenorrhea, rheumatic diseases and other inflammatory disorders, kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present.

Diclofenac ophthalmic is indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in people who have undergone cataract extraction and for the temporary relief of pain and photophobia in people undergoing corneal refractive surgery.

Diclofenac is also available in topical forms and is useful for osteoarthritis but not other types of long-term musculoskeletal pain. Diclofenac may also help with actinic keratosis and with acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains and contusions.

In many countries, eye drops are sold to treat acute and chronic nonbacterial inflammation of the anterior part of the eyes (such as postoperative states). The eye drops have also been used to manage pain for traumatic corneal abrasion.

Diclofenac is often used to treat chronic pain associated with cancer, especially if inflammation is present.

==Contraindications==
Diclofenac is contraindicated for pregnant women; for people with active stomach and/or duodenal ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding; and for people undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.

==Adverse effects==
Diclofenac consumption has been associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported. Major adverse cardiovascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death is increased significantly by diclofenac.

In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescription label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in fetuses that result in low amniotic fluid.

===Heart===
In 2013, a study found major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 people allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased by diclofenac (1·65).

Following the identification of increased risks of heart attacks with the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib in 2004, attention has focused on all the other members of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug group, including diclofenac. Research results are mixed, with a meta-analysis of papers and reports up to April 2006 suggesting a relative increased rate of heart disease of 1.63 compared to nonusers. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation said, &quot;However, the increased risk is small, and many patients with chronic debilitating pain may well feel that this small risk is worth taking to relieve their symptoms&quot;. Only aspirin was found not to increase the risk of heart disease; however, this is known to have a higher rate of gastric ulceration than diclofenac. As of January 2015, the MHRA announced that diclofenac would be reclassified as a prescription-only medicine (POM) due to the risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

A subsequent large study of 74,838 Danish users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or coxibs found no additional cardiovascular risk from diclofenac use. A very large study of 1,028,437 Danish users of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or coxibs found the &quot;Use of the nonselective NSAID diclofenac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.42; and odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.59, respectively), with a dose-dependent increase in risk.&quot;

Diclofenac is similar in COX-2 selectivity to celecoxib.

===Gastrointestinal===

* Gastrointestinal complaints are most often noted. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (misoprostol, ranitidine, or omeprazole).

===Liver===
* Liver damage occurs infrequently, and is usually reversible. Hepatitis may occur rarely without any warning symptoms and may be fatal. Patients with osteoarthritis more often develop symptomatic liver disease than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. If used for the short-term treatment of pain or fever, diclofenac has not been found more hepatotoxic than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
* , Endo, Novartis, and the US FDA notified healthcare professionals to add new warnings and precautions about the potential for elevation in liver function tests during treatment with all products containing diclofenac sodium.
* Cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.

===Kidney===
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs &quot;are associated with adverse renal [kidney] effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins&quot; in sensitive persons or animal species, and potentially during long-term use in nonsensitive persons if resistance to side effects decreases with age. However, this side effect cannot be avoided merely by using a COX-2 selective inhibitor because, &quot;Both isoforms of COX, COX-1, and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney...

===Mental health===
* Mental health side effects have been reported. These symptoms are rare but exist in significant enough numbers to include as potential side effects. These include depression, anxiety, irritability, nightmares, and psychotic reactions.

==Pharmacology==
As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the primary mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic action is thought to be inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis through COX-inhibition.

The main target in the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis appears to be the transiently expressed prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGES-2), also known as cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). That is, diclofenac is partially selective for COX-2. The reported selectivity for COX-2 varies from 1.5 to 30 depending on the source.

The drug may be bacteriostatic via inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis.

Diclofenac has a relatively high lipid solubility, making it one of the few nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are able to enter the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier. As in the rest of the body, it is thought to exert its effect in the brain through inhibition of COX-2. In addition, it may have effects inside the spinal cord.

Diclofenac may be a unique member of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in other aspects. Some evidence indicates it inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways, thus reducing the formation of leukotrienes (also pro-inflammatory autacoids). It also may inhibit phospholipase A2, which may be relevant to its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency – it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis.

Marked differences exist among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in their selective inhibition of the two subtypes of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, and COX-2. Drug developers have focused on selective COX-2 inhibition, particularly as a way to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In practice, the use of some COX-2 inhibitors with their adverse effects has led to massive numbers of lawsuits alleging wrongful death by heart attack, yet other significantly COX-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, have been well tolerated by most of the population.

Besides the COX-inhibition, several other molecular targets of diclofenac possibly contributing to its pain-relieving actions have recently been identified. These include:
* Blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels (after activation of the channel, diclofenac inhibits its reactivation, also known as phase inhibition)
* Blockage of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs)
* Positive allosteric modulation of KCNQ- and BK-potassium channels (diclofenac opens these channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane)

The duration of action (i.e., duration of pain relief) of a single dose is longer (6 to 8 h) than the drug&#x27;s 1.2–2 h half-life. This could be partly because it persists for over 11 hours in synovial fluids.

==History==
Diclofenac was first synthesized by Alfred Sallmann and Rudolf Pfister in 1973. The name &quot;diclofenac&quot; derives from its chemical name: 2-(2,6-dichloranilino) phenylacetic acid. It was patented in Germany in 1978 by Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis). It came into medical use in the United States in 1988. GlaxoSmithKline purchased the rights in 2015. It is available as a generic medication.

==Society and culture==
===Formulations and brand names===
Diclofenac formulations are available worldwide under many different brand names.

Voltaren and Voltarol contain the sodium salt of diclofenac. In the United Kingdom, Voltarol can be supplied with either the sodium salt or the potassium salt, while Cataflam, sold in some other countries, is the potassium salt only. However, Voltarol Emulgel contains diclofenac diethylammonium 1.16%, being equivalent to 1% sodium salt. In 2016, Voltarol was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £39.3 million.

In the United States, 1% diclofenac gel was approved by the FDA in 2007 as a prescription drug for the temporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis of joints in the hands, knees, and feet. In 2020, the FDA approved the gel formulation for nonprescription use.

In January 2015, diclofenac oral preparations were reclassified as prescription-only medicines in the UK. The topical preparations are available without a prescription.

===Ecological effects===

Use of diclofenac for animals is controversial due to toxicity when eaten by scavenging birds that eat dead animals; the medication has been banned for veterinary use in several countries.

Use of diclofenac in animals has been reported to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be kidney failure; however, toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary diclofenac, and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down diclofenac. At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac. Meloxicam is a safer alternative to replace use of diclofenac. It is more expensive than diclofenac, but the cost is dropping as more pharmaceutical companies are beginning to manufacture it.

Steppe eagles have the same vulnerability to diclofenac as Old World vultures and are therefore at a similar risk from its effects. Diclofenac has been shown also to harm freshwater fish species such as rainbow trout. In contrast, New World vultures, such as the turkey vulture, can tolerate at least 100 times the level of diclofenac that is lethal to &quot;Gyps&quot; species.

&quot;The loss of tens of millions of vultures over the last decade has had major ecological consequences across the Indian subcontinent that pose a potential threat to human health. In many places, populations of feral dogs have increased sharply from the disappearance of &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures as the main scavenger of wild and domestic ungulate carcasses. Associated with the rise in dog numbers is an increased risk of rabies&quot; and casualties of almost 50,000 people. The Government of India cites this as one of the major consequences of a vulture species extinction. A major shift in the transfer of corpse pathogens from vultures to feral dogs and rats could lead to a disease pandemic, causing millions of deaths in a crowded country like India, whereas vultures&#x27; digestive systems safely destroy many species of such pathogens. Vultures are long-lived and slow to breed. They start breeding only at the age of six and only 50% of their young survive. Even if the government ban is fully implemented, it will take many years to revive the vulture population.

The loss of vultures has had a social impact on the Indian Zoroastrian Parsi community, who traditionally use vultures to dispose of human corpses in Towers of Silence, but are now compelled to seek alternative methods of disposal.

Despite the vulture crisis, diclofenac remains available in other countries including many in Europe. It was controversially approved for veterinary use in Spain in 2013 and continues to be available, despite Spain being home to around 90% of the European vulture population and an independent simulation showing that the drug could reduce the population of vultures by 1–8% annually. Spain&#x27;s medicine agency presented simulations suggesting that the number of deaths would be quite small. A paper published in 2021 identified the first authenticated death of a vulture from diclofenac in Spain, a cinereous vulture.

Diclofenac is on the European Union&#x27;s watch list because it pollutes the Baltic Sea. When the substance enters freshwater, it has an environmental impact and is considered more difficult to remove in wastewater treatment plants than, for example, ibuprofen. Harmful residues have been found in blue mussels and fish, among others, where it has been found to cause damage to internal organs such as the gills, kidneys and liver.

==Veterinary use==
Diclofenac is used for livestock; such use was responsible for the Indian vulture crisis, during which in a few years 95% of the country&#x27;s vulture population was killed, and in many countries, agricultural use is now forbidden.

Diclofenac is approved as a veterinary medication in some countries for the treatment of pets as well as in livestock. In some species of birds, diclofenac causes accumulation of uric acid crystals in internal organs—especially the liver and kidneys—resulting in visceral gout, as well as cellular damage and necrosis. In South Asia in the 2000s, vulture populations were decimated after feeding on carcasses of livestock that had been treated with diclofenac.

<text>Pollux is the brightest star in the constellation of Gemini. It has the Bayer designation β Geminorum, which is Latinised to Beta Geminorum and abbreviated Beta Gem or β Gem. This is an orange-hued, evolved red giant located at a distance of 34 light-years, making it the closest red giant (and giant star) to the Sun. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. In 2006 an exoplanet (designated Pollux b or β Geminorum b, later named Thestias) was announced to be orbiting it.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;β Geminorum&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Geminorum&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The traditional name &quot;Pollux&quot; refers to the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek and Roman mythology. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Pollux&quot; for this star.
Castor and Pollux are the two &quot;heavenly twin&quot; stars giving the constellation Gemini (Latin, &#x27;the twins&#x27;) its name. The stars, however, are quite different in detail. Castor is a complex sextuple system of hot, bluish-white type A stars and dim red dwarfs, while Pollux is a single, cooler yellow-orange giant. In Percy Shelley&#x27;s 1818 poem &quot;Homer&#x27;s Hymn to Castor and Pollux&quot;, the star is referred to as &quot;... mild Pollux, void of blame.&quot;

Originally the planet was designated Pollux b. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Thestias for this planet. The winning name was based on that originally submitted by theSkyNet of Australia; namely Leda, Pollux&#x27;s mother. At the request of the IAU, &#x27;Thestias&#x27; (the patronym of Leda, a daughter of Thestius) was substituted. This was because &#x27;Leda&#x27; was already attributed to an asteroid and to one of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites.

In the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium of al Achsasi al Mouakket&quot;, this star was designated &quot;Muekher al Dzira&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Posterior Brachii&quot;, meaning &quot;the end in the paw&quot;.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;North River&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Pollux, ρ Geminorum, and Castor. Consequently, Pollux itself is known as (, .)

== Physical characteristics ==

At an apparent visual magnitude of 1.14, Pollux is the brightest star in its constellation, even brighter than its neighbor Castor (α Geminorum). Pollux is 6.7 degrees north of the ecliptic, presently too far north to be &quot;occulted&quot; by the Moon. The last lunar occultation visible from Earth was on 30 September 116 BCE from high southern latitudes.

Parallax measurements by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite place Pollux at a distance of about from the Sun. This is close to the standard unit for determining a star&#x27;s absolute magnitude (a star&#x27;s apparent magnitude as viewed from 10 parsecs). Hence, Pollux&#x27;s apparent and absolute magnitudes are quite close.

The star is larger than the Sun, with about two times its mass and almost nine times its radius. Once an A-type main-sequence star similar to Sirius, Pollux has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. The effective temperature of this star&#x27;s outer envelope is about , which lies in the range that produces the characteristic orange hue of K-type stars. Pollux has a projected rotational velocity of . The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star&#x27;s metallicity, is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 85% to 155% of the Sun&#x27;s abundance.

An old estimate for Pollux&#x27;s diameter obtained in 1925 by John Stanley Plaskett via interferometry was 13 million miles (20.9 million km, or ), significantly larger than modern estimates. A more recent measurement by the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer give a radius of . Another estimate that uses Pollux&#x27;s spectral lines obtained .

Evidence for a low level of magnetic activity came from the detection of weak X-ray emission using the ROSAT orbiting telescope. The X-ray emission from this star is about 1027 erg s−1, which is roughly the same as the X-ray emission from the Sun. A magnetic field with a strength below 1 gauss has since been confirmed on the surface of Pollux; one of the weakest fields ever detected on a star. The presence of this field suggests that Pollux was once an Ap star with a much stronger magnetic field. The star displays small amplitude radial velocity variations, but is not photometrically variable.

== Planetary system ==
Since 1993 scientists have suspected an exoplanet orbiting Pollux, from measured radial velocity oscillations. The existence of the planet, Pollux b, was confirmed and announced on June 16, 2006. Pollux b is calculated to have a mass at least 2.3 times that of Jupiter. The planet is orbiting Pollux with a period of about 590 days.

The existence of Pollux b has been disputed; the possibility that the observed radial velocity variations are caused by stellar magnetic activity cannot be ruled out.

<doc id="359663" wikidata="Q7879447" url="?curid=359663" title="Ulmus glabra 'Camperdownii'">
<text>The Wych Elm cultivar &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot; &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27;, commonly known as the Camperdown Elm, was discovered about 1835–1840 (often mis-stated as &#x27;1640&#x27;) as a young contorted elm (a sport) growing in the forest at Camperdown House, in Dundee, Scotland, by the Earl of Camperdown&#x27;s head forester, David Taylor. The young tree was lifted and replanted within the gardens of Camperdown House where it remains to this day. The original tree, which grows on its own roots, is less than 3 m tall, with a weeping habit and contorted branch structure. The earl&#x27;s gardener is said to have produced the first of what are commonly recognised as Camperdown elms by grafting a cutting to the trunk of a wych elm (&quot;U. glabra&quot;).

Henry and Bean record that in early days both &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; and a reportedly similar-looking cultivar called &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; were marketed as &quot;U. montana pendula nova&quot;. Koch had listed an &quot;U. serpentina&quot; in 1872, and an &quot;U. montana serpentina&quot; was marketed in the late 19th century and early 20th by the Späth nursery in Berlin, and by the Ulrich nursery in Warsaw. In Späth catalogues between 1902 and 1920, &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; appears while &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; is absent; by 1930 &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; appears but &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; is absent. This suggests that &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; may have been a continental name for &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27;, and that Späth dropped the name &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; c.1930 in favour of &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27;. Elwes and Henry&#x27;s failure to mention the serpentining branches of &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; may have contributed to the impression of two different trees. In this omission they were followed by Bean (1925; corrected 1981), Green (1964), Hillier (1972– 2002), Krüssmann (1976), and White (2003), the first four of whom, like Elwes and Henry, list &#x27;Serpentina&#x27; as a cultivar distinct from &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27;.

Although usually classed as a cultivar of wych elm, the tree was considered a nothomorph of &quot;Ulmus&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot; &#x27;Vegeta&#x27; by Green (1964).

The tree is sometimes confused with the &#x27;Horizontalis&#x27; (Weeping Wych Elm) owing to both being given the epithet &#x27;Pendula&#x27;.

==Description==
The grafted Camperdown Elm slowly develops a broad, flat head that may eventually build as high as 4 m (13 feet), and a commensurately wide crown with a weeping habit. Its chief diagnostic feature is its contorted branching, what Mitchell (1982) called the &quot;head of furiously twisting branches&quot;.

The ultimate size and form of &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; depends on such factors as latitude and location, on what part of the parent tree the cuttings come from, on the &#x27;stock&#x27; on which it is grafted, and on possible continuing mutation. Specimens may therefore vary in appearance. Grown in lower latitudes like Victoria, Australia, the tree can attain a height and spread of over 13 m.
==Pests and diseases==
&#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, however, there are still many examples to be found in parks and gardens across the British Isles as it often avoids detection by the &quot;Scolytae&quot; beetle (a major vector of Dutch elm disease) because of its diminutive height. In North America it often escapes infection possibly because the American vectors of the disease do not feed on wych elm, however, its leaves are heavily damaged there by the elm leaf beetle &quot;Xanthogaleruca luteola&quot;, elm yellows , and disfigured by leaf-mining and leaf-rolling insects, such as the elm casebearer, &quot;Coleophora ulmifoliella&quot; .
==Cultivation==
Every &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27; is descended (through cuttings) from the original sport and usually grafted on a wych elm trunk. Other grafting stock has been used, including Dutch elm &quot;U.&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot;, Siberian elm &quot;U. pumila&quot;, and English elm &quot;U. minor&quot; &#x27;Atinia&#x27; (although this ultimately produces suckers).

Camperdown elms satisfied a mid-Victorian passion for curiosities in the &#x27;Gardenesque&#x27; gardens then in vogue. Many examples were planted, as &#x27;rarities&#x27;, in Britain and America. There are many on university campuses, often planted as memorials, such as at the campus of the University of Idaho. Others featured in townscapes such as at the Lakeview Cemetery, Seattle, and Kripalu Yoga Center, Stockbridge, MA. 

The tree was also introduced to Australia, where a number still survive, notably in Victoria, where it was marketed from 1873.

Camperdown Elm is cold hardy, suffering more from summer drought than winter cold (to zone 4), although 90% of the University of Minnesota elm trials specimens were lost during the exceptionally severe winter of 2002–2003.
==Notable trees==

In Dundee, Scotland, there are two well established Camperdownii Elms at the gated entrance to a private residence on Constitution Terrace in the Crescents Conservation Area. Both trees have grown so they intertwine with each other and create the illusion of one tree in the summer months. The trees are likely to have been cultivated around 1850, the same age as the Victorian mansion situated in the grounds which was built around 1850, therefore are among the oldest in Dundee. These trees are the only known &#x27;twin trees&#x27; of their kind.
In Prospect Park, Brooklyn, a Camperdown Elm planted in 1872 near the Boat House has developed into a picturesque weatherbeaten specimen, no more than four metres high, like an oversized bonsai. Described by the poet Marianne Moore as &quot;our crowning curio,&quot; the Prospect Park tree is considered the outstanding specimen tree in the park. Halifax Public Gardens contains a similar specimen, located next to the Boer War Memorial fountain, which displays the same characteristics as the Prospect Park tree.

The UK TROBI Champion trees are in Scotland, at Baxters Park, Dundee, and at Ayr Cemetery. In France, two grow by the gate at corner of rue de Buzenval and rue de Lagney in the Square Sarah Bernhardt, Paris (20th Arrondissement). NB: Two Corkscrew Willows at the entrance near the corner of rue de Lagny &amp; rue Mounet Sully look the same during winter.

In Gardner, Massachusetts, there is a Camperdown Elm on Parker Street in the front yard of a former store now currently a private residence, towering over the peak of the two-story building with a trunk circumference of over 9 feet. The tree has not been touched for decades and is infested with leaf miners and borers; there is also a significant amount of trunk rot and large missing limbs. As of late June 2010, a local resident, Nate Thibault, has taken action to create a restoration plan for the tree. The tree&#x27;s age is undetermined but believed to have reached its maturity.
&quot;[UPDATE: The new owner of this property has unfortunately failed to recognize the historical significance of this tree and had it completely removed!]&quot;

There is a Camperdown Elm on the Smith College campus which was planted as part of an arboretum by Frederick Law Olmsted at the turn of the 20th century.

The Post University campus in Waterbury, Connecticut, hosts a Camperdown Elm, which once served as the backdrop for the university&#x27;s logo.

In Warrenton, Oregon there is a Camperdown Elm on the property of the DK Warren House. This is actually 2 trees that have intertwined together for a spectacular canopy. www.dkwarrenhouse.com, Circa. 1885

In Port Gamble, Washington there is a Camperdown Elm next to the historic Walker-Ames House. Planted in 1875, this individual measures 20 feet tall, with a 26-foot crown and 7-foot trunk circumference.

In Kingston, Washington there is a Camperdown Elm on an old homestead that is now the community center called The Village Green. It was planted in 1885, it measures 20 feet tall, with a 28-foot crown and 7 foot trunk circumference.

In Alfred, NY the “Umbrella Tree” is a beloved landmark on the Alfred University campus. Frequently it&#x27;s a temporary home to students nestled in its branches or artwork hanging from its limbs. Found in front of the Powell Campus Center it was planted circa 1905. Originally it sat in front of Kenyon Memorial Hall, the first building on this site. It once had a “twin” located just a few yards away that was removed in 1974 due to ill health. A third one was once located next to the School of Theology building (The Gothic), currently the site of Herrick Memorial Library.

In Saint John, New Brunswick, there is a Camperdown Elm on Red Head Road on the front yard of a former farm, currently a private residence. The owner is currently trying to locate the tree&#x27;s history; its age is undetermined.

In Leamington, Ontario, there is a mature Camperdown Elm on Seacliff Drive in the back yard of a garden center.

In Eastport, Maine, there is a Camperdown Elm at the corner of High Street and Shackford Street. The tree is on the corner near the original Anderson home built circa the 1850s. It is 3 feet in diameter at the widest part of its trunk. Eastport is the easternmost city in the United States.

In Spiers Old School Grounds near Beith, Scotland is a fine specimen dating from the late 1880s planted by the Earl of Eglinton&#x27;s head gardener on behalf of the Spier&#x27;s Trust (see photograph).

In Newport, Rhode Island, there is a Camperdown Elm at the Chinese Tea House in the Marble House estate, a historic mansion built by Mr. and Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt between 1888 and 1892, which is open to the public.

In Cazenovia, New York, there is a Camperdown Elm planted in the gardens of The Brewster Inn.

Two large trees are situated outside 315 Eureka Street, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, (2014), planted c.1900. Measured in 2011, one (girth 2.7 m) was 13.7 m tall and 14.3 m broad, the other (girth 2.6 m) 13 m tall and 13 m broad.

The largest recorded specimens are located in New Zealand. The cultivar was popular with early settlers and there are several trees with girth measurements over 2.8 metres listed on the New Zealand Tree Register. The largest tree, situated at 8 Harakeke Street, Christchurch has a girth of 3.5 m, is 9.6 m high and has an average canopy spread of 11.4 m (2016).

<text>&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; is a 1955 song with music by Alex North and lyrics by Hy Zaret. North wrote the music as a theme for the prison film &quot;Unchained&quot; (1955), hence the song title. Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by the Righteous Brothers in 1965. According to the song&#x27;s publishing administrator, over 1,500 recordings of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; have been made by more than 670 artists, in multiple languages.

In 1955, three versions of the song (by Les Baxter, Al Hibbler, and Roy Hamilton) charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 in the United States, and four versions (by Al Hibbler, Les Baxter, Jimmy Young, and Liberace) appeared in the top 20 in the United Kingdom simultaneously, a record for any song. The song continued to chart in the 21st century, and it was the only song to reach number one with four different recordings in the United Kingdom until it was joined by &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in 2014 with the release of Band Aid 30&#x27;s version.

Of the hundreds of recordings made, the Righteous Brothers&#x27; version, with a solo by Bobby Hatfield, became the jukebox standard after its release. Hatfield changed the melody in the final verse and many subsequent covers of the song are based on his version. The Righteous Brothers&#x27; recording achieved a second round of great popularity when it was featured in the film &quot;Ghost&quot; in 1990. In 2004, it was number 27 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

== Origin of song ==
In 1954, Alex North was contracted to compose the score for the prison film &quot;Unchained&quot; (released in 1955). North had a melody he had written in the 1930s and composed and recorded the score when he was asked to write a song based upon the movie&#x27;s theme. North asked Hy Zaret to write the lyrics. After first refusing, Zaret and North together wrote &quot;Unchained Melody.&quot; Zaret refused the producer&#x27;s request to include the word &quot;unchained&quot; in his lyrics. The song eventually became known as the &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; even though the song does not actually include the word &quot;unchained&quot;. Instead, Zaret chose to focus on someone who pines for a lover he has not seen in a &quot;long, lonely time&quot;. The film centered on a man who contemplates either escaping from prison to live life on the run or completing his sentence and returning to his wife and family. The song has an unusual harmonic device as the bridge ends on the tonic chord rather than the more usual dominant chord. &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; is written in the key of C major. 

Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack and performs an abbreviated version in the film. Playing one of the prisoners, he sings it, accompanied by another prisoner on guitar, while other prisoners listen sadly. With Duncan singing the vocals, the song was nominated in 1956 for 1955&#x27;s Oscars, but the Best Song award went to the hit song &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot;.

William Stirrat, an electrical engineer, claimed to have written the lyrics as a teenager in 1936 under the pen name &quot;Hy Zaret&quot; only to have North use the uncredited words in the 1955 original. The case went to court and the dispute was resolved completely in favor of the real Zaret (the one born Hyman Zaritsky) who continued to receive all royalties.

== Early versions ==
Following the movie, there were several charting covers that were released in 1955. Bandleader Les Baxter released a choral version (Capitol Records catalog number 3055) which reached number 1 on the US charts and number 10 in the UK. The words &quot;unchain me&quot; are sung repeatedly at the beginning and the lyrics are sung by a choir. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked this version as the No. 5 song of 1955. Al Hibbler followed close behind with a vocal version (Decca Records catalog number 29441), that reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number 2 in the UK chart listings. Jimmy Young&#x27;s release (on Decca Records UK catalog number F10502) stayed at number 1 on the British charts for 3 weeks and remained on the UK charts for 19 weeks. Young re-recorded the song in early 1964 and it hit number 43 in the UK. Two weeks after Young&#x27;s version entered the top 10 of the British charts in June 1955, Liberace scored a number 20 hit (Philips PB 430). Roy Hamilton&#x27;s version (Epic Records catalog number 9102) reached number 1 on the R&amp;B Best Sellers list and number 6 on the pop chart. June Valli recorded the song on March 15, 1955 (RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-6078) with the flip side &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, and took it to number 29 on the Top Pop Records list. Harry Belafonte recorded the song, and sang his version at the 1956 Academy Awards after it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song of 1955.

While the sheet music business was losing its prominence to sound recordings, a sheet music release of the song peaked at number 1 on its tenth week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Best Selling Sheet Music chart on the week ending June 18, 1955. It stayed at its peak position for nine weeks until it dropped to number 4 on its twentieth week on the week ending August 27.

== The Righteous Brothers versions ==

The best-known version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was recorded by the duo the Righteous Brothers for Philles Records in 1965. The lead vocal was performed solo by Bobby Hatfield, who later recorded other versions of the song credited solely to him. According to his singing partner Bill Medley, they had agreed to do one solo piece each per album. Both wanted to sing &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; for their fourth album, but Hatfield won the coin toss.

=== Recording ===

The song was not originally intended to be released as an A-side. As Spector was not especially interested in producing B-sides or album tracks he left the production to Bill Medley, who had produced the duo before they signed with Spector and Philles. He brought in a similar &#x27;wall of sound&#x27; instrumental track. Medley said: &quot;Phil came to me and asked me to produce the Righteous Brothers albums because he would have taken too long and it would have cost too much money.&quot; By Medley&#x27;s account, Spector only claimed production credit after it supplanted &quot;Hung On You&quot; as the hit. Early copies of the single did not credit a producer for &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and only credited Spector as producer of the original single &quot;Hung On You&quot;. Later pressings of the single credited Spector as the producer, as do album liner notes in the Spector box set &quot;Back to Mono (1958–1969)&quot;.

Hatfield made a change to the song during the recording sessions. The first two takes of the song he performed it in the same style as Roy Hamilton. For a third take, he decided to change the melody for the &quot;I need your love&quot; line in the final verse, and sang it much higher instead. After this recording, Hatfield said he could do another take better, to which Medley replied: &quot;No, you can&#x27;t.&quot; Medley played the Wurlitzer piano on the song; later, he noted that &quot;if I knew that it was gonna be a hit I certainly would have brought in a better piano player.&quot;

===Release===

&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was originally released as the &quot;B&quot; side of the single &quot;Hung On You&quot; as the follow-up single to &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot;. However, &quot;Hung On You&quot; failed to interest radio DJs who instead chose to play the &#x27;B&#x27; side &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. According to Medley, producer Phil Spector, who would deliberately place a throwaway song that was not meant to be played on the B side, was so incensed by DJs choosing to play the B side that he started to call their radio stations to get them to stop playing &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. However, he failed, and the song reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and No. 14 in the UK in 1965.

=== Re-recording and re-release ===
&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; reappeared on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1990 after the Righteous Brothers&#x27; recording was used in the box office blockbuster film &quot;Ghost&quot;. Two versions charted in the US that year – the original and a new recording. According to Medley, he was interested in having the original recording released due to the renewed interest in the song, but was told that there were licensing issues. Although Hatfield&#x27;s voice was no longer as good as when he first recorded the song, they decided to re-record it for Curb Records. The re-recorded version was released as both a cassette single and a CD single. It received minimal airplay but sold well, peaking at number 19. The re-recorded version was certified Platinum by the RIAA on January 10, 1991, and received a Grammy Award nomination.

The 1965 original Righteous Brothers recording was reissued in 1990 by oldies-reissue label Verve Forecast under licensing from Polygram Records (which had acquired the rights years earlier). The original version received a lot of airplay, and topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart for two weeks in 1990. However, sales for this version were minimal in the US since it was available as only a 45 RPM single and the song peaked at No. 13 based largely on airplay. For eight weeks, both versions were on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 simultaneously and the Righteous Brothers became the first act to have two versions of the same song in the Top 20 at the same time. This re-released song reached number 1 in the UK where it stayed for four weeks, becoming the UK&#x27;s top selling single of 1990. As of 2017, it had sold 1.17 million copies in the UK. The 1990 reissue also reached number 1 in Australia, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.

Due to the success of their re-recording, the Righteous Brothers also re-recorded other songs and released them as part of a budget-priced CD compilation by Curb Records. For the original recordings, Polydor had licensed the CD rights to Rhino Records for a premium-priced 1989 compilation of Righteous Brothers hits from various labels; later in 1990, it issued its own regular-priced Righteous Brothers greatest hits CD that included the recording.

=== Reception ===
The Righteous Brothers&#x27; cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; is now widely considered the definitive version of the song. Hatfield&#x27;s vocal in the original recording in particular is highly praised; it has been described as &quot;powerful, full of romantic hunger, yet ethereal,&quot; and a &quot;vocal tour de force&quot;, although his later re-recording was noted as &quot;fudging only a bit on the highest notes&quot;. The production of their original recording has been described as &quot;epic&quot;, and that with &quot;Hatfield&#x27;s emotion-packed tenor soaring to stratospheric heights, it&#x27;s a record designed to reduce anyone separated from the one they loved to a &quot;pile of mush&quot;.

== Elvis Presley version ==
On June 21, 1977, Elvis Presley performed the song at a show in Rapid City, South Dakota. The performance, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;the last great moment of his career&quot;, was recorded for his last television special two months before his death in August 1977. A single, based on this recording, was released in March 1978 by RCA Records with &quot;Softly, As I Leave You&quot; as the b-side. The song reached No. 6 in the country charts of both the US and Canada, and was certified Gold by Music Canada on July 10, 1986.

Another live version recorded earlier on April 24, 1977, at Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was included in his last album &quot;Moody Blue&quot;. Both versions had studio overdubs with additional instruments added before they were released.

== Robson &amp; Jerome version ==

The version by Robson &amp; Jerome is notable as the best-selling single of 1995 in the UK. It also launched the singing career of Robson &amp; Jerome, and became the biggest hit in the UK for Simon Cowell, marking his beginning as a significant figure in the music industry.

In November 1994, in an episode of the UK television drama series &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot;, characters Dave Tucker and Paddy Garvey, portrayed by actors Robson Green and Jerome Flynn respectively, performed &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; as an impromptu duo, The Unrighteous Brothers, after the entertainment failed to appear for a friend&#x27;s wedding. Their performance triggered a strong response from the audience who attempted to find a recording of the song that was then unavailable. Simon Cowell was alerted to the interest shown by the public, and pursued the two reluctant actors for the next four months to record the song, to the extent that Robson Green threatened legal action to stop Cowell harassing them. The actors were eventually persuaded to sign a recording contract with Cowell and record a Righteous Brothers-type version of the song as a duo. The recording was produced by Mike Stock and Matt Aitken. It was later revealed by Stock that the vocals were &quot;assisted&quot; and parts of the song were sung by other session singers. It was released as a double A-sided single with &quot;White Cliffs of Dover&quot;, a popular song during World War II, included in recognition of the 50th anniversary of VE day, the date of the single release. The video released for &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; also incorporated clips from the 1945 film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;.

Their recording immediately reached number 1 in the UK, selling 314,000 copies in its first week, at that time the fastest-selling debut single in UK chart history. It stayed at the top of the chart for seven weeks. It became the best selling single of 1995, and one of the country&#x27;s all-time biggest-selling singles (No. 9 in November 2012), with 1.87 million copies sold. The self-titled album they released later in the year also became the best-selling album of 1995. Although the duo decided to quit the following year, they would eventually sell 7 million copies of albums and 5 million copies of the 3 singles released. Simon Cowell, who before this was known largely as a creator of novelty records with television characters such as the puppets Zig and Zag and action characters Power Rangers, then came to the attention of the media for his ability to create hit records.

== Gareth Gates version ==
English singer-songwriter Gareth Gates first performed &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; as a contestant in the quarter-final of the first series of the UK singing competition television show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, which included Simon Cowell as one of the judges. Gates reprised the song in the final as his personal choice, but the competition was won by Will Young. Gates was signed by Cowell, and as the runner-up, Gates released the song as his first single three weeks after the winner had released his single, the double A-sided &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; / &quot;Evergreen&quot;. Gates&#x27; cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was released together with his versions of the same two songs released by Young, which Gates had also performed in the final.

Gates&#x27; version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; became one of the fastest-selling singles in the UK, selling around 328,000 copies in the first day of release. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in its first week of release with sales of 850,000 copies, and stayed at the top of the chart for four weeks. It became the second best-selling song in the UK in 2002, as well as that of the decade of 2000s, after the single by the winner Will Young. It has sold 1.35 million copies in the UK as of 2017.

== Impact ==
=== Popularity ===
&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was the only song to have reached No. 1 in the UK in four different recordings on the official chart until it was joined by the charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in its fourth re-recording in 2014. It is the only song to have sold over a million by three separate acts in the UK – Robson and Jerome (1.87 million), Gareth Gates (1.35 million), the Righteous Brothers (1.17 million). The song has been number 1 on lists of love songs featured on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 and Five.

The song has been covered by many artists; according to the song&#x27;s publishing administrator, over 1,500 recordings of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; have been made by more than 670 artists in multiple languages. Its popularity also meant that the song is one of the highest grossing songs for its copyright holders, estimated in 2012 to be the fifth biggest earners of royalties according to the BBC&#x27;s list of The Richest Songs in the World at £18 million.

=== Accolades ===
The song was nominated in 1956 for 1955&#x27;s Oscar for best original song from the film &quot;Unchained&quot;. The re-recorded version by the Righteous Brothers was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1991 in the best pop performance by a duo or group category, and their original version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000. The use of the Righteous Brothers&#x27; cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; in the film &quot;Ghost&quot; resurrected the song&#x27;s popularity as it was recognized as the &quot;most played&quot; song of 1992 by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). ASCAP also announced it to be one of the 25 most-performed songs and musical works of the 20th century in 1999, and the most-performed love song of the 1950s in 2003.

In 2001, the song was ranked at No. 138 in the list of Songs of the Century released by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the Righteous Brothers version of the song at number 365 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was placed first in Magic 1278&#x27;s 500 greatest songs of all time. It was also listed in 2004 at No. 27 in the list of the 100 top movie songs of all time in American Film institute&#x27;s centenary AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of songs in American cinema. In 2007, the Songwriters Hall of Fame honored &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; with a Towering Song award that is presented to creators of a song &quot;that has influenced the culture in a unique way over many years.&quot;
