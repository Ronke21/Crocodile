<text>Shane Patrick Lysaght MacGowan (25 December 195730 November 2023) was a British-born Irish singer-songwriter and musician, best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of Celtic punk band the Pogues. He won acclaim for his lyrics, which often focused on the Irish emigrant experience; he also received widespread media attention for his lifestyle, which included decades of heavy alcohol and drug abuse. A &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary noted his &quot;twin reputations as a titanically destructive personality and a master songsmith whose lyrics painted vivid portraits of the underbelly of Irish immigrant life.&quot;

Born in Kent, England, to Irish parents, MacGowan spent his early childhood in Tipperary, Ireland, before moving back to England with his family at age six. After attending Holmewood House preparatory school, he won a literary scholarship to Westminster School but was expelled in his second year for drug offences. At age 17 to 18, he spent six months in psychiatric care at Bethlem Royal Hospital due to his drug and alcohol abuse. He became active on the London punk scene under the alias Shane O&#x27;Hooligan, attending gigs, working in the Rocks Off record shop, and writing a punk fanzine. In 1977, he and his then-girlfriend Shanne Bradley formed the punk band the Nipple Erectors (subsequently the Nips). In 1982, with Spider Stacy and Jem Finer, he co-founded the Pogues—originally called Pogue Mahone, an anglicisation of the Irish phrase , meaning &quot;kiss my arse&quot;—who fused punk influences with traditional Irish music. He was the principal songwriter and lead vocalist on the band&#x27;s first five studio albums, including &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; (1985) and the critically acclaimed and commercially successful &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; (1988). With Finer, he co-wrote the Christmas hit single &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; (1987), which he recorded as a duet with Kirsty MacColl. A perennial Christmas favourite in Ireland and the UK, the song was certified sextuple platinum in the UK in 2023.

During a 1991 tour of Japan, the Pogues dismissed MacGowan due to the impact of his drug and alcohol dependency on their live shows. He formed a new band, Shane MacGowan and The Popes, with which he released two further studio albums, including the singles &quot;The Church of the Holy Spook&quot; (1994) and &quot;That Woman&#x27;s Got Me Drinking&quot; (featuring Johnny Depp, 1994). His solo projects after leaving the Pogues included the singles &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; (a duet with Nick Cave, 1992), &quot;Haunted&quot; (a duet with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, 1995) and &quot;My Way&quot; (1996); he also collaborated with artists including the Jesus and Mary Chain, Dropkick Murphys and Cruachan. In 2001, he rejoined the Pogues for reunion shows and continued to tour with the group until it dissolved in 2014. At a January 2018 gala concert to celebrate MacGowan&#x27;s 60th birthday, the president of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, presented him with a lifetime achievement award for outstanding contributions to Irish life, music and culture. Later that year, he married his long-term partner, journalist and writer Victoria Mary Clarke. Following years of deteriorating health, he died from pneumonia in Dublin in November 2023, aged 65.

==Early life==
MacGowan was born on 25 December 1957 in Pembury, Kent, the son of Irish parents who were visiting relatives in England at the time of his birth. MacGowan spent his early childhood in Tipperary, Ireland. His younger sister, Siobhan MacGowan, was born in 1963; she later became a journalist, writer, and songwriter. MacGowan and his family moved to England when he was aged six and a half. His father, Maurice, from a middle-class background in Dublin, worked in the offices of department store C&amp;A; his mother, Therese, from Tipperary, worked as a typist at a convent, having previously been a singer, traditional Irish dancer, and model.

MacGowan lived in many parts of southeast England such as Brighton, London, and the home counties, and attended an English public school. His father encouraged his precocious interest in literature; by age 11, MacGowan was reading authors including Fyodor Dostoyevsky, John Steinbeck, and James Joyce. At 13, he was among the winners of a literary contest sponsored by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. In 1971, he left Holmewood House preparatory school in Langton Green, Kent, with a literature scholarship for Westminster School. Found in possession of drugs, he was expelled in his second year. At age 17, he spent six months in a psychiatric hospital due to drug addiction; while there, he was also diagnosed with acute situational anxiety. Briefly enrolled at St Martin&#x27;s School of Art, he worked at the Rocks Off record shop in central London, and started a punk fanzine under the pseudonym Shane O&#x27;Hooligan. He was first publicly noted in 1976 at a concert by London punk rock band the Clash, where his earlobe was damaged by future Mo-dettes bassist Jane Crockford. A photographer took a picture of him covered in blood, which was reported in the music paper &quot;NME&quot; with the headline &quot;Cannibalism at Clash Gig&quot;. Shortly after this, he and bassist Shanne Bradley formed the punk band the Nipple Erectors (later known as the Nips).

==Career==
===1982–1991: Leading the Pogues===
MacGowan drew upon his Irish heritage when founding the Pogues and changed his early punk style for a more traditional sound with tutoring from his extended family. Many of his songs were influenced by Irish nationalism, Irish history, the experiences of the Irish diaspora (particularly in England and the United States), and London life in general. These influences were documented in the biography &quot;Rake at the Gates of Hell: Shane MacGowan in Context&quot;. He often cited the 19th-century Irish poet James Clarence Mangan and playwright Brendan Behan as influences.

The Pogues&#x27; most critically acclaimed album was &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; (1988), which also marked the high point of the band&#x27;s commercial success. Between 1985 and 1987, MacGowan co-wrote &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, which he performed with Kirsty MacColl, and remains a perennial Christmas favourite; in 2004, 2005 and 2006, it was voted favourite Christmas song in a poll by music video channel VH1. Other notable songs he performed with the Pogues include &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;, &quot;Sally MacLennane&quot; and &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (featuring the Dubliners). In the following years MacGowan and the Pogues released several albums. In 1988, he co-wrote &quot;Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six&quot;, a song by the Pogues which proved highly controversial due to its support of the Birmingham Six – six men wrongly convicted of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, but still serving prison sentences for the bombings at the time – and was banned on British commercial TV and radio.

In Yokohama, Japan, during a 1991 tour, the Pogues dismissed MacGowan for unprofessional behaviour. The band&#x27;s performances had been affected by MacGowan&#x27;s drug and alcohol problems, and his bandmates parted ways with him following &quot;a string of no-shows, including when the Pogues were opening for Dylan&quot;.

===1992–2005: Shane MacGowan and the Popes===
After MacGowan had been dismissed from the Pogues, he formed a new band, Shane MacGowan and The Popes. The new band recorded two studio albums, a live album, three tracks on the Popes &quot;Outlaw Heaven&quot; (2010) and a live DVD; the band also toured internationally. In 1997, MacGowan appeared on Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, covered by numerous artists in aid of Children in Need. It was the UK&#x27;s number one single for three weeks, in two separate spells. Selling over a million copies, the record contributed £2,125,000 to the charity&#x27;s highest fundraising total in six years. From December 2003 up to May 2005, Shane MacGowan and the Popes toured extensively in the UK, Ireland and Europe.

===2001–2014: Return to the Pogues===

The Pogues and MacGowan reformed for a sell-out tour in 2001 and each year from 2004 to 2009 for further tours, including headline slots at Guilfest in England and the Azkena Rock Festival in the Basque Country. In May 2005, MacGowan rejoined the Pogues permanently. That same year, the Pogues re-released &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; to raise funds for the Justice For Kirsty Campaign and Crisis at Christmas. The single was the best-selling Christmas-themed single of 2005, reaching number 3 in the UK Charts that year.

In 2006, he was seen many times with the Libertines and Babyshambles singer Pete Doherty; on occasions MacGowan joined Babyshambles on stage. Other famous friends included Johnny Depp, who appeared in the video for &quot;That Woman&#x27;s Got Me Drinking&quot;, and Joe Strummer, who referred to MacGowan as &quot;one of the best writers of the century&quot; in an interview featured on the videogram release &quot;Live at the Town and Country Club&quot; from 1988. Strummer occasionally joined MacGowan and the Pogues on stage (and briefly replaced MacGowan as lead vocalist after his sacking from the band). He also worked with Nick Cave and joined him on stage.
About his future with the Pogues, in a 24 December 2015 interview with &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, when the interviewer asked whether the band were still active, MacGowan said: &quot;We&#x27;re not, no&quot;, saying that, since their 2001 reunion happened, &quot;I went back with [the] Pogues and we grew to hate each other all over again&quot;, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t hate the band at all – they&#x27;re friends. I like them a lot. We were friends for years before we joined the band. We just got a bit sick of each other. We&#x27;re friends as long as we don&#x27;t tour together. I&#x27;ve done a hell of a lot of touring. I&#x27;ve had enough of it.&quot;

===2010–2011: The Shane Gang===
In 2010, MacGowan played impromptu shows in Dublin with a new five-piece backing band, the Shane Gang, including In Tua Nua rhythm section Paul Byrne (drums) and Jack Dublin (bass), with manager Joey Cashman on whistle. In November 2010, this line-up went to Lanzarote to record a new album. MacGowan and the Shane Gang performed at the Red Hand Rocks music festival in the Patrician Hall, Carrickmore County Tyrone in June 2011.

===2014–2023: Later career===
MacGowan made a return to the stage on 13 June 2019 at the RDS Arena in Dublin as a guest of Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders.

Following on from the success of Feis Liverpool 2018&#x27;s finale, in which he was joined by artists such as Imelda May, Paddy Moloney, Albert Hammond Jr and many more, MacGowan was announced to appear on 7 July alongside a host of guests for the Feis Liverpool 2019&#x27;s finale. The event was ultimately cancelled due to a lack of ticket sales and funding issues. Feis Liverpool is the UK&#x27;s largest celebration of Irish music and culture.

In 2020, MacGowan reportedly returned to the studio to record several new songs with the Irish indie band Cronin.

===Media and charity work===
MacGowan appeared in an episode of &quot;Fair City&quot;, shown on 28 December 2008. In 2009, he starred in the RTÉ reality show &quot;Victoria and Shane Grow Their Own&quot;, as he and his future wife, Victoria Mary Clarke, endeavoured to grow their food in their own garden.

In 2010, MacGowan offered a piece of unusual art to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) to auction off to support their services to children: a drawing on a living room door. It earned €1,602 for the charity.

==Personal life==

On 26 November 2018, after a decades-long relationship and subsequent 11-year engagement, MacGowan married Irish journalist Victoria Mary Clarke in Copenhagen. They lived in Dublin. MacGowan was a Roman Catholic, calling himself &quot;a free-thinking religious fanatic&quot; who also prayed to the Buddha. As an adolescent, he considered the priesthood.

===Politics===
In 2015, MacGowan stated that he had grown up in an Irish republican family and that he regretted not joining the IRA. In a filmed interview he said, &quot;I was ashamed I didn&#x27;t have the guts to join the IRA, and the Pogues was my way of overcoming that&quot;. The central figure in his 1997 song &quot;Paddy Public Enemy No. 1&quot; is based on ex-INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey. Asked his opinion of McGlinchey, MacGowan said &quot;he was a great man&quot;. He also counted former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams as a friend, according to his most recent biography.

In a 1997 interview with &quot;The Irish World&quot;, MacGowan said that he wished for &quot;the peace process&quot; to succeed, but believed it would &quot;be a long, drawn-out process&quot;. He added that he wished for a quicker resolution that led to &quot;the English&quot; giving up all control of Irish lands, and that Ireland be made into a &quot;socialist republic&quot;.

===Health and addictions===
MacGowan &quot;battled longstanding health issues, compounded by well-documented struggles with substance abuse&quot;. He was &quot;a famously voracious consumer of drugs and prone to physical trauma&quot;.

MacGowan began drinking alcohol at age five, when his family gave him Guinness to help him sleep. His father frequently took him to the local pub while he drank with his friends. He suffered physically from years of binge drinking. MacGowan also used LSD, and he developed a heroin addiction during his tenure with the Pogues. In the 1980s, he &quot;was repeatedly injured in falls and struck by moving vehicles&quot;. While in New Zealand during a 1988 Pogues tour, MacGowan &quot;painted his hotel room, face and chest blue, apparently because &#x27;the Maoris were talking to me&#x27;&quot;. Problems arising from his alcohol and drug abuse led to his firing from the Pogues in 1991, and he experienced stomach ulcers and alcoholic hepatitis in the 1990s. MacGowan often performed onstage and gave interviews while drunk. In 2004, on the BBC TV political magazine programme &quot;This Week&quot;, he gave incoherent and slurred answers to questions from Janet Street-Porter about the public smoking ban in Ireland.

In November 1999, MacGowan was arrested in London after Sinéad O&#x27;Connor found him passed out on his floor, and called emergency services. MacGowan was charged with heroin possession in January 2000. When police formally cautioned MacGowan (a process that &quot;requires the accused to admit their guilt&quot;), MacGowan accepted the caution and the criminal case against him was terminated in March 2000. O&#x27;Connor said she took this action in an attempt to discourage him from using heroin. Although he was furious with O&#x27;Connor at first, MacGowan later expressed gratitude to her and said that the incident helped him kick his heroin habit.

MacGowan experienced years of ill health toward the end of his life. In mid-2015, as he was leaving a Dublin studio, he fell and fractured his pelvis. After that, he used a wheelchair. Later that year, MacGowan said: &quot;It was a fall, and I fell the wrong way. I broke my pelvis, which is the worst thing you can do. I&#x27;m lame in one leg, I can&#x27;t walk around the room without a crutch. I am getting better, but it&#x27;s taking a very long time. It&#x27;s the longest I&#x27;ve ever taken to recover from an injury. And I&#x27;ve had a lot of injuries&quot;. He continued to use a wheelchair until his death in 2023.

In 2016, Clarke told the press that MacGowan was sober &quot;for the first time in years&quot;. She indicated that MacGowan&#x27;s drinking had &quot;not just been a recreational activity&quot;, but that &quot;his whole career has revolved around it and, indeed, been both enhanced and simultaneously inhibited by it&quot;. She said that his drinking problem was made much worse by the introduction of hard drugs such as heroin. Clarke added that a serious bout with pneumonia—compounded by his 2015 hip injury, which required a long hospital stay—was ultimately responsible for his sobriety. The hospital stay required a total detox, and MacGowan&#x27;s sobriety continued after he returned home.

MacGowan was long known for having very bad teeth. He lost the last of his natural teeth around 2008. In 2015, he had a new set of teeth—including one gold tooth—fitted in a nine-hour procedure. The new set of teeth was secured by eight titanium dental implants. The procedure was the subject of the hour-long television programme &quot;Shane MacGowan: A Wreck Reborn&quot;.

In early February 2021, MacGowan broke his knee in a fall at his home and left him bed-ridden for a short time.

MacGowan was hospitalised for an infection on 6 December 2022. He was diagnosed with viral encephalitis. Days after MacGowan had entered hospital, Clarke told the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; that he &quot;seems perfectly normal now – he is pissed off because he can&#x27;t have a drink in the hospital&quot;. Clarke reportedly added that she had urged MacGowan to &quot;ditch his hard-living lifestyle&quot;, but that her efforts had not been met with success.

==Death==
It was reported on 23 July 2023 that MacGowan was hospitalised in an intensive care unit. Following treatment for an infection, he was visited by many celebrities while in hospital. He was discharged from St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital on 23 November 2023 after four months of treatment, but was shortly thereafter re-admitted with another infection. At 3:30 a.m. on 30 November 2023, as he was receiving last rites, MacGowan died from pneumonia with his wife and sister-in-law by his side; he was 65. He left an estate of €849,733, which he willed to his wife.

On 8 December, MacGowan&#x27;s coffin was borne through the streets of Dublin on a horse-drawn carriage as fans lined the streets for his funeral procession. Later, hundreds gathered inside and outside Saint Mary of the Rosary Church in Nenagh, County Tipperary, including celebrities Nick Cave, Johnny Depp, BP Fallon, Bob Geldof, Aidan Gillen, President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins and former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams. There was dancing inside the church as &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was performed by the Pogues with Glen Hansard, Lisa O&#x27;Neill and John Sheahan from the Dubliners.

&quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; went to No. 1 in Ireland on the weekend of MacGowan&#x27;s funeral. On 13 December 2023, the Pogues reissued the song as a charity seven-inch single in tribute to MacGowan and to benefit the Dublin Simon Community, an anti-homelessness organisation that MacGowan had supported.

A pair of posthumous portraits, following MacGowan’s last London visit by artist Dan Llywelyn Hall, were unveiled in London to support the Encephalitis Society.

==Legacy==
Following MacGowan&#x27;s death, Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, said: &quot;Shane will be remembered as one of music&#x27;s greatest lyricists. So many of his songs would be perfectly crafted poems, if that would not have deprived us of the opportunity to hear him sing them. The genius of Shane&#x27;s contribution includes the fact that his songs capture within them, as Shane would put it, the measure of our dreams—of so many worlds, and particularly those of love, of the emigrant experience and of facing the challenges of that experience with authenticity and courage, and of living and seeing the sides of life that so many turn away from.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described MacGowan as &quot;a master songsmith whose lyrics painted vivid portraits of the underbelly of Irish immigrant life.&quot;

Following MacGowan&#x27;s death, Tom Waits wrote on X: &quot;Shane MacGowan&#x27;s torrid and mighty voice is mud and roses punched out with swaggering stagger, ancient longing that is blasted all to hell. A Bard&#x27;s bard, may he cast his spell upon us all forevermore.&quot;

Nick Cave called MacGowan &quot;the greatest songwriter of his generation, with the most terrifyingly beautiful of voices&quot;. Bruce Springsteen said the &quot;passion and deep intensity of [MacGowan&#x27;s] music and lyrics is unmatched by all but the very best in the rock and roll canon... I don&#x27;t know about the rest of us, but they&#x27;ll be singing Shane&#x27;s songs 100 years from now.&quot;

When Bob Dylan performed a concert in Dublin in 2022, he paid tribute to MacGowan while onstage, describing the former Pogues frontman as one of his &quot;favourite artists&quot;.

Paul Simon said MacGowan was &quot;that kind of artist that needed to burn very brightly and intensely. Some artists are like that. They produce work that we treasure but they pay for it with their health – their bodily health and their mental health. That was Shane.&quot;

===Autobiography and biographies===
In 2001, MacGowan coauthored the autobiographical book &quot;A Drink with Shane MacGowan&quot; with his future wife, Victoria Mary Clarke. The book was published by Pan Macmillan.

Aside from &quot;Rake at the Gates of Hell: Shane MacGowan in Context&quot;, which covered a portion of his musical career, MacGowan was the subject of a 2015 biography, &quot;A Furious Devotion: The Life of Shane MacGowan&quot;, published by Omnibus Press. He
was also the subject of several books and paintings. In 2000, Tim Bradford used the title &quot;Is Shane MacGowan Still Alive?&quot; for a humorous book about Ireland and Irish culture.
&quot;Shaman Shane: The Wounded Healer&quot; by Stephan Martin brands Shane as a latter-day London-Irish spirit-raiser and exorcist. This commentary is found in the book &quot;Myth of Return: The Paintings of Brian Whelan and Collected Commentaries&quot;. London Irish artist Brian Whelan has painted MacGowan (for example &quot;Boy from the County Hell&quot;); his works are featured on MacGowan&#x27;s official website, and he is also the illustrator of The Popes&#x27; &quot;Outlaw Heaven&quot; cover.

===Honours and awards===

In 2006, MacGowan was voted 50th in the &quot;NME&quot; Rock Heroes List. In January 2018, MacGowan was honoured with a concert gala to celebrate his 60th birthday at the National Concert Hall in Dublin, where Irish president Michael D. Higgins presented him with a lifetime achievement award for his outstanding contribution to Irish life, music and culture. He also won the 2018 Ivor Novello Inspiration Award.

<text>Dionysius I Telmaharoyo (Latin: &quot;Dionysius Telmaharensis&quot;, Syriac: ܕܝܘܢܢܘܣܝܘܣ ܬܠܡܚܪܝܐ, Arabic: مار ديونيسيوس التلمحري), also known as Dionysius of Tel Mahre, was the Patriarch of Antioch, and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church from 818 until his death in 845.

==Biography==
Dionysius was born in Tal Mahre, near the city of Raqqa, into a wealthy family from Edessa, and became a monk at the Monastery of Qenneshre, where he studied philology, jurisprudence, philosophy, and theology. He also studied at the Monastery of Mar Jacob at Kayshum. In 818, Dionysius was elected Patriarch of Antioch unanimously by a synod of forty-eight bishops. After his consecration, he issued a proclamation and held three councils in Raqqa in the same year, at which he issued twelve canons. Dionysius restored the Monastery of Qenneshre in 822 after it was damaged by fire caused by dissenters.

In 826, Dionysius visited Egypt in the company of the Abbasid general Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani. He later held a council at the Monastery of Euspholis in 828, and returned to Egypt in 832 in the company of Caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun. Whilst in Egypt, Dionysius met with Pope Jacob of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a fellow miaphysite church, and several Coptic Orthodox bishops outside of the city of Tannis. He held another council at the city of Tagrit in 834, and met with Al-Ma&#x27;mun in Baghdad, and also his successor, Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tasim. A total of one hundred bishops were ordained by Dionysius during his tenure and he served as patriarch until his death on 22 August 845.

==Works==
At the request of John, Bishop of Dara, Dionysius composed the &quot;Annals&quot;, a two volume history of the church and secular events from the coronation of the Roman Emperor Maurice in 582 to the death of the Roman Emperor Theophilus in 843. One volume was dedicated to church history whilst the other covered secular history, and each volume was divided into eight books. The work was composed with use of citations of the works of Theophilus of Edessa, an 8th-century scholar. The &quot;Annals&quot; were cited extensively by Michael I, Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch (r. 1166–1199), and the anonymous author of the &quot;Chronicle of 1234&quot;. Dionysius&#x27; accounts were also later used in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of Bar Hebraeus, Maphrian of the East (r. 1266–1286).

The &quot;Chronicle of Zuqnin&quot; was erroneously ascribed to Dionysius by Giuseppe Simone Assemani, but this has since been disregarded.

<text>Władysław Roman Orlicz (May 24, 1903 – August 9, 1990) was a Polish mathematician of Lwów School of Mathematics. His main interests were functional analysis and topology: Orlicz spaces are named after him.

== Education and career ==
Orlicz was the third of Franciszek and Maria Orlicz&#x27;s five children. His youngest brother died in the Polish-Soviet War, the eldest perished in the Stutthof concentration camp. The other brothers also became professors. The family moved several times. Orlicz attended school in Tarnów, Znojmo, and Lwów, where he finished school in 1920 and began studying mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic University. He studied with Hugo Steinhaus, Antoni Łomnicki and Stanisław Ruziewicz, among others. As early as 1923 he took on small tasks at the Faculty of Mathematics. On August 1, 1925 he became a junior assistant at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów (now University of Lviv). He published his first scientific work in 1926 at the age of 23. In 1928 he completed his dissertation on the theory of orthogonal sequences. In 1929 he went to University of Göttingen on a scholarship and returned to Lemberg in 1930 as a senior assistant. In 1934 he presented his habilitation thesis The investigations of orthogonal systems. The following year he became an assistant professor at the Lwów Polytechnic University and received his teaching license at the University of Lwów. In 1937, he became an associate professor at the University of Poznań.

The outbreak of the Second World War surprised him while he was on vacation in Lemberg. Since he could not return to Poznań, he was appointed professor in Lemberg. Officially he worked as a teacher. When it became clear in early 1945 that Lemberg would no longer belong to Poland, Orlicz went back to Poznań. In 1948 he was appointed full professor at the University of Poznań, where he remained until his retirement in 1970. He also worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952.

Orlicz was awarded the Stefan Banach Prize by the Polish Mathematical Society in 1948.

<doc id="362719" wikidata="Q213053" url="?curid=362719" title="Superman (1978 film)">
<text>Superman (also marketed as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film based on DC Comics featuring the eponymous character, played by Christopher Reeve. It is the first of four installments in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series starring Reeve as Superman. The film was directed by Richard Donner based on a screenplay by Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton. The film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Jeff East, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, Jack O&#x27;Halloran, Maria Schell, and Sarah Douglas. It depicts the origin of Superman, including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton, son of Jor-El (Brando), and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane (Kidder) while battling the villainous Lex Luthor (Hackman).

Ilya Salkind had the idea of a Superman film in 1973 and, after a difficult process with DC Comics, the Salkinds bought the rights to the character the following year. Several directors, most notably Guy Hamilton, and screenwriters were associated with the project before Donner was hired to direct. Tom Mankiewicz was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a creative consultant credit. It was decided to film both &quot;Superman&quot; and its sequel &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980) simultaneously, with principal photography beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.

The most expensive film made up to that point, with a budget of $55 million, &quot;Superman&quot; premiered at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 10, 1978, and was released in the United Kingdom on December 14, and in the United States on December 15. The film was a critical and financial success; its worldwide box office earnings of $300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. It received praise for Reeve&#x27;s performance and John Williams&#x27;s musical score, and was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound at the 51st Academy Awards, and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film&#x27;s legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood&#x27;s superhero film franchises. In 2017, &quot;Superman&quot; was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry.

== Plot ==

On the planet Krypton, Jor-El, a member of the Kryptonian high council, sentences criminals General Zod, Non, and Ursa to the Phantom Zone. He warns the council that Krypton will be destroyed by its exploding red supergiant sun, but they dismiss his concerns. Before the planet&#x27;s destruction, Jor-El and his wife Lara send their baby son Kal-El to Earth, where his unique physiology grants him evolving superhuman abilities. Kal-El&#x27;s spaceship touches down near Smallville, Kansas. Found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are astonished when the infant lifts their truck, they adopt him, naming him Clark. As he grows, hiding his powers, Jonathan believes Clark was sent to Earth for a special purpose.

Soon after Jonathan&#x27;s fatal heart attack, a glowing green crystal from his spaceship that is hidden in the barn calls to Clark. This leads him to the Arctic, where a Fortress of Solitude, echoing Krypton&#x27;s architecture, ascends from the ice. Inside, Jor-El&#x27;s hologram reveals Clark&#x27;s heritage and trains him for twelve years. Emerging in a blue-and-red suit bearing the House of El crest, he is cautioned against changing human history.

Clark is hired as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; in Metropolis. He is drawn to Lois Lane. After saving her from a helicopter accident, Clark secretly uses his powers in public acts of heroism, gaining immediate fame as the &quot;caped wonder&quot;. Perry White, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;″s chief, seeks more information on this new hero. In costume, Clark later visits Lois, taking her on a flight, leading her to coin his name, &quot;Superman&quot;.

Criminal mastermind Lex Luthor discovers a joint U.S. Army/U.S. Navy missile test and plots to target the San Andreas Fault with reprogrammed missiles, though one is misdirected by his bumbling assistant, Otis. Suspecting Superman&#x27;s interference, Lex identifies a Kryptonian meteorite, lethal to Superman. With Otis and his girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, Lex retrieves it and traps Superman in his lair, revealing his plan to sink the western U.S., making his desert land prime coastline. He weakens Superman using the meteor, now known as Kryptonite, and informs him of the misdirected missile set for Hackensack, New Jersey.

Concerned for her mother in Hackensack, Teschmacher frees Superman, urging him to first stop the eastbound missile. He sends it to space but misses the westbound missile, which triggers severe earthquakes in California, endangering landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. Superman counteracts the devastation by mending the fault line. As Superman rescues others, Lois is trapped in her car by an aftershock, suffocating before he can save her. Distraught and enraged over his failure to save Lois, Superman disregards Jor-El&#x27;s warning against altering history. Heeding Jonathan&#x27;s belief in his purpose, he flies around Earth, reversing time to prevent Lois&#x27;s death and the missile&#x27;s destruction. After saving the West Coast, he imprisons Luthor and Otis, then soars into the sunrise.

== Cast ==
* Marlon Brando as Jor-El: Superman&#x27;s biological father on Krypton. He has a theory about the planet exploding, yet the Council refuses to listen. He dies as the planet explodes but successfully sends his infant son to Earth as a means to help the child. Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50 million because he felt cheated out of his share of the box office profits. This stopped Brando&#x27;s footage from being used in Richard Lester&#x27;s version of &quot;Superman II&quot;.
* Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor: A scientific genius and businessman who is Superman&#x27;s nemesis. It is he who discovers Superman&#x27;s weakness and hatches a plan that puts millions of people in danger.
* Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent / Superman: Born on Krypton as Kal-El and raised on Earth, he is a being of immense power, strength, flight and invulnerability who, after realizing his destiny to serve mankind, uses his powers to protect and save others. As a means to protect his identity, he works in Metropolis at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; as mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent and changes his clothes into a red-blue red caped suit with an S shield on its chest and is dubbed &quot;Superman&quot; by Lois. Reeve was picked from over 200 actors who auditioned for the role.
** Jeff East as the teenage Clark Kent: As a teenager, he is forced to hide his superhuman abilities, making him unpopular among his classmates and frustrating his efforts to gain the attention of classmate Lana Lang (Diane Sherry). Following the death of his adoptive father, he travels to the Arctic to discover his Kryptonian heritage. East&#x27;s dialogue in the film is redubbed by Christopher Reeve for the final cut.
* Ned Beatty as Otis: Lex Luthor&#x27;s bumbling henchman.
* Jackie Cooper as Perry White: Clark Kent&#x27;s hot-tempered boss at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. He assigns Lois to uncover the news of an unknown businessman purchasing a large amount of property in California. Keenan Wynn was originally cast, but dropped out shortly before filming because of heart disease. Cooper, who originally auditioned for Otis, was subsequently cast.
* Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent: Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive father in Smallville during his youth. He is a farmer who teaches Clark skills that will help him in the future. He later has a fatal heart attack that changes Clark&#x27;s outlook on his duty to others.
* Trevor Howard as the First Elder: Head of the Kryptonian Council, who does not believe Jor-El&#x27;s claim that Krypton is doomed. He warns Jor-El: &quot;Any attempt by you to create a climate of fear and panic amongst the populace must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.&quot;
* Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A reporter at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.
* Jack O&#x27;Halloran as Non: Large and mute, the third of the Kryptonian villains who are sentenced to be isolated in the Phantom Zone.
* Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher: Lex Luthor&#x27;s girlfriend and accomplice. Already cynical of his increasing grandiosity and disturbed by his cruelty, she saves Superman&#x27;s life after learning that Luthor has launched a nuclear missile toward her mother&#x27;s hometown of Hackensack, New Jersey. She shows a romantic interest in Superman, implied by her fixing her hair before she makes her presence known to him, and then by kissing him before she saves his life.
* Maria Schell as Vond-Ah: Like Jor-El, a top Kryptonian scientist; but she too is not swayed by Jor-El&#x27;s theories.
* Terence Stamp as General Zod: Evil leader of the three Kryptonian criminals who swears vengeance against Jor-El when he is sentenced to the Phantom Zone. His appearance was to set him and his accomplices as the main antagonists of &quot;Superman II&quot;.
* Phyllis Thaxter as Martha Kent (née Clark): Clark Kent&#x27;s faithful adoptive mother. A kindly woman who dotes on her adoptive son and is fiercely devoted to her husband, Jonathan. She is her son&#x27;s emotional support after Clark is devastated by Jonathan&#x27;s death. Thaxter was producer Ilya Salkind&#x27;s mother-in-law.
* Susannah York as Lara: Superman&#x27;s biological mother on Krypton. She, after learning of Krypton&#x27;s fate, has apprehensions about sending her infant son to a strange planet alone.
* Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen: A teenage photographer at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Jeff East, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent, originally auditioned for this role but outranked following his portrayal of the teen Clark.
* Sarah Douglas as Ursa: General Zod&#x27;s second in command and consort, sentenced to the Phantom Zone for her unethical scientific experiments. Caroline Munro turned down the opportunity to play Ursa, in favour of Naomi in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me.&quot;
* Harry Andrews as the Second Elder: Council member, who urges Jor-El to be reasonable about plans to save Krypton.

Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill have cameo appearances (they played the parents of young Lois Lane in a deleted scene that was restored in later home media releases). Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in the film serials &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950), and were the first actors to portray the characters onscreen in a live-action format. Neill reprised her role in the 1950s &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series.

Larry Hagman and Rex Reed also make cameos; Hagman plays an army major in charge of a convoy that is transporting one of the missiles, and Reed plays himself as he meets Lois and Clark outside the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; headquarters.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Ilya Salkind had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and their partner Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer&#x27;s choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot; back-to-back, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester (who later directed &quot;Superman II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;), Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Ilya wanted to hire Steven Spielberg to direct, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to &quot;wait until [Spielberg&#x27;s] big fish opens.&quot; &quot;Jaws&quot; was very successful, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but by then Spielberg had already committed to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Guy Hamilton was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his script for &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot; in July 1975. Jax-Ur appeared as one of General Zod&#x27;s henchmen, with Clark Kent written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down Lex Luthor.

In early 1975, Brando signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19 million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green suitcase or a bagel with Brando&#x27;s voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13-part &quot;Roots&quot;-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in twelve days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando&#x27;s and Hackman&#x27;s footage &quot;because they would be committed to other films immediately.&quot; Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts as &quot;very heavy&quot;, and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing &quot;The Late Show&quot;, so David&#x27;s wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, but he says he did little.

Their script was submitted in July 1976, and had a camp tone, including a cameo appearance by Telly Savalas as his &quot;Kojak&quot; character. The scripts for &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot; were now at over 400 pages combined. Pre-production started at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented. &quot;In Italy&quot;, producer Ilya Salkind remembered, &quot;we lost about $2 million [on flying tests].&quot; Marlon Brando found out he could not film in Italy because of a warrant out for his arrest: a sexual-obscenity charge from &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. Production moved to England in late 1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a tax exile. Hamilton left the project as he was also ill.

Mark Robson was strongly considered and was in talks to direct, but after seeing &quot;The Omen&quot;, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning &quot;&quot; when he was hired in January 1977 for $1 million to direct &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;. Donner felt it was best to start from scratch. &quot;They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me.&quot; Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz, &quot;not a word from the Puzo script was used.&quot; &quot;It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t shoot this screenplay because you&#x27;ll be shooting for five years&#x27;&quot;, Donner continued. &quot;That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much.&quot; Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the &#x27;S&#x27; on Superman&#x27;s costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.

==== Casting of Superman ====
It was initially decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner was hired as director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested and met with Donner, but he was more interested casting an &quot;unknown&quot; actor. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4 million, turning down all three roles.

When it was next decided to cast an unknown actor, casting director Lynn Stalmaster first suggested Christopher Reeve, but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny. Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman.

Olympic champion Bruce Jenner auditioned for the title role. Patrick Wayne was cast, but dropped out when his father John Wayne was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

Both Neil Diamond and Arnold Schwarzenegger lobbied hard for the role, but were ignored. James Caan, James Brolin, Lyle Waggoner, Christopher Walken, Nick Nolte, Jon Voight, and Perry King were approached. Nolte wanted to play Superman as a schizophrenic. Kris Kristofferson and Charles Bronson were also considered for the title role. Warren Beatty was offered the role but turned it down.

James Caan said he was offered the part but turned it down. &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t wear that suit.&quot;

&quot;We found guys with fabulous physique who couldn&#x27;t act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like Superman&quot;, creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz remembered. The search became so desperate that producer Ilya Salkind&#x27;s wife&#x27;s dentist was screen tested.

Stalmaster convinced Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve stunned the director and producers. He was told to wear a &quot;muscle suit&quot; to produce the desired muscular physique, but Reeve refused, instead undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from to during pre-production and filming. Reeve earned only $250,000 for both &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for &quot;Superman&quot;. However, Reeve felt, &quot;&quot;Superman&quot; brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face.&quot; Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East&#x27;s lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. &quot;I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind&quot;, East commented. &quot;It was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later.&quot; East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. Technicians applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to increase his resemblance to Reeve.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on March 28, 1977, at Pinewood Studios for the Krypton scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point, which was $55 million. Because &quot;Superman&quot; was being shot simultaneously with &quot;Superman II&quot;, filming lasted nineteen months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months, but problems arose during production. John Barry served as production designer, while Stuart Craig and Norman Reynolds worked as art directors. Derek Meddings and Les Bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors. Stuart Freeborn was the make-up artist, while Barry, David Tomblin, John Glen, David Lane, Robert Lynn and an uncredited Peter Duffell and André de Toth directed second unit scenes. Vic Armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and Reeve&#x27;s stunt double; his wife Wendy Leech was Kidder&#x27;s double. &quot;Superman&quot; was also the final complete film by cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who died during post-production while working on &quot;Tess&quot; for director Roman Polanski. The Fortress of Solitude was constructed at Shepperton Studios and at Pinewood&#x27;s 007 Stage. Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, Warner Bros. decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warner Bros. also supplied $20 million and acquired television rights.

New York City doubled for Metropolis, while the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; Building served as the location for the offices of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, during the time of the New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico; Lake Mead; and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, &quot;Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I&#x27;ll be nine months over?&#x27;&quot; Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. On his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, &quot;At one time if I&#x27;d seen him, I would have killed him.&quot;

Lester was offered producing credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. &quot;Being there all the time meant he [Lester] could take over&quot;, Salkind admitted. &quot;[Donner] couldn&#x27;t make up his mind on stuff.&quot; On Lester, Donner reflected, &quot;He&#x27;d been suing the Salkinds for his money on &quot;Three&quot; and &quot;Four Musketeers&quot;, which he&#x27;d never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they&#x27;d move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, &#x27;Don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I&#x27;m telling you not to, but you&#x27;ll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.&#x27; Lester came in as a &#x27;go-between&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t trust Lester, and I told him. He said, &#x27;Believe me, I&#x27;m only doing it because they&#x27;re paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I&#x27;ll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I&#x27;ll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me.&quot;

It was decided to stop shooting &quot;Superman II&quot; and focus on finishing &quot;Superman&quot;. Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel. The filmmakers took a risk: if &quot;Superman&quot; was a box office bomb, they would not finish &quot;Superman II&quot;. The original climax for &quot;Superman II&quot; had General Zod, Ursa, and Non destroying the planet, with Superman time traveling to fix the damage.

Donner commented, &quot;I decided if &quot;Superman&quot; is a success, they&#x27;re going to do a sequel. If it ain&#x27;t a success, a cliffhanger ain&#x27;t gonna bring them to see &quot;Superman II&quot;.&quot;

=== Effects ===

&quot;Superman&quot; contains large-scale visual effects sequences. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood long and high. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. The car crashes on the Golden Gate Bridge were a mixture of models and stunt drivers on a disused runway. Young Clark Kent&#x27;s long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.

As detailed in the &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; DVD special effects documentary &quot;The Magic Behind The Cape&quot;, presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field, in the end, three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects.

For landings and take-offs, wire flying-riggings were devised and used. On location, these were suspended from tower cranes, whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard, for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did much of the work himself, and was suspended as high as in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn&#x27;t necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).

For stationary shots where Superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve&#x27;s isolated image would be inserted into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.

Where the shot is tracking with Superman as he flies (such as in the Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.

A technique was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also led to the creation of the Zoptic system.

The highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians are made of the same 3M material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. &quot;We noticed the material lit up on its own&quot;, Donner explained. &quot;We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera.&quot;

The Clio Award-winning opening titles were made with traditional optical animation using an innovative technique that combined a motion control camera with slit-scan photography. The titles were designed by Richard Greenberg of R/Greenberg Associates (R/GA)

=== Music ===
Jerry Goldsmith, who scored Donner&#x27;s &quot;The Omen&quot;, was originally set to compose &quot;Superman&quot;. Portions of Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s work from &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; were used in &quot;Superman&quot;&#x27;s teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts, and John Williams was hired. Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the soundtrack. The music was one of the last pieces to come into place. Williams&#x27; &quot;Theme from Superman (Main Title)&quot; was released as a single, reaching number 81 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 69 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart. Williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously, and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it.

Kidder was supposed to sing &quot;Can You Read My Mind?&quot;, the lyrics to which were written by Leslie Bricusse, but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover. Maureen McGovern eventually recorded the single, &quot;Can You Read My Mind?&quot; in 1979, although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack. It became a mid-chart hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that year (number 52), spending three weeks at number five on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding Canadian charts. It was also a very minor hit on the U.S. Country chart, reaching number 93. Both Williams&#x27; and McGovern&#x27;s singles contained theme music from the score. The score earned John Williams an Academy Award nomination, but he lost to Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s score for &quot;Midnight Express&quot;.

The soundtrack was originally released as a 2-LP set in December 1978, and the same recording was issued on CD for the first time in 1987 (with the tracks &quot;Growing Up&quot; and &quot;Lex Luthor&#x27;s Lair&quot; omitted to fit the recording onto one disc).

A re-recording of the score, conducted by John Debney and performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, was released by Varese Sarabande records in 1998. In 2000, an expanded edition of the original score was released on a 2-CD set by Rhino Records.

In February 2008, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released an 8-CD boxed set titled &quot;Superman: The Music&quot;, including a newly restored complete score on the first two discs, as well as alternates and source cues on disc 8. As part of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary in February 2019, La-La Land Records released the fully expanded restoration of Williams&#x27; score on a 3-disc set, including the previously issued alternates and source music.

== Themes ==

&quot;Superman&quot; is divided into three basic sections, each having a distinct theme and visual style. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of science fiction films and lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a Norman Rockwell painting. The third (and largest) segment, set mostly in Metropolis, is an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called &quot;verisimilitude&quot;), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach.

In each of the three acts, the mythic status of Superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero&#x27;s journey (or monomyth) as described by Joseph Campbell. Each act has a discernible cycle of &quot;call&quot; and journey. The journey is from Krypton to Earth in the first act, from Smallville to the Fortress of Solitude in the second act, and then from Metropolis to the whole world in the third act.

Many have noted the examples of apparent Christian symbolism. Donner, Tom Mankiewicz and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of Christian references to discuss the themes of &quot;Superman&quot;. Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El (God) and Kal-El (Jesus). Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz&#x27;s actions, joking &quot;I got enough death threats because of that.&quot;

Several concepts and items of imagery have been used in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, &quot;All these years how we&#x27;ve prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child&quot;, which was compared to the Virgin Mary.

Mirroring Biblical accounts of Jesus, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, &quot;Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.&quot; The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, featuring the fall, resurrection and his battle with evil. Another vision was that of &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot;.

The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi Simcha Weinstein&#x27;s book &quot;Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero&quot;, says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a &quot;nebbish&quot;, saying &quot;He&#x27;s a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He&#x27;s Woody Allen.&quot; Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent&#x27;s persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant&#x27;s character in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. This same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in &quot;Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero&quot; by Danny Fingeroth.

In the scene where Lois Lane interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, &quot;I never lie.&quot; Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his secret identity as Clark Kent, is &quot;telling the biggest lie of all time&quot;. His romance with Lois also leads him to contradict Jor-El&#x27;s orders to avoid altering human history, time traveling to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.

== Release ==

&quot;Superman&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in June 1978, the 40th anniversary of &quot;Action Comics 1&quot;, which first introduced Superman, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months. Editor Stuart Baird reflected, &quot;Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months.&quot; Donner, for his part, wished that he had &quot;had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you&#x27;ve gotta turn the picture over.&quot;

Warner Bros. Pictures spent $6–7 million on marketing the film. &quot;Superman&quot; premiered at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., on December 10, 1978, with director Richard Donner and several cast members in attendance. Three days later, on December 13, it had a European Royal Charity Premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew in attendance.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
It set a new all-time U.S. industry record for business during a pre-Christmas week with $12 million, and set new records for Warner Bros. for their best opening day ($2.8 million) and three-day weekend ($7.5 million). For the week of December 22–28, it set an all-time U.S. weekly record of $18.5 million. It also set a record single day gross for Warner Bros. with a gross of $3.8 million. In its third weekend it grossed $13.1 million for the four-day holiday weekend setting a record 18-day gross of $43.7 million.

Approximately 120 million people saw Superman in the opening theatrical run in 1978. Including re-releases, it went on to gross $134.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $166 million internationally, totaling $300.5 million worldwide. &quot;Superman&quot; was the second highest-grossing film of 1978 in North America. It was also Warner Bros.&#x27;s most successful film at the time.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Superman&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Rotten Tomatoes, of critics gave &quot;Superman&quot; a positive review, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Superman&quot; deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The film was widely regarded as one of the top ten films of 1978. &quot;Superman&quot; creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, in tears, thanked Donner and gave a positive reaction. Shuster was &quot;delighted to see Superman on the screen. I got chills. Chris Reeve has just the right touch of humor. He really is Superman.&quot; Siegel beamed, &quot;It&#x27;s exactly as I imagined it.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars. Although describing the Krypton scenes as &quot;ponderous&quot; (&quot;Brando was allegedly paid $3 million for his role, or, judging by his dialogue, $500,000 a cliché&quot;), Ebert wrote that &quot;&quot;Superman&quot; is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and – you know what else? Wit&quot;. He praised Reeve, stating that he &quot;sells the role; wrong casting here would have sunk everything&quot;, and concluded that the film &quot;works so well because of its wit and its special effects&quot;. Ebert placed the film on his ten best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a delightful mess. Good performances. Sloppy editing. Cheap nonflying special effects. Funny dialog. In sum, &quot;Superman&quot; is the kind of picture critics tear apart, but still say, &#x27;You ought to see it.

James Harwood of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy&quot;, and he further added: &quot;As both the wholesome man of steel and his bumbling secret identity Clark Kent, Reeve is excellent. As newswoman Lois Lane, Kidder plays perfectly off both of his personalities and her initial double-entendre interview with Superman is wickedly coy, dancing round the obvious question any red-blooded girl might ask herself about such a magnificent prospect.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a mixed review, &quot;The Superman comic strip has been carefully, elaborately, sometimes wittily blown up for the big-theater screen, which, though busy, often seems sort of empty.&quot; He did however praise the performance of Kidder, calling her &quot;most charming&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a big letdown&quot;, praising Reeve as &quot;the salvaging strength of the film&quot; but referring to the matter of the villain as &quot;an essential problem&quot;, finding that &quot;even in a succession of wigs, Gene Hackman is not preposterous, funny or dementedly menacing, and what he&#x27;s doing here is not evident.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in a positive review, &quot;Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras—Christopher Reeve, a young actor at once handsome and astute enough to rationalize the preposterous fancy of a comic-book superhero in the flesh.&quot; He felt that Kidder was &quot;a good actress and a phenomenal screamer, but she looks a little exhausted.&quot;

Writing in a retrospective review, James Berardinelli believed &quot;there&#x27;s no doubt that it&#x27;s a flawed movie, but it&#x27;s one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It&#x27;s exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of &quot;Superman II&quot;.&quot; Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo&#x27;s original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as &quot;simply puffed-up TV episodes.&quot; After Kidder&#x27;s death in 2018, Sonia Saraiya of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; retrospectively praised her ability to balance Lois&#x27;s ditzy nature with her ambition and no-nonsense attitude, calling her a worthy foil to Reeve and writing that &quot;Kidder played a human woman who could believably both attract and deserve a man who is canonically perfect, with the physique of a Greek god and the moral compass of a saint.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Superman&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Film Editing (Stuart Baird), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Sound (Gordon K. McCallum, Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier and Roy Charman) and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects. Donner publicly expressed disgust that production designer John Barry and cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth had not been recognized by the Academy.

&quot;Superman&quot; was also successful at the 32nd British Academy Film Awards. Reeve won Best Newcomer, while Hackman, Unsworth, Barry, and the sound designers earned nominations. The film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. At the Saturn Awards, Kidder, Barry, John Williams, and the visual effects department received awards, and the film won Best Science Fiction Film. Reeve, Hackman, Donner, Valerie Perrine, and costume designer Yvonne Blake were nominated for their work as well. In addition, Williams was nominated at the 36th Golden Globe Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.

== Television and home media ==
=== The extended TV version ===
While, by contract, Richard Donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters. This was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the ABC television network prior to the film&#x27;s release. Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in). During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind found themselves in the position of having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help, which is why Warner Bros. had theatrical and home video distribution rights. By 1981, when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers had already prepared a 3-hour-and-8-minute version that actually had been the first version of the film visually locked down prior to being re-edited for theatrical release. This extended cut, which would be used for worldwide television distribution, reincorporated some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut. Networks and stations could then re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the &quot;Salkind International Television Cut&quot;.

ABC aired the broadcast television debut of &quot;Superman&quot; over two nights in February 1982, with a majority of the unused footage. The 182-minute network cut (which was slightly cut down for content) was repeated in November of that same year, this time in its entirety in one evening. ABC presented the original theatrical version of the film for the two remaining broadcasts.

When the TV rights reverted to Warner Bros. in 1985, CBS aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable) TV stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut. The stations that showed the extended cut edited the second half to add more advertising time and &quot;previously on...&quot; cutback scenes just as ABC had done in 1982.

In 1994 (following a pay-cable reissue and its obligatory run on USA Network), Warner Bros. Television syndicated the full 188-minute international television version, most famously on Los Angeles station KCOP. The most notable additions unseen on U.S. television were two additional scenes never seen before, in addition to what had been previously reinstated. This version also surfaced outside of Los Angeles. For example, WJLA Channel 7, an ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., aired the extended cut in July 1994. Because its first known airing was on the aforementioned KCOP, it is also known in fan circles as the &quot;KCOP Version&quot;.

There were various extended TV versions each broadcast in various countries. Most of these are in pan and scan, as they were made in the 1980s, when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old TVs.

Until 2017, it was thought the quality of the extended network TV version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in 16mm (using the &quot;film chain system&quot;) and a mono sound mix done, as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981, stereo was not available in television broadcasts (16 mm television prints were, in fact, made and mastered on NTSC Standard Definition video for the initial ABC network broadcasts). However, during an inventory of the Warner Bros. library, an IP master of the full 188-minute television version was discovered. This eighteen-reel master was not marked with an aspect ratio, but the print was inspected and, as it turned out, was in the proper 2.35:1 Panavision ratio. This was the source of the Warner Archive Collection Blu-Ray release of what would officially be called the &quot;Superman: The Movie Extended Cut&quot;, issued on October 3, 2017. The video release was visually restored by WB&#x27;s imaging department, and, other than the opening and end credits (which are in true stereo), the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono TV sound mix. This particular release also includes another version discussed below.

Richard Donner was critical of this extended cut of the film. He called this version of the film &quot;terrible,&quot; saying it &quot;was nothing more than an assembly.&quot; He said he cut the bad material out of the movie and that the producers and Warner Bros. added it back in just &quot;to make a buck.&quot;

=== Other editions ===
When Michael Thau and Warner Home Video started working on a film restoration in 2000, only eight minutes of the added footage that had been used in the TV cut could be considered restored into a version that director Richard Donner called his preferred version of the film. Thau determined that some of the extra footage could not be added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt &quot;the pace of the film&#x27;s storyline would be adversely affected [and there were] timing problems matching [footage] with John Williams&#x27; musical score, etc… The cut of the movie shown on KCOP was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV as the Television Station paid per minute to air the movie. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making.&quot; There was a special test screening of the Special Edition in 2001 in San Antonio, Texas, on March 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year, which did not occur. In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD. Director Donner also assisted, working slightly over a year on the project. The release included making-of documentaries directed by Thau and eight minutes of restored footage.

Thau explained, &quot;I worked on &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; and that&#x27;s how I really met Dick [Donner] and Tom Mankiewicz. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about &quot;Superman&quot; and that&#x27;s how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of &#x27;Taking Flight&#x27; and &#x27;Making Superman&#x27;&quot;. Donner commented, &quot;There are a few shots where Chris [Reeve]&#x27;s costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color back to where it should be.&quot; Thau wanted to make the film shorter: &quot;I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem (&quot;Can You Read My Mind&quot;) when they&#x27;re flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action... It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn&#x27;t want to take [that] out [or] the poem.&quot; It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing &quot;bare bones&quot; editions of &quot;Superman II&quot;, &quot;Superman III&quot;, and &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot;. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc &quot;Christopher Reeve Superman Collection&quot; and the 14-disc &quot;Superman Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

On November 6, 2018 (following year-long worldwide revival theatrical screenings to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film&#x27;s original release), Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released an Ultra HD Blu-ray of &quot;Superman&quot; presented in a new Dolby Vision transfer of the original theatrical version straight from the original camera negative, with its original 70mm/six-track stereo mix rendered in 5.1 surround, in addition to the 2000 remix in Dolby Atmos. This new release also includes a standard Blu-ray Disc of the theatrical cut, plus select bonus features carried over from previous video releases.

== Legacy ==
In 2007, the Visual Effects Society listed &quot;Superman&quot; as the 44th-most influential use of visual effects of all time. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named it the 174th-greatest film of all time on its list of 500. In 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Superman 3rd on their list of &quot;The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture&quot;.

With the film&#x27;s success, it was immediately decided to finish &quot;Superman II&quot;. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler did not ask Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film&#x27;s publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, &quot;I&#x27;d work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that&#x27;s fine. If they don&#x27;t want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain&#x27;t gonna be me.&quot; Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers&#x27; decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. Kidder said that as a result, she was only given a cameo appearance for &quot;Superman III&quot;, and not a main supporting role. Jack O&#x27;Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, &quot;It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds.&quot; Two more films, &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983) and &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), were produced. Donner&#x27;s vision for &quot;Superman II&quot; was eventually realized nearly three decades later, when he supervised the editing of &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, which was released in 2006. In the same year, Donner and writer Geoff Johns wrote &quot;Last Son&quot;, a comic book story arc in Action Comics featuring Superman. Unused footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, discovered during the restoration of &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, was used in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006).

Because &quot;Superman&quot; went into production prior to the releases of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (May 1977) and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (November 1977), some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films
in the 1980s. This is certainly the view of &quot;Superman&quot; producer Ilya Salkind and some who have interviewed him, as well as of film production assistant Brad Lohan. Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see &quot;Superman&quot; as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two. Ilya Salkind denies any connection between &quot;Superman&quot;—which began filming in March 1977—and the other films, stating that &quot;I did not know about &#x27;&quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27;; &#x27;&quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; did not know about &#x27;&quot;Superman&quot;&#x27;; &#x27;&quot;Close Encounters&quot;&#x27; did not know about &quot;&#x27;Superman&quot;.&#x27; It really was completely independent—nobody knew anything about anybody.&quot; &quot;Superman&quot; also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director Christopher Nolan cited Richard Donner&#x27;s vision and scope of &quot;Superman&quot; when pitching the concept for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; to Warner Bros. in 2002. The film&#x27;s influence can also be seen in films of the genre including the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), and Patty Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017).

In 2021, DC Comics revived the continuity of the 1978 film with their &quot;Superman &#x27;78&quot; comic book series, emulating the look of the Christopher Reeve films. The series picks up where the first two films left off, thereby acting as a direct sequel.

After the first screening of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023) to the attendees of the Cinemacon 2023, director Andy Muschietti and producer Barbara Muschietti revealed that a cameo appearance of Brando&#x27;s Jor-El from &quot;Superman&quot; was considered for the film, but was left in the &quot;cutting floor room&quot; due to not fitting in the story.

The film inspired The Kinks&#x27; 1979 song &quot;(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman&quot;, when the band&#x27;s main songwriter, Ray Davies, watched the film in late 1978.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Superman (Clark Kent) – #26 Hero

In December 2017, the film was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry, for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>The heat death of the universe (also known as the Big Chill or Big Freeze) is a hypothesis on the ultimate fate of the universe, which suggests the universe will evolve to a state of no thermodynamic free energy, and will therefore be unable to sustain processes that increase entropy. Heat death does not imply any particular absolute temperature; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform work. In the language of physics, this is when the universe reaches thermodynamic equilibrium.

If the curvature of the universe is hyperbolic or flat, or if dark energy is a positive cosmological constant, the universe will continue expanding forever, and a heat death is expected to occur, with the universe cooling to approach equilibrium at a very low temperature after a long time period.

The hypothesis of heat death stems from the ideas of Lord Kelvin who, in the 1850s, took the theory of heat as mechanical energy loss in nature (as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale. This also allowed Kelvin to formulate the heat death paradox, which disproves an infinitely old universe.

==Origins of the idea==
The idea of heat death stems from the second law of thermodynamics, of which one version states that entropy tends to increase in an isolated system. From this, the hypothesis implies that if the universe lasts for a sufficient time, it will asymptotically approach a state where all energy is evenly distributed. In other words, according to this hypothesis, there is a tendency in nature towards the dissipation (energy transformation) of mechanical energy (motion) into thermal energy; hence, by extrapolation, there exists the view that, in time, the mechanical movement of the universe will run down as work is converted to heat because of the second law.

The conjecture that all bodies in the universe cool off, eventually becoming too cold to support life, seems to have been first put forward by the French astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly in 1777 in his writings on the history of astronomy and in the ensuing correspondence with Voltaire. In Bailly&#x27;s view, all planets have an internal heat and are now at some particular stage of cooling. Jupiter, for instance, is still too hot for life to arise there for thousands of years, while the Moon is already too cold. The final state, in this view, is described as one of &quot;equilibrium&quot; in which all motion ceases.

The idea of heat death as a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics, however, was first proposed in loose terms beginning in 1851 by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson), who theorized further on the mechanical energy loss views of Sadi Carnot (1824), James Joule (1843) and Rudolf Clausius (1850). Thomson&#x27;s views were then elaborated over the next decade by Hermann von Helmholtz and William Rankine.

===History===
The idea of the heat death of the universe derives from discussion of the application of the first two laws of thermodynamics to universal processes. Specifically, in 1851, Lord Kelvin outlined the view, as based on recent experiments on the dynamical theory of heat: &quot;heat is not a substance, but a dynamical form of mechanical effect, we perceive that there must be an equivalence between mechanical work and heat, as between cause and effect.&quot;
In 1852, Thomson published &quot;On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy&quot;, in which he outlined the rudiments of the second law of thermodynamics summarized by the view that mechanical motion and the energy used to create that motion will naturally tend to dissipate or run down. The ideas in this paper, in relation to their application to the age of the Sun and the dynamics of the universal operation, attracted the likes of William Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz. The three of them were said to have exchanged ideas on this subject. In 1862, Thomson published &quot;On the age of the Sun&#x27;s heat&quot;, an article in which he reiterated his fundamental beliefs in the indestructibility of energy (the first law) and the universal dissipation of energy (the second law), leading to diffusion of heat, cessation of useful motion (work), and exhaustion of potential energy, &quot;lost irrecoverably&quot; through the material universe, while clarifying his view of the consequences for the universe as a whole. Thomson wrote:
The clock&#x27;s example shows how Kelvin was unsure whether the universe would eventually achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. Thompson later speculated that restoring the dissipated energy in &quot;vis viva&quot; and then usable work – and therefore revert the clock&#x27;s direction, resulting in a &quot;rejuvenating universe&quot; – would require &quot;a creative act or an act possessing similar power&quot;. Starting from this publication, Kelvin also introduced the heat death paradox (Kelvin&#x27;s paradox), which challenged the classical concept of an infinitely old universe, since the universe has not achieved its thermodynamic equilibrium, thus further work and entropy production are still possible. The existence of stars and temperature differences can be considered an empirical proof that the universe is not infinitely old.

In the years to follow both Thomson&#x27;s 1852 and the 1862 papers, Helmholtz and Rankine both credited Thomson with the idea, along with his paradox, but read further into his papers by publishing views stating that Thomson argued that the universe will end in a &quot;heat death&quot; (Helmholtz), which will be the &quot;end of all physical phenomena&quot; (Rankine).

==Current status==
Proposals about the final state of the universe depend on the assumptions made about its ultimate fate, and these assumptions have varied considerably over the late 20th century and early 21st century. In a hypothesized &quot;open&quot; or &quot;flat&quot; universe that continues expanding indefinitely, either a heat death or a Big Rip is expected to eventually occur. If the cosmological constant is zero, the universe will approach absolute zero temperature over a &quot;very&quot; long timescale. However, if the cosmological constant is positive, the temperature will asymptote to a non-zero positive value, and the universe will approach a state of maximum entropy in which no further work is possible.

== Time frame for heat death ==
The theory suggests that from the &quot;Big Bang&quot; through the present day, matter and dark matter in the universe are thought to have been concentrated in stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters, and are presumed to continue to do so well into the future. Therefore, the universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and objects can do physical work.:§VID The decay time for a supermassive black hole of roughly 1 galaxy mass (1011 solar masses) because of Hawking radiation is in the order of 10100 years, so entropy can be produced until at least that time. Some large black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps 1014 during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10106 years. After that time, the universe enters the so-called Dark Era and is expected to consist chiefly of a dilute gas of photons and leptons.:§VIA With only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe will have tailed off dramatically, with extremely low energy levels and extremely long timescales. Speculatively, it is possible that the universe may enter a second inflationary epoch, or assuming that the current vacuum state is a false vacuum, the vacuum may decay into a lower-energy state.:§VE It is also possible that entropy production will cease and the universe will reach heat death.:§VID

It is suggested that, over vast periods of time, a spontaneous entropy &quot;decrease&quot; would eventually occur via the Poincaré recurrence theorem, thermal fluctuations, and fluctuation theorem. Through this, another universe could possibly be created by random quantum fluctuations or quantum tunnelling in roughly formula_1 years.

==Opposing views==
Max Planck wrote that the phrase &quot;entropy of the universe&quot; has no meaning because it admits of no accurate definition. In 2008, Walter Grandy wrote: &quot;It is rather presumptuous to speak of the entropy of a universe about which we still understand so little, and we wonder how one might define thermodynamic entropy for a universe and its major constituents that have never been in equilibrium in their entire existence.&quot; According to László Tisza, &quot;If an isolated system is not in equilibrium, we cannot associate an entropy with it.&quot; Hans Adolf Buchdahl writes of &quot;the entirely unjustifiable assumption that the universe can be treated as a closed thermodynamic system&quot;. According to Giovanni Gallavotti, &quot;there is no universally accepted notion of entropy for systems out of equilibrium, even when in a stationary state&quot;. Discussing the question of entropy for non-equilibrium states in general, Elliott H. Lieb and Jakob Yngvason express their opinion as follows: &quot;Despite the fact that most physicists believe in such a nonequilibrium entropy, it has so far proved impossible to define it in a clearly satisfactory way.&quot; In Peter Landsberg&#x27;s opinion: &quot;The &quot;third&quot; misconception is that thermodynamics, and in particular, the concept of entropy, can without further enquiry be applied to the whole universe. ... These questions have a certain fascination, but the answers are speculations.&quot;

A 2010 analysis of entropy states, &quot;The entropy of a general gravitational field is still not known&quot;, and &quot;gravitational entropy is difficult to quantify&quot;. The analysis considers several possible assumptions that would be needed for estimates and suggests that the observable universe has more entropy than previously thought. This is because the analysis concludes that supermassive black holes are the largest contributor. Lee Smolin goes further: &quot;It has long been known that gravity is important for keeping the universe out of thermal equilibrium. Gravitationally bound systems have negative specific heat—that is, the velocities of their components increase when energy is removed. ... Such a system does not evolve toward a homogeneous equilibrium state. Instead it becomes increasingly structured and heterogeneous as it fragments into subsystems.&quot; This point of view is also supported by the fact of a recent experimental discovery of a stable non-equilibrium steady state in a relatively simple closed system. It should be expected that an isolated system fragmented into subsystems does not necessarily come to thermodynamic equilibrium and remain in non-equilibrium steady state. Entropy will be transmitted from one subsystem to another, but its production will be zero, which does not contradict the second law of thermodynamics.

==In popular culture==

In Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1956 short story &quot;The Last Question&quot;, humans repeatedly wonder how the heat death of the universe can be avoided.

In the 1981 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Logopolis&quot;, the Doctor realizes that the Logopolitans have created vents in the universe to expel heat build-up into other universes—&quot;Charged Vacuum Emboitments&quot; or &quot;CVE&quot;—to delay the demise of the universe. The Doctor unwittingly travelled through such a vent in &quot;Full Circle&quot;.

In the 1995 computer game &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot;, based on Harlan Ellison&#x27;s short story of the same name, it is stated that AM, the malevolent supercomputer, will survive the heat death of the universe and continue torturing its immortal victims to eternity.

In the 2011 anime series &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, the antagonist Kyubey reveals he is a member of an alien race who has been creating magical girls for millennia in order to harvest their energy to combat entropy and stave off the heat death of the universe.

In the last act of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&quot;, the player encounters an alien race known as the Ea who have lost all hope in the future and any desire to live further, all because they have learned of the eventual heat death of the universe and see everything else as pointless due to its probable inevitability.

The overarching plot of the &quot;Xeelee Sequence&quot; concerns the Photino Birds&#x27; efforts to accelerate the heat death of the universe by accelerating the rate at which stars become white dwarves.

The 2019 hit indie video game &quot;Outer Wilds&quot; has several themes grappling with the idea of the heat death of the universe, and the theory that the universe is a cycle of big bangs once the previous one has experienced a heat death.

In &quot;Singularity Immemorial&quot;, the seventh main story event of the mobile game &quot;Girls&#x27; Frontline: Neural Cloud&quot;, the plot is about a virtual sector made to simulate space exploration and the threat of the heat death of the universe. The simulation uses an imitation of Neural Cloud&#x27;s virus entities known as the Entropics as a stand in for the effects of a heat death.

<doc id="362726" wikidata="Q6315297" url="?curid=362726" title="Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich">
<text>Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich (July 1496 – 12 June 1567), was Lord Chancellor during King Edward VI of England&#x27;s reign, from 1547 until January 1552. He was the founder of Felsted School with its associated almshouses in Essex in 1564. He was a beneficiary of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and persecuted perceived opponents of the king and their policies. He played a role in the trials of Catholic martyrs Thomas More and John Fisher as well as that of Protestant martyr Anne Askew.

==Origins==
According to some sources, Rich was born in the London parish of St Lawrence Jewry, the second son of Richard Rich by Joan Dingley, but this is disputed. Also, according to Carter, he was born at Basingstoke, Hampshire, the son of John Rich (d. 1509?), of Penton Mewsey, Hampshire, and a wife named Agnes whose surname is unknown. In 1509, Richard inherited his father&#x27;s house in Islington, Middlesex. Early in 1551 he was described in an official document as &quot;fifty-four years of age and more&quot;, and was therefore born about 1496 or earlier.

According to Sergeaunt (1889):
He had a brother, Robert, whom Henry VIII granted a messuage in Bucklersbury on 24 February 1539, and who died in 1557.

==Career==
Little is known of Rich&#x27;s early life. He may have studied at Cambridge before 1516. That year, he entered the Middle Temple as a lawyer and at some point between 1520 and 1525 he was a reader at the New Inn. By 1528 Rich was in search of a patron and wrote to Cardinal Wolsey; in 1529, Thomas Audley succeeded in helping him get elected as an MP for Colchester. As Audley&#x27;s career advanced in the early 1530s, so did Rich&#x27;s, through a variety of legal posts, before he became truly prominent in the mid-1530s.

Other preferments followed, and in 1533 Rich was knighted and became the Solicitor General for England and Wales in which capacity he was to act under Thomas Cromwell as a &quot;lesser hammer&quot; for the demolition of the monasteries, and to secure the operation of Henry VIII&#x27;s Act of Supremacy. Rich had a share in the trials of Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher. In both cases his evidence against the prisoner included admissions made in friendly conversation, and in More&#x27;s case the words were given a misconstruction that could hardly be other than wilful. While on trial, More said that Rich was &quot;always reputed light of his tongue, a great dicer and gamester, and not of any commendable fame.&quot; Rich also played a major part in Cromwell&#x27;s fall.

As King&#x27;s Solicitor, Rich travelled to Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdonshire in January 1536 to take the inventory of the goods of Katherine of Aragon, and wrote to Henry advising how he might properly obtain her possessions.

===Chancellor===
On 19 April 1536 Rich became the chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, established for the disposal of the monastic revenues. His own share of the spoil, acquired either by grant or purchase, included Leez (Leighs) Priory and about 100 manors in Essex. Rich also acquired—and destroyed—the real estate and holdings of the Priory of St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield. He was Speaker of the House of Commons in the same year, and advocated the king&#x27;s policy. Despite the share he had taken in the suppression of the monasteries, the prosecution of Thomas More and Bishop Fisher and the part he played under Edward VI and Elizabeth, his religious beliefs remained nominally Catholic.

Rich was also a participant in the torture of Anne Askew, the only woman tortured at the Tower of London. Both he and Chancellor Wriothesley turned the wheels of the rack to torture her.

===Baron Rich===

Rich was an assistant executor of the will of King Henry VIII, and received a grant of lands. He became Baron Rich of Leez on 26 February 1547. In the next month he succeeded Wriothesley as chancellor. He supported Lord Protector Edward Seymour in his policies, including reforms in Church matters and the prosecution of his brother Thomas Seymour, until the crisis of October 1549, when he joined with John Dudley. He resigned his office in January 1552.

===Prosecution of bishops===
Rich took part in the prosecution of bishops Stephen Gardiner and Edmund Bonner, and had a role in the harsh treatment accorded to the future Mary I of England. But upon her accession, Mary showed Rich no ill will. He took an active part in the restoration of the old religion in Essex under the new reign, and was one of the most active persecutors. His reappearances in the privy council were rare during Mary&#x27;s reign, but under Elizabeth he served on a commission to inquire into the grants of land made under Mary, and in 1566 was sent for to advise on the question of the queen&#x27;s marriage. He died at Rochford in Essex, on 12 June 1567, and was buried in Holy Cross Church in Felsted.

In Mary&#x27;s reign he founded a chaplaincy with provision for the singing of masses and dirges, and the ringing of bells in Felsted church. To this was added a Lenten allowance of herrings to the inhabitants of three parishes. These donations were transferred in 1564 to the foundation of Felsted School for instruction, primarily for children born on the founder&#x27;s manors, in Latin, Greek, and divinity. The patronage of the school remained in the founder&#x27;s family until 1851.

===Descendants===
Rich&#x27;s descendants formed the powerful Rich family, lasting for three centuries, acquiring several titles in the Peerage of England and intermarrying with numerous other noble families.

By his wife Elizabeth Jenks (Gynkes) (d.1558) he had 15 children. Thirteen of them are shown in the Essex pedigrees. The eldest son, Robert (1537?–1581), second Baron Rich, supported the Reformation.

One grandson, Richard Rich, was the first husband of Katherine Knyvet: another, the younger Robert Rich, third Baron Rich (1559–1619) was created First Earl of Warwick (of the third creation) in 1618, and was the father of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, who was Commander of the Commonwealth Navy during the Interregnum. This line failed with the death of the 8th Earl on 7 September 1759.

Rich had an illegitimate son named Richard (d. 1598) whom he acknowledged fully in his will with legacies and guardians for his minority, his education in the common law, and suitable marital arrangements. In this line of descent was his grandson the merchant adventurer Sir Nathaniel Rich, and his great-grandson Nathaniel Rich (nephew of the elder Nathaniel), a colonel in the New Model Army during the English Civil War. One of his distant descendants is Rory Stewart.

==Legacy==
Since the mid-16th century Rich has had a reputation for immorality, financial dishonesty, double-dealing, perjury and treachery rarely matched in English history. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper called Rich a man &quot;of whom nobody has ever spoken a good word&quot;.

==Depiction in the arts==
Rich is the supporting villain in the play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; by Robert Bolt, which shows his slide into corruption. In the subsequent, Oscar-winning film adaptation, John Hurt portrays him. Bolt depicts Rich as perjuring himself against More in order to become Attorney-General for Wales. More responds, &quot;Why, Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... but for Wales?&quot; The final line of the film notes that Rich &quot;died in his bed&quot; in juxtaposition with More&#x27;s martyrdom and the other major characters&#x27; untimely deaths. In the 1988 remake of the film, Jonathan Hackett portrayed Rich.

Rich is a supporting character in C. J. Sansom&#x27;s Shardlake series of historical mystery novels, which are set in Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. Rich is portrayed as a cruel villain who is prepared to subvert justice to enhance his property and position. He has a significant role in the plot of &quot;Sovereign&quot;, the third of the series, and in &quot;Heartstone&quot;, the fifth.

Rod Hallett played Rich in seasons two, three and four of the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot;.

Rich (spelled Riche in the novels) appears in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s three volumes about Thomas Cromwell, &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; and &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;. Bryan Dick portrays him in the BBC television adaptation of the first two novels, and Tom Mothersdale in the last of &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;.

<doc id="362728" wikidata="Q2381834" url="?curid=362728" title="Negative temperature">
<text>Certain systems can achieve negative thermodynamic temperature; that is, their temperature can be expressed as a negative quantity on the Kelvin or Rankine scales. This should be distinguished from temperatures expressed as negative numbers on non-thermodynamic Celsius or Fahrenheit scales, which are nevertheless higher than absolute zero. A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is &quot;hotter&quot; than any system with a positive temperature. If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system. A standard example of such a system is population inversion in laser physics.

Thermodynamic systems with unbounded phase space cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding heat always increases their entropy. The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to &quot;saturate&quot; in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. For a system of ordinary (quantum or classical) particles such as atoms or dust, the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle momenta can in principle be increased indefinitely). Some systems, however (see the examples below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.

== History ==

The possibility of negative temperatures was first predicted by Lars Onsager in 1949.
Onsager was investigating 2D vortices confined within a finite area, and realized that since their positions are not independent degrees of freedom from their momenta, the resulting phase space must also be bounded by the finite area. Bounded phase space is the essential property that allows for negative temperatures, and can occur in both classical and quantum systems. As shown by Onsager, a system with bounded phase space necessarily has a peak in the entropy as energy is increased. For energies exceeding the value where the peak occurs, the entropy &quot;decreases&quot; as energy increases, and high-energy states necessarily have negative Boltzmann temperature.

The limited range of states accessible to a system with negative temperature means that negative temperature is associated with emergent ordering of the system at high energies. For example in Onsager&#x27;s point-vortex analysis negative temperature is associated with the emergence of large-scale clusters of vortices. This spontaneous ordering in equilibrium statistical mechanics goes against common physical intuition that increased energy leads to increased disorder.

It seems negative temperatures were first found experimentally in 1951, when Purcell and Pound observed evidence for them in the nuclear spins of a lithium fluoride crystal placed in a magnetic field, and then removed from this field.  They wrote:

: A system in a negative temperature state is not cold, but very hot, giving up energy to any system at positive temperature put into contact with it. It decays to a normal state through infinite temperature.

== Definition of temperature ==
The absolute temperature (Kelvin) scale can be loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system&#x27;s particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing &quot;hotter&quot; systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation. The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of thermodynamic temperature in terms of Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy formula. This reveals the tradeoff between internal energy and entropy contained in the system, with &quot;coldness&quot;, the &quot;reciprocal&quot; of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity. Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.

The definition of thermodynamic temperature is a function of the change in the system&#x27;s entropy under reversible heat transfer :
: formula_1
Entropy being a state function, the integral of over any cyclical process is zero. For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system&#x27;s energy , the temperature can be defined as:
: formula_2

Equivalently, thermodynamic beta, or &quot;coldness&quot;, is defined as 
:formula_3
where is the Boltzmann constant.

Note that in classical thermodynamics, is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, is the statistical entropy, a function of the possible microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates. For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other.

Some theorists have proposed using an alternative definition of entropy as a way to resolve perceived inconsistencies between statistical and thermodynamic entropy for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. It has been argued that the new definition would create other inconsistencies; its proponents have argued that this is only apparent.

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, so that the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality. (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics for systems with limited states.) By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterized as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero, but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p. 462) put it,

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity (where is the Boltzmann constant), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, …, 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, is considered more natural than . Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have −∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==

The distribution of energy among the various translational, vibrational, rotational, electronic, and nuclear modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a &quot;normal&quot; system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the time scale of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of nuclear spins in a strong external magnetic field. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of temperature can be based on the relationship:

:formula_4

The relationship suggests that a &quot;positive temperature&quot; corresponds to the condition where entropy, , increases as thermal energy, , is added to the system. This is the &quot;normal&quot; condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin-related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an infinite number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===

The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of particles, each of which can take an energy of either or but are otherwise noninteracting. This can be understood as a limit of the Ising model in which the interaction term becomes negligible. The total energy of the system is

:formula_5

where is the sign of the th particle and is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with negative energy. From elementary combinatorics, the total number of microstates with this amount of energy is a binomial coefficient:

:formula_6

By the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics, the entropy of this microcanonical ensemble is

:formula_7

We can solve for thermodynamic beta () by considering it as a central difference without taking the continuum limit:

:formula_8

hence the temperature

:formula_9

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property. In the canonical ensemble, the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property. This leads to ( refers to microstates):
:formula_10

Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles. This leads to microstates , , , and .
:formula_11

The resulting values for , , and all increase with and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field. This allows the experiment to be run as a variation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to spin up and spin down. In the absence of a magnetic field, these spin states are &quot;degenerate&quot;, meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state). It is possible to add energy to the spin system using radio frequency techniques. This causes atoms to &quot;flip&quot; from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position. In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature. In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures. It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the nuclear Overhauser effect with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many lasing systems, wherein a large fraction of the system&#x27;s atoms (for chemical and gas lasers) or electrons (in semiconductor lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a population inversion.

The Hamiltonian for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency is
:formula_12

The density operator in the grand canonical ensemble is
:formula_13

For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, must be positive semidefinite. So if , and is negative semidefinite, then must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional degrees of freedom. Using an optical lattice, upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold potassium-39 atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a Feshbach resonance and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian from . Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the Mott insulator regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.

=== Two-dimensional vortex motion ===
The two-dimensional systems of vortices confined to a finite area can form thermal equilibrium states at negative temperature, and indeed negative temperature states were first predicted by Onsager in his analysis of classical point vortices. Onsager&#x27;s prediction was confirmed experimentally for a system of quantum vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate in 2019.

<text>David Gregory Malone (born October 19, 1948 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland) is a Canadian impressionist and actor. He is well known for the &quot;CODCO&quot; television series and his impersonations of Barbara Frum, Jean Chrétien, and Queen Elizabeth II.

== Career ==
Prior to CODCO, Malone wrote and performed in a number of shows for CBC Television, including &quot;The Wonderful Grand Band&quot;, &quot;The Root Seller&quot; and &quot;The S and M Comic Book&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;The Adventure of Faustus Bidgood&quot;.

After the death of his &quot;CODCO&quot; co-star Tommy Sexton in 1993, he devoted some years of his life to raising awareness of HIV and AIDS, including writing, directing and appearing in a training film for health care professionals. He also directed a docudrama film, &quot;The Untold Story of the Suffragists of Newfoundland&quot;, in which he appeared as Sir Richard Squires, and acted in the films &quot;Rare Birds&quot;, &quot;Extraordinary Visitor&quot;, &quot;Messiah from Montreal&quot; and &quot;Heyday!&quot;. He also appeared in a one-man special for &quot;Comedy Now!&quot;, &quot;Pocket Queen&quot;, which won an award at the 1999 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. More recently, he has had a recurring guest role in &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;. He appeared as orphanage headmaster Mr. Hill in the Irish-Canadian co-production &quot;Maudie&quot;, widely released in 2017.

Along with Sexton and their &quot;CODCO&quot; co-star Andy Jones, Malone was a recipient of the Earle Grey Award, the lifetime achievement award of Canadian television&#x27;s Gemini Awards, in 2002.

His first memoir, &quot;You Better Watch Out&quot;, was published in 2009 by Knopf Canada. He released a book in 2012 entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland&#x27;s Confederation with Canada&quot;, which is a look at how Newfoundland became a province of Canada in 1949. Malone is openly gay. He is also an amateur theologian.

==Politics==
Malone participated in the campaign that stopped the privatization of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, and has championed other environmental causes, including a campaign to ban shipping of garbage to Newfoundland. He ran as a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the St. John&#x27;s West by-election in 2000, losing narrowly to Loyola Hearn.

Malone supported Elizabeth May and the Green Party of Canada in the 2008 election, and performed at the 2009 Green Party convention in Pictou, Nova Scotia.

In June 2019, Malone was announced as the Green party candidate for the riding of Avalon for the 2019 federal election. Malone finished a distant fourth in the election.

<text>Fantasy hockey is a form of fantasy sport where players build a team that competes with other players who do the same, based on the statistics generated by professional hockey players or teams. The majority of fantasy hockey pools are based on the teams and players of the ice hockey National Hockey League (NHL).

A typical fantasy hockey league or hockey pool, has 8 - 12 teams but often have as many as 20. Other types of pools may have a greater number of teams, which may dilute the average talent making it more or less fun depending on the league, but also represents more closely the actual NHL, which currently has 32 teams. Other forms of fantasy hockey may allow an unlimited number of teams, whereby any number of owners may draft the same player(s). These typically have a restricted number of &quot;trades&quot; where one player may simply be exchanged for any other in the player pool, typically of the same position.

NHL.com/Fantasy has recently integrated year-round fantasy coverage, featuring rankings, news and advice.

==Rules==
The most common way for choosing NHL players or teams to comprise a fantasy team is via a draft, either online or in person. However, the method ranges from basic (i.e., the draft has a predetermined number of rounds, and every team has a pick in each round, unless they have traded their picks) to complicated (i.e. &#x27;auction&#x27; style).

Some leagues require an entry fee at the start of the season, with the league champion at the end of the year collecting some or all of the money. In other leagues, money is not involved at all and the league is simply for fun.

===Team structure===

Most office hockey pools keep the teams simple - merely choose 12 or 15 or 20 skaters from any position, most points win. However, fantasy hockey leagues usually use more complicated formats.

One common format of a fantasy team (rotisserie style) is:

* 2 Centers (Forward)
* 2 Left Wings (Forward)
* 2 Right Wings (Forward)
* 4 Defensemen
* 2 Goaltenders
* 5 Bench Players (who can play any position)

===Point scoring===

Common categories in which fantasy owners collect points include:

* Points
* Goals
* Assists
* Plus/Minus (+/-) 
* Penalty Minutes
* Power Play Points
* Game-Winning Goals
* Faceoffs Won
* Shots On Goal
* Hits
* Blocked Shots
* Wins (Goalie)
* Goals Against Average (Goalie)
* Save Percentage (Goalie)
* Shutouts (Goalie)
* Hat Tricks

&quot;Points&quot; (which is goals plus assists) is the most common measure of a fantasy hockey team&#x27;s performance. Some pools offer additional scoring based on the player&#x27;s position (such as points for a goaltender victory) or skill level (such as points for penalties earned by an enforcer). Other pools have much higher levels of complexity, taking into account defensive statistics and +/-. When management of the participant&#x27;s roster is required (i.e., activating certain players), this type of pool is often referred to as &quot;fantasy hockey&quot;.

====Example====
The most common scoring scheme is simply:
* 1 point per goal
* 1 point per assist
* 2 points per win
* 0 points per loss
* 1 point per OT loss

==Types of fantasy hockey leagues==

===Draft===
There are two basic kinds of hockey pools: &quot;draft&quot; and &quot;non-draft&quot;. In a draft pool, no player can be held by more than one participant. All of the pool participants take turns drafting their players. (The drafts are usually held in serpentine fashion; that is, the team picking first in the odd rounds will pick last in the even rounds.) This type of pool requires considerable in-depth knowledge of players beyond the top tier of NHL stars.

In a non-draft pool, everyone simply picks a set number of players. Thus, multiple participants can have the same player among their set roster.

One variant of a non-draft pool is a &quot;box-style&quot; pool, where players of a similar caliber (i.e., forwards, defencemen, superstars, rookies) are grouped together and a fixed number of players are selected from each group or box.

A hockey pool can also be played using the NHL playoffs, Olympics, World Cup or World Championship tournaments. These pools are extremely popular as they are much shorter in length.

===Head-to-Head===
In a &#x27;Head-to-Head&#x27; league fantasy owners attempt to win the most categories per week, with their weekly points to be added to their cumulative points total for the season. It is the only format that offers a bracket-style playoff format at the end of the regular season. At the end of the season, the teams with the most points make the playoffs (the number of playoff spots varies per league), with the team emerging from this successful being declared the league champion. In this format, the team that has the most points in the regular season does not always win in the playoffs. In fact, a much lower ranked team can win it all if they pull off an upset or two in the playoffs.

There is now a head-to-head points system, that combines the concepts of the two. It provides weekly match ups and opponents where each player tries to accumulate the most points. Points are earned from each stat, which are individually assigned a specific amount. For instance, a goal could be worth 3 points and an assist worth 2 points. Each game will see one win awarded and one loss awarded, except in the event that the competing teams tie in points scored for the week.

Going away from the &quot;points&quot; subsection of head-to-head scoring systems, there are two popular options that use weekly head-to-head match ups and score categories.

The first is commonly referred to as &quot;head-to-head most categories.&quot; In leagues that employ this system, each matchup will be contested between two teams, each of which are simply trying to win more scoring categories than its opponent in an effort to get the win for that week. For instance, if a fantasy hockey league uses 13 scoring categories, and Team A wins 8 of those categories to Team B&#x27;s 5, then Team A will get the win and go 1-0 for the week. Team B will have lost and take an 0-1 record from that week.

The second categorical head-to-head fantasy hockey scoring system is commonly referred to as &quot;head-to-head each category.&quot; While two leagues can use exactly the same scoring categories, team records and finish in the league standings can (and almost always will) be very different between the H2H Most and H2H Each systems. This is because in H2H Each leagues, &quot;every individual category represents a &#x27;game&#x27; to be won or lost in the standings.&quot; So, in our example from the paragraph above, if Team A wins 8 categories to Team B&#x27;s 5 over the week that they play against each other, Team A will have earned an 8-5 record for the week, while Team B will have earned a 5-8 record. This makes for a couple notable differences: 1) it creates wider gaps in the standings as the season progresses, 2) it puts an onus on battling for every single category, rather than creating a situation in which winning the most categories is impossible by mid-week and offering owners no incentive to play out the string, 3) it rewards dominance and proficiency in the most categories. To cite a well-known example, think of it in college football terms. Head-to-head most categories leagues require only that you win the week, no matter the score. Head-to-head each category leagues require that you win the week &quot;by as many categories as possible&quot;, because a team&#x27;s record is tied to what would otherwise be considered the score of the game.

There are advantages to each system, and commissioners should consider what kind of a league they want to create for their team owners. In short, the pros and cons of each head-to-head system are as follows:

Head-to-head most categories - The benefit is in the simplicity and also in the parity within the standings. More teams remain in realistic playoff contention longer, because it is easier to make up what would constitute a full game in the standings. The drawback is that teams can load up on half of the categories while leaving the others to chance and still end up winning most games despite possibly not being the most well-rounded team in a rotisserie sense. Another serious drawback to H2H Most Categories leagues is that once it becomes apparent during the week which team will win the most categories, there becomes no incentive to keep up, because a loss is a loss no matter the final score. This can result in the losing manager not setting his lineup in the last few days of the week. Since fantasy hockey was invented for Saturday nights, the busiest night of the NHL schedule, this can leave much to be desired.

Head-to-head each category - The benefit is that the standings should most closely reflect a rotisserie type of overall team strength, with the caveat that the opponent is different every week (rotisserie leagues have no head-to-head match ups and therefore no opponents). Another benefit is the incentive to battle hard for any and all categories that are within reach near the end of the week, by choosing to start players based on which ones are likely to perform best in those specific categories. The drawbacks are that it is not a true rotisserie league, so the possibility of the best team not winning still exists, and also that the better teams can run up the scores regularly and create much separation in the standings. Some owners are not equipped to continue giving their all when they see a record of 30-50, but might otherwise see a record of 3-5 as simply two games under .500.

Head-to-head points - The benefit is that the league can decide how much weight it wants to give to certain actions, or what would be called &quot;categories&quot; in the other leagues. A common complaint about head-to-head category leagues is that it places too much or too little importance on certain aspects of the game of hockey. By assigning a point value to everything that would otherwise be its own equally weighted category, the competitors can decide what kind of players they want to value the highest. The drawback to this setting is that games can frequently get out of hand by the weekend, thus again causing an atmosphere of indifference among many league members during what is supposed to be the most exciting time of the week.

===Daily Fantasy Hockey===

Daily fantasy hockey is a new niche in the fantasy sports industry. Like traditional fantasy sports, players draft a team of real world athletes who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day. Daily fantasy sports is quicker and more numbers-driven. Daily fantasy sports websites do not compete for the same players as traditional sports games, but instead market themselves as complementing traditional fantasy sports. Casual fans enjoy daily fantasy hockey leagues because they do not require continued attention from team owners in order for said owners to achieve. A small fee is usually required to enter these contests, with a significantly higher jackpot for the winner. However, the number of participants is often in the hundreds or even thousands.

Daily fantasy sports have faced criticism for their similarity to sports betting. The structure and payouts of daily fantasy games have been described as providing a feeling of &quot;instant gratification&quot; to its players, similar to that of online gambling.

===Points===
A &quot;Points&quot; league is one of the most simple and easy systems for beginners to fantasy hockey. Owners begin each season by selecting a team of a pre-determined number of players to fill different roles on the team. The most used positions for a points league are: centers, right wing, left wing, defense, goalie, rookie and enforcer. Respectively each of the different positions accumulate points differently. For example a forward may score points by goals and assists, whereas an enforcer will score points on penalty minutes and hits. Instead of owners competing against a single other team, like in head-to-head, owners gain points throughout the year for their players real time stats and is reflected in the owner&#x27;s team total. For instance, if for every goal scored in real life, one point is awarded to the respective team, and a player scores 25 goals, then the team will have 25 points for that player. Points are awarded for each of the categories and can be changed by the Commissioner of the league. Points leagues can also be combined with a &quot;keeper leagues&quot; format.

===Rotisserie===
A &#x27;Rotisserie&#x27; league is one in which teams are ranked in order from best to worst. In a ten-team league with ten categories, the maximum number of points a team can earn is 100 (by finishing 1st in each category). The least is ten, by finishing last and collecting only one point per category. Rotisserie leagues are likely the most strategic type of fantasy pool and reward managers whose team has strong, balanced scoring across all categories.

===Express League===
An &#x27;Express League&#x27; offers contests with shorter time frames than traditional season-long fantasy leagues. The rules are usually the same as the &#x27;Points&#x27; league. Games time frame could be from one day to one week or even more sometime.

==Keeper Leagues==

Any fantasy hockey pool that &quot;rolls over&quot; into future years is called a &quot;Keeper&quot; or &quot;Dynasty&quot; league. The leagues can be run each year in any of the above formats with a winner declared at the end of each season. At the end of the year team managers decide which players they wish to protect (the number varies - from protecting and keeping all players, to keeping as few as three or four players). Before the next NHL season begins, a fantasy draft is held to fill out the rest of the roster.

Many keeper leagues, as well as some single season leagues, have adopted salary cap rules similar to the NHL. In a &quot;Salary Cap League&quot;, a salary is assigned to each player before the manager selects his team. Salaries are usually determined by the NHL player&#x27;s real salary. Otherwise a number value is assigned - usually by an online hockey pool program - or it is determined through an auction process. Each manager must ensure that they do not go over the predefined salary cap when selecting players.

Some leagues have also introduced a rookie draft into their fantasy league. By using the rankings from the last season to determine the draft order, last place gets 1st pick and so on. In most leagues trading picks is also allowed.

==Running a hockey pool==
For a typical hockey pool, there are hundreds of statistical updates occurring every night. Updating statistics accurately and on a timely basis is usually handled by hockey pool software or via an online hockey pool manager like HockeyDraft.ca or OfficePools.com

== Simulated Fantasy Hockey ==
A variant of fantasy hockey that does not rely on day-to-day real world player statistics is simulated fantasy hockey.

In a simulated fantasy hockey league, each team owner builds a roster of players who are represented by a set of ratings for attributes such as scoring prowess and passing ability. The assembled rosters then compete in simulated head-to-head matchups, with the outcome determined by the attributes of the players. Simulation of those games can be conducted manually or using specialized computer software. Because the games are simulated, they do not require any real-world hockey leagues to be in-season, meaning simulated fantasy hockey can be played year-round.

Each simulated hockey league has its own rules for player acquisition, scheduling, and for determining player ratings. While many leagues are focused on active NHL players, some leagues opt to not use real-world players at all, assigning ratings to fictional players, while others build their rosters from historical players.

==History==

One of the first known fantasy hockey leagues was formed in 1981 by Jay Arbour (son of legendary New York Islanders Coach Al Arbour) and Neil Smith (who served as GM of the NY Rangers from 1989–2000). The league also included sportscasters Howie Rose and Sam Rosen, among others.

The longest documented continuously run hockey pool was formed in 1980 by a group of students from Handsworth Secondary School in North Vancouver, Canada. Known as the &quot;Handsworth Alumni Hockey Pool&quot;, it is now in its 45th year of existence as of the 2024/2025 NHL Season. The only year the pool was not active was during the 2004-2005 NHL Season, which was cancelled due to a labour dispute.

<doc id="362736" wikidata="Q1227533" url="?curid=362736" title="Directors Guild of America">
<text>The Directors Guild of America (DGA) is an entertainment guild that represents the interests of film and television directors in the United States motion picture industry and abroad. Founded as the Screen Directors Guild in 1936, the group merged with the Radio and Television Directors Guild in 1960 to become the modern Directors Guild of America.

==DGA Awards==

The DGA hosts the annual DGA Awards, an important precursor to the Academy Awards. In its 69-year history, the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film has been a near perfect barometer for both the Best Director, and in some cases, the Best Picture Academy Award. Only seven times has the DGA Award winner not won the corresponding Best Director Academy Award. Honorees are awarded with a statue manufactured by Society Awards.

==Credits==
The rule that a film can only have one single director was adopted to preserve the continuity of a director&#x27;s vision and to avoid producers and actors lobbying for a director&#x27;s credit, or studios hiring multiple directors for a single film or television episode.

The rule is waived only for directorial teams recognized by the DGA who have a history of working together and sharing a common vision. Examples include The Wachowskis, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Hughes brothers, Russo Brothers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and the Coen brothers. The Coens for years divided credit, with Ethan taking producing credit, Joel taking directing credit, and both of them sharing the writing credit (even though the two of them shared all three duties between themselves) until &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; in 2004.

An example of the DGA refusing to recognize a directorial team was Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller for &quot;Sin City&quot;; they were rejected because they had never worked together before; Rodriguez quit the DGA so that Miller would share director&#x27;s credit.

For the film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, director Bryan Singer was fired due to frequent absences and clashing on the set, with Dexter Fletcher replacing him with two weeks left of filming. Singer still received director credit and Fletcher received executive producer credit.

In the past, the DGA has also engaged in disputes with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) over possessory credits, first used in the 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. The WGA tried to limit possessory credits to writers, but has always been successfully opposed by the DGA, leaving directors free to try to negotiate such credits if they wish.

==Non-member directors==
Not all Hollywood directors are DGA members. Notable exceptions include George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez. Quentin Tarantino directed six feature films before becoming a DGA member, in 2012. Those who are not members of the guild are unable to direct for the larger movie studios, which are signatories to the guild&#x27;s agreements that all directors must be guild members.

==Leadership==

The following are the past Presidents of the Screen Directors Guild and the DGA:

* 1936–1938 King Vidor
* 1938–1941 Frank Capra
* 1941–1943 George Stevens
* 1943–1944 Mark Sandrich
* 1944–1946 John Cromwell
* 1946–1948 George Stevens
* 1948–1950 George Marshall
* 1950–1951 Joseph L. Mankiewicz
* 1951–1959 George Sidney
* 1959–1961 Frank Capra
* 1961–1967 George Sidney
* 1967–1971 Delbert Mann
* 1971–1975 Robert Wise
* 1975–1979 Robert Aldrich
* 1979–1981 George Schaefer
* 1981–1983 Jud Taylor
* 1983–1987 Gilbert Cates
* 1987–1989 Franklin J. Schaffner
* 1989–1993 Arthur Hiller
* 1993–1997 Gene Reynolds
* 1997–2002 Jack Shea
* 2002–2003 Martha Coolidge – first female president
* 2003–2009 Michael Apted
* 2009–2013 Taylor Hackford
* 2013–2017 Paris Barclay – first black and first openly gay president
* 2017–2021 Thomas Schlamme
* 2021–present Lesli Linka Glatter
==DGA Director&#x27;s Finder Series==
The Director&#x27;s Finder Series (or Director&#x27;s Finder Screening Series), inaugurated in December 1998, provides for the screening of independent films with no U.S. distributor, and no previous TV or other distribution. Selected by a lottery, the films are screened in DGA theatres in Los Angeles and New York City to an audience of DGA members and invited potential distributors. Many films have been picked up by distributors via the series that may not otherwise have been spotted. The series was initiated by the DGA&#x27;s Independent Directors&#x27; Committee, chaired by Steven Soderbergh, initially for U.S. films only, but later expanded to include Australian, Irish, British and New Zealand directors, via the International Association of English-Speaking Directors Organisation (IAESDO). By 2007, the series had screened more than 75 films. The DGA has collaborated with organisations such as the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland (SDGI) and the Australian Directors&#x27; Guild (ADG), which nominate one film to participate.

Australian entries, selected for the Finders Series Award by the ADG from a shortlist of four, include &quot;Boxing Day&quot; (2007), directed by Kriv Stenders; and after a five-year lapse, Tony Krawitz&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Tall Man&quot; (2012), and in 2014 Catriona McKenzie&#x27;s &quot;Satellite Boy&quot; was selected for the series.

Irish entries include Terry McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; (2014) and Ross Whitaker&#x27;s &quot;Katie&quot; (2018).

<text>Waking Up the Neighbours is the sixth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams, released on September 24, 1991. The album was recorded at Battery Studios in London and The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, mixed at Mayfair Studios in London, and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk in New York City.

The album received critical acclaim and reached the number one position on the album charts in at least eight countries, becoming Adams&#x27; second best-selling album worldwide. Its first single, &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, stayed at number one on the UK Singles Chart for a record sixteen consecutive weeks. The album was also notable in Canada for creating controversy concerning the system of Canadian content.

== Music ==

=== Background and recording ===
The performance of Adams&#x27; 1987 album &quot;Into the Fire&quot; was felt as somewhat of a disappointment. Although it reached No. 7 on the Billboard album chart and No. 2 in his native Canada, it fell short of the massive commercial success enjoyed by his fourth album &quot;Reckless&quot; released in 1984. &quot;Into the Fire&quot; was also Adams&#x27; last album recorded together with his longtime collaborator Jim Vallance; their songwriting partnership ended in August 1989. 

An attempt to record a new album was made in 1988 with Steve Lillywhite producing, but nothing from these sessions was released. Over a year after that, Adams joined forces with Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, previously known for his work with AC/DC, The Cars, Foreigner, and Def Leppard to start work on Adams&#x27; next album, recording at Battery Studios in England and the Warehouse Studios in Canada. Recording began in March 1990, and along with mixing, finished in June 1991. According to Adams, Lange changed his way of thinking about the songwriting process making him work meticulously on each song. As a result, the recording process went on for more than a year, and the release of album, originally scheduled for the fall of 1990, had to be postponed several times. Lange is credited on all 15 tracks of the album including four songs whose demos were originally recorded with Vallance.

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot; was released after a number of delays in September 1991. The album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album and lead single topped the charts in a number of countries, with &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; spending a record 16 weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart and topping the charts in 17 countries. It sold a record four million copies in the US. Canadian content regulations were revised in 1991 to allow radio stations to credit airplay of the album towards their legal requirement to play Canadian music. The album is Adams&#x27; second-bestselling album worldwide. 

=== Singles ===
Released before the album, &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; was its most successful single. It has become one of the most successful songs of all time, spending seven weeks at number one on the United States&#x27; &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, sixteen consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart, 11 weeks on the Dutch Top 40 and nine weeks at number one on the &quot;Canadian&quot; singles chart in Canada. The song received a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television at the 1992 Grammy Awards, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song of 1991.

Adams was approached to write a theme song by the producers of the upcoming Kevin Costner film, &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, and received a tape of orchestration written by film-score composer Michael Kamen. He and &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange used a section of Kamen&#x27;s orchestration and composed &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, which was placed deep in the film&#x27;s closing credits when it opened on June 14, 1991. The song rose to number one in the United Kingdom the week before the film&#x27;s British release, topped the charts in 16 countries, and sold over 10 million copies worldwide (one of the biggest-selling singles of all time). When the BBC asked Adams about the recent acoustic live version from his &quot;Bare Bones&quot; CD, &quot;Do you ever get bored of hearing your record-breaking hit &#x27;Everything I Do&#x27;?&quot; he said: &quot;Of course not. What a silly question.&quot; Julien Temple directed the music video for &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, which was filmed in Sheffield, England on May 17–18, 1991.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop This Thing We Started&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single. A rock song (in contrast to &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;), it peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 behind Prince&#x27;s &quot;Cream&quot;. The song was nominated at the 1992 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance, Solo.

&quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot; was the third single, whose title came from a fragment Adams and Jim Vallance wrote in the late 1980s. Originally titled &quot;Buddy Holly Idea&quot; because of its resemblance to Holly&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, it was developed into a song by Lange and Adams.

&quot;Thought I&#x27;d Died and Gone to Heaven&quot; was the fourth single from &quot;Waking up the Neighbours&quot;. It reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In the UK, the song reached number eight. &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;, &quot;Do I Have to Say the Words?&quot; (number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and &quot;Touch the Hand&quot; were also released as singles, but had less rotation than the first four singles.

== Canadian content controversy ==
The album caused controversy in Canada concerning the system of Canadian Content. Although Adams was one of Canada&#x27;s biggest recording stars at the time, the specific nature of his collaboration with non-Canadians, coupled with his decision to primarily record the album outside Canada, meant that the album and all its songs were not considered Canadian content for purposes of Canadian radio airplay. Under the system then in place, a piece of recorded music had to meet any two of the following four criteria in order to qualify as Canadian content:

* 1) the artist was Canadian
* 2) the track was completely recorded in Canada
* 3) the music was entirely written by a Canadian (or Canadians)
* 4) the lyrics were entirely written by a Canadian (or Canadians)

As Adams co-wrote both the music and the lyrics with Mutt Lange, who is from Zambia, and he did not primarily record the album in Canada, he only fulfilled one of the criteria. It was noted that if Adams had written all the lyrics, and Lange all the music (or vice versa), the collaboration would have counted as Canadian content. As a result, under CRTC regulations none of the album&#x27;s songs was considered Canadian content.

In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada&#x27;s annual Juno Awards, where his album had been almost completely ignored by the awards committee. He did end up winning the Entertainer of the Year Award (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.

Adams publicly criticised the CRTC policy, calling it &quot;a disgrace, a shame...stupidity&quot;. He continued his attack with:
&quot;You&#x27;d never hear Elton John being declared un-British [...] It&#x27;s time to abolish the CRTC. Not everyone agrees.&quot;
As a result of the controversy, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced that Canadian content rules would be changed. The new regulation allows non-Canadians to contribute up to 50% of the finished content to each of both the music and the lyrics of a recorded piece, and still qualify for Canadian content status—provided the recording artist is Canadian, or the song is recorded in Canada. Accordingly, the Adams/Lange songs, and the Adams/Lange/Vallance songs on the album now count as Canadian content, as Jim Vallance is also Canadian. However, the Adams/Lange/Kamen co-written &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; still does not count as Canadian content, as two of the three writers are non-Canadians, and the track was not recorded in Canada.

== Waking Up the Nation tour ==
Before releasing the album, Adams had already started a tour promoting it, and on June 8, 1991, he held large concerts in Europe co-headlining with ZZ Top. Shortly after the tour started, &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; was released as the debut single for the album. The single became a worldwide hit. Adams further supported the new album with his tour Waking Up the World, which started in October 1991 and ran through to the end of December 1993. On October 4, 1991, the world tour started in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On December 18, 1991, Adams played his two first-ever shows in Reykjavík, Iceland. After his tour in Europe, as well as a concert at Wembley Stadium attended by more than 72,000 people, Adams left for the United States, where he performed at the Ritz Theatre on January 10. That concert sold out in less than 20 minutes. In attendance were Ben E. King and Nona Hendrix.

The Canadian leg of the &#x27;Waking Up the World&#x27; Tour kicked off in Sydney, Nova Scotia on 12 January 1992, and wrapped up with a standing room only concert in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 31 January. In February 1992, he toured New Zealand and Australia for seven dates, kicking off with a press conference in Sydney. On February 21 the tour headed to Japan for close to a dozen shows in six cities. Bryan taped an interview with MuchMusic&#x27;s Terry Dave Mulligan in Calgary, Alberta and the air date was scheduled for mid-March. The tour continued through several European countries in June 1992, including Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, and in July 1992, Bryan performed for the first time in Hungary and Turkey. September through December 1992 saw the tour in the U.S. The Asian tour headed to Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong in February, 1993, before returning to the U.S. during March through May.

Adams&#x27; visit to South Africa during his Waking Up the World tour, following the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners from prison and the unbanning of black political parties, has been left relatively undocumented. Adams&#x27; concert at Cape Town&#x27;s Green Point stadium during the tour was called one of his most emotional and memorable performances.

Coca-Cola was one of the official partners and sponsors of the tour, and the beverage company released a commercial promoting the tour. It featured the song &quot;House Arrest&quot; with Adams and his band playing the song in a neighborhood and also featured actress Neve Campbell.

<text>Anthony Wilson (born May 9, 1968) is an American jazz guitarist, arranger and composer. He is the son of bandleader Gerald Wilson.

== Education and career ==
Born in Los Angeles on May 9, 1968, Wilson received his degree in music composition from Bennington College. He counts Duke Ellington, Gil Evans, Wes Montgomery, Ry Cooder, and T-Bone Walker among his influences. His first album &quot;Anthony Wilson&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award and his second album, &quot;Goat Hill Junket&quot; (1998) also received praise. Albums with his nine-piece band include &quot;Adult Themes&quot; (MAMA, 1999) and &quot;Power of Nine&quot; (Groove Note, 2006). Diana Krall and mandolinist Eva Scow appear on the latter.

He has also recorded two trio albums with Hammond organist Joe Bagg and drummer Mark Ferber, &quot;Our Gang&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Savivity&quot; in 2005 (both on Groove Note). In 2009 he recorded more organ trio music with &quot;Jack of Hearts&quot; (again for Groove Note) featuring Larry Goldings on Hammond organ, and alternating drummers Jim Keltner and Jeff Hamilton.

As a composer, he has received commissions from the International Association for Jazz Education, the Henry Mancini Institute, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, luthier John Monteleone, and the Jazz Coalition Commission Fund. His guitar quartet song cycle &quot;Seasons&quot; was composed as a vehicle for Monteleone&#x27;s quartet of guitars called &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; which were included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 2011 exhibition &quot;Guitar Heroes.&quot; &quot;Seasons&quot; was released as an audio CD and live performance film DVD set on Wilson&#x27;s label Goat Hill Recordings in November 2011. Another 2011 album, recorded in Brazil, was &quot;Campo Belo&quot; (Goat Hill), featuring rising Brazilian music stars André Mehmari (piano and accordion), Edu Ribeiro (drums), and Guto Wirtti (bass).

Wilson arranged and orchestrated Ivan Lins&#x27; song &quot;Love Dance&quot; for Barbra Streisand, on her 2009 album &quot;Love Is the Answer&quot;, produced by Diana Krall. Wilson also played guitar on that album.

Wilson can be heard on recordings by Paul McCartney (Kisses on the Bottom, Concord), Willie Nelson (American Standard, Blue Note), Leon Russell (Life Journey, Universal), Aaron Neville (Nature Boy: The Standards Album, Verve), Al Jarreau (Accentuate the Positive, Verve), Mose Allison (The Way of the World, Anti-), Joe Henry (Fuse, Mammoth), Diane Schuur (Midnight, Concord), Gladys Knight (Before Me, Verve), Kenny Burrell (75th Birthday Bash Live!, Blue Note), Randy Crawford and Joe Sample (No Regrets, PRA), Bobby Hutcherson (Wise One, Kind of Blue), Till Brönner (The Good Life, Verve).

He has been a member of Diana Krall&#x27;s group since 2001, appearing on albums and DVDs, notably the Grammy-winning &quot;Live in Paris&quot;.

He recorded the album &quot;Nova&quot; with Brazilian guitarist Chico Pinheiro which was released in Brazil on Pinheiro&#x27;s label Buriti and in the US on Wilson&#x27;s label Goat Hill Recordings.

Wilson can also be heard on a number of his father Gerald Wilson&#x27;s recordings. Since 1986, he has held the guitar chair with the Gerald Wilson Orchestra. Since his father&#x27;s death in 2014, Wilson has continued the leadership of the Gerald Wilson Orchestra in performances at the SOKA Jazz Festival (2014) and the Playboy Jazz Festival (2015).

Wilson&#x27;s main guitar is a custom &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; archtop built by luthier John Monteleone; he has also been seen on videos such as &quot;Live in Paris&quot; playing a blond 1958 Gibson Byrdland. Other frequently played guitars include a 1968 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe, and a 1934 Gibson L-30, and a Fender American Vintage series Telecaster with pickups made by Ron Ellis.

<doc id="362752" wikidata="Q1384878" url="?curid=362752" title="Quickdraw">
<text>A quickdraw (also known as an extender) is a piece of climbing equipment used by rock and ice climbers to allow the climbing rope to run freely through protection such as bolt anchors or other traditional gear while leading.

A quickdraw consists of two carabiners connected by a semi-rigid material (sometimes called the &quot;dogbone&quot;). One carabiner has a straight gate and connects to an anchoring device. The other carabiner is for the climbing rope, and uses a bent gate. Quickdraws are manufactured with either a solid carabiner gate or a wire carabiner gate for its lighter weight.

==Use==
A quickdraw is a specific type of runner. 
Runners are used by rock and ice climbers to extend the distance between an anchoring device and the rope.

A quickdraw is differentiated from a simple open loop of webbing with 2 carabiners on it by the following attributes:

# The material that connects the 2 carabiners is semi-rigid. It is not as flexible as an open loop of webbing. This rigidity facilitates quicker clipping to an anchoring device.
# The gate (on the carabiner that clips to a rope) is held in a specific orientation that facilitates quicker clipping to a rope.

These two attributes differentiate a quickdraw from other types of runners. These two attributes are what makes this special type of runner &quot;quick&quot; to &quot;draw&quot;.
If either of these two elements is missing the runner is not a &quot;quickdraw&quot;.

The methods by which a quickdraw maintains gate orientation vary. The most popular method involves the use of an elastic polymer band around the outside of the point of connection between the carabiner and the semi-rigid material. The elastic band should only be installed on the rope-end, and not on the anchor end. The elastic band is not a load-bearing element, and the carabiner must pass through the dogbone to hold body weight. Incorrect assembly has led to at least one death.

While historically the orientation of the gates varied, it is now generally recommended that both gates face the same direction, and that the quickdraw is clipped with both gates facing away from the climber&#x27;s path. This lessens the chances of the carabiner getting &quot;nose-hooked&quot; and breaking, or of either carabiner unclipping, during a fall or due to rope drag.

==Permadraw==

A permadraw is a quickdraw that is made from steel cable that has steel carabiners and remains permanently attached to the bolts. Developed in places such as Rifle Mountain Park in Colorado as a safer alternative; steel is much harder-wearing than the aluminum used in normal quickdraws. In addition, unlike quickdraws, climbers don&#x27;t need to retrieve the permadraws at the end of a climb.

==Alpine draw==
Alpine quick draws feature long slings wrapped or folded multiple times to save space on a climbers harness in place of a dogbone. Alpine draws are often used to extend pieces of protection and reduce rope drag but may also be attached to the harness simply as a convenient way to store slings for other purposes, such as building an anchor or use in natural protection. The softer sling of an alpine draw may be considered superior to the stiffer dogbone of most quick draws as it causes less perturbation of traditional protection and may reduce the chance of the rope unclipping itself from the carabiner.

<doc id="362753" wikidata="Q6266287" url="?curid=362753" title="Johnny Ball">
<text>Johnny Ball (born Graham Thalben Ball; 23 May 1938) is an English television personality and a populariser of mathematics. He is also the father of BBC Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball.

==Early life==
Ball was born in Bristol and attended Kingswood Primary School on the eastern edge of the city. Later in his childhood the family moved to Bolton, then part of Lancashire, where he attended Bolton County Grammar School. He left formal education with two &quot;O&quot; Levels, one in mathematics and one in geography. He was called up for national service and spent three years in the Royal Air Force. He was posted to Wales as a radar operator and was later sent to Germany to monitor the Hamburg-Berlin air corridor.

Ball began his entertainment career by working as a Butlin&#x27;s Redcoat, and was an entertainer in northern clubs and cabaret. He was nicknamed Johnny after John Ball, who played for Bolton Wanderers from 1950 to 1958 and the name stuck.

==Television and radio career==
Ball was one of the hosts of pre-school programme &quot;Play School&quot; beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s and beyond. He was also a regular fixture on children&#x27;s television from the mid 1970s and throughout the 1980s, presenting several series of science and technology programmes intended for children (including &quot;Think of a Number&quot;; &quot;Think Again&quot;; &quot;Think Backwards&quot;; &quot;Think...This Way&quot; and &quot;Johnny Ball Reveals All&quot;). As well as appearing on screen Ball wrote jokes for some shows including &quot;Crackerjack&quot;. All of these shows (except the ITV programme &quot;...Reveals All&quot;) appeared on the BBC. Ball&#x27;s shows were known for presenting scientific and technological principles in an entertaining and accessible way for young people.

In 2003, Ball appeared on &quot;The Terry and Gaby Show&quot; in which he answered viewers&#x27; questions. In July 2004, he was named in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; list of the top 40 most eccentric TV presenters of all time. In July 2012, he presented a &quot;Horizon&quot; special on ageing on BBC Four. He has starred in ITV and Channel 4 television adverts as well as radio adverts for the Yorkshire-based firm Help-Link.

In 2012, Ball took part in the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; television show, where he was paired with Aliona Vilani. A training accident in the three-week interval resulted in torn ligaments for Vilani, causing her to retire temporarily from the show. She was replaced by Iveta Lukošiūtė who, with Ball, was eliminated in the first week. Vilani returned in the final group dance alongside Ball. In an interview in October 2017, Ball said that Vilani faked the injury, with Vilani denying the allegation and saying she would take legal advice over Ball&#x27;s comments. There are no reports that she subsequently took any form of legal action.

==Personal life==
Ball&#x27;s daughter Zoe by his first wife, Julia née Anderson, previously presented &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; for BBC TV as well as the breakfast show on BBC Radio 2. The couple divorced when Zoe was two.

Ball lives with his wife, Diane, in Buckinghamshire.

==Other activities==
*Ball was the Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1993 to 1996.
*In November 2006, Ball voiced his opposition to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act, which would require any adult working with children to be vetted by the Criminal Records Bureau. In an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he said: &quot;It is like George Orwell&#x27;s 1984... a quarter of adults will have to be checked... The fear we are instilling in [children] is abhorrent.&quot;
*In 2007 it was reported that Ball rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, stating that &quot;carbon dioxide has been unfairly victimised in the debate.&quot; He supports the expansion of nuclear power and has given speeches arguing for its development.

<doc id="362756" wikidata="Q744553" url="?curid=362756" title="Churchill, Manitoba">
<text>Churchill is a subarctic port town in northern Manitoba, Canada, on the west shore of Hudson Bay, roughly from the Manitoba–Nunavut border. It is most famous for the many polar bears that move toward the shore from inland in the autumn, leading to the nickname &quot;Polar Bear Capital of the World&quot; and to the benefit of its burgeoning tourism industry.

==Geography==
Churchill is located on the Hudson Bay, at the mouth of the Churchill River on the 58th parallel north, far north of most Canadian populated areas. Churchill is far from any other towns or cities, with Gillam, approximately to the south, being the closest larger settlement. Manitoba&#x27;s provincial capital, Winnipeg, is approximately south of Churchill. While not part of the city, Eskimo Point and Eskimo Island are located across the river at the former site of the Prince of Wales Fort.

==History==
Various nomadic Arctic peoples lived and hunted in this region. The Thule people arrived around the year 1000 from the west, the ancestors of the present-day Inuit. The Dene people arrived around the year 500 from farther north. Since before the time of European contact, the region around Churchill has been predominantly inhabited by the Chipewyan and Cree peoples.

Europeans first arrived in the area in 1619 when a Danish expedition led by Jens Munk wintered near where Churchill would later stand. Only 3 of 64 expedition members survived the winter and sailed one of the expedition&#x27;s two ships, the sloop &quot;Lamprey&quot;, back to Denmark. Danish archaeologists in 1964 discovered remains of the abandoned ship, the frigate &quot;Unicorn&quot;, in the tidal flats some kilometres from the mouth of the river. The discoveries were all taken to Denmark; some are on display at the National Museum in Copenhagen.

After an abortive attempt in 1688–89, in 1717, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built the first permanent settlement, &quot;Churchill River Post,&quot; a log fort a few kilometres upstream from the mouth of the Churchill River. The trading post and river were named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who was governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the late 17th century. The fort, Prince of Wales Fort, was rebuilt at the mouth of the river. The fort was primarily built to capitalize on the North American fur trade, out of the reach of York Factory. It dealt mainly with the Chipewyan living north of the boreal forest. Much of the fur came from as far away as Lake Athabasca and the Rocky Mountains. A defensive battery, Cape Merry Battery, was built on the opposite side of the fort to provide protection.

As part of the Anglo-French dispute for North America, in 1731–1741, the original fort was replaced with Prince of Wales Fort, a large stone fort on the western peninsula at the mouth of the river. In 1782, the French Hudson Bay expedition, led by La Pérouse, captured it. Since the British, under Samuel Hearne, were greatly outnumbered and, in any event, were not soldiers, they surrendered without firing a shot. The leaders agreed Hearne would be released and given safe passage to England, along with 31 British civilians, in the sloop &quot;Severn&quot;, on condition he immediately publish his story &quot;A Journey to the Northern Ocean&quot;. In return, the British promised the same number of French prisoners would be released, and a British seaman familiar with the waters safely navigated the French away from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay coastline at a time of year when the French risked becoming trapped in winter ice. The French made an unsuccessful attempt to demolish the fort. The worst effect was on the local indigenous peoples, who had become dependent on trade goods from the fort, and many of them starved. Extensive reconstruction and stabilization of the fort&#x27;s remains have occurred since the 1950s.

In 1783, Hearne returned to build a new fort a short distance upriver. Due to its distance from areas of heavy competition between the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, it remained a stable, if not profitable, source of furs.

Between the years of decline in the fur trade and the emergence of Western agricultural success, Churchill phased into and then back out of obsolescence. After decades of frustration over the monopoly and domination of the Canadian Pacific Railway, western Canadian governments banded together. They aggressively negotiated for the creation of a significant new northern shipping harbour on Hudson Bay, linked by rail from Winnipeg. Initially, Port Nelson was selected for this purpose in 1912. After several years of effort and millions of dollars, this project was abandoned, and Churchill was chosen as the alternative after World War One. Surveys by the Canadian Hydrographic Service ship opened the way for safe navigation. Construction was completed by 1929.

Once this transportation rail link from farms to the Churchill port was completed, commercial shipping took many more years to pick up. In 1932, Grant MacEwan was the first person to cross through Churchill customs as a passenger. This was purely due to his determination to take the Hudson Bay route to Saskatchewan from Britain—most passengers returned via the St. Lawrence River.

In 1942, the United States Army Air Forces established a base called Fort Churchill, east of the town. After World War II, the base served several other purposes, including being a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and a Strategic Air Command facility. Following the demolition of the base it was repurposed into the town&#x27;s airport.

Naval Radio Station Churchill, call sign CFL, was activated as an ionospheric study station by the Royal Canadian Navy in support of the U-boat high-frequency direction finding (HFDF) net and became operational on 1 August 1943. Around 1949, Churchill became part of the Canadian SUPRAD (signals intelligence) network and remained in that role until it closed its doors in 1968. The Operations and Accommodations building remains today but is abandoned.

This area was also the site of the Churchill Rocket Research Range, part of Canadian-American atmospheric research. Its first rocket was launched in 1956, and it continued to host launches for research until closing in 1984. The site of the former rocket range now hosts the Churchill Northern Studies Centre, a facility for multidisciplinary Arctic research.

In the 1950s, the British government considered establishing a site near Churchill for testing their early nuclear weapons before choosing Australia instead.

==Environment==
Churchill is situated at the estuary of the Churchill River at Hudson Bay. The small community stands at an ecotone, on the Hudson Plains at the juncture of three ecoregions: the boreal forest to the south, the Arctic tundra to the northwest, and the Hudson Bay to the north. Wapusk National Park, located at , is to the southeast of the town.

The landscape around Churchill is influenced by shallow soils caused by a combination of subsurface permafrost and Canadian Shield rock formation. The black spruce dominant tree cover is sparse and stunted by these environmental constraints. There is also a noticeable &quot;ice pruning&quot; effect on the trees. The area also offers sport fishing. Several tour operators offer expeditions on land, sea and air, using all-terrain vehicles, tundra buggies, boats, canoes, helicopters, and ultralight aircraft.

===Aurora borealis===
Like all northern communities in Canada, Churchill can sometimes see the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) when there is a high amount of solar activity and the skies are clear, usually in February and March. Visibility also depends on the sky being dark enough to see them, which usually precludes their visibility in the summer due to nautical twilight all night long.

===Climate===
Churchill has a very harsh subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, frigid winters (from early October to May) and short, cool to mild summers. Churchill&#x27;s winters are much colder than a coastal location at a latitude of 58 degrees north should warrant. The shallow Hudson Bay freezes over in the winter, eliminating maritime transit. Prevailing northerly winds from the North Pole jet across the frozen bay, leading to a January average temperature of , comparable to the frigid cold in the Siberian Arctic city of Norilsk, which is at a much higher latitude of 69 degrees north. Juneau, Alaska, by contrast, is also at a latitude of 58 degrees north but is moderated by the warmer and much deeper Pacific Ocean. Juneau&#x27;s January average temperature is a full warmer than Churchill&#x27;s.

==Economy==
Tourism and ecotourism are significant contributors to the local economy, with the polar bear season (October and November) being the largest. Tourists also visit to watch beluga whales in the Churchill River in June and July. The area is also popular for birdwatchers and to view the aurora borealis.

The Port of Churchill is the terminus for the Hudson Bay Railway operated by the Arctic Gateway Group. The port facilities handle shipments of grain and other commodities around the world. The Churchill Northern Studies Centre also attracts visitors and academics from around the world who are interested in sub-Arctic and Arctic research. The town also has a health centre, several hotels, tour operators, and restaurants; it serves locals and visitors.

===Ecotourism===
Churchill is situated along Manitoba&#x27;s coastline, on Hudson Bay at the meeting of three major biomes: marine, boreal forest and tundra, each supporting a variety of flora and fauna. Each year, 10,000–12,000 eco-tourists visit, about 400–500 of whom are birders.

====Polar bears====
Polar bears were once considered solitary animals that would avoid contact with other bears except for mating. In the Churchill region, however, many alliances between bears are made in the fall. These friendships last only until the ice forms. Then, it is every bear for itself to hunt ringed seals. Starting in the 1980s, the town developed a sizable tourism industry focused on the migration habits of the polar bear. Tourists can safely view polar bears from specially modified vehicles built to navigate the tundra terrain. Utilizing a set of trails created by the Canadian and US military, responsible tour operators are granted permits to access these trails for wildlife viewing. Staying on these established trails ensures that the tundra ecosystem is maintained. October and early November are the most feasible times to see polar bears, thousands of which wait on the vast peninsula until the water freezes on Hudson Bay so they can return to hunt their primary food source, ringed seals. There are also opportunities to see polar bears in the non-winter months, with tours via boat visiting the coastal areas where polar bears can be found on land and swimming in the sea.

Many locals leave their cars unlocked in case someone needs to quickly escape the polar bears in the area. Local authorities maintain a so-called &quot;polar bear jail&quot; where bears (primarily adolescents) who persistently loiter in or close to town, are held after being tranquillised, pending release back into the wild when the bay freezes over. It is the subject of a poem, &quot;Churchill Bear Jail&quot;, written by Salish Chief Victor A. Charlo.

====Beluga whales====
Thousands of beluga whales, which move into the warmer waters of the Churchill River estuary during July and August to calf, are a significant summer attraction. Polar bears are present as well and can sometimes be seen from boat tours at this time of year.

====Birds====
Churchill is also a destination for birdwatching from late May until August; normally, 175 species are found there. Birders have recorded more than 270 species within a radius of Churchill, including snowy owl, tundra swan, American golden plover and gyrfalcon. More than 100 birds, including parasitic jaeger, Smith&#x27;s longspur, stilt sandpiper, and Harris&#x27;s sparrow nest there. Other birds that are seen around Churchill, but less often, include the northern hawk-owl, three-toed woodpecker and the Ross&#x27;s gull.

===Health care===

The town has a modern health centre, operated by the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, which employs about 129 people, including six doctors and eighteen nurses. It provides 21 acute care beds, dental care and diagnostic laboratories to service the residents of Churchill and the regions of Nunavut.

===Arctic research===
====Churchill Northern Studies Centre====
The Churchill Northern Studies Centre is a non-profit research and education facility east of the town of Churchill. It provides accommodations, meals, equipment rentals, and logistical support to scientific researchers who work on a diverse range of topics of interest to northern science.

====Churchill Marine Observatory====
The Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO), operated by the University of Manitoba, was constructed with federal funds beginning in 2015. The observatory became operational in December 2021. It facilitates studies to address technological, scientific and economic issues pertaining to Arctic oil spills, gas exploration, and other contaminants. The facility is located in the Churchill River estuary, and consists of two saltwater sub-pools designed to simultaneously accommodate contaminated and control experiments on various scenarios of the behaviour of oil spills in sea ice. The concrete pools are equipped with a movable fabric roof to control snow cover and ice growth, and various sensors and instruments to allow real-time monitoring. The project is estimated to cost about $32 million.

==Transportation==

Churchill Airport, formerly a United States and Canadian military base, is serviced by Calm Air operating scheduled flights connecting Churchill to Winnipeg.

The privately owned Port of Churchill is Canada&#x27;s principal seaport on the Arctic Ocean. The port was originally constructed by the government in the 1930s, although the idea of building such an Arctic deep-water port originated in the 19th century. It is the only Arctic Ocean seaport connected to the North American railway grid. The port is capable of servicing Panamax vessels. The presence of ice on Hudson Bay restricts navigation from mid-autumn to mid-summer. Churchill experiences the highest tides in Hudson Bay. The Churchill estuary has a narrow entrance, and ships planning to moor at the port have to execute a relatively tight 100-degree turn. Maritime transportation companies, Nunavut Sealink and Supply (NSSI) as Groupe Desgagnés, and Nunavut Eastern Arctic Sealink (NEAS) both have bases in Churchill and provide sealift to Nunavik and all Nunavut communities. The port was used for the export of Canadian grain to European markets, with rail-sea connections made at Churchill.

There are no roads from Churchill that connect to the Canadian highway network. The only overland route connecting Churchill to the rest of Canada is the Hudson Bay Railway, formerly part of the Canadian National Railway (CN) network, which connects the Port of Churchill and the town&#x27;s railway station to CN&#x27;s rail line at The Pas. The Winnipeg–Churchill train, operated by Via Rail, provides passenger service between Churchill station in downtown Churchill and Union Station in downtown Winnipeg twice per week and from The Pas once per week. The journey from Winnipeg takes approximately 40 hours, and services many smaller communities in northern Manitoba and eastern Saskatchewan.

In 1997, the railway line and port were sold by the Canadian government to the American railway-holding company OmniTRAX. The government of Manitoba proposed in 2010 that the Port of Churchill could serve as an &quot;Arctic gateway,&quot; accepting container ships from Asia whose containers would then be transported south by rail to major destinations in North America. Churchill has been used to transship grain since 1929. In October 2012, the &quot;Financial Post&quot; reported that due to delays in the approval of several new pipelines from Alberta&#x27;s oil fields, oil industry planners were considering shipping oil by rail to Churchill, for loading on panamax oil tankers. Under this plan icebreakers would extend the shipping season. In July 2016, OmniTRAX announced the closure of the Port of Churchill and the end of daily rail freight service to the port. Weekly freight service to the town remained until May 2017, when floods washed out the track.

In 2018, the Port of Churchill, the Hudson Bay Railway, and the Churchill Marine Tank Farm were purchased by Arctic Gateway Group, a public-private partnership that includes Missinippi Rail LP (a consortium of First Nations and local governments), Fairfax Financial and AGT Food and Ingredients. The group engaged Cando Rail Services and Paradox Access Solutions to repair the flood damage. On 1 November 2018, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined Churchill residents to celebrate the resumption of rail freight service to the town. Regular freight shipments resumed in late November and passenger service in early December 2018.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Churchill had a population of 870 living in 389 of its 540 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 899. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of the 2021 Canada Census, just over 56 percent of the population is Indigenous, and the rest (43 percent) are non-native. Of the Indigenous population, there were 345 First Nations (69 percent), 80 Métis (16 percent), 25 Inuit (5 percent) and 35 people (7 percent) had multiple Indigenous ancestry.

The non-native population is mainly of European descent, although a small number of Black Canadians (2.3%) and Latin Americans (1%) also reside in Churchill.

English is the most commonly spoken language, followed by Cree, Inuktitut, French and Dene.

== Attractions ==
The town has a modern multiplex centre housing a cinema, cafeteria, public library, hospital, health centre, daycare, swimming pool, ice hockey rink, indoor playground, gym, curling rinks and basketball courts. Nearby is the Itsanitaq Museum, operated by the Diocese of Churchill-Baie d&#x27;Hudson, with over 850 high quality Inuit carvings on permanent display. The exhibits include historical and contemporary sculptures of stone, bone, and ivory, as well as archaeological and wildlife specimens. The Parks Canada visitor centre also has artifacts on display and makes use of audiovisual presentations of various topics involving the region&#x27;s natural and archaeological history.

By the late 1980s, both the local government and Parks Canada had successfully educated its population on polar bear safety, significantly reducing lethal confrontations and fuelling ecotourism such that both the community and the polar bears benefited.

<text>Ronald Roe Messner (born August 1, 1935) is an American building contractor who has built more than 1,700 churches, including several megachurches.

Having divorced his first wife, he married televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in 1993 after her divorce from husband and PTL Club founder Jim Bakker.

== Early life ==
Messner grew up in Waldron, Kansas, on the Kansas-Oklahoma border. He founded Messner Construction in Andover, Kansas, and began building churches.

== Heritage USA ==
Roe Messner gained fame with the construction of Heritage USA in 1978 at the behest of Jim Bakker. In 1987, he and his first wife, Ruth Ann, wrote a book titled &quot;Building for the Master&quot;. He was reportedly the person who produced the money for the $265,000 payment to Jessica Hahn to cover up a sexual assault. Messner later billed PTL for work never completed on the Jerusalem Amphitheater at Heritage USA, thus playing a behind-the-scenes role in the downfall of the PTL Club. Revelations of the payoff invited scrutiny of Bakker&#x27;s finances, prompting him to be charged with fraud. In Bakker&#x27;s fraud trial, Messner testified for Bakker&#x27;s defense, asserting that Jerry Falwell had attempted to take over PTL and its associated cable television network by dispatching Messner to the Bakker home in Palm Springs, California to make an offer to &quot;keep quiet&quot;.

According to Messner&#x27;s testimony, Tammy wrote the offer on her stationery, listing a $300,000-a-year lifetime salary for Jim, $100,000 a year for Tammy, a house, and a year&#x27;s worth of free phone calls and health insurance. However, Messner said Bakker wrote on it: &quot;I&#x27;m not making any demands on PTL. I&#x27;m not asking for anything.&quot; Falwell denied making any offer. In the messy bankruptcy of PTL, Messner was listed as the single biggest creditor of PTL with an outstanding claim of $14 million. In court papers, the new operators accused Messner of $5.3 million in inflated or phony billings to PTL.

== Marriage to Tammy Faye ==
Messner divorced his first wife in 1993. At about the same time, Tammy Faye divorced Bakker. Messner and Tammy Faye were married in and lived in Rancho Mirage, California.

In 1996, Roe was convicted of bankruptcy fraud, having claimed to owe nearly $30 million to over 300 creditors in 1990. As he faced sentencing in 1996, he said he could not afford to treat his prostate cancer because he lacked health insurance. He was sentenced to and served 27 months in prison.

Messner published &quot;Church Growth by Design&quot;, another book on church building, in 2003.

== Tammy Faye Messner&#x27;s death ==
Messner and Tammy Faye moved to the gated community of Loch Lloyd, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City, in 2007. Tammy Faye died from cancer on July 20 that year; her last public appearance was a taped interview on CNN from their home the day before. Her ashes were interred in the Messner family plot in Waldron, immediately next to Messner&#x27;s mother.

Roe Messner himself is known to have received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in the past, though he told Larry King that his doctors had told him that he would not die from the disease.

==Notable churches==

Messner is reported to have been the biggest church builder in the United States. On August 7, 2007, he told Larry King that he had built 1,784 churches in 47 states. Messner supervised construction of the churches but was not the architect. He has designed and/or built over 1,800 churches in all 50 states.

<doc id="362765" wikidata="Q2897670" url="?curid=362765" title="Adenovirus serotype 36">
<text>Human adenovirus 36 (HAdV-36) or Ad-36 or Adv36 is one of 52 types of adenoviruses known to infect humans. AD-36, first isolated in 1978 from the feces of a girl suffering from diabetes and enteritis, has long been recognized as a cause of respiratory and eye infections in humans.
It was first shown to be associated with obesity in chickens by Dr. Nikhil Dhurandhar.

AD-36 infection can induce cellular differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and stem cells derived from human adipose tissue.

==Role in obesity==
There has been a positive correlation between body fat and the presence of AD-36 antibodies in the blood. Previous research showed that chickens or mice injected with similar types of viruses show a statistically significant weight gain.

To date, AD-36 is the only human adenovirus that has been linked with human obesity, present in 30% of obese humans and 11% of nonobese humans. In addition, a study of obese Americans indicates that about 30% of the obese individuals and only 5% of non-obese individuals have antibodies to Ad-36. Another study determined that children with the virus averaged 52 pounds heavier than those with no signs of it and obese children with the virus averaged 35 pounds heavier than obese children with no trace of the virus. AD-36 also causes obesity in chickens, mice, rats, and monkeys.

==Public awareness==
On March 18, 2006, the research of Richard Atkinson (University of Wisconsin) was posted on some websites. In those studies, blood tests conducted on over 2000 Australians showed that more than 20% of the study participants had contracted Ad-36 viral infection.

On January 26, 2009, many popular internet news portals ran reports of the pending release of scientific research by Professor Nikhil Dhurandhar (Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana) implicating AD-36 as a potential cause for Britain&#x27;s relatively high rate of adult obesity.

<doc id="362768" wikidata="Q1314442" url="?curid=362768" title="James Loy">
<text>James Milton Loy (born August 10, 1942) is a retired admiral of the United States Coast Guard who served as the acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security in 2005 and U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from November 4, 2003, to March 1, 2005. Prior to his appointment as deputy secretary, he served as the second administrator of the Transportation Security Administration from 2002 to 2003, and before that as the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard from 1998 to 2002. Also in 2004, Loy was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Early life and education==
Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Loy earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America as a youth and was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award as an adult. Loy entered the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1960. Subsequently, he earned master&#x27;s degrees in history and government from Wesleyan University, and in Public Administration from University of Rhode Island.

==Career==
Loy served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, served in combat as commanding officer of patrol boat during the Vietnam War, and eventually rose to the rank of admiral. In May 1998, Loy became the twenty first Commandant of the Coast Guard, serving in that post until 2002.

As the USCG Commandant, Loy reacted to the September 11 attacks of 2001. In the short term, he supervised the resumption of sea-borne trade throughout the U.S., after the USCG had shut down most major ports after the attacks. In the long term, Loy led the U.S. delegation to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and was instrumental in ensuring that the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code was approved and implemented in 2002. The code came into effect in 2004.
In May 2002, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Norman Mineta, appointed Loy to become the Deputy Undersecretary for the newly formed Transportation Security Administration. Loy led the agency through its creation and subsequent incorporation into the Department of Homeland Security.

On October 23, 2003, Loy was nominated as the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security by U.S. President George W. Bush, and sworn in on November 4, 2003. Following the departure of Tom Ridge, Loy filled in as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security from February 1, 2005, until February 15, 2005, when Michael Chertoff was confirmed and sworn into office. Joining the exodus of leadership, Loy resigned as Deputy Secretary, effective March 1, 2005.

On April 7, 2005, the Cohen Group announced that Loy had joined the firm as a Senior Counselor, effective April 18. On August 5, 2005, Loy joined the Board of Directors for Lockheed Martin.

In the fall of 2006 it was announced that Loy was being honored as the first Chair of the Tyler Institute for Leadership at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. As such Loy has played a significant role in speaking and drawing other distinguished visitors to the Academy. His first class was designed to teach a select group of cadets about the international shipping industry and how it might be secured.

In March 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had a feature on Loy and his relation to the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s Deepwater contract, which was awarded to Lockheed Martin in summer of 2002. When asked by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; if he ever faced improper influence on Deepwater decisions while serving as the USCG Commandant, Loy said: &quot;The question is almost insulting. I will pass on giving you any kind of answer.&quot;

==Personal==
In the 2024 United States presidential election, Loy endorsed Kamala Harris.

==Awards and decorations==
* Admiral Loy is a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

==Post career activities==
In 2020, Loy, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

In July 2022, Loy joined with other former U.S. military leaders in condemning former president and commander in chief, Donald Trump. &quot;While rioters tried to thwart the peaceful transfer of power and ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the president and commander in chief, Donald Trump, abdicated his duty to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.

<doc id="362771" wikidata="Q180656" url="?curid=362771" title="Flail (weapon)">
<text>A flail is a weapon consisting of a striking head attached to a handle by a flexible rope, strap, or chain. The chief tactical virtue of the flail is its capacity to strike around a defender&#x27;s shield or parry. Its chief liability is a lack of precision and the difficulty of using it in close combat, or closely-ranked formations.

There are two broad types of flail: a long, two-handed infantry weapon with a cylindrical head, and a shorter weapon with a round metal striking head. The longer cylindrical-headed flail is a hand weapon derived from the agricultural tool of the same name, commonly used in threshing. It was primarily considered a peasant&#x27;s weapon, and while not common, they were deployed in Germany and Central Europe in the later Late Middle Ages. The smaller, more spherical-headed flail appears to be even less common; it appears occasionally in artwork from the 15th century onward, but many historians have expressed doubts that it ever saw use as an actual military weapon.

== The peasant flail ==

In the Late Middle Ages, a particular type of flail appears in several works being used as a weapon, which consists of a very long shaft with a hinged, roughly cylindrical striking end. In most cases, these are two-handed agricultural flails, which were sometimes employed as an improvised weapon by peasant armies conscripted into military service or engaged in popular uprisings. For example, in the 1420–1497 period, the Hussites fielded large numbers of peasant foot soldiers armed with this type of flail.

Some of these weapons featured anti personnel studs or spikes embedded in the striking end, or are shown being used by armored knights, suggesting they were made or at least modified specifically to be used as weapons. Such modified flails were used in the German Peasants&#x27; War in the early 16th century. Several German martial arts manuals or &quot;Fechtbücher&quot; from the 15th, 16th and 17th century feature illustrations and lessons on how to use the peasant flail (with or without spikes) or how to defend against it when attacked.

== The military flail ==

The other type of European flail is a shorter weapon consisting of a wooden connected by a chain, rope, or leather to one or more striking ends. The &quot;kisten&quot;, with a spiked or non-spiked head and a leather or rope connection to the haft, is attested in the 10th century in the territories of the Rus&#x27;, probably being adopted from either the Avars or Khazars. This weapon spread into Central and Eastern Europe in the 11th–13th centuries, and then further west in Western Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries. The medieval military flail ( in French and in German), then, might typically have consisted of a wooden shaft joined by a length of chain to one or more iron-shod wooden bars, or it may have been a (&quot;chain morning star&quot;) with one or more metal balls or morning star in the place of the wooden bars. Artwork from the 15th century to the early 17th century shows most of these weapons having handles longer than 3 ft and being wielded with two hands, but a few are shown used in a single hand or with a haft too short to be used two-handed.

Despite being very common in fictional works such as cartoons, films and role-playing games as a &quot;quintessential medieval weapon&quot;, historical information about flails other than the kisten or derivatives of the peasant flail is rarer than other contemporary weapons, but a notable body of visual and textual sources for Western, Central, and Southern European depictions and descriptions of military are extant, if not particularly easy to find. Some doubt they were used as weapons at all due to the scarcity of genuine specimens as well as the unrealistic way they are depicted in art, as well as the number of pieces in museums that turned out to be 19th century forgeries when analyzed, though these limited and somewhat sensationlist studies have now been largely debunked. Waldman (2005) documented several likely authentic examples of the ball-and-chain flail from private collections as well as several restored illustrations from German, French, and Czech sources. Even the more comprehensive scholarly articles collating the numerous sources for flails note that their use in warfare was likely rare at best, even if such weapons were known about as a concept. Flails are noted as being potentially hazardous to their user in the absence of appropriate training and experience, meaning that, even if a blow were struck, there may have been a long time before the user could ready another swing.

== Variations outside Europe ==

In Asia, short flails originally employed in threshing rice were adapted into weapons such as the nunchaku or three-section staff. In China, a very similar weapon to the long-handled peasant flail is known as the two-section staff, and Korea has a weapon called a pyeongon. In Japan, there is also a version of the smaller ball-on-a-chain flail called a chigiriki.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the long-handled flail is found in use in India. An example held in the Pitt Rivers Museum has a wooden ball-shaped head studded with iron spikes. Another in the Royal Armouries collection has two spiked iron balls attached by separate chains.

The knout, a whip or scourge formerly used in Russia for the punishment of criminals, was the descendant of the flail. It was manufactured in many forms, and its effect was so severe that few of those who were subjected to its full force survived the punishment. The Emperor Nicholas I substituted a milder whip for the knout.

<doc id="362774" wikidata="Q334841" url="?curid=362774" title="Nakhon Pathom province">
<text>Nakhon Pathom (, , (Pronunciation)) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Suphan Buri, Ayutthaya, Nonthaburi, Bangkok, Samut Sakhon, Ratchaburi, and Kanchanaburi. The capital city of Nakhon Pathom province is Nakhon Pathom.

Nakhon Pathom province is home to the Phra Pathommachedi, a chedi commissioned by King Mongkut (Rama IV) and completed by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1870. The chedi is a reminder of the long vanished Dvaravati civilization that once flourished here and by tradition Nakhon Pathom is where Buddhism first came to Thailand. The province itself is known for its many fruit orchards.

==Geography==
Nakhon Pathom is a small province 56 km from Bangkok. It is in the alluvial plain of central Thailand and is drained by the Tha Chin River (known locally as the &quot;Nakhon Chai Si&quot;), a tributary of the Chao Phraya River. There are many canals that have been dug for agriculture. The total forest area is just or 0.8 per mille of provincial area. The Thai capital Bangkok has grown until it borders Nakhon Pathom.

===Climate===

Nakhon Pathom province has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification category Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until May. Monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Climatological data for the years 2012–2013: Its maximum temperature is 40.1 °C (104.2 °F) in April 2013 and the lowest temperature is 12.0 °C (53.6 °F) in December 2013. The highest average temperature is 37.4 °C (99.3 °F) in April 2013 and the minimum average temperature is 16.5 °C (61.7 °F) in December 2013. The average relative humidity is 75% and the minimum relative humidity is 22%. Annual rainfall is 1,095 millimeters. The number of rainy days was 134 days for the year 2013.

==Toponymy==
The name derives from the Pali words &quot;Nagara Pathama&quot;, meaning &#x27;first city&#x27;, and Nakhon Pathom is often referred as Thailand&#x27;s oldest city. Archaeological remains have been linked to the (pre-Thai) Dvaravati kingdom, dating to the 6th through 11th centuries.

==History==
Nakhon Pathom Province centuries ago was a coastal city on the route between China and India; due to sedimentation from the Chao Phraya River, the coastline moved much farther to sea. When the Tha Chin River changed its course, the city lost its main water source and thus was for hundreds of years deserted, the population moving to a city called &quot;Nakhon Chai Si&quot; (or &quot;Sri Wichai&quot;). King Mongkut (Rama IV) ordered the restoration of the Phra Pathom Chedi, which was then crumbling and abandoned in the jungle. A city gradually formed around it, bringing new life to Nakhon Pathom. A museum presents the archaeological record of the city&#x27;s history.

Major settlement of the province included immigration beginning in the reign of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II), which included Khmer villages (e.g., &quot;Don Yai Hom&quot;), the Lan Na-populated (&quot;Baan Nua&quot;) and Lao Song villages (e.g., &quot;Don Kanak&quot;), as well as a major influx of southern Chinese in the late-1800s and early-1900s. Today Nakhon Pathom attracts people from all over Thailand, most notably from Bangkok and Isan, plus Burmese migrant workers. The province includes industrial zones, major university towns, government offices relocated from Bangkok, and agricultural and transport hubs.

==Economy==
In mid-2019, the Department of Airports (DOA) proposed the construction of a new airport in the province, to relieve pressure on Bangkok&#x27;s two existing airports. The 20 billion baht airport would occupy 3,500 rai of land in Bang Len District and Nakhon Chai Si District. Its capacity would be 25 million passengers annually. If approved, construction would start in 2023 and the airport would be operational by 2025 or 2026. When fully built-out, the airport will accommodate 80-100 seat aircraft flying between Bangkok and second-tier provinces to ease congestion at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports. The project site has low population density, only 200 households on 400 plots of land.

In terms of agriculture, Nakhon Pathom is a province that has long been known as a source of pig farming. Most of the original farmers were Thai-Chinese. Its amount of pig farming is ranked among the top in the country. The breeds of pigs that are popularly raised are exotic breeds, such as Landrace, Large White, Duroc, and various crossbreed varieties.

== Health ==
Nakhon Pathom&#x27;s main hospital is Nakhon Pathom Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows Phra Pathom Chedi, at 127 meters the tallest pagoda in the world. It is in the center of the city of Nakhon Pathom, and has been an important Buddhist center since the 6th century. The current building was created by King Mongkut in 1860. On the pagoda a royal crown is depicted, the symbol for King Mongkut&#x27;s work on reconstructing the pagoda.

The provincial flag is blue with the yellow provincial seal in the middle of the flag.

The provincial tree &quot;Diospyros decandra&quot; (known as &quot;chan&quot; in Thai). The provincial aquatic life is the giant river prawn (&quot;Macrobrachium rosenbergii&quot;) (known as &quot;kung mae-nam&quot; or &quot;kung kam-kram&quot; in Thai). 

The provincial slogan is &quot;sweet pomelos, delicious rice, beautiful young ladies&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 106 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 904 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 10 October 2020 there are: one Nakhon Pathom Provincial Administrative Organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and twenty-six municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Nakhon Pathom has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further five have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and twenty subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).


The non-municipal areas are administered by 91 Subdistrict Administrative&lt;br&gt;
Organizations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).


==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>The Himalayan Trust is an international non-profit humanitarian organisation first established in the 1960s by Sir Edmund Hillary, who led the trust until his death in 2008. The Himalayan Trust aims to improve the health, education and general wellbeing of people living in the Solukhumbu District.

The Himalayan Trust is headquartered in New Zealand where it is a registered charity through the Charities Commission. The Trust has charitable status being a member of the Council for International Development (CID).

== Organisational structure ==
The Himalayan Trust operates from New Zealand. It maintains a small staff, preferring to work through partnerships with local NGOs in Nepal, such as The Himalayan Trust Nepal and has a focus on capacity building.

A board of directors meets regularly to approve strategic plans and budgets and determine policy. The current chairperson is Lynley Cook. The board is made up of eight members who are elected every two years. The members cover a wide range of experience and expertise across education and health, and all have a passion for Nepal.

A large proportion of the funding comes from donations from the New Zealand public, as well ongoing support from New Zealand&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Aid Programme.

== History ==
In 1960, Sir Edmund Hillary was in the Everest region leading the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition, an expedition studying high altitude physiology and looking for the Yeti. At a high camp one night he asked Sirdar Urkien what, above all, would he like for his children and the Sherpa people. Urkien asked for a school in his village of Khumjung. When the village elders gave permission for the supposed 200-year-old Yeti scalp in the Khumjung Monastery to be taken for examination by scientists in Paris, London or Chicago, one of the conditions was that a school be built in Khumjung (the experts said the relic had been fabricated from the skin of a serow or goat-antelope).

The first school was built in the Khumbu region of Nepal. Built by Wally Romanes in a week from prefabricated aluminium sections flown into Mingbo and carried down to Khumjung, it opened in mid-June 1961, the first major project of the Himalayan Trust.


Hillary wrote:
:&quot;The opening ceremony was a remarkable occasion. Surrounded by clouds and fog with frequent showers of rain, the villagers celebrated the important occasion with great enthusiasm.&quot;
The following year Hillary received requests for two more schools, one from Thame and one from Pangboche. The letter from Thame read:

27 October 1962

Sir

Respected Bara Sahib Sir Edmund Hillary

We the local people, the Sherpas of Thame, Khumbu, came to know that your honour, helping us in all respects, is going to open some more schools in Khumbu. So we Thame people are requesting your honour to open a school at Thame just like Khumjung.
Though our children have eyes but still they are blind!
So all we Sherpas of Thame are praying your honour to make our children just like those of Khumjung. We hope your honour may consider our prayer.

Yours,

Chewang Rimpi Sherpa

Thak Noori Sherpa

Kinken Kang Sherpa

Khunjo Chumbi Sherpa

Both schools were completed in 1963 along with other Himalayan Trust projects. These included building a pipeline to bring Khumjung&#x27;s water from its source in Khumbila to a reservoir in the village as well as running a smallpox immunization programme. The programme resulted in more than 3,000 people being vaccinated, with the result that the outbreak was limited to a few dozen people and about twenty deaths.

The Trust ended up building 26 schools in total over a period of 30 years. These schools were initially staffed and funded through the Trust until 1972 when the government took over the administration of all schools and education in the area. The Trust has a formal agreement with the Nepalese Government to continue to provide teaching resources and support to schools within the Solukhumbu Region.

By 1964, it was clear to Edmund Hillary that the transport of building materials needed to be easier, so the Himalayan Trust built an airstrip. The site chosen was beside the tiny village of Lukla, now the second busiest airstrip in Nepal. That year, aid projects also included a school in Namche and a bridge over the rough waters of the Dudh Kosi.

In 1966 the Himalayan Trust built the Kunde Hospital. The hospital was staffed by John R McKinnon from 1966 until 1968. During this time Diane Margaret McKinnon (née Diane Margaret Jack) taught at the Khumbu primary school. Their term in the Solu Khumbu ended when their son, Aaron Dorje McKinnon, was born. During this time the airstrip at Lukla (initially built with assistance from the Himalayan Trust) was extended to allow for the arrival of larger aircraft.

The building of Phaplu Hospital followed in 1975. Both hospitals were staffed by volunteer doctors from New Zealand and Canada working for periods of two years. Eventually both hospitals were handed over to local doctors – Phaplu to Dr Mingmar Gyelzen in 1982, and Khunde to Dr Kami Temba in 2001.

== Recent activities ==
A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on 25 April 2015, followed just 18 days later by a second earthquake measuring 7.3 in magnitude. This was one of the worst natural disasters in Nepal&#x27;s history and it left 2.8 million people across the country in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.

In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, The Himalayan Trust provided emergency shelter, bedding and other essential items for affected communities in the Solukhumbu region.

Of the more than 60 schools supported by the Himalayan Trust, 10 were completely destroyed and all sustained some damage. Temporary classrooms were provided in 30 schools – either by donating tents, retrofitting damaged buildings or constructing temporary shelters. All teachers in Solukhumbu have received training to support traumatized children.

Until 2020, work will continue to rebuild and carry out seismic strengthening on classrooms, teachers&#x27; quarters, student hostels and toilet blocks in up to 30 schools across the Solukhumbu district.

In 2013, a water and sanitation project was launched in Lukla to enable all residents of the village to have access to fresh, running water and to establish a fire-fighting system. This was established by Lukla residents and the Himalayan Trust provided 50 percent of the funding. In 2015, the project was successfully completed.

In April 2014, an avalanche on Mount Everest killed 16 Nepalese guides. The Trust immediately set up a fund to support the families of those killed in the disaster. The fund includes a scholarship programme for the children of the victims, ensuring they receive a full education and helping them explore alternative employment opportunities.

The Himalayan Trust continues to support schools in the Solukhumbu region, providing educational resources and specialist high school curriculum training for teachers. They also provide training in English medium teaching and support an academic scholarships programme that is open to all students in the region.

<doc id="362779" wikidata="Q643066" url="?curid=362779" title="Swatch Internet Time">
<text>Swatch Internet Time (or ) is a decimal time system introduced in 1998 by the Swatch corporation as part of the marketing campaign for their line of &quot;.beat&quot; watches. Those without a watch could use the Internet to view the current time on the watchmaker&#x27;s website, but now a dedicated wiki serves the purpose. The concept of .beat time is similar to &quot;decimal minutes&quot; in French Revolutionary decimal time.

Instead of hours and minutes, in Swatch Time the mean solar day is divided into 1,000 equal parts called &quot;&quot;s, meaning each lasts in standard time, and an hour lasts for approximately 42 .beats. The time of day always references the amount of time that has passed since midnight (standard time) in Biel, Switzerland, where Swatch&#x27;s headquarters is located. For example, @248 BEATS indicates a time 248  after midnight, or of a day (just over 5 hours and 57 minutes; or 5:57 AM UTC+1).

There are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; it is a globally unified timekeeping system based on what Swatch calls &quot;Biel Mean Time&quot; (BMT), the time zone conventionally known as Central European Time or West Africa Time. Note that it is based on the time zone and not the actual mean solar time measured in Biel. Also, unlike civil time in Switzerland and many other countries, Swatch Internet Time has never observed daylight saving time (DST), even prior to more recent decisions to abandon DST in certain locales.

==History==
Swatch Internet Time was announced on 23 October 1998, in a ceremony at the Junior Summit &#x27;98, attended by Nicolas G. Hayek, president and CEO of the Swatch Group, G.N. Hayek, president of Swatch Ltd., and Nicholas Negroponte, founder and then director of the MIT Media Lab. During the summit, Swatch Internet Time became the official time system for Nation.1, an online country (supposedly) created and run by children.

===Uses===

During 1999, Swatch produced several models of watch, branded &quot;Swatch &quot;, that displayed Swatch Internet Time as well as standard time, and even convinced a few websites (such as CNN.com) to use the new format. PHP&#x27;s date() function has a format specifier, &#x27;B&#x27;, which returns the Swatch Internet Time notation for a given time stamp. It was also used as a time reference on ICQ, and the online role-playing game &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; used it since its launch on the Dreamcast in 2000 to try to facilitate cross-continent gaming (as the game allowed Japanese, American and European players to mingle on the same servers). In March 2001, Ericsson released the T20e, a mobile phone which gave the user the option of displaying Internet Time. Outside these areas, it is infrequently used. While Swatch still offers the concept on its website, it no longer markets Beat watches. In July 2016, Swatch released Touch Zero Two, its second wirelessly connected watch, with Swatch Internet Time function.

===Beatnik satellite controversy===
In early 1999, Swatch began a marketing campaign about the launch of their Beatnik satellite, intended to service a set of Internet Time watches. They were criticized for planning to use an amateur radio frequency for broadcasting a commercial message (an act banned by international treaties). The satellite was intended to be deployed by hand from the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. Swatch instead donated the transmitter batteries for use in normal &quot;Mir&quot; functions, and the satellite never broadcast.

==Description==
The concept was touted as an alternative, decimal measure of time. One of the supposed goals was to simplify the way people in different time zones communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether. It also does away with the division of the day into 12 or 24 parts (hours), then 60 parts (minutes), then 60 parts (seconds), then 1000 parts (milliseconds). Furthermore, there is no confusion between the AM/PM system and 24-hour time.

===Beats===
Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1,000 parts called &quot;&quot;. Each lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. One is equal to one decimal minute in French decimal time.

Although Swatch does not specify units smaller than one , third party implementations have extended the standard by adding &quot;centibeats&quot; or &quot;sub-beats&quot;, for extended precision: @248.00. Each &quot;centibeat&quot; is a hundredth of a and is therefore equal to one French decimal second (0.864 seconds).

===Time zones===
There are no time zones; instead, the new time scale of Biel Mean Time (BMT) is used, based on the company&#x27;s headquarters in Biel, Switzerland. Despite the name, BMT does not refer to mean solar time at the Biel meridian (7°15′E), but to the standard time there. It is equivalent to Central European Time and West Africa Time, or UTC+1.

Like UTC, Swatch Internet Time is the same throughout the world. For example, when the time is 875 , or @875, in New York, it is also @875 in Tokyo. Unlike civil time in most European countries, Internet Time does not observe daylight saving time, and thus it matches Central European Time during (European) winter and Western European Summer Time, which is observed by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands during summer.

===Notation===
The most distinctive aspect of Swatch Internet Time is its notation; as an example, &quot;@248&quot; would indicate a time 248  after midnight, equivalent to a fractional day of 0.248 CET, or 04:57:07.2 UTC. No explicit format was provided for dates, although the Swatch website formerly displayed the Gregorian calendar date in the order day-month-year, separated by periods and prefixed by the letter &quot;d&quot; (e.g. d31.01.99).

===Calculation from UTC+1===
The formula for calculating the time in from UTC+1 is:

formula_1
Where &quot;h&quot; is UTC+1 hours and &quot;m&quot; is UTC+1 minutes. The result is rounded down.

<text>Charles Anthony Raven Crosland (29 August 191819 February 1977) was a British Labour Party politician and author. A social democrat on the right wing of the Labour Party, he was a prominent socialist intellectual. His influential book &quot;The Future of Socialism&quot; (1956) argued against many Marxist notions and the traditional Labour Party doctrine that expanding public ownership was essential to make socialism work, arguing instead for prioritising the end of poverty and improving public services. He offered positive alternatives to both the right wing and left wing of the Labour Party.

Having served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Gloucestershire from 1950 to 1955, Crosland returned to Parliament for Great Grimsby (1959–1977). During Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments of 1964–1970 he served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury (1964), then Minister of State for Economic Affairs (1964–1965). Entering the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science (1965–1967), he led the Labour campaign to replace grammar schools with comprehensive schools that did not use the eleven-plus for the selection of pupils. He later served as President of the Board of Trade (1967–1969), then Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning (1969–1970).

When Labour returned to power he served as Secretary of State for the Environment (1974–1976) and briefly as Foreign Secretary (1976–1977). In that role he promoted détente with the Soviet Union. He died suddenly in February 1977 of a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 58.

== Early life ==
Crosland was born at St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex. His father, Joseph Beardsall Crosland, was a senior official at the War Office, and his mother, Jessie Raven, was an academic. Both of his parents were members of the Plymouth Brethren. His maternal grandfather was Frederick Edward Raven (1837–1903), founder of the Raven Exclusive Brethren and secretary of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Crosland later rejected his family&#x27;s religion. He grew up in north London and was educated at Highgate School and at Trinity College, Oxford, obtaining a second class honours degree in Classical Moderations in Greek and Latin Literature.

In the spring of 1941, Crosland was commissioned in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and in late 1942 he joined (as part of the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion) the 2nd Parachute Brigade, which was part of the 1st Airborne Division. In September 1943, he participated in the landings at Taranto, Operation Slapstick. Crosland had his first direct experience of combat in Italy in December . He then became an intelligence officer gathering information for several months in the front line about troop movements at the Battle of Monte Cassino, and was also briefly involved in the Allied invasion of southern France as part of Operation Rugby in August 1944. He ended the war as a Captain.

After the war, Crosland returned to Oxford University and obtained first class honours in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, which he studied in 12 months; he also became President of the Oxford Union. He then became a university don at Oxford, tutoring in Economics. Notable people he taught at Oxford included Tony Benn, Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter.

== In opposition ==
=== Early years in parliament ===
Crosland, who had been talent-spotted by Hugh Dalton, was chosen as a Labour candidate in December 1949 to fight the next general election. He entered Parliament at the February 1950 general election, being returned for the South Gloucestershire constituency. He held that seat until the 1955 general election, when he was defeated at Southampton Test.

Crosland returned to the House of Commons at the 1959 general election when he was elected for Grimsby, which he would represent for the rest of his life. He was, like Roy Jenkins and Denis Healey, a friend and protégé of Hugh Gaitskell, and together they were regarded as the &quot;modernisers&quot; of their day.

From June 1960, Crosland played an important part in the establishment of the Campaign for Democratic Socialism, a right-wing grassroots group within the Labour Party, created, in part, as a response to the debates around the Left&#x27;s advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament and Clause IV. However, Crosland was against Gaitskell&#x27;s attempts to change Clause 4.

=== 1963 leadership election ===
Even though they were from the same wing of the party, the thought of the Labour Party being led by the volatile George Brown appalled Crosland, but he also was a critic of Harold Wilson for his apparent lack of principles. Just over two years earlier Wilson had challenged Gaitskell for the party leadership. Crosland nominated and voted for James Callaghan in the leadership contest caused by Gaitskell&#x27;s death on 18 January 1963. He rationalised his decision to back Callaghan on the basis that &quot;We have to choose between a crook (Harold Wilson) and a drunk (George Brown)&quot;. However, Callaghan was eliminated after obtaining 41 votes, the margin in votes between Wilson and Brown in the final ballot. With Callaghan eliminated, Crosland&#x27;s second wife wrote in her 1982 biography, he voted for George Brown in the second ballot, although with zero enthusiasm, and with little interest about the result, as he was opposed to both of the candidates now standing for the party leadership. Wilson won by 144 votes to Brown&#x27;s 103 on 14 February 1963.

Although critical of Harold Wilson, and angry with him for his 1960 challenge to Gaitskell for the party leadership, Crosland respected him as a political operator. Under Wilson, Crosland was first appointed Brown&#x27;s deputy in October 1964. In November 1964 Crosland and Brown told Wilson and Callaghan that ruling out devaluation was a mistake in the face of the economic crisis then under way. However, Crosland was not Brown&#x27;s deputy for long.

== In government ==
On 22 January 1965, Wilson appointed Crosland Secretary of State for Education and Science.

=== Grammar schools controversy ===
The ongoing campaign for Comprehensive schools in England and Wales gained a major boost with Circular 10/65, which as a statute rather than a Government Bill was controversial at the time, although a government motion in favour of the policy had been passed in January 1965. Crosland&#x27;s policy gained approval from local government; by 1979 over 90% of pupils were in comprehensive schools. In her biography published in 1982, Susan Crosland said her husband had told her &quot;If it&#x27;s the last thing I do, I&#x27;m going to destroy every fucking grammar school in England. And Wales and Northern Ireland.&quot;

Another major educational change was that presaged by his speech at Woolwich Polytechnic (now Greenwich University) establishing a &#x27;binary system&#x27; of higher education, in which universities would be joined by polytechnic institutions which concentrated on high-level vocational skills.

=== Overseas student fees hike ===
In October 1966, a committee of ministers in the Labour government decided to increase university fees for overseas students. Two months later Crosland announced their decision which treated Commonwealth students for the first time as if they were foreign. Widespread protests, which erupted immediately, soon united a large number of influential people from across a wide spectrum from left-wing militant students to mildly conservative vice-chancellors.

=== 1967–1976 ===
Crosland subsequently served as President of the Board of Trade from September 1967 to October 1969. He was deeply disappointed not to have been made Chancellor of the Exchequer after the November 1967 cabinet reshuffle which followed the devaluation of the pound. That job went to Roy Jenkins instead. Then he became Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning until the election defeat of June 1970.

Crosland was seen as a leader and intellectual guru of the &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;social democratic&quot; wing of the Labour Party in the 1970s. In April 1972, he stood for the deputy leadership of the party after Roy Jenkins resigned. He polled 61 votes of the Parliamentary Labour Party and was eliminated in the first round. The contest was eventually won by Edward Short, who defeated Michael Foot. Crosland was embarrassed by the national press in January 1973 when it emerged he had been given a silver coffee pot donated by disgraced corrupt architect John Poulson when opening a school in Bradford in January 1966. It later transpired that the pot was only silver-plated, and therefore of trivial value.

After Labour&#x27;s return to power in March 1974, Crosland became Secretary of State for the Environment. He was instrumental in changing Transport policy on British Rail to be a higher fare fast intercity passenger service rather than its previous role as a general freight common carrier. He contested the leadership in March 1976 following Wilson&#x27;s resignation, but polled only 17 votes and finished bottom of the poll. After his elimination, he switched his support to the eventual winner James Callaghan, who duly rewarded Crosland by appointing him Foreign Secretary on 8 April 1976.

According to John P. Mackintosh, the Wilson and Callaghan governments were dominated by Crosland&#x27;s views on equality:
:Crosland’s ideas continued to be almost unchallenged and dominated the Labour governments of 1964–1970. [...] [T]he Labour Government which came into office in 1974 edged back towards a Croslandite position. [...] [I]f any ideas or policies could be said to have characterised Mr Callaghan&#x27;s very matter-of-fact and cautious government, they were the continuation of an approach which Crosland had set out in 1956.

Crosland&#x27;s time as foreign secretary was dominated by the Third Cod War and relations with Rhodesia. Crosland once quipped to his wife that &quot;when I pop off and they cut open my heart, on it will be engraved &#x27;fish&#x27; and &#x27;Rhodesia&#x27;&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Early in his life Crosland had numerous gay affairs, including allegedly with Roy Jenkins. He later described the relationship as &quot;an exceedingly close and intense friendship.&quot;

Crosland benefited from the patronage of Hugh Dalton, who, in 1951, wrote to Richard Crossman: &quot;Thinking of Tony, with all his youth and beauty and gaiety and charm... I weep. I am more fond of that young man than I can put into words.&quot; According to Nicholas Davenport, Dalton&#x27;s unrequited feelings for Crosland became an embarrassing joke within the Labour Party.

Crosland married Hilary Sarson in November 1952, divorcing after five years, though the marriage had effectively ended after a year. Crosland had numerous affairs with other women. He remarried on 7 February 1964 to Susan Catling, an American from Baltimore resident in London whom he had met in 1956, and, in contrast to his first marriage, this was very happy and contented. Susan Crosland was a successful journalist and writer. There were no children of either marriage, although Crosland&#x27;s second wife had two daughters from a previous marriage. He persuaded his step-daughters to abandon their elite private schools to attend Holland Park Comprehensive. Susan Crosland died on 26 February 2011.

Crosland was a keen football fan and an avid viewer of the television show &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. He insisted on taking the then American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a football fan, to Blundell Park to watch Grimsby Town play Gillingham in April 1976 when the two met for the first time. In December 1976, when Kissinger bowed out after the Republican defeat, he watched a football match with Crosland at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

== Labour revisionist ==
After losing his seat in 1955, he wrote (as C.A.R. Crosland) &quot;The Future of Socialism&quot; which was published in autumn 1956. This became a seminal work for the moderate British left. (A revised 50th anniversary edition was published in 2006.) In the book he outlines the need for socialism to adapt to modern circumstances – a context from which the use of the term &quot;revisionism&quot; has its origins in Britain, despite the gradualism associated with the Fabian Society since the end of the nineteenth century.

Labour revisionism was a powerful ideological tendency within the Party in the 1950s and 1960s, taking intellectual sustenance from the Crosland book, and political leadership from Hugh Gaitskell. The goal was to reformulate socialist principles, and bring the Labour Party policies up to date with the changing British society and economy. Revisionism rejected the view that socialism ought to be primarily identified with the ownership of the means of production. That meant that continuous nationalisation was not a central goal. Second, was a series of political values focused on personal liberty, social welfare, and equality. Themes of destroying or overthrowing the rich and elite were downplayed in favour of policies of high taxation, more widespread educational opportunity, and expanded social services. Revisionists insisted on the necessity of a market-oriented mixed economy with a central role for capitalism and entrepreneurship.

Crosland was himself an active member of the Fabian Society, contributing to the &quot;New Fabian Essays&quot; collection, which saw the emerging generation of Labour thinkers and politicians attempt to set out a new programme for Labour following the Attlee governments of 1945 to 1951. In the 1951 essay &quot;The Transition from Capitalism&quot; he claimed that &quot;by 1951 Britain had, in all the essentials, ceased to be a capitalist country&quot; as a result of the establishment of the welfare state. In particular, Crosland wished to challenge the dominance of Sidney and Beatrice Webb in Fabian thinking, challenging their austere, managerialist, centralising, &quot;top-down&quot;, bureaucratic Fabianism with a more liberal vision of the good society and the good life, writing in &quot;The Future of Socialism&quot; that &quot;Total abstinence and a good filing system are not now the right signposts to the socialist utopia. Or at least, if they are, some of us will fall by the wayside&quot;.

Two further books of essays by Crosland were published: &quot;The Conservative Enemy&quot; (London, Cape, 1962) and &quot;Socialism Now, and Other Essays&quot; (London, Cape, 1974).

== Death ==
Crosland and his wife bought a converted mill at Adderbury in Oxfordshire in 1975, as well as having a home at Lansdowne Road in Notting Hill, London. On the afternoon of 13 February 1977, Crosland was at his home in Adderbury, working on a paper on the Rhodesian situation, and was planning that evening to complete a major foreign policy speech on détente. However, he suffered a massive cerebral haemorrhage and fell into a coma. He died six days later, on 19 February, at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, aged 58. Crosland was succeeded as foreign secretary by David Owen, who delivered his speech to the Diplomatic Writers Association on 3 March 1977. The following day, Crosland&#x27;s ashes were scattered at sea near Grimsby.

His papers are held at the London School of Economics.

<text>Irish red ale (), also known as red ale or Irish ale, is a style of pale ale that is brewed using a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley, giving the beer its red colour. Its strength typically ranges from 3.8% to 4.8% alcohol by volume, although some craft varieties can be as high as 6%.

In the United States, &quot;Irish red&quot; is sometimes used to describe a darker amber ale or a &quot;red&quot; beer that is a lager with caramel colouring. However, these beers are not Irish red ales. 

==History==
The true origins of Irish Red Ale are unknown. It is said that ale has been brewed in Kilkenny city, at St. Francis Abbey, since the 14th century. Commercial brewing, distilling, malting and milling took place in the city in the 18th century by a merchant class of predominantly Catholic families, namely Archdeakin, Brennan, Cormick, Connell, Dullard, Hyland, Kinchella, McCreary, Meighan, Smithwick, Sullivan and Watters. Conditions for brewing and distilling in Kilkenny were ideal, and by 1782 there were eight distilleries in the city. Due to County Kilkenny&#x27;s favourable climate, the city&#x27;s agricultural hinterland provided abundant yields of corn, wheat and barley. Further, as noted by MP and brewer Richard Sullivan in 1834, the nearby Castlecomer Plateau provided brewers and distillers in the city with a plentiful supply of coal.
Perhaps the most well known Irish red ale is Smithwick&#x27;s, which traces its lineage to 1710, with the establishment of John Smithwick&#x27;s brewery at St. Francis Abbey. The venture was short-lived and the brewery was sold by the family. This was commonplace in Kilkenny at the time, as periods of political instability and sporadic famine in Ireland in the 18th and 19th centuries weighed heavily on the industry. John&#x27;s grandson, Edmond Smithwick, acquired the St. Francis Abbey brewery in 1827 from the Brennans and greatly expanded its operations.

The company was acquired by Guinness in 1965 and the current brand was launched, replacing other now discontinued beers brewed by Smithwick&#x27;s, such as &#x27;Time ale&#x27; and &#x27;Time barley wine&#x27;. In 1987, Guinness developed an export-only brand of Smithwick&#x27;s known as Kilkenny, which has since evolved into its own distinct variant, with a redder colour, more bitter taste and foamier head.

While ale had been brewed for centuries in Ireland, the term &quot;Irish red ale&quot; was rarely, if ever, used in Ireland. It was popularised in the United States to describe a style of reddish-amber ale that has its roots in Ireland. In 1981, Coors licensed Killian&#x27;s Irish Red from Heineken France, which became one of the top selling specialty beer brands in the United States. Killian&#x27;s Irish Red, which is actually an amber lager, popularised the name &quot;Irish red ale&quot; to such an extent that the term was imported back into Ireland by many craft brewers as a classification.

In 2013, the Smithwick&#x27;s brewery in Kilkenny was finally closed and all brewing moved to St. James&#x27;s Gate in Dublin. In order to keep the tradition of Kilkenny brewing alive, descendants of both the Smithwick and Sullivan families opened a new brewery in Kilkenny in 2016 and relaunched the Sullivan&#x27;s brand, which had been discontinued in 1918. Sullivan&#x27;s claims it can trace it&#x27;s lineage to a brewery on James&#x27;s Street in 1702, which would make it the oldest branded red ale.

==Style==
The colour of Irish red ale is in the 11 to 18 range as defined by the Standard Reference Method (SRM). The style of beer is characterised by its malt profile, which typically includes a caramel or toffee-like sweetness. Irish red ales have a dry finish and a low to moderate bitterness of 15-30 IBU. Due to its sweet taste and relatively low alcohol content, Irish red ales are very popular with American craft brewers. Kilkenny and Smithwick&#x27;s are by far the most common macro-brewed varieties.

<doc id="362804" wikidata="Q599585" url="?curid=362804" title="In the First Circle">
<text>In the First Circle (; also published as The First Circle) is a novel by Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, released in 1968. A more complete version of the book was published in English in 2009.

The novel depicts the lives of the occupants of a sharashka (a research and development bureau made of Gulag inmates) located in the Moscow suburbs. This novel is highly autobiographical. Many of the prisoners (zeks) are technicians or academics who have been arrested under Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges following the Second World War. Unlike inhabitants of other Gulag labor camps, the sharashka zeks were adequately fed and enjoyed good working conditions; however, if they found disfavor with the authorities, they could be instantly shipped to Siberia.

The title is an allusion to Dante&#x27;s first circle, or limbo of Hell in &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, wherein the philosophers of Greece, and other virtuous pagans, live in a walled green garden. They are unable to enter Heaven, as they were born before Christ, but enjoy a small space of relative freedom in the heart of Hell.

==Plot summary==
Innokentii Volodin, a diplomat, makes a telephone call to an old family doctor (Dobrumov) he feels obliged by conscience to make, even though he knows he could be arrested. His call is taped and the NKVD seek to identify who has made the call.

The &quot;sharashka&quot; prisoners, or zeks, work on technical projects to assist state security agencies and generally pander to Stalin&#x27;s increasing paranoia. While most are aware of how much better off they are than &quot;regular&quot; gulag prisoners (some of them having come from gulags themselves), some are also conscious of the overwhelming moral dilemma of working to aid a system that is the cause of so much suffering. As Lev Rubin is given the task of identifying the voice in the recorded phone call, he examines printed spectrographs of the voice and compares them with recordings of Volodin and four other suspects. He narrows it down to Volodin and one other suspect, both of whom are arrested.

By the end of the book, several zeks, including Gleb Nerzhin, the autobiographical hero, choose to stop co-operating, even though their choice means being sent to much harsher camps.

Volodin, initially crushed by the ordeal of his arrest, begins to find encouragement at the end of his first night in prison.

The book also briefly depicts several Soviet leaders of the period, including Stalin himself, who is depicted as vain and vengeful, remembering with pleasure the torture of a rival, dreaming of one day becoming emperor of the world, or listening to his subordinate Viktor Abakumov and wondering: &quot;...has the day come to shoot him yet?&quot;

==Themes==
The novel addresses numerous philosophical themes, and through multiple narratives is a powerful argument both for a stoic integrity and humanism. Like other Solzhenitsyn works, the book illustrates the difficulty of maintaining dignity within a system designed to strip its inhabitants of it.

==Characters==
*: A Ministry official whose phone call at the beginning of the book functions as a catalyst for much of the later action in the sharashka and eventually leads to his arrest.
*: A zek mathematician, 31. An autobiographical character. He is offered a position in a cryptography group, and refuses, even knowing this means he will be sent away from the sharashka.
*: Gleb&#x27;s wife. Waited for eight years and became a student in Moscow because of him (Marfino is not far from Moscow) but is considering divorce because remaining married to a prisoner blocks her prospects for continuing studies or finding a job.
*: A zek designer, 36, a survivor of the northern camps now serving his second term. Sologdin is based on Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s friend Dimitrii Mikhailovich Panin, who later wrote a book entitled &quot;The Notebooks of Sologdin&quot;. He works on a cryptographic machine in secret, but is found out and has to develop his invention so as not to get sent back.
*: A zek philologist and teacher, 36, a Communist from youth, but nevertheless always ready for a good joke, even about socialism. Rubin is based on Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s friend Lev Kopelev. He gets a position in a new group; his first task is to identify the man who called to warn Dr. Dobrumov not to share his medical discoveries with international colleagues.
*: A zek engineer and head of the acoustic laboratory, he is not taken seriously and behaves like a child, despite the fact that he is as old as Nerzhin.
*: A zek mechanic, 23. Loves Klara, daughter of the prosecutor Makarygin. An informer himself, albeit a reluctant one, is beaten and sent away for helping fellow inmates find out who the other informers are.
*: Makarygin&#x27;s youngest daughter, works in the vacuum laboratory and falls in love with Ruska.

==Editions==
Solzhenitsyn first wrote this book with 96 chapters. He felt he could never get this version published in the USSR, so he produced a &quot;lightened&quot; version of 87 chapters. In the long version, the diplomat Volodin&#x27;s phone call (chapter 1) was to the US embassy, warning them of a Soviet attempt to get atomic bomb secrets. In the short version this call is to an old family doctor warning him not to share a new medicine with some French doctors he will visit. Another difference, in the long version Sologdin is a Roman Catholic, while in the short version his faith is not described.

Shortly after &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; was published, Solzhenitsyn submitted his &quot;lightened&quot; version for publication in the USSR, but it was never accepted. This version was first published abroad in 1968. An English version was first published in Great Britain by Collins and the Harvill Press in 1968. A paperback edition, still consisting of 87 chapters was published in 1988, translated from the Russian by Max Hayward, Manya Harari and Michael Glenny. The complete 96 chapter version (with some later revisions) was published in Russian by YMCA Press in 1978, and has been published in Russia as part of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s complete works. Excerpts from the full 96 chapter version were published in English by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and in &quot;The Solzhenitsyn Reader&quot;. An English translation of the full version was published by Harper Perennial in October 2009, entitled &quot;In the First Circle&quot; rather than &quot;The First Circle&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The Polish director Aleksander Ford made an English language film based on the novel in 1973, &quot;The First Circle&quot;. While it adhered closely to Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s plot, the film was a critical and commercial failure.

The 1992 TV movie based on the novel, &quot;The First Circle&quot;, won Canada&#x27;s Gemini Award for Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series, awarded to Ron Orieux. Directed by Larry Sheldon, it received nominations for best dramatic miniseries, best actor, best actress, and best writing in the category. It starred Victor Garber as the protagonist, Christopher Plummer, Robert Powell and Dominic Raacke, with F. Murray Abraham as Stalin. It was released on DVD.

In January 2006, the Rossiya Telekanal aired a miniseries directed by Gleb Panfilov. Solzhenitsyn helped adapt the novel for the screen and narrated the film.

<doc id="362813" wikidata="Q5739088" url="?curid=362813" title="Heritage USA">
<text>Heritage USA was an American Christian-themed water park, theme park and residential complex in Fort Mill, South Carolina, built by televangelist Jim Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye Bakker, founders of &quot;The PTL Club&quot;.

The park, which occupied , was built by church builder Roe Messner. Since its closure in 1989, projects have been constructed on the land it once occupied, portions of which have been sold to several companies.

The former Heritage USA facilities in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which were purchased by MorningStar Fellowship Church in 2004, were renamed Heritage International Ministries (H.I.M.).

==History==

Heritage USA opened in 1978, and by 1986, it attracted nearly 6 million visitors annually and employed around 2,500 people. The facilities included the 501-room Heritage Grand Hotel, the attraction Main Street USA, an indoor shopping complex, the Heritage Village Church, Upper Room, a 400-unit campground, The Jerusalem Amphitheater, conference facilities, King&#x27;s Castle, a skating rink, prayer and counseling services, cable television production studios, Bible and evangelism school, visitor retreat housing, staff and volunteer housing, timeshares and the Heritage Island water park and recreational facilities. It was the third-largest theme park by attendance, with 4.9 million visitors per year, behind only Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Heritage USA was described as a Christian version of Disneyland; before the scandal leading to its closure, Jim Bakker had plans to expand the park.

===Falwell&#x27;s slide===

According to the September 21, 1987, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, televangelist Jerry Falwell &quot;plunged&quot; down a &quot;hellish&quot; water slide called the &quot;Typhoon&quot; wearing a suit, fulfilling &quot;a promise made during a fund-raising drive that netted $20 million for the debt-ridden PTL&quot;. This drive eventually took the PTL Club and Heritage USA from Jim Bakker. The article said Jim Bakker &quot;arranged for Falwell to take over PTL in March in an effort to avoid what he called a &#x27;hostile takeover&#x27; of the television ministry by people threatening to expose a sexual encounter he admitted to having seven years earlier with church secretary Jessica Hahn.&quot; Photographs of Falwell&#x27;s water-slide plunge circulated worldwide. Video of the slide is also available on YouTube.

===Closure===
At Heritage USA&#x27;s peak, when it earned $126 million per year, the IRS revoked its tax exemption. Soon after Bakker&#x27;s federal indictment and public condemnation for raping and drugging Jessica Hahn with another man in his employ, John Fletcher, seven years before, park attendance dropped. Falwell said the park competed unfairly with tax-paying attractions and that the tax-exempt ministry should be separated from PTL&#x27;s business interests. Under Falwell&#x27;s leadership, Heritage USA sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with debts estimated at $72 million.

In return for a promised lifetime annual four-day vacation stay, 165,000 people had donated $1,000 to Jim Bakker&#x27;s planned Heritage USA hotel tower; each donor received $6.54 in compensation. Starting in 1987, Bakker&#x27;s legal and personal troubles made headlines, and in September 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused severe damage to many of the buildings. Heritage USA closed shortly after the storm.

==Redevelopment efforts==
In 1991, the Heritage USA property was purchased for $52 million by San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo in partnership with a Malaysian investment group, MUI Group (Malayan United Industries Berhad). The property was renamed &quot;New Heritage USA&quot;. The partnership between Cerullo and MUI ended over a disagreement concerning Cerullo&#x27;s issuance of discount cards for the theme park. MUI filed suit against Cerullo and ultimately bought out his interest in the venture, renaming the property Regent Park. Cerullo retained control of PTL&#x27;s cable network, which at the time was known as &quot;The Inspirational Network&quot;, ultimately moving it to Charlotte, North Carolina and renaming it &quot;The New Inspirational Network&quot;.

, it is known as The Inspiration Network (INSP). MUI is the parent company of Laura Ashley plc, which moved its US headquarters and distribution center to the property. The corporate offices of Laura Ashley are located in the former PTL World Outreach Center, a pyramid-shaped building that formerly housed the Bakkers&#x27; offices and those of the leaders of PTL. Since MUI purchased the building, it has been renamed &quot;The Regent Building&quot;. Through its local subsidiary Regent Carolina Corporation, MUI built a golf course and residential development on most of the former Heritage USA property.

For a short period in the 1990s, MUI operated the 501-room hotel and resort under a management agreement with Radisson Hotels, calling the property the &quot;Radisson Grand Resort,&quot; but the complex was not successful as a secular venture and ultimately closed and fell into disrepair. In December 2004, the remainder of the property was sold to Coulston Enterprises, owned by local developer and former MUI executive Earl Coulston. Coulston Enterprises sold portions of the property that had housed the PTL Ministry to MorningStar Ministries of Charlotte, headed by Rick Joyner; and Flames-of-Fire Ministries of Fort Mill, headed by Coulston&#x27;s wife Sabrina.

MorningStar has undertaken ongoing renovations to the portions of the property purchased by the ministry, including the Heritage tower, despite a few wishing to see the tower torn down and erecting a new billboard on Interstate 77 calling for its demolition. The buildings that had housed Flames-of-Fire were sold to The Broadcast Group, a television and multi-media production company headed by Dr. Dale Hill, who formerly worked for Bakker and PTL. Coulston Enterprises has developed several new subdivisions that include houses and restaurants on the remainder of the property.

In January 2006, a 24-hour prayer ministry opened at the former Heritage USA. Musicians and prayer leaders formed The Zadok House of Prayer (ZHOP) after relocating from the International House of Prayer in Kansas City. In April 2009, ZHOP vacated the grounds, and the building that housed their ministry, a former PTL warehouse complex, was sold to MorningStar Fellowship Church. It now houses MorningStar&#x27;s K-12 private school Comenius School of Creative Leadership (CSCL). In late 2006, the IRS placed a tax lien for $13.2 million on Regent Carolina Corporation, which had not yet transferred control of the golf course, common areas and roads to the Regent Park homeowners association. The golf course was subsequently sold to Southern Gailes. In 2018, Rick Joyner expressed interest in rebuilding the theme park.

==Legacy==

=== The Barn &amp; PTL Studios ===

Coulston entered into a lease/purchase agreement in April 2009 with The Broadcast Group, a multimedia production and training company founded in 1986 by former PTL Television Network executive Dr. Dale Hill, for the portion of the property encompassing the former Barn auditorium, Total Learning Center and PTL Television Network Studios. The studio production facility was renamed &quot;The Broadcast Group Complex&quot;. The former PTL Television Studios and adjacent Total Learning Center complex were almost immediately renovated and reopened upon the closing of the lease/purchase agreement in 2009. The Barn Auditorium renovations were completed in April 2012 and the facility was reopened and renamed &quot;The Barn at Regent Park&quot;.

In February 2014, The Broadcast Group suddenly relocated their operations from the buildings to a nearby office park in Fort Mill and shortly afterwards it was announced that all of the buildings and the surrounding 18-acre property had been acquired by Antioch International Church, which operated from a converted/renovated former PTL warehouse near the Heritage Grand Hotel, for $3.81 million on April 24, 2014; according to York County, South Carolina tax records. Antioch moved their church to a property at 8400 Regent Parkway (address since renumbered/renamed 453 Glynwood Forest Drive) and now uses the former Barn Auditorium as their new church home. The complex comprising The Barn &amp; studios has since been renamed The River Place.

=== The Upper Room ===

In January 2009, a group called &quot;Friends of The Upper Room&quot; created an online petition to Flames-of-Fire Ministry and Coulston Enterprises—then owners of The Upper Room—asking them to consider donating the property to another ministry or selling it at a reduced price to save the property from rumored demolition plans. The Upper Room building and surrounding properties were placed on the market.

In November 2010, over 565 people had signed the petition and rumors that The Upper Room&#x27;s owners planned to demolish it continued to circulate. In May 2010, the Friends of the Upper Room called for interested people worldwide to pray daily to ensure the building&#x27;s future. On November 19, 2010, it was announced that The Upper Room had been acquired by Christian concert promoter Russell James, who planned to begin renovations on December 1, 2010, with planned opening date of January 1, 2011; it would be known as the Upper Room Chapel.

The facility underwent extensive restoration; the outdoor &quot;Walk of Faith&quot; was restored and is again used as a house of intercessory prayer. It will ultimately be open 24 hours a day, with live video streaming through a website.

=== Heritage Grand Hotel redevelopment ===

MorningStar Fellowship Church bought the tower from Coulston Enterprises in 2004 on the condition that the tower be torn down in two years, or Coulston would be paid $300,000. York County approved a development plan in 2005 that would have required the tower be torn down. Later, MorningStar persuaded the county to let the ministry complete the tower. In 2013, MorningStar sued the county for breaching the development agreement, and the county claimed MorningStar did. The county continued to appeal its claims until 2019, and a joint agreement in 2020 gave MorningStar time to start the process of finishing the tower for senior housing. The county reinstated lawsuits in 2021, and continues to claim the tower should have come down by 2013 because it is unfit for the purpose. On March 16, 2022, the county stated in a news release that it never stood in MorningStar&#x27;s way but says codes require an unsafe building to be demolished. Numerous supporters of MorningStar have asked York County Council to change its mind, and MorningStar has filed another legal motion.

=== King&#x27;s Castle demolition ===

On March 19, 2013, developer Earl Coulston, who had purchased much of the former Heritage USA property, began demolishing &quot;The King&#x27;s Castle&quot;, an abandoned arcade and go-kart track that was originally intended to house the world&#x27;s largest Wendy&#x27;s restaurant. The building was under construction at the time of the Bakkers&#x27; departure in the late 1980s; construction ceased when Heritage USA entered bankruptcy and payments to contractor Roe Messner were stopped. The castle was later completed by Heritage USA&#x27;s then-new owner Regent Carolina Corporation (f/k/a New Heritage Carolina Corporation), a subsidiary of MUI Corporation of Malaysia. It was used for several years as an arcade and go-kart track before closing and falling into disrepair and abandonment.

Coulston jointly owned the building with neighboring MorningStar Fellowship Church as his property line ran through the rear portion of the building. MorningStar had originally intended the castle to be renovated and used as a youth center but later determined that it had been too heavily vandalized and was in too much disrepair to renovate. Coulston approached MorningStar and offered to pay for the cost of demolition because it was partially on his property and abutted a nearby housing complex he was developing. As soon as demolition began, it was halted the same day because the contractor did not have proper permission from either the State of South Carolina or York County. Demolition resumed once the proper permits were secured and the site has since been cleared.

=== Jerusalem Amphitheater/King&#x27;s Arena ===

The property encompassing the &quot;Jerusalem Amphitheater&quot; (also known as &quot;King&#x27;s Arena&quot;) and campground is owned by Earl Coulston. The campgrounds have been renovated and are now known as Crown Cove RV Park. The outdoor amphitheater has been demolished. A large portion of the amphitheater was demolished as part of Coulston&#x27;s plan to retrofit it with a roof and turn it into a venue for youth concerts. This never materialized and the amphitheater remained abandoned for many years before being demolished in October 2012.

<doc id="362815" wikidata="Q203159" url="?curid=362815" title="Monterey International Pop Festival">
<text>The Monterey International Pop Festival was a three-day music festival held June 16 to 18, 1967, at the Monterey County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California. The festival is remembered for the first major American appearances by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Who and Ravi Shankar, the first large-scale public performance of Janis Joplin and the introduction of Otis Redding to a mass American audience.

The festival embodied the theme of California as a focal point for the counterculture and generally is regarded as one of the beginnings of the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in 1967 and the public debut of the hippie, flower power and flower children movements and era. Because Monterey was widely promoted and heavily attended, featured historic performances, and was the subject of a popular theatrical documentary film, it became an inspiration and a template for future music festivals, including the Woodstock Festival two years later. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; publisher Jann Wenner said &quot;Monterey was the nexus – it sprang from what the Beatles began, and from it sprang what followed.&quot;

==Background==
In early 1967, Michael Bowen produced the Human Be-In at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, where many attendees dropped acid for the first time (lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD) and listened to Timothy Leary tell the crowd that people living in cities should reorganize as tribes and villages. This was one of the important precursors to the Summer of Love five months later. The Human Be-In directly inspired the Monterey International Pop Festival.

The first American hippie-style rock festival was held during June 10–11 at Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California, produced by radio station KFRC as the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival. Star performers included the Doors, the Sons of Champlin, the Steve Miller Blues Band, Jefferson Airplane, Hugh Masekela, Country Joe and the Fish, Canned Heat and the Byrds; the latter six acts also played Monterey Pop one week later.
==Planning==

The festival was planned in seven weeks by John Phillips of the Mamas &amp; the Papas, record producer Lou Adler, event producer Alan Pariser and publicist Derek Taylor. Monterey had been known as the site for the long-running Monterey Jazz Festival; the promoters saw a notional Monterey Pop festival as a way to validate rock music as an art form in the way in which jazz and folk were regarded. Taylor announced the festival on March 25, 1967, in his regular column for &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; magazine. The festival&#x27;s board of governors included some such as Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy who displayed initial enthusiasm but did little to organize the event. The Monterey Jazz stage manager, Paul Vieregee, was brought in to supervise the stage for the pop festival, and the same sound company was hired: McCune Sound.

The artists performed for free, with all revenue donated to charity, except for Ravi Shankar, who was paid $3,000 for his afternoon-long performance on the sitar. Country Joe and the Fish were paid $5,000, not by the festival, but from revenue generated from the D. A. Pennebaker documentary, &quot;Monterey Pop&quot;. The artists did, however, have their flights and accommodation paid for. Apart from Shankar, each act was given up to 40 minutes for their performance. Several ended their sets earlier, including the Who, who played for only 26 minutes.

Monterey&#x27;s bill boasted a lineup that put established stars like the Mamas and the Papas, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane and the Byrds alongside groundbreaking new acts from the UK and the U.S.

Crowd estimates for the festival have ranged from 25,000 to 90,000 people, which congregated in and around the festival grounds. The county fairgrounds&#x27; largest performance venue, an outdoor livestock arena with a stage at one end, had an approved festival capacity of 7,000, but it was estimated that 8,500 jammed into it for Saturday night&#x27;s show, with many extra attendees standing around the sides of the arena. Festival-goers who wanted to see the musical performances were required to have either an &#x27;all-festival&#x27; ticket or a separate ticket for each of the five scheduled concert events they wanted to attend in the arena: Friday night, Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday afternoon and night. Ticket prices varied by seating area, and ranged from $3 to $6.50 ($– in 2025, adjusted for inflation).

The song &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot; was written by Phillips and sung by Scott McKenzie, released in May 1967, to promote the event.

==Performances==
===Friday night===
The Los Angeles–based band the Association with hits such as &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; and &quot;Never My Love&quot; was the first act to perform at the festival. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s reporter Michael Lydon reviewed their performance as having a &quot;professional style and entertaining manner,&quot; especially on their latest hit single &quot;Windy&quot;, which was rising steadily on the Billboard Hot 100.

The Association was followed by the Paupers, a rock band from Toronto, who delivered a &quot;screaming volume and a racy quality,&quot; according to Lydon. The Paupers were proud to be judged on their music alone, not relying on &quot;gimmicks&quot; or lighting effects.

The next act was blues singer Lou Rawls fronting a big band, the song arrangements conveying a &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; soul&quot; style. Rawls also spoke to the crowd about the gritty experiences of African American life. After his set, he said to reporters that he was confident that &quot;the blues is the way of the future. The fads come and go, but the blues remain. The blues is the music that makes a universal language.&quot; He described how rock artists were increasingly drawing from the blues to give their music more substance.

Beverley Martyn sang a short set followed by Johnny Rivers. After Rivers was Eric Burdon leading his new incarnation of the Animals, introduced as the New Animals, re-interpreted the Stones song &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, adding electric violin. With this appearance, Burdon signaled a change to more of a politically charged hard rock style mixed with psychedelia. He later wrote the song &quot;Monterey&quot; about his experience at the concert.

The headliner of Friday night was Simon &amp; Garfunkel, who started after midnight, and performed minimally with just two voices and one guitar. They finished at 1:30 am on Saturday morning. Lydon reviewed their set as sweetly retrospective, but &quot;they seemed sadly left behind&quot; by the shifting of rock music away from the duo&#x27;s established folk rock style.

===Saturday afternoon===

Canned Heat started the Saturday afternoon show; their set was deemed &quot;uninspired&quot; by Lydon. In a thrilling display of raw emotion, Janis Joplin sang next, backed by Big Brother and the Holding Company. Joplin&#x27;s wildly elemental interpretation of the blues standard &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; was described by Lydon as &quot;the blues big mama style, tough, raw, and gutsy, and with an aching that few black singers reach.&quot; For the first time at Monterey Pop, the audience rose to their feet. This Saturday set was not recorded by filmmaker Pennebaker, so the group was asked to play again on Sunday night. &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; music critic Phil Elwood wrote that Joplin proved to be &quot;the real queen of the festival&quot;. This ended up being Joplin&#x27;s breakout appearance, bringing her fame far beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Columbia Records signed Big Brother and the Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.

Country Joe and the Fish came next, delivering a funny performance with an anti-war message. Guitarist and songwriter Barry Melton said afterward that he put political messages in the band&#x27;s music because &quot;we feel that in this society, you have to make your stance clear. Others don&#x27;t want to speak up in songs, be right up front.&quot; Melton said that taking LSD was part of his &quot;liberation&quot;, allowing him to draw from many different musical genres. &quot;When I hear a sound that is groovy I use it. I try to find music all over the place. Listening to anything can give you musical ideas. That&#x27;s freedom, and maybe that&#x27;s psychedelic.&quot; 

Organist Al Kooper sang and played two extended songs for a half hour, followed by the Butterfield Blues Band who were appraised by Lydon as reinvigorating the crowd with &quot;precisely&quot; interpreted blues without being &quot;uptight&quot;. One of Paul Butterfield&#x27;s standout harmonica solos was described as an exercise in serialism, breaking a &quot;few notes into tiny bits and experiment[ing] with their regroupings.&quot; The next two bands were dismissed by Lydon as forgettable sets: Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Steve Miller Band.

The final set of Saturday afternoon was the Electric Flag, a band led by guitarist Mike Bloomfield, containing Buddy Miles on drums, Barry Goldberg on organ, and Nick Gravenites singing in front. Their act was hailed as a &quot;smash success&quot; by Lydon. David Crosby announced later that night that if anyone in the audience had failed to see Electric Flag play, &quot;man, you are out of it, so far out of it.&quot;

===Saturday night===
Moby Grape kicked off Saturday evening&#x27;s concert with an unmemorable performance, according to Lydon. Due to legal and managerial disputes, the group was not included in the Pennebaker-produced film. Some of the Moby Grape footage was shown in 2007 as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of the film. An outtake of Moby Grape&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hey Grandma&quot; appears on the bonus disc of the Criterion release of the film. Regarding the decision for Moby Grape to open the evening, guitarist Jerry Miller recalled that &quot;everybody was arguing. Nobody wanted to play first and I said that would be fine for me.&quot;

Moby Grape was followed by a &quot;terrible&quot; showing by South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, helped only by a spirited display by Danny &quot;Big Black&quot; Rey on the congas. The Byrds sang some hits and some new songs, but did not energize the crowd. The band ended with a new single, &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;, featuring Masekela on trumpet, reprising his participation in the studio recording. 

A 20-year-old Laura Nyro gave one of her earliest performances at the Monterey Pop Festival. Lydon wrote that Nyro&#x27;s &quot;melodramatic&quot; set, &quot;accompanied by two dancing girls who pranced absurdly&quot;, was a disaster during which &quot;the evening hit bottom&quot;. Other critics wrote that the black-gowned Nyro was out of sync with the psychedelic sensibilities of the event. Upon the conclusion of her set, Nyro was upset, having heard booing from the audience. While reviewing the raw footage in the 1990s, Pennebaker picked out an audience member saying &quot;beautiful&quot;, and invited Nyro to witness it, but she died before this could be arranged.

With two huge singles behind them, San Francisco–based Jefferson Airplane was one of the major attractions of the festival, having built a large following on the West Coast. Lydon wrote that the band &quot;thoroughly proved themselves&quot; masters of psychedelia, aided by a trippy Headlights liquid light show projected overhead, enticing hundreds to join the band on stage dancing. Grace Slick &quot;sang as if possessed&quot; while she swayed in a full-length blue robe. 

After this, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s played a handful of instrumental R&amp;B tunes, wearing brilliant lime green suits, then they were joined by an identically attired Otis Redding who electrified the audience with his sexually charged singing style. He sang his 1965 song &quot;Respect&quot; which was topping the charts because of a popular new interpretation by Aretha Franklin. Redding finished with a riveting &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;. The crowd responded by standing and screaming for more. Redding had been included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding&#x27;s career. Until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding&#x27;s show, received well by the audience (&quot;there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding&#x27;s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend&quot;) included a version of the Stones&#x27; &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. The festival would be one of his last major performances: Redding died only six months later, in a plane crash, at the age of 26.

===Sunday afternoon===
Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to the U.S. at the festival. Shankar&#x27;s set began Sunday afternoon following a rainy morning, and the audience filled the arena to about 80% capacity. All other musical acts played to a packed house. He and his group of East Indian instrumentalists played for three hours, after asking everyone to refrain from photography and smoking. Shankar performed several ragas, two of which were released on the album &quot;&quot;. A &quot;dhun&quot; based on the raga &quot;Panchamse-Ghara&quot; (later miscredited as raga &quot;Bhimpalasi&quot;) concluded the &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; film.

===Sunday night===
The Blues Project opened the final night of the festival. Lydon said that their blues fusion music was &quot;part blues, part Scottish air, part weird phrases that became images of ambiguity.&quot; Big Brother and the Holding Company returned for a short set designed to capture on film Janis Joplin singing &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;. A team led by Cyrus Faryar, called Group With No Name, played a &quot;terrible&quot; set, as judged by Lydon. Buffalo Springfield, introduced by Peter Tork of the Monkees, appeared with a competent and efficient delivery of a half dozen songs, with &quot;Bluebird&quot; called out as memorable.

Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the U.S. after playing some New York dates two months earlier, the Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. The band used rented Sound City amps for their set, which were not as powerful as their regular Vox amps which they had left in England to save shipping costs. At the end of their frenetic performance of &quot;My Generation&quot;, the audience was stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend smashed his guitar and slammed the neck against the amps and speakers. Smoke bombs exploded behind the amps and frightened concert staff rushed onstage to retrieve expensive microphones. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. During Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s stay in England, he and the Who had seen each other perform; they were both impressed with and intimidated by each other, so neither wanted to be upstaged by the other. They decided to toss a coin, resulting in the Who winning the right to play first.

The festival crew cleared the mess left behind by the Who, and set the stage for the Grateful Dead. While a psychedelic light show was projected overhead, the band, fronted by lead guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia, played extended jams, starting with &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot; for 14 minutes, and finishing with a 20-minute segue of &quot;Alligator&quot; into &quot;Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks)&quot;. Lydon commented: &quot;The Grateful Dead were beautiful. They did at top volume what Shankar had done softly. They played pure music, some of the best music of the concert. I have never heard anything in music that could be said to be qualitatively better than the performance of the Dead, Sunday night.

Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones introduced the Jimi Hendrix Experience at the Monterey Pop Festival on the evening of Sunday, June 18. Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s use of extremely high volumes, the feedback this produced, and the combination of the two along with his dive-bombing use of the vibrato bar on his guitar, produced sounds that, with the exception of the British in attendance, none of the audience had ever heard before. This, along with his look, his clothing, and his erotic antics onstage, had an enormous impact on the audience. To take things further, aware of the Who&#x27;s planned explosive finale, he asked around for a can of lighter fluid, which he placed behind one of his amplifier stacks before beginning his set. He ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it on fire, and then smashing it onto the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This performance put Hendrix on the map and generated an enormous amount of attention in the music press and newspapers alike. Robert Christgau later wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; of Hendrix&#x27;s performance:

Backstage before their sets, Hendrix played his guitar while staring at guitarist Pete Townshend, who denied the assumption that they were jamming together. Townshend said later, &quot;It was just Jimi on a chair playing at me. Playing at me like &#x27;Don&#x27;t fuck with me, you little shit.&#x27;&quot;

The Mamas &amp; the Papas closed the festival. They also brought on Scott McKenzie to play his John Phillips–written single &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;. Their set included their hits &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; and &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. The song &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; was the final song performed at the festival, with Cass Elliot telling the audience &quot;You&#x27;re on your own&quot;.

After the concert, members of Jefferson Airplane, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the Grateful Dead jammed together backstage for four more hours, stopping for breakfast at dawn.

==No-shows==

===The Beach Boys===
The Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson was among the festival&#x27;s board members. His group was, at one point, slotted to perform after the Byrds on June 17, the second evening of the event. During mid–1967, the Beach Boys were struggling with numerous personal and professional issues. At the last minute, they announced that they could not play the gig due to Carl Wilson&#x27;s dispute with officials over his refusal to be drafted into military service, as well as the band&#x27;s commitments to finishing the long-overdue &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; single for Capitol Records.

Another (unofficial) reason given for the band&#x27;s cancellation was that Brian had had disagreements with the promoter. Carl later commented: &quot;Brian was on the board and [the festival] changed several times, the concept of it, and he decided &#x27;This is shit, let&#x27;s not play it.&#x27; I think there were some people getting hostile about the group at the time, about the surfing thing and he figured, &#x27;Fuck you,&#x27; or something like that.&quot; Asked about the decision, Bruce Johnston said &quot;it went from &#x27;Here&#x27;s the money, here&#x27;s the offer, you&#x27;re headlining&#x27; to &#x27;Now this is gonna be a non-profit show&#x27; so we pulled out.&quot; Other issues plaguing the group involved Brian and Dennis Wilson&#x27;s drug use.

Many of the people involved with the festival thought that the group was simply too scared to compete with the &quot;new music&quot;. Derek Taylor, who had previously worked as their publicist, presumed that &quot;it had to be down to Brian. Those sorts of decision were always his, really.&quot; John Phillips told a reporter that &quot;Brian was afraid that the hippies from San Francisco would think The Beach Boys were square and boo them.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s assistant Michael Vosse recalled that Wilson thought the Beach Boys would have been criticized by festival goers who were intent on seeing British acid rock groups. Writer David Leaf posited that the band dropped out because they had no fitting material in their repertoire besides &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.

Mike Love stated that none of the band members &quot;were afraid to perform at Monterey&quot; and explained that &quot;Carl was to appear in federal court the Tuesday after the concert, but for all we knew, they were going to arrest him again if he performed onstage ... &quot;. In a 1974 interview, he stated that he was &quot;ready to go&quot;, but Brian &quot;got sort of cold feet on the situation because he didn&#x27;t trust that the people there in that organization were going to do right with the money and everything, and sure enough there was a scandal about that about a year or two after.&quot; Stephen Desper, who was a sound engineer for the event, wrote that the band dropped out due to Love&#x27;s objections toward Coca-Cola, one of the event&#x27;s sponsors. In 2017, Love reflected that drugs were influencing the band&#x27;s decisions at the time and maintained that pulling out of Monterey was not his doing.

In the week after the festival had occurred, Brian traveled to the Monterey County Fairgrounds to pick up programmes of the event. According to journalist Domenic Priore, the band attempted to &quot;make up for their non-appearance&quot; by recording a live album, &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;, but it was never released.

The Beach Boys&#x27; sudden cancellation drew much criticism from the music press, and it had a long-lasting impact on critics&#x27; opinions of the group. Taylor remembered that dropping out of the program &quot;undoubtedly set the band in a very bad light. They were certainly heavily criticized at the time for it. It seemed rather like an admission of defeat.&quot; Biographer Steven Gaines writes that the band&#x27;s cancellation &quot;had a snowballing effect&quot; that came to represent &quot;a damning admission that [they] were washed up&quot;. In the description of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Jesse Jarnow, &quot;when the band pulled out of their performance, the ascendant underground effectively wrote the Beach Boys—one of the biggest American hitmakers of the decade—out of the &#x27;60s rock narrative that followed.&quot;

===Other===
* Donovan was mentioned as a possible attendee in Taylor&#x27;s original March 25, 1967, press release, but he was refused a visa to enter the United States because of a 1966 drug charge.
*The Kinks were also mentioned in Taylor&#x27;s press release, but the band declined the invitation after anticipating issues obtaining U.S. work visas. Due to incidents during the band&#x27;s 1965 US tour, the US musicians&#x27; union blacklisted them from American performance until 1969.
*The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful were invited but declined because of a marijuana investigation and resulting bandmember changes.
*Dionne Warwick canceled her appearance shortly before the festival.
*The Monkees, despite being the biggest selling act of 1967, were never in any serious consideration to play, although band members Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork did attend the festival. Dolenz can be seen in footage during Ravi Shankar&#x27;s performance while Tork introduced Buffalo Springfield. Tork had also introduced the Lou Rawls performance two days before.

==Influence==

The festival launched the careers of many who played there, making some of them into stars virtually overnight, including Janis Joplin.

Monterey was also the first high-profile event to mix acts from major regional music centers in the U.S.San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and New York Cityand it was the first time many of these bands had met each other in person. It was a particularly important meeting place for bands from the Bay Area and L.A., who had tended to regard each other with a degree of suspicion, and until that point the two scenes had been developing separately along fairly distinct lines. Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane said &quot;The idea that San Francisco was heralding was a bit of freedom from oppression.&quot;

Monterey also marked a significant changing of the guard in British music. The Who and Eric Burdon and the Animals represented the UK, with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones conspicuously absent. The Stones&#x27; Brian Jones was seen many times strolling through the crowds, resplendent in full psychedelic regalia, and appeared on stage briefly to introduce Jimi Hendrix. It would be two more years before the Stones went on tour, by which time Jones was dead. The Beatles had already stopped touring altogether. Meanwhile, the Who&#x27;s striking performance brought them widespread fame in the US. 

Also notable was the festival&#x27;s innovative sound system, designed and built by audio engineer Abe Jacob, who started his career doing live sound for San Francisco bands and went on to become a leading sound designer for the American theater. Jacob&#x27;s groundbreaking Monterey sound system was the progenitor of all the large-scale PAs that followed. It was a key factor in the festival&#x27;s success and it was greatly appreciated by the artists—in the Monterey film, David Crosby can clearly be seen saying &quot;Great sound system!&quot; to bandmate Chris Hillman at the start of the Byrds&#x27; soundcheck. Lighting by Chip Monck attracted the attention of the Woodstock Festival promoters.

Electronic music pioneers Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause set up a booth at Monterey to demonstrate the new electronic music synthesizer developed by Robert Moog. Beaver and Krause had bought one of Moog&#x27;s first synthesizers in 1966 and had spent a fruitless year trying to get someone in Hollywood interested in using it. Through their demonstration booth at Monterey, they gained the interest of acts including the Doors, the Byrds, the Rolling Stones, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and others. This quickly built into a steady stream of business, and the eccentric Beaver was soon one of the busiest session men in L.A. He and Krause earned a contract with Warner Brothers.

Eric Burdon and the Animals later that same year, in their hit &quot;Monterey&quot;, quoted a line from the Byrds&#x27; song &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot; (&quot;I think that maybe I&#x27;m dreamin&#x27;&quot;) and mentioned performers the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, Ravi Shankar, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Hugh Masekela, Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones&#x27; Brian Jones (&quot;His Majesty Prince Jones smiled as he moved among the crowd&quot;). The instruments used in the song imitate the styles of these performers.

===Anniversary festival===
The festival did not become an annual event. However, in 2017 on the 50th anniversary of the festival, the &quot;Monterey International Pop Festival – Celebrates 50 Years&quot; was held at the same venue on the same weekend, with the participation of Lou Adler. Norah Jones, daughter of Ravi Shankar, was one of the headliners.

==Recording and filming the festival==

The festival was the subject of a documentary movie titled &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; by noted documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker. Pennebaker&#x27;s team used recently developed portable 16mm crystal-sync motion picture cameras that stayed synchronized with double-system sound-recording systems. The film stock was Eastman Kodak&#x27;s recently released &quot;high-speed&quot; 16mm Ektachrome 100 ASA color reversal motion picture stock, without which the nighttime shows would have been virtually impossible to shoot in color. Sound was captured by Wally Heider&#x27;s mobile studio on a then state-of-the art eight-channel recorder, with one track used for the crystal-sync tone, to synchronize it with the film cameras. The Grateful Dead believed that the film was too commercial and refused permission for their performance to be shown. The screening of the film in theaters nationwide helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more such festivals around the country. Adler said the cameramen were instructed to capture at least two complete songs for most of the acts, but for certain others, particularly the Who and Hendrix, to film as much of the sets as possible. As a result, only one song was not captured in part at least from both acts&#x27; performances.

Big Brother&#x27;s scheduled set was not filmed because of a disagreement. However, due to the huge reaction the band got, they were asked to return to play two songs on Sunday, to be filmed specifically for the movie.

An expanded version of the documentary has been released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection.

The audio recordings of the festival eventually became the basis for many albums, most notably the 1970 release &quot;Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival&quot; featuring partial sets by Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix. Other releases recorded at the festival included dedicated live albums by in 1967 and Jefferson Airplane in 1991. In 1992, a four-CD box set was released featuring performances by most of the artists; various other compilations have been released over the years. According to a radio promotional feature that accompanied the box-set release, on modified stages, including flatbed Kaleidscope (LA) trucks, set up in the surrounding environs, there had been several spontaneous jam sessions for the overflow crowds and campers. Among them was one at the Monterey Peninsula Community College sports stadium (right across the Hwy. 1 interchange), where Jimi Hendrix, flanked by Jorma Kaukonen and John Cipollina, played for an enthusiastic audience.

<doc id="362816" wikidata="Q712724" url="?curid=362816" title="Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)">
<text>Article 58 of the Russian SFSR Penal Code was put in force on 25 February 1927 to prosecute those suspected of counter-revolutionary activities. It was revised several times. In particular, its Article 58-1 was updated by the listed sub-articles and put in force on 8 June 1934.

This article introduced the formal notion of the enemy of workers: those subject to articles 58-2 — 58-13 (those under 58-1 were &quot;traitors&quot;, 58-14 were &quot;saboteurs&quot;).

Penal codes of other republics of the Soviet Union also had articles of similar nature.

==Summary==
Note: In this section, the phraseology of article 58 is given in quotes.

The article covered the following offenses.

*58-1: Definition of counter-revolutionary activity: 
A counter-revolutionary action is any action aimed at overthrowing, undermining or weakening of the power of workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; Soviets... and governments of the USSR and Soviet and autonomous republics, or at the undermining or weakening of the external security of the USSR and main economical, political and national achievements of the proletarian revolution

It was not limited to anti-Soviet acts: by &quot;international solidarity of workers&quot;, any other &quot;worker&#x27;s state&quot; was protected by this article.
**58-1а. Treason: death sentence or 10 years of prison, both cases with property confiscation.
**58-1б. Treason by military personnel: death sentence with property confiscation.
**58-1в. In the case of flight of the offender in treason subject to 58-1б (military personnel only), his relatives were subject to 5–10 years of imprisonment with confiscation or 5 years of Siberia exile, depending on the circumstances: either they helped or knew and did not report or simply lived with the offender. 
**58-1г. Non-reporting of a treason by a military man: 10 years of imprisonment. Non-reporting by others: offense by Article 58-12.
*58-2. Armed uprising or intervention with the goal to seize the power: up to death with confiscation, including formal recognition as &quot;enemy of workers&quot;.
*58-3. Contacts with foreigners &quot;with counter-revolutionary purposes&quot; (as defined by 58-1) are subject to Article 58-2.
*58-4. Any kind of help to &quot;international bourgeoisie&quot; which, not recognizing the equality of communist political system, strives to overthrow it: punishment similar to 58-2.
*58-5. Urging any foreign entity to declaration of war, military intervention, blockade, capture of state property, breaking diplomatic relations, breaking international treaties, and other aggressive actions against USSR: similar to 58-2.
*58-6. Espionage. Punishment: similar to 58-2.
*58-7. Undermining of state industry, transport, monetary circulation or credit system, as well as of cooperative societies and organizations, with counter-revolutionary purpose (as defined by 58-1) by means of the corresponding usage of the state institutions, as well as by opposing their normal functioning: same as 58-2. &quot;Note: the offense according to this article was known as wrecking and the offenders were called &quot;wreckers&quot;.&quot;
*58-8. Terrorist acts against representatives of Soviet power or of workers and peasants organisations: same as 58-2.
*58-9. Damage of transport, communication, water supply, warehouses and other buildings or state and communal property with counter-revolutionary purpose: same as 58-2.
*58-10. Anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation: at least 6 months of imprisonment. In the conditions of unrest or war: same as 58-2.
*58-11. Any kind of organisational or support actions related to the preparation or execution of the above crimes is equated to the corresponding offenses and prosecuted by the corresponding articles.
*58-12. Non-reporting of a &quot;counter-revolutionary activity&quot;: at least 6 months of imprisonment.
*58-13. Active struggle against revolutionary movement of tsarist personnel and members of &quot;counter-revolutionary governments&quot; during the civil war, same as 58-2.
*58-14 (added on June 6, 1927) &quot;Counter-revolutionary sabotage&quot;, i.e., conscious non-execution or deliberately careless execution of &quot;defined duties&quot;, aimed at the weakening of the power of the government and of the functioning of the state apparatus is subject to at least one year of freedom deprivation, and under especially aggravating circumstances, up to the highest measure of social protection: execution by shooting with confiscation of property.

==Application==

Sentences were long, up to 25 years, and frequently extended indefinitely without trial or consultation. Inmates under Article 58 were known as &quot;politichesky&quot; (полити́ческий, short for полити́ческий заключённый, &quot;politichesky zakliuchonny&quot; or &quot;political prisoner&quot;), as opposed to common criminals, &quot;ugolovnik&quot; (уголо́вник). Often prisoners would be released without the right to settle within 100 km of large cities.

Section 10 of Article 58 made &quot;propaganda and agitation against the Soviet Union&quot; a triable offence, whilst section 12 allowed for onlookers to be prosecuted for not reporting instances of section 10. In effect, Article 58 was carte blanche for the secret police to arrest and imprison anyone deemed suspicious, making for its use as a political weapon.

Article 58 was applied to Soviet citizens outside the USSR as well. In the Soviet occupation zone of Germany people were interned as &quot;spies&quot; for suspected opposition to the Stalinist regime, e.g. for contacts with organizations based in the Western occupation zones, on the basis of Article 58 of the Soviet penal code. In the NKVD special camp in Bautzen, 66% of the inmates fell into this category.

==Evolution==
After the denunciation of Stalinism by Nikita Khrushchev the code was significantly rewritten. 

==Application of the article==
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his 1973 book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; characterized the enormous scope of the article in this way:

One can find more epithets in praise of this article than Turgenev once assembled to praise the Russian language, or Nekrasov to praise Mother Russia: great, powerful, abundant, highly ramified, multiform, wide sweeping 58, which summed up the world not so much through the exact terms of its sections as in their extended dialectical interpretation.Who among us has not experienced its all-encompassing embrace? In all truth, there is no step, thought, action, or lack of action under the heavens which could not be punished by the heavy hand of Article 58.

According to Solzhenitsyn, &quot;The paragraph 58 had no minimum of age! So was it even told at the lectures on law held for the people — Tallinn, 1945. Dr Uusmaa had known a six year old boy, who was in the colony on the ground of paragraph 58 — this is obviously a record!&quot;

==Analogs in other Union republics==
In Ukraine the article corresponded to Article 54 (UkrSSR Penal Code), in Belarus – Article 63 (BSSR Penal Code).

*Soviet law, NKVD troika

<doc id="362817" wikidata="Q682484" url="?curid=362817" title="Citizens Party (United States)">
<text>The Citizens Party was a political party in the United States. It was founded in Washington, D.C., by Barry Commoner, who aimed to gather under one banner a nationwide political organization of progressive, environmentalist and liberal groups, many of which were unsatisfied with President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration, for the first time since the dissolution of the national Progressive Party in the 1960s. The Citizens Party registered with the Federal Election Commission at the end of 1979. Commoner, a professor of environmental science at Washington University in St. Louis, was the head of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems in St. Louis, Missouri and editor of &quot;Science Illustrated&quot; magazine.

The Citizens Party platform was very progressive, pro-science, and environmentalist. Some have claimed that it was possibly socialist as well, but this claim arose from a misunderstanding of the economic democracy platform of the party, which appears to be a form of corporatism. Commoner repeatedly espoused opposition to socialism for parts of the economy other than essential infrastructure. His economic democracy idea stated that the business of business is to do business, but that the business of government is to regulate business to prevent abuses.

In all, the party was founded around four essential platforms, including economic democracy.
==History==

===1980 election cycle===
The first Citizens Party National Convention met in Cleveland, Ohio, in the Cleveland Plaza Hotel from April 10 to 13, 1980. There were 260 delegates from 30 states present. The &quot;proposals presented at the convention reportedly numbered some 300 items, a list largely irreducible to a manageable platform ... Units of the party organization on the state level thus became more or less responsible for delineating their own briefer versions of the list of goals&quot; (Kruschke, p. 46). The party nominated Barry Commoner and LaDonna Harris (then, at that time, the wife of Democratic senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma) for president and vice president respectively. La Donna Harris was &quot;a leading feminist and a Comanche Indian [who] labeled herself as &#x27;a woman of color.&#x27;&quot;

In order to increase public awareness of its existence, the Citizens Party ran a commercial on 600 radio stations which used profanity (the advertisement began with an actor exclaiming: &quot;Bullshit! ... Carter, Reagan and Anderson, it&#x27;s all bullshit!&quot;). Several of the radio stations tried to remove the profanity, but the Federal Communications Commission forbade them to do so.

As the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1980, Commoner achieved ballot status in 29 states (22 and DC under the Citizens Party label, six as an Independent, and in Pennsylvania with the Consumer Party), although his major activity was centered in the large states of California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania.

In addition to the national ticket in the presidential election, twenty-two other Citizens candidates appeared on the ballot in various states, including three for the U.S. Senate and eleven for the U.S. House. Commoner received 221,083 votes. Although Commoner did not garner more than one percent in any state, the party received enough support to be the first minor party to qualify for federal matching funds (about $157,000) for the 1984 elections.

===1982 election cycle===
In 1981, the Citizens Party won an election for the first time when Terry Bouricius was elected to the board of Aldermen in Burlington, Vermont. In 1982, the Citizens Party fielded two candidates for governorships (Pennsylvania and Texas), three candidates for the Senate (Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont), and 15 candidates for the U.S. House.

===1984 election cycle===
In 1984, the Citizens Party held its second national convention at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, from August 10 to 12, 1984. There were 125 delegates from 30 states present. The convention nominated Sonia Johnson of Virginia, “a radical feminist,” for president and Richard Walton of Rhode Island for vice president. Johnson had been excommunicated from the LDS Church in 1979 as a result of her outspoken support of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1982 Johnson undertook a publicized 37-day fast which was meant to encourage the Illinois legislature to ratify the ERA.

Two other minor parties endorsed the Citizens ticket in 1984. The Socialist Party USA National Convention in New York City from September 3 to 5, 1983 voted to try to run a joint ticket with the Citizens Party, and the Peace and Freedom Party in California endorsed Johnson for president (although it ran Emma Wong Mar for vice president).

Despite the two additional endorsements, the Citizens Party suffered serious setbacks during 1984. It ran fewer candidates for office: one for the Senate (Illinois), one for Governor (Vermont), and two for the U.S. House. Johnson appeared on the ballot in thirteen states as the Citizens candidate, two as an Independent, one (Arkansas) as the Citizens Group nominee, and one (Pennsylvania) as the Consumer nominee. The Citizens Party vote fell by two thirds, to 72,153, although Johnson significantly improved upon Commoner&#x27;s totals in Pennsylvania and Louisiana.

===1986 election cycle and party dissolution===
In the 1986 election, the Citizens Party once again offered four candidates: two for governor (Pennsylvania and Rhode Island), one for the Senate (Pennsylvania), and one for the U.S. House (Minnesota). The Pennsylvania candidates used the Consumer Party label.

After the disappointing number of votes cast in favor of the Citizens Party nominees, it dissolved. The 1987 Socialist Party National Convention nominated its own ticket of Willa Kenoyer (a former co-chair of the Citizens Party) and Ron Ehrenreich for the 1988 presidential election, while the Consumer Party in Pennsylvania resumed its separate existence, picking up the remaining pieces of the Citizens Party.

<text>Karl Georg Büchner (17 October 1813 – 19 February 1837) was a German dramatist and writer of poetry and prose, considered part of the Young Germany movement. He was also a revolutionary and the brother of physician and philosopher Ludwig Büchner. His literary achievements, though few in number, are generally held in great esteem in Germany and it is widely believed that, had it not been for his early death, he might have joined such central German literary figures as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller at the summit of their profession.

== Life and career ==
Born in Goddelau (now part of Riedstadt) in the Grand Duchy of Hesse as the son of a physician, Büchner attended the Darmstadt gymnasium, a humanistic secondary school.

In 1828, he became interested in politics and joined a circle of William Shakespeare aficionados, which later on probably became the Giessen and Darmstadt section of the Society for Human Rights ().

In 1831, at age 18, he began to study medicine in Strasbourg. In Strasbourg, he immersed himself in French literature and political thought. He was influenced by the utopian communist theories of François-Noël Babeuf and Claude Henri de Saint-Simon. In 1833 he moved to Giessen and continued his studies at the local university.

While Büchner continued his studies in Giessen, he established a secret society dedicated to the revolutionary cause. In July 1834, with the help of evangelical theologian Friedrich Ludwig Weidig, he published the leaflet &quot;Der Hessische Landbote&quot;, a revolutionary pamphlet critical of social injustice in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The authorities charged them with treason and issued a warrant for their arrest. Weidig was arrested, tortured and later died in prison in Darmstadt; Büchner managed to flee across the border to Strasbourg where he wrote most of his literary work and translated two French plays by Victor Hugo, &quot;Lucrèce Borgia&quot; and &quot;Marie Tudor&quot;. Two years later, his medical dissertation, &quot;Mémoire sur le Système Nerveux du Barbeaux (Cyprinus barbus L.)&quot; was published in Paris and Strasbourg. In October 1836, after receiving his M.D. and being appointed by the University of Zürich as a lecturer in anatomy, Büchner relocated to Zürich where he spent his final months writing and teaching until his death from typhus at the age of twenty-three. 
His first play, &quot;Dantons Tod&quot; (&quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;), about the French Revolution, was published in 1835, followed by &quot;Lenz&quot; (first partly published in Karl Gutzkow&#x27;s and Wienberg&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Revue&quot;, which was quickly banned). &quot;Lenz&quot; is a novella based on the life of the Sturm und Drang poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. In 1836 his second play, &quot;Leonce and Lena&quot;, satirized the nobility. His unfinished and most famous play, &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, exists only in fragments and was published posthumously.

==Legacy==
By the 1870s, Büchner was nearly forgotten in Germany when Karl Emil Franzos edited his works; these later became a major influence on the naturalist and expressionist movements. Arnold Zweig described &quot;Lenz&quot;, Büchner&#x27;s only work of prose fiction, as &quot;the beginning of modern European prose&quot;.

The play &quot;Woyzeck&quot; became the basis for many adaptations including Alban Berg&#x27;s landmark atonal opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; which premiered in 1925, and Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (see main article, &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, for a full list). &quot;Woyzeck&quot; has been included in the curriculum for students in grade 12 in Germany.

A German literary Georg Büchner Prize is awarded annually. It was created in 1923.

<doc id="362823" wikidata="Q1189460" url="?curid=362823" title="Large format">
<text>Large format photography refers to any imaging format of or larger. Large format is larger than &quot;medium format&quot;, the or size of Hasselblad, Mamiya, Rollei, Kowa, and Pentax cameras (using 120- and 220-roll film), and much larger than the frame of 35 mm format.

The main advantage of a large format, film or digital, is a higher resolution at the same pixel pitch, or the same resolution with larger pixels or grains which allows each pixel to capture more light enabling exceptional low-light capture. A 4×5 inch image (12.903 mm²) has about 15 times the area, and thus 15 times the total resolution, of a 35 mm frame (864 mm²).

Large format cameras were some of the earliest photographic devices, and before enlargers were common, it was normal to just make 1:1 contact prints from a 4×5, 5×7, or 8×10-inch negative.

==Formats==
The most common large format is , which was the size used by cameras like the Graflex Speed Graphic and Crown Graphic, among others. Less common formats include quarter-plate (), , and ; the size of many old 1920s Kodak cameras (various versions of Kodak 1, 2, and 3 and Master View cameras, to much later Sinar monorail studio cameras) are , , , various panoramic or &quot;banquet&quot; formats (such as and inches ( and  cm), and metric formats, including , , and and assorted old and current aerial image formats of , (K17, K18, K19, K22 etc.), using roll film of 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10 inches width or, view cameras (including pinhole cameras), reproduction/process cameras, and x-ray film.

Above inches, the formats are often referred to as Ultra Large Format (ULF) and may be , , or inches or as large as film, plates, or cameras are available. Many large formats (e.g., , , and inches) are horizontal cameras designed to make big negatives for contact printing onto press-printing plates.

The Polaroid 20×24 camera is one of the largest format instant cameras in common usage and can be hired from Polaroid agents in various countries. Many well-known photographers have used the , wheeled-chassis Polaroid.

==Control==

Most, but not all, large format cameras are view cameras, with fronts and backs called &quot;standards&quot; that allow the photographer to better control rendering of perspective and increase apparent depth of field. Architectural and close-up photographers in particular benefit greatly from this ability. These allow the front and back of the camera to be &quot;shifted&quot; up/down and left/right (useful for architectural images where the scene is higher than the camera, and produces images where the scene is lower than the camera), and &quot;tilted&quot; out of parallel with each other left/right, up/down, or both; based on the Scheimpflug principle. The shift and tilt movements make it possible to solve otherwise impossible depth-of-field problems, and to change perspective rendering, and create special effects that would be impossible with a conventional fixed-plane fixed-lens camera.

Ansel Adams&#x27; photographs, and those of the other Group f/64 photographers, demonstrate how the use of front (lens plane) and back (film plane) adjustments can secure great apparent depth of field when using the movements available on large format view cameras.

==Operation==
A number of actions need to be taken to use a typical large format camera, resulting in a slower, often more contemplative, photographic style. For example, film loading using sheet film holders requires a dark space to load and unload the film, typically a changing bag or darkroom, although prepackaged film magazines and large format roll films have also been used in the past.

A tripod is typically used for view camera work, but some models are designed for hand-held use. These &quot;technical cameras&quot; have separate viewfinders and rangefinders for faster handling.

In general large format camera use, the scene is composed on the camera&#x27;s ground glass, and then a film holder is fitted to the camera back prior to exposure. A separate Polaroid back using instant film is used by some photographers, allowing previewing of the composition, correctness of exposure and depth of field before committing the image to film to be developed later. Failure to &quot;Polaroid&quot; an exposure risks discovery later, at the time of film development, that there was an error in camera setup.

==Uses==
The 4×5 inch sheet film format was very convenient for press photography since it allowed for direct contact printing on the printing plate, hence it was widely used in press cameras. This was done well into the 1940s and 1950s, even with the advent of more convenient and compact medium format or 35 mm roll-film cameras which started to appear in the 1930s. The 35 mm and medium format SLR which appeared in the mid-1950s were soon adopted by press photographers.

Large format photography is not limited to film; large digital camera backs are available to fit large format cameras. These are either medium-format digital backs adapted to fit large format cameras (sometimes resulting in cropped images), step and repeat Multishot systems, or scanning backs (which scan the image area in the manner of a flat-bed scanner). Scanning backs can take seconds or even several minutes to capture an image. When using a Sinar Macroscan unit and 54H data files, over 1 gigabyte of data is produced.

Large format, both film-based and digital, is still used for many applications, such as landscape photography, advertising photos, fine-art photography, scientific applications and generally for images that will be enlarged to a high magnification while requiring a high level of detail. High quality fine art prints can be made at sizes in the range of 40x50″ from a 4×5″ original, and well beyond that for larger negatives.

In the printing industry, very large fixed cameras were also used to make large films for the preparation of lithographic plates before computer to film and computer to plate techniques were introduced. These are generally referred to as a &quot;process camera&quot; and consist of vertically mounted models for smaller work and horizontal units mounted on rails for very large works such as maps and plans.

===National Park Service documentation programs===
Large format film is also used to create a record of historic places and things for the National Park Service documentation programs. The Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), and the Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS) require large format film-based photography. 4×5″, 5×7″, and 8×10″ large format film formats are the only acceptable formats for inclusion in these collections at the Library of Congress. 4x5 and 5x7 are generally used in the field (5×7″ is preferred for very significant buildings) and 8×10″ is generally used for photo-duplication of historic photographs, documents and blueprints. Through HABS/HAER/HALS, buildings and sites of historic significance are recorded with large format cameras and black and white film and using techniques that document the key features of the historic resource with special care not to distort the angles and views. This rectified photography can be accomplished with large format cameras by keeping the film, lens and subject perfectly parallel. Smaller format cameras need to be tilted to view high or low subjects, but the same subjects can be captured by shifting the lens element of a large format camera up or down to keep the film, lens, and subject planes parallel.

HABS, HAER, and HALS also requires the increased resolution of large format film. A sheet of 5×7″ film has almost twice the resolution of 4×5″ film, and 4×5″ is almost 16 times larger than a 35 mm film image (24×36 mm). This added negative size not only allows for more detail, but the large format polyester film is also far more durable than acetate 35 mm stock. HABS, HAER, and HALS require that all submissions to the Library of Congress include the original film (archivally washed) and it must also include contact prints on fiber-based paper; these contacts are the same size as the film being submitted, 4×5″, 5×7″, or 8×10″, and the large size allows people to readily see the prints, while 35 mm contacts would be too small and would require magnification.

<doc id="362827" wikidata="Q7451774" url="?curid=362827" title="Separate Baptists">
<text>The Separate Baptists are a group of Baptists originating in the 18th-century United States, primarily in the South, that grew out of the Great Awakening.

The Great Awakening was a religious revival and revitalization of piety among the Christian churches. It covered English-speaking countries and swept through the American colonies between the 1730s and the 1770s. Three important preachers of the times were Gilbert Tennent (1703–65), Jonathan Edwards (1703–58), and George Whitefield (1714–70). The Separate Baptists are most directly connected to Whitefield&#x27;s influence. The first identifiable congregation of Separate Baptists was formed in Boston, Massachusetts. Whitefield preached in Boston in 1740. The pastor of the Baptist church disapproved of the revival excitement, while several members approved of it and became discontented with the pastor&#x27;s ministry. They withdrew from the First Baptist Church and formed Second Baptist Church in 1743.

The Great Awakening served to both invigorate and divide churches. Many denominations divided into Old Lights — holding a low view of the revivalism, and sometimes directly opposing it — and &quot;New Lights&quot; — who enthusiastically embraced it. Many New Lights felt that the old ways had allowed too many unconverted church members, and by the end of the 1740s some of the New Lights believed the established churches could not be reformed from within and withdrew from them. A favorite verse among them was II Corinthians 6:17 — &quot;Come out from among them, and be ye separate.&quot; This led to them being called &quot;Separate&quot;.

A growing body of Separate Baptists began in New England. They were zealous in evangelism and held to heart-felt religion. The most prominent New England pastor and congregation was Isaac Backus (1724–1808) and the church at Middleborough, Massachusetts. Backus was raised a Congregationalist and became a New Light (or Separatist) Congregational pastor in 1748. After conversion to Baptist views on the doctrine of baptism, Backus and others formed a Baptist congregation in 1756. Backus was very active in the fight for religious liberty in America. The Separate Baptists of New England were never truly a separate group from the Regular Baptists. It would remain for the Separate Baptists in the South to develop along distinct lines.

In 1745 Shubal Stearns (1706–71), a member of the Congregational church in Tolland, Connecticut, heard evangelist George Whitefield. Stearns was converted and adopted the Awakening&#x27;s view of revival and conversion. Stearns&#x27; church became involved in a controversy over the proper subjects of baptism in 1751. Soon Stearns rejected infant baptism and sought baptism at the hands of Wait Palmer, Baptist minister of Stonington, Connecticut. By March, Shubal Stearns was ordained into the ministry by Palmer and Joshua Morse, the pastor of New London, Connecticut. The next twenty years of Stearns&#x27; remarkable ministry is inextricably intertwined with the rise and expansion of the Separate Baptists.

In 1754, Stearns moved south to Opequon, Virginia. Here he joined Daniel Marshall and wife Martha (Stearns&#x27; sister), who were already active in a Baptist church there. On November 22, 1755, Stearns and his party moved further south to Sandy Creek, in Guilford County, North Carolina. This party consisted of eight men and their wives, mostly relatives of Stearns. Stearns pastored at Sandy Creek until his death. From there, Separate Baptists spread in the South. The church quickly grew from 16 members to 606. Church members moved to other areas and started other churches. The Sandy Creek Association was formed in 1758. Morgan Edwards, Baptist minister and historian contemporary with Stearns, recorded that, &quot;in 17 years, [Sandy Creek] has spread its branches westward as far as the great river Mississippi; southward as far as Georgia; eastward to the sea and Chesopeck [sic] Bay; and northward to the waters of the Pottowmack [sic]; it, in 17 years, is become mother, grandmother, and great grandmother to 42 churches, from which sprang 125 ministers.&quot;

For a time these Baptists remained somewhat distinct from the Regular Baptists. They were in the main in agreement with the Regulars, but holding to some minor points of difference. According to Edwards, &quot;These are called Separates, not because they withdrew from the Regular-baptists but because they have hitherto declined any union with them. The faith and order of both are the same, except some trivial matters not sufficient to support a distinction, but less a disunion; for both avow the Century-Confession and the annexed discipline.&quot;

One distinction was in the number of ordinances or rites observed by the Separates. The nine rites were baptism, the Lord&#x27;s supper, love feasts, laying on of hands, washing feet, anointing the sick, the right hand of fellowship, kiss of charity, and devoting children. Not all the churches practiced all nine of these, but most churches practiced more than the two ordinances generally held by the Regular Baptists — baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper.

With the exception of the Separate Baptists in Christ, the denominational name &quot;Separate Baptist&quot; disappeared in many areas of the country with the formal and informal agreements of union between the Regular Baptists and Separate Baptists, beginning in Virginia in 1787, in the Carolinas in 1789, and in Kentucky in 1797 &amp; 1801. As recorded by Benedict, the conclusion of the terms of union in Virginia stated, &quot;...we are united, and desire hereafter, that the names Regular and Separate be buried in oblivion; and that from henceforth, we shall be known by the name of the United Baptist Churches, in Virginia.&quot;

Descendants of the Separate Baptists include the Separate Baptists in Christ, Landmark Missionary Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Southern Baptists, United Baptists, and The General Association of Baptists.

Separate Baptists are particularly visible in Kentucky, where a member of the denomination, Vernie McGaha of Russell Springs, served in the state senate.

<doc id="362828" wikidata="Q355237" url="?curid=362828" title="Bruno Latour">
<text>Bruno Latour (; ; 22 June 1947 – 9 October 2022) was a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist. He was especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS). After teaching at the École des Mines de Paris (Centre de Sociologie de l&#x27;Innovation) from 1982 to 2006, he became professor at Sciences Po Paris (2006–2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. He was also a Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics.

Latour is best known for his books &quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot; (1991; English translation, 1993), &quot;Laboratory Life&quot; (with Steve Woolgar, 1979) and &quot;Science in Action&quot; (1987). Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with social constructionist approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour diverged significantly from such approaches. He was best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice. Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.
Along with Michel Callon, Madeleine Akrich, and John Law, Latour is one of the primary developers of actor–network theory (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the generative semiotics of Algirdas Julien Greimas, and (more recently) the sociology of Émile Durkheim&#x27;s rival Gabriel Tarde.

==Biography==
Latour was related to a well-known family of winemakers from Burgundy known as Maison Louis Latour, but was not associated with the similarly named Château Latour estate in Bordeaux.

As a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy. In 1971–1972, he ranked second and then first (&quot;reçu second, premier&quot;) in the French national competitive exam /&quot;CAPES de philosophies&quot;. Latour went on to earn his PhD degree in philosophical theology at the University of Tours in 1975. His thesis title was &quot;Exégèse et ontologie: une analyse des textes de resurrection&quot; (&quot;Exegesis and Ontology: An Analysis of the Texts of Resurrection&quot;). 

Latour developed an interest in anthropology, and undertook fieldwork in Ivory Coast, on behalf of ORSTOM, which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations. In the 1990s, he engaged in a series of dialogues with Michel Serres that were published as &quot;Eclaircissements (Conversations on Science, Culture and Time)&quot;.

After spending more than twenty years (1982–2006) at the Centre de sociologie de l&#x27;innovation at the École des Mines in Paris, Latour moved in 2006 to Sciences Po, where he was the first occupant of a chair named for Gabriel Tarde. In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie in Karlsruhe, Germany, including &quot;Iconoclash&quot; (2002) and &quot;Making Things Public&quot; (2005). In 2005, he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.

Latour remained religious until the end of his life, reading the Bible &quot;devotedly.&quot;

Latour died from pancreatic cancer on 9 October 2022, at the age of 75. His papers were contributed to the French National Archives and the Municipal Archives of Beaune.

==Awards and honors==
On 22 May 2008, Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Université de Montréal on the occasion of an organizational communication conference held in honor of the work of James R. Taylor, on whom Latour has had an important influence. He held several other honorary doctorates, as well as France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;Honneur (2012).

===Holberg Prize===
On 13 March 2013, he was announced as the winner of the 2013 Holberg Prize. The prize committee stated that &quot;Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity, and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern, nature and society, human and non-human.&quot; The committee states that &quot;the impact of Latour&#x27;s work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science, art history, history, philosophy, anthropology, geography, theology, literature and law.&quot;

A 2013 article in &quot;Aftenposten&quot; by Norwegian philosopher Jon Elster criticised the conferment to Latour, by saying &quot;The question is, does he deserve the prize. ... If the statutes [of the award] had used new knowledge as the main criteria, instead as one of several, then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion.&quot;

===Spinoza and Kyoto Prize===
The Dutch &quot;International Spinozaprijs Foundation&quot; awarded the &quot;Spinozalens 2020&quot; to Bruno Latour on 24 November 2020.
In 2021 he received the Kyoto Prize in the category &quot;Thought and Ethics&quot;.

== Main works ==

===&quot;Laboratory Life&quot;===

After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of &quot;Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts&quot; with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book, the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the scientific method, in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard, they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are &quot;socially constructed&quot; within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices—in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society&quot; is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: &quot;Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.&quot;

Some of Latour&#x27;s position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour&#x27;s position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour&#x27;s hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly, philosopher John Searle argues that Latour&#x27;s &quot;extreme social constructivist&quot; position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently &quot;comical results&quot;.

===&quot;The Pasteurization of France&quot;===
After a research project examining the sociology of primatologists, Latour followed up the themes in &quot;Laboratory Life&quot; with &quot;Les Microbes: guerre et paix&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Pasteurization of France&quot; in 1988). In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France&#x27;s most famous scientists Louis Pasteur and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography. Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur&#x27;s career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted. By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur&#x27;s work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason.

===&quot;Aramis, or The Love of Technology&quot;===
&quot;Aramis, or The Love of Technology&quot; focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project. Aramis PRT (personal rapid transit), a high tech automated subway, had been developed in France during the 70s and 80s and was supposed to be implemented as a personal rapid transit system in Paris. It combined the flexibility of an automobile with the efficiency of a subway. Aramis was to be an ideal urban transportation system based on private cars in constant motion and the elimination of unnecessary transfers. This new form of transportation was intended to be as secure and inexpensive as collective transportation. The proposed system had custom-designed motors, sensors, controls, digital electronics, software and a major installation in southern Paris. But in the end the project died in 1987. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation. While investigating Aramis&#x27;s demise, Latour delineates the tenets of actor-network theory. According to Latour&#x27;s own description of the book, the work aims &quot;at training readers in the booming field of technology studies and at experimenting in the many new literary forms that are necessary to handle mechanisms and automatisms without using the belief that they are mechanical or automatic.&quot;

===&quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot;===
Latour&#x27;s work &quot;Nous n&#x27;avons jamais été modernes : Essai d&#x27;anthropologie symétrique&quot; was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as &quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot;.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape. He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the scientific method to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over postmodernism, modernism, or antimodernism. His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives. Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake. He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past. Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real. In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other. Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato. He refused the concept of &quot;out there&quot; versus &quot;in here&quot;. He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference. Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different to that of post-moderns. He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.

In 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour&#x27;s politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is &quot;a fanciful escape from modern Western history&quot;.

===&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot;===
&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in &quot;Science in Action&quot; and &quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot;. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with pedologists in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: &quot;The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice&quot; (p. 24). Some authors have criticized Latour&#x27;s methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Katherine Pandora states:

&quot;[Latour&#x27;s] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)&quot;.

In addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot;. Two of the chapters draw on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot; as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:

&quot;It is hard not to be caught up in the author&#x27;s obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well.&quot;

Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot;. In Felix Stalder&#x27;s article &quot;Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism&quot;, he summarizes Latour&#x27;s position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: &quot;These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them&quot;.

===&quot;Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?&quot;===
In a 2004 article, Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, &quot;Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?&quot; He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: &quot;our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget.&quot; (p. 231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace empiricism, to insist on the &quot;cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude – to speak like William James&quot;. (p. 233)

Latour suggests that about 90 per cent of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms &quot;the fact position and the fairy position.&quot; (p. 237) The fairy position is anti-fetishist, arguing that &quot;objects of belief&quot; (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the &quot;naive believer&quot;; the &quot;fact position&quot; argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p. 238) &quot;Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?&quot; asks Latour: no matter which position you take, &quot;You&#x27;re always right!&quot; (p. 238–239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use &quot;an unrepentant positivist&quot; approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as &quot;a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish.&quot; (p. 241) These inconsistencies and double standards go largely unrecognized in social critique because &quot;there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position.&quot; (p. 241)

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential &quot;critical barbarity&quot; that has—like a malign virus created by a &quot;mad scientist&quot;—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including global warming deniers and the 9/11 Truth movement: &quot;Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.&quot; (p. 230)

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: &quot;The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution.&quot;

Latour&#x27;s article has been highly influential within the field of postcritique, an intellectual movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that seeks to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism. The literary critic Rita Felski has named Latour as an important precursor to the project of postcritique.

===&quot;Reassembling the Social&quot;===
In &quot;Reassembling the Social&quot; (2005), Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a &quot;practical metaphysics&quot;, which calls &quot;real&quot; anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action. So if someone says, &quot;I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors&quot; we are obliged to recognize the &quot;ontological weight&quot; of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God&#x27;s presence with &quot;social stuff&quot;, like class, gender, imperialism, etc. Latour&#x27;s nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: &quot;Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted.&quot;

For Latour, to talk about metaphysics or ontology—what really is—means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour&#x27;s description of metaphysics:

If we call metaphysics the discipline inspired by the philosophical tradition that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others. The question then becomes how to explore the actors&#x27; own metaphysics.

A more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are &quot;controversies over agencies&quot; – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour&#x27;s nuance: for Latour, there is no &quot;basic structure of reality&quot; or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or &quot;worlds&quot; in his terms, exists–one for each actor&#x27;s sources of agency, inspirations for action. In this Latour is remarkably close to B.F. Skinner&#x27;s position in Beyond Freedom and Dignity and the philosophy of Radical Behaviorism. Actors bring &quot;the real&quot; (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one &quot;basic structure&quot; that explains agency, but to recognize &quot;the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors&quot;. Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to relativism, Latour argues. The relativist researcher &quot;learns the actors&#x27; language,&quot; records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher &quot;structure&quot; to &quot;explain&quot; the actor&#x27;s motivations. The relativist &quot;takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying&quot; and &quot;follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what &#x27;makes them act&#x27;&quot;. The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.

== In the science wars ==

Alan Sokal, in his &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;, criticized Latour&#x27;s relativism by referring to an article written by Latour in &quot;La Recherche&quot; in 1998. In his reaction to research showing that the pharaoh Ramses II probably died of tuberculosis, Latour thought &quot;How could he pass away due to a bacillus discovered by Koch in 1882? ... Before Koch, the bacillus has no real existence.&quot; He says that it is as much of an anachronism as it would be to claim that the pharaoh died of machine-gun fire.

Latour noted that he had been asked &quot;Do you believe in reality?&quot;, which caused a &quot;quick and laughing answer&quot;. Reality, for Latour, is neither something we have to &quot;believe&quot; in nor do we have lost access to it in the first place. &quot;&#x27;Do you believe in reality?&#x27; To ask such a question one has to become so &quot;distant&quot; from reality that the fear of &quot;losing&quot; it entirely becomes plausible—and this fear itself has an intellectual history [...] Only a mind put in the strangest position, looking at a world &quot;from inside out&quot; and linked to the outside by nothing but the tenuous connection of the &quot;gaze&quot;, will throb in the constant fear of losing reality; only such a bodiless observer will desperately look for some absolute life-supporting survival kit.&quot;According to Latour, the originality of science studies lies in demonstrating that facts are both real and constructed. The accusation of a postmodern hostility to science, thus, not only fails to recognize that science studies aims at a more robust understanding how science is done in practice, but also shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the methods and insights of science studies. In fact, Latour has emphatically problematized the rise of anti-scientific thinking and so-called &quot;alternative facts&quot; For Latour, the recent attacks against climate sciences and other disciplines demonstrate that there is a real war on science going on requiring a more intimate cooperation between science and science studies.

<text>Cosgrove Hall Films was a British animation studio founded by Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall, headquartered in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. Cosgrove Hall was a major producer of children&#x27;s television and animated programmes/films, which are still seen in over eighty countries. The company was wound down by its then owner, ITV plc, on 26 October 2009. It was mainly known for its series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and &quot;Count Duckula&quot;.

==History==
===Stop Frame Productions===

Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall first met while both were students at Manchester College of Art and Design, which is now part of Manchester Metropolitan University. They later became co-workers at Granada Television, where they produced television graphics.

Hall left his job in 1969 and founded his own production company, Stop Frame Productions. Cosgrove joined the company shortly after its establishment. Their first projects, for Stop Frame, included public service films and television commercials for such companies as the &quot;TVTimes&quot;. From 1971 to 1972, the company released the animated series, &quot;The Magic Ball&quot;, which they created in a renovated shed located in the yard of Cosgrove&#x27;s father-in-law. Hall directed two animated productions for Stop Frame, &quot;Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo&quot;, which was released in 1972, and the television series, &quot;Noddy&quot;, which aired in 1975. The company also produced opening credits and graphics for children&#x27;s TV series such as &quot;Rainbow&quot; in 1972.

Stop Frame Productions halted production, and was closed in 1975.

===Cosgrove Hall Productions===
Following the closure of Stop Frame Productions, Cosgrove and Hall were able to find new work in animation, specifically due to their earlier work on the 1972 series &quot;Rainbow&quot;. The producer of &quot;Rainbow&quot;, Thames Television, an ITV franchisee, created a new subsidiary animation studio called Cosgrove Hall Productions in the following year, 1976. Thames hired and commissioned Cosgrove and Hall as lead animators to create new animated programmes, for this new studio, based on their earlier work with &quot;Rainbow&quot;. Another bit of Thames commissioned work was the title sequence for the 1974 feature film The Best Of Benny Hill for Thames Television and EMI Films. Thames Television also hired John Hambley as Cosgrove Hall Films&#x27; first executive producer. Its first series was &quot;Chorlton and the Wheelies&quot;, the lead role being named after the suburb of Manchester where the company was based (the other characters were placed on wheels as this made the stop-frame animation easier). The pop singer and musician Bernard Sumner worked for Cosgrove Hall from its founding until 1979 as a tracer.

&quot;Danger Mouse&quot; was one of the studio&#x27;s earliest international successes. The studio made 161 episodes between 1981 and 1992. In each one, Danger Mouse, the world&#x27;s greatest secret agent, and his well-meaning but useless sidekick, Penfold, outwit the evil Baron Silas Greenback and various scoundrels. In 1983, the studio made a 75-minute film, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, based on Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s classic story of the same name. It won a BAFTA award and an international Emmy award. Subsequently, the studio made a 52-episode TV series based on the characters between 1984 and 1990. All the music and songs for the feature and series were written by Keith Hopwood, late of Herman&#x27;s Hermits and Malcolm Rowe. The Stone Roses guitarist John Squire worked on this series. &quot;Count Duckula&quot; was a spoof on the Dracula legend; its title character is the world&#x27;s only vegetarian vampire. He aspires to be rich and famous. Originally he was a villain/henchman recurring in the &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; series, but got his own spin-off series in 1988 that rapidly became one of Cosgrove Hall&#x27;s most successful programmes, and a Cosgrove Hall staple to spin-off characters from each successive cartoon. Both shows also aired on Nickelodeon in the U.S. during the late 1980s, and were popular in the ratings for the channel. In 1989, the studio produced a full-length feature based on Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;The BFG&quot;.

&quot;Truckers&quot;, the first book in &quot;The Bromeliad&quot;, was the studio&#x27;s first collaboration with the best-selling author Terry Pratchett. The 1992 series follows the efforts of a group of nomes, whose spaceship crash-landed on Earth 15,000 years ago, to return home.
However, Cosgrove Hall Productions&#x27; days became numbered as on 31 December 1992, their financial backer and owner, Thames Television lost its ITV franchise and began divesting/closing its subsidiaries.
The studio downgraded its operations following Thames&#x27; loss of ITV franchise, and eventually closed doors in 1993.

===Cosgrove Hall Films===
On 15 November 1993, Anglia Television and HBO announced the re-opening of Cosgrove Hall Productions, albeit as Cosgrove Hall Films. The studio would be 75% owned by Anglia and HBO&#x27;s joint-venture Anglia Television Entertainment, while Cosgrove and Hall would hold the remaining 25%, with Anglia/HBO&#x27;s distribution arm ITEL holding international distribution to projects produced by the studio. Cosgrove Hall Films&#x27; first two projects were new episodes of both &quot;Avenger Penguins&quot; and &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Toyland Adventures&quot; (both of which began airing prior to the sudden shutdown and reopening). Cosgrove Hall Films also acquired the rights to produce new series based on existing Cosgrove Hall properties. However, Thames would retain the pre-1993 programming catalogue. Nearer the end of the 1990&#x27;s, ownership was placed under ITEL itself, with then-Anglia owners United News &amp; Media purchasing HBO&#x27;s stake in November 1999.

In 1997, Cosgrove Hall Films produced two series for Channel 4 based on &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; and &quot;Soul Music&quot;, two novels from Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series.

One of the studio&#x27;s specialities was producing programmes for young children, such as &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Toyland Adventures&quot;, &quot;Bill and Ben&quot;, and &quot;Andy Pandy&quot; for the BBC. The latter two series were based on classic characters from the 1950s. In the mid 2000s, Cosgrove Hall worked on a new version of &quot;Postman Pat&quot;. The studio also animated &quot;Ghosts of Albion&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s first fully animated webcast. Website visitors could learn about the production and help to develop the story. Cosgrove Hall produced &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; animated story for the BBC website. In 2006, they animated the missing first and fourth episodes of the Doctor Who serial &quot;The Invasion&quot; for a DVD release.

ITV started reducing its children&#x27;s department in 2006 and towards the end of 2008 it began winding down the operations of Cosgrove Hall. All except six staff were made redundant by ITV, and Cosgrove Hall moved &#x27;in house&#x27; to the Granada Television Studios in Manchester, ending over 30 years of the studio in Chorlton, with many ex staff moving to Chapman Entertainment. ITV said Cosgrove Hall currently had no work but believed “It is on the verge of a commission that will lead to the next recruitment drive.” However the UK was going thought its deepest recession and ITV 
was not interested in investing in Cosgrove Hall. A financial review decided that the company was no longer viable.

The company was again put under review by ITV plc in October 2009, being absorbed, and ceasing to exist a few months later. Cosgrove Hall was developing &quot;Theodore&quot;, a CGI-animated series, when ITV absorbed the company. Despite being absorbed, the company is still classified as an &quot;Active&quot; business on Companieshouse.

===Legacy===
The land occupied by Cosgrove Hall&#x27;s studios, in Albany Road, Chorlton, adjacent to the town&#x27;s telephone exchange, which had stood empty for two years, was finally sold in the summer of 2010 to a housing development company. The intention was to demolish the historic studios and build retirement flats. During 2012, the studios were eventually demolished as part of the above development. Urban explorers who visited the site during the demolition found and photographed some models and backgrounds used in previous productions. Coincidentally, during April of that year it was announced that during the past summer, prior to the death of Mark Hall, he and Brian Cosgrove had pitched the idea of resurrecting the brand to possible investors.

Brian Cosgrove became the executive producer at CHF Entertainment, (defunct 2019), as was Hall until his death. On 18 November 2011, Cosgrove Hall Films closed down due to Mark Hall’s death of cancer at the age of 75. CHF Entertainment had actively worked on a number of television series, including &quot;Pip Ahoy!&quot;, which was aimed at preschool children, and &quot;HeroGliffix&quot;, which was aimed at older children.

<text>Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow ( in Berlin – in Sachsenhausen) was a German writer notable in the Young Germany movement of the mid-19th century.

==Life==
Gutzkow was born of an extremely poor family, not proletarian, but of the lowest and most menial branch of state employees. His father held a clerkship in the war office in Berlin, and was pietistic and puritanical in his outlook and demands. Jacob Wittmer Hartmann speculates that Gutzkow&#x27;s later agnosticism was probably a reaction against the excessive religiosity of his early surroundings. After completing his basic studies, beginning in 1829 Gutzkow studied theology and philosophy at the University of Berlin, where his teachers included Hegel and Schleiermacher.

While still a student, he began his literary career by the publication in 1831 of a periodical entitled &quot;Forum der Journalliteratur&quot;. This brought him to the notice of Wolfgang Menzel, who invited him to Stuttgart to assist in the editorship of the &quot;Literaturblatt&quot;. At the same time he continued his university studies at Jena, Heidelberg and Munich. In 1832 he published &quot;Briefe eines Narren an eine Närrin&quot; anonymously in Hamburg; and in 1833 his novel &quot;Maha-Guru, Geschichte eines Gottes&quot;, a fantastic and satirical romance set in Tibet, was issued in Stuttgart by the well known publishing house. In 1835 he went to Frankfurt, where he founded the &quot;Deutsche Revue&quot;. While Gutzkow started out as a collaborator of Wolfgang Menzel, he ended up his adversary.

Also in 1835, his novel &quot;Wally die Zweiflerin&quot; appeared. News of the 1830 July Revolution at Paris had moved him deeply, and the general atmosphere of radicalism pervading Europe at that time, and perhaps more specifically a reading of the &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; by David Friedrich Strauss, influenced Gutzkow in the composition of this first novel, which exalts the agnosticism and emancipated views of the heroine, Wally. The work was directed specially against the institution of marriage and the belief in revelation. The book incorporates many ideas that Gutzkow had recently absorbed from French writers, notably Henri de Saint-Simon, particularly the latter&#x27;s theory of the emancipation of the flesh.

Immediately after its publication, the writings of Gutzkow, together with those of Heinrich Heine, Heinrich Laube, Ludolf Wienbarg and Theodor Mundt, were banned by the German Federal Assembly in December 1835. This is usually taken as the starting point of the school known as Young Germany, literary reformers heralding the democratic upheaval of 1848. Whatever interest Gutzkow&#x27;s novel might have attracted from its own merits was enhanced by the action of the German federal diet, which condemned Gutzkow to three months&#x27; imprisonment, decreed the suppression of all he had written or might yet write, and prohibited him from exercising the functions of editor within the German confederation.

During his term of imprisonment at Mannheim, Gutzkow wrote his treatise &quot;Zur Philosophie der Geschichte&quot; (1836). On obtaining his freedom he returned to Frankfurt, whence he went in 1837 to Hamburg. Here he inaugurated a new epoch of his literary activity by bringing out his tragedy &quot;Richard Savage&quot; (1839), which immediately made the round of all the German theatres. Of his numerous other plays, the majority by c. 1910 were neglected; but a few had obtained an established place in the repertory of the German theatre, especially the comedies &quot;Zopf und Schwert&quot; (1844), &quot;Das Urbild des Tartüffe&quot; (1847), &quot;Der Königsleutnant&quot; (1849) and the blank verse tragedy, &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; (1847). In 1847, Gutzkow went to Dresden, where he succeeded Tieck as literary adviser to the court theatre. Meanwhile, he had not neglected the novel. &quot;Seraphine&quot; (1838) was followed by &quot;Blasedow und seine Söhne&quot;, a satire on the educational theories of the time. Between 1850 and 1852 appeared &quot;Die Ritter vom Geiste&quot;, which may be regarded as the starting point for the modern German social novel. &quot;Der Zauberer von Rom&quot; is a powerful study of Roman Catholic life in southern Germany.
After the success of &quot;Die Ritter vom Geiste&quot;, Gutzkow founded a journal on the model of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Household Words&quot;, entitled &quot;Unterhaltungen am häuslichen Herd&quot;, which first appeared in 1852 and continued until 1862. In 1864 he had an epileptic seizure, and his theatrical powers began to diminish. To this period belong the historical novels &quot;Hohenschwangau&quot; (1868) and &quot;Fritz Ellrodt&quot; (1872), &quot;Lebensbilder&quot; (1870–1872), consisting of autobiographic sketches, and &quot;Die Söhne Pestalozzis&quot; (1870), with a plot founded on the story of Kaspar Hauser. After another epileptic episode Gutzkow journeyed to Italy in 1873, taking up residence in the country near Heidelberg on his return before moving again to Frankfurt, where he died on 16 December 1878.

With his play &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; and other works, Gutzkow stood up for the emancipation of the Jews; this play would later become the first classic play to be translated into Yiddish, and become a longtime standard of Yiddish theater. Gutzkow was never a revolutionary, and he became more conservative with age. He was one of the first Germans who tried to make a living by writing. His strong controversial purpose obscured his artistic genius, but his work profoundly influenced the popular thought of c. 1910 Germany, and gives one of the best pictures we have of the intellectual life and the social struggle of his generation and nation.

==Adaptations==
His comedy in 5 acts &quot;Zopf und Schwert&quot; (1844) received two adaptations; in 1926 Aafa-Film made the movie &quot;Sword and Shield&quot;, and Edmund Nick used it for his operetta &quot;Über alles siegt die Liebe&quot; (&quot;Love Conquers Everything&quot;, 1940), libretto by .

<text>Sforno is the name of a prominent Jewish Italian family, many members of which distinguished themselves as rabbis and scholars. The most prominent of these were the following:

== Hananeel ben Jacob Sforno ==
Scholar of Talmud. He lived at Bologna in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and was the brother of Obadiah Sforno, who mentions him in the introduction to his commentary on the Pentateuch. Obadiah also writes that Hananeel was a financier, and at one point, supported Obadiah financially. A &quot;responsum&quot; of Hananeel&#x27;s was inserted by Shabbethai Baer in his &quot;Beer Eshek&quot;.

== Israel Sforno ==
Talmudist; lived at Viadano in the sixteenth century. A &quot;halakhic&quot; decision of his is quoted in a manuscript collection of 260 &quot;responsa&quot; of the Italian rabbis (No. 235).

== Jacob ben Obadiah Sforno ==
Venetian scholar of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Shabbethai Bass, and, after him, Wolf, attributed to Jacob a work entitled &quot;Iggeret ha-Ṭe&#x27;amim&quot; (Venice, 1600), containing mystic explanations of the accents. The correctness of the ascription is, however, doubted by Steinschneider, who believes that this work is identical with one of the same title by Aaron Abraham ben Baruch.

== Nissim Isaac ben Judah Sforno ==
A rabbi at Mantua in the sixteenth century. He was the author of an epistle on the &quot;Kuzari&quot;. A &quot;responsum&quot; (legal &quot;novella&quot;) of his is quoted in the above-mentioned collection.

== Obadiah ben Israel Sforno ==
Venetian Talmudist of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He edited Menahem Azariah di Fano&#x27;s &quot;Yemin Adonai Romemah&quot; (Venice, n.d.); and a &quot;responsum&quot; of his is inserted in Di Fano&#x27;s collection of &quot;Responsa&quot; (Venice, n.d., p. 83).

== Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno ==
Italian exegete, philosopher, and physician; born at Cesena about 1475; died at Bologna in 1550. See the main article on him, Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno.

== Osheah ben Nissim Isaac Sforno ==
Rabbi at Mantua in the first half of the seventeenth century. A religious poem of his was inserted by Joseph Jedidiah Karmi in his &quot;Kenaf Renanim&quot;.

== Solomon Shmaya ben Nissim Isaac Sforno ==
Rabbi at Asti, later at Venice; died in 1617. Several &quot;responsa&quot; of his were inserted by Jacob Heilbronner in his &quot;Naḥalat Ya&#x27;aḳob&quot; (Padua, 1622). Solomon left in manuscript commentaries on &quot;Psalms&quot;, &quot;Proverbs&quot;, &quot;Job&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, the &quot;Megillot&quot;, &quot;Ezra&quot;, &quot;Nehemiah&quot;, and &quot;Chronicles&quot;. He edited the &quot;Cuzari&quot; with the commentary of Judah Moscato (Venice, 1594). On his death a funeral sermon was pronounced by Leon of Modena, who lauded him in the highest terms.

<doc id="362833" wikidata="Q1099587" url="?curid=362833" title="Jamie and the Magic Torch">
<text>Jamie and the Magic Torch is a British children&#x27;s animated television series made by Cosgrove Hall Productions for Thames Television and shown on the ITV network, running from 1977 to 1980.

The series was written and narrated by Brian Trueman, who later wrote shows such as &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; and &quot;Count Duckula&quot; for Cosgrove Hall.

==Premise==
The programme is based around the young boy of the title and his torch. When shone on the floor, the torch opens up a hole into a fun fantasy world called Cuckoo Land.

The beginning of each episode has Jamie&#x27;s mother tucking him into bed at night and saying, &quot;Sleep well, Jamie.&quot; Then from under his bed, his pet Old English Sheepdog, Wordsworth, appears, holding the torch in his mouth. Jamie takes the torch and shines it on the floor, opening up a portal to Cuckoo Land (in which Wordsworth always gets stuck). The portal manifests itself as a helter skelter.

When they reach the end of the slide, they fly out into Cuckoo Land from the bottom of a tree trunk, and land on a trampoline. All of this is accompanied by a song, written by Joe Griffiths. Once in Cuckoo Land, the fun begins.

==Characters in Cuckoo Land==
* Mr. Boo, who flies around in his &#x27;submachine&#x27;, obsessed with counting things.
* Officer Gotcha, who rides a unicycle and eats truncheons.
* Strumpers Plunkett, who plays melodies on his trumpet nose.
* Wellibob the cat, who does everything backwards and speaks with a Glaswegian accent.
* Jo-Jo Help the unhelpful handyman.
* Nutmeg the ragdoll, whose magical pocket can produce all kinds of items.
* The Yoo-hoo Bird, who plays tricks on and runs from Officer Gotcha.
* Bullybundy, the show business rabbit with oversized feet.
* Arthur, a robot (series 3 only).

==VHS releases==

The first two series have also been released on DVD, In 2024, all 3 series of the show were finally released on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray. In July 2024, all 3 series were made available via a premium subscription to the ITVX streaming service.

<doc id="362843" wikidata="Q1811124" url="?curid=362843" title="Saint Serf">
<text>Saint Serf or Serbán (&quot;Servanus&quot;) () is a saint of Scotland. Serf was venerated in western Fife. He is called the apostle of Orkney, with less historical plausibility. Saint Serf is connected with Saint Mungo&#x27;s Church near Simonburn, Northumberland (off the Bellingham Road, north of Chollerford). His feast day is 1 July.

==Legends==

David Hugh Farmer wrote that the legend of Serf is &quot;a farrago of wild impossibilities&quot; stating that Serf was the son of Eliud, King of Canaan, and his wife Alphia, daughter of a King of Arabia. Childless for a long time, they at last had two sons: the second was Serf. Serf came to Rome, carrying with him such a reputation for sanctity that he was elected and served as Pope for seven years.

He travelled to Gaul and Britain after vacating the Holy See, returning to Scotland. There, he met Adomnán, Abbot of Iona, who showed him an island in Loch Leven (later called St Serf&#x27;s Inch). At the time, this island was part of the Pictish kingdom of &quot;Fib&quot; (Fife). Serf founded the eponymous St Serf&#x27;s Inch Priory on the island, where he remained seven years. The priory was a community of Augustinian canons. It was founded from St. Andrews Cathedral Priory at the initiation of King David I of Scotland in 1150. From the 15th century onwards the priory began to be referred to as &quot;Portmoak&quot;. After more than four centuries of Augustinian monastic life, the first Protestant king of Scots, James VI of Scotland, granted the priory to St Leonard&#x27;s College, St Andrews. Today, there are only a small amount of remains left of the priory.

The centre of his ministry (and possibly of his activity) was Culross, which according to tradition, was founded by the saint. At Dunning, in Strathearn, he is said to have slain a dragon with his pastoral staff.

&quot;Finally, after many miracles, after divine virtues, after founding many churches, [Saint Serf], having given his peace to the brethren, yielded up his spirit in his cell at Dunning, on the first day of the Kalends of July; and his disciples and the people of the province take his body to Cuilenross [Culross], and there, with psalms and hymns and canticles, he was honourably buried.&quot;

===Serf and Mungo===
Saint Serf is said to have been a contemporary of Saint Mungo, also known as Saint Kentigern, though he could not have lived at the same time as both Adomnán and Mungo.

A legend states that when the British princess (and future saint) Theneva (Thenaw) became pregnant before marriage, her family threw her from a cliff. She survived the fall unharmed, and was soon met by an unmanned boat. She knew she had no home to go to, so she boarded the boat; it sailed her across the Firth of Forth to land at Culross where she was cared for by Saint Serf; he became foster-father of her son, Saint Kentigern (Saint Mungo).

Another legend states that Mungo restored a pet robin of Serf&#x27;s to life. The bird had been killed by some of his classmates who had planned to blame him for its death.see also dg wing

==Churches==
Saint Serf is a relatively common dedication for churches in Fife, Edinburgh and Central Scotland.

The name also attaches to schools in the area.

<text>Union Baptists is a Baptist Christian denomination in United States.

==History==
It trace their origin to the American Civil War, or war between the northern and southern United States. Baptist churches and associations, especially in border states, were rent asunder by this national conflict. Tensions over secession, war and reconstruction, as well as the fact that Primitive Baptists did not allow members to hold membership in secret societies, combined to incubate the &quot;Union Baptists&quot;. Many pro-Union Primitive Baptists joined Union Leagues, and were expelled from their churches and associations. The Mountain Union Association, formed in 1867 at Silas Creek church near Lansing, North Carolina, was the first &quot;Union&quot; Baptist association. The Mountain Union Association was instrumental in helping former slaves organize the &quot;New Covenant Association of Wilkes County&quot; in 1868.

This distinction, at least in name, has persisted in the Appalachias, and some churches and associations still consider themselves &quot;Union Baptists&quot;. There seems to be no doctrinal distinction between Union Baptists and Regular Baptists. The Union Baptists mirror many traits of other Appalachian primivistic sects, such as feet washing, river baptisms, and impromptu chanted sermons. But they are also less Calvinistic and more evangelical than groups such as Primitive Baptists and Old Regular Baptists, and promote Sunday Schools and revivals. Most of the churches do not use musical instruments (though some do), and singing is strictly congregational. The old practice of lining hymns is reserved for use preceding communion and feet washing.

Three associations - Original Mountain Union, Primitive and Union - have about 3300 members in 36 churches. The geographical distribution of these churches is in 8 counties in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

There are no known surviving distinct groups of &quot;Union&quot; Baptists in other border states.

<text>Thomas Sexton (July 3, 1957 – December 13, 1993) was a Canadian comedian. Born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, he was the youngest member of the &quot;CODCO&quot; comedy troupe.

Educated in St. John&#x27;s, he was an honours student before quitting after Grade 10 to pursue an acting career in Toronto. After briefly working on a children&#x27;s touring theatre show, he landed his first television role in the drama series &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;. Sexton and colleague Diane Olsen subsequently wrote &quot;Cod on a Stick&quot;, a comedic play which launched CODCO.

In 1975, Sexton took a brief sabbatical from CODCO to study at the Toronto Dance Theatre. He subsequently returned, working on other shows with CODCO and subsequently touring with colleague Greg Malone in two co-written works, &quot;The Wonderful Grand Band&quot; and &quot;Two Foolish to Talk About&quot;. In 1985 and 1986, Sexton and Malone wrote and performed in a series of television specials for the CBC, called &quot;The S and M Comic Book&quot;, which in turn led to CODCO landing its own series in 1988.

After CODCO&#x27;s run concluded in 1993, Sexton and Malone wrote and starred in a CBC television special, &quot;The National Doubt&quot;, satirizing the constitutional debates of the early 1990s. Sexton subsequently wrote a semi-autobiographical film, &quot;Adult Children of Alcoholics: The Musical&quot;, which was in production in November 1993 when Sexton, who was openly gay, fell ill due to complications from AIDS. He died on December 13 of that year.

Malone subsequently campaigned for HIV and AIDS education in Sexton&#x27;s memory. His sister, filmmaker Mary Sexton, produced a documentary film about him, &quot;Tommy...A Family Portrait&quot;, in 2001. Along with Malone and their &quot;CODCO&quot; co-star Andy Jones, Sexton was a posthumous recipient of the Earle Grey Award, the lifetime achievement award of Canadian television&#x27;s Gemini Awards, in 2002.

The Tommy Sexton Centre, a new assisted housing complex for people living with HIV and AIDS, was opened in St. John&#x27;s in 2006. In 2009, several drag queens in the city put together &quot;Ravishing in Red&quot;, a tribute show to Sexton, as a fundraiser for the Sexton Centre. One performer, Betty &quot;Boo&quot; Kakke, singled him out as Newfoundland&#x27;s &quot;clown prince&quot;.

Sexton&#x27;s mother, Sara Sexton, became a major figure in HIV/AIDS awareness in Newfoundland and Labrador following her son&#x27;s death. Sara Sexton was announced as an inductee to the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2013, and was inducted in February 2014. Sara Sexton died on February 28, 2020; in 2021, Mary Sexton and her son Nik Sexton released &quot;Me, Mom &amp; COVID&quot;, a documentary film about her life.

<text>The Daily Express is a national daily United Kingdom middle-market newspaper printed in tabloid format. Published in London, it is the flagship of Express Newspapers, owned by publisher Reach plc. It was first published as a broadsheet in 1900 by Sir Arthur Pearson. Its sister paper, the Sunday Express, was launched in 1918. In June 2022, it had an average daily circulation of 201,608.

Under the ownership of Lord Beaverbrook, the &quot;Express&quot; rose to become the newspaper with the largest circulation in the world, going from 2 million in the 1930s to 4 million in the 1940s. It was acquired by Richard Desmond&#x27;s company Northern &amp; Shell in 2000. Hugh Whittow was the editor from February 2011 until he retired in March 2018. In February 2018 Trinity Mirror acquired the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and other publishing assets of Northern &amp; Shell, in a deal worth £126.7 million. To coincide with the purchase the Trinity Mirror group changed the name of the company to &quot;Reach&quot;. Hugh Whittow resigned as editor and Gary Jones took over as editor-in-chief soon after the purchase.

The paper&#x27;s editorial stances have often been seen as aligned to Euroscepticism and supportive of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and other right-wing factions including the European Research Group (ERG) of the Conservative Party.

==History==
The &quot;Daily Express&quot; was founded in 1900 by Sir Arthur Pearson, with the first issue appearing on 24 April 1900. Pearson lost his sight to glaucoma in 1913, and sold the title to the future Lord Beaverbrook in 1916.

The &quot;Express&quot; was one of the first papers to place news instead of advertisements on its front page, and carried gossip, sport, and women&#x27;s features. It was also the first in Britain to have a crossword puzzle.

It began printing in Manchester in 1927. In 1931 it moved its London headquarters to 120 Fleet Street, a specially commissioned Art Deco building. Under Beaverbrook, the paper set newspaper sales records several times throughout the 1930s. Its success was partly due to aggressive marketing campaign and a circulation war with other populist newspapers. Arthur Christiansen became editor in October 1933. Under his direction sales climbed from two million in 1936 to four million in 1949. He retired in 1957. The paper also featured Alfred Bestall&#x27;s &quot;Rupert Bear&quot; cartoon and satirical cartoons by Carl Giles which it began publishing in the 1940s. On 24 March 1933, a front-page headline, &quot;Judea Declares War on Germany&quot; (because of the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933), was published.

During the late 1930s, the paper advocated the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s National Government, due to the influence of Lord Beaverbrook. On 7 August 1939, the front-page headline was &quot;NO WAR THIS YEAR&quot;. Less than a month later, Britain and France were at war with Nazi Germany following its invasion of Poland. The front page, floating in dirty water, later featured in &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;.

The ruralist and fascist author Henry Williamson wrote for the paper on many occasions over a span of half a century. He also wrote for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; at the beginning of his career.

In 1938, the publication moved to the Daily Express Building, Manchester (nicknamed the &quot;Black Lubyianka&quot;), designed by Owen Williams on the same site in Great Ancoats Street. It opened a similar building in Glasgow in 1936 in Albion Street. Glasgow printing ended in 1974 and Manchester in 1989 on the company&#x27;s own presses. Johnston Press has a five-year deal, begun in March 2015, to print the northern editions of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot;, &quot;Sunday Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot; at its Dinnington site in Sheffield. The Scottish edition is printed by facsimile in Glasgow by contract printers, the London editions at Westferry Printers.

In March 1962, Beaverbrook was attacked in the House of Commons for running &quot;a sustained vendetta&quot; against the British Royal Family in the &quot;Express&quot; titles. In the same month, the Duke of Edinburgh described the &quot;Express&quot; as &quot;a bloody awful newspaper. It is full of lies, scandal and imagination. It is a vicious paper.&quot; At the height of Beaverbrook&#x27;s control, in 1948, he told a Royal Commission on the press that he ran his papers &quot;purely for the purpose of making propaganda&quot;. The arrival of television, and the public&#x27;s changing interests, took their toll on circulation, and following Beaverbrook&#x27;s death in 1964, the paper&#x27;s circulation declined for several years. During this period, the &quot;Express&quot;, practically alone among mainstream newspapers, was vehemently opposed to entry into what became the European Economic Community.

Partially as a result of the rejuvenation of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; under David English and the emergence of &quot;The Sun&quot; under Rupert Murdoch and editorship of Larry Lamb, average daily sales of the &quot;Express&quot; dropped below four million in 1967, below three million in 1975, and below two million in 1984. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; switched from broadsheet to tabloid in 1977 (the &quot;Mail&quot; having done so six years earlier), and was bought by the construction company Trafalgar House in the same year. Its publishing company, Beaverbrook Newspapers, was renamed Express Newspapers. In 1982, Trafalgar House spun off its publishing interests to a new company, Fleet Holdings, under Lord Matthews, but this succumbed to a hostile takeover by United Newspapers in 1985. Under United, the &quot;Express&quot; titles moved from Fleet Street to Blackfriars Road in 1989.

Express Newspapers was sold to publisher Richard Desmond in 2000, and the names of the newspapers reverted to &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. In 2004, the newspaper moved to Lower Thames Street in the City of London. In February 2018, it moved into 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf.

On 31 October 2005, UK Media Group Entertainment Rights secured majority interest from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for Rupert Bear. They paid £6 million for a 66.6% control of the character. The &quot;Express&quot; retains minority interest of one-third plus the right to publish Rupert Bear stories in certain Express publications.

===Richard Desmond era===

In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by Richard Desmond, publisher of celebrity magazine &quot;OK!&quot;, for £125 million. Controversy surrounded the deal since Desmond also owned softcore pornography magazines. As a result, many staff left, including editor Rosie Boycott and columnist Peter Hitchens. Hitchens moved to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, saying working for the new owner was a moral conflict of interest since he had always attacked the pornographic magazines that Desmond published. Despite their divergent politics, Desmond respected Hitchens.

In 2007, Express Newspapers left the National Publishers Association due to unpaid fees. Since payments to the NPA fund the Press Complaints Commission, it is possible that the &quot;Express&quot; and its sister papers could cease being regulated by the PCC. The chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, which manages PCC funds, described Express Newspapers as a &quot;rogue publisher&quot;.

The Express group lost prominent libel cases in 2008–2009; it paid damages to people involved in the Madeleine McCann case (see below), a member of the Muslim Council of Britain, footballer Marco Materazzi, and sports agent Willie McKay. The losses led the media commentator Roy Greenslade to conclude that Express Newspapers (which also publishes the &quot;Star&quot; titles) paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000. Greenslade characterised Desmond as a &quot;rogue proprietor&quot;.

In late 2008, Express Newspapers began cutting 80 jobs to reduce costs by £2.5 million; however, too few staff were willing to take voluntary redundancy. In early 2008, a previous cost-cutting exercise triggered the first 24-hour national press strike in the UK for 18 years. In late August 2009 came plans for a further 70 redundancies, affecting journalists across Express Newspapers (including the &quot;Daily&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot;).

In August 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority criticised the company for advertorials as features alongside adverts for the same products. The ASA noted that the pieces were &quot;always and uniquely favourable to the product featured in the ads and contained claims that have been or were likely to be prohibited in advertisements&quot;.

In January 2010, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority over a front-page promotion for &quot;free&quot; fireworks. This led to comment that the &quot;Express&quot; has become &quot;the Ryanair of Fleet Street&quot;, in that it is a &quot;frequent offender&quot; which pays little heed to the ASA&#x27;s criticisms.

In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100 million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton.

On 31 December 2010, the Express, with all the media titles in Desmond&#x27;s Northern &amp; Shell group, were excluded from the Press Complaints Commission after withholding payment. Lord Black, chairman of PressBof, the PCC&#x27;s parent organisation, called this &quot;a deeply regrettable decision&quot;. According to &quot;Press Gazette&quot;, in December 2016 circulation figures showed gross sales of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; were 1,491,264 compared to 391,626 for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

The full run of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; has been digitised and is available at UK Press Online.

In September 2017, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; publisher Trinity Mirror announced its interest in buying all of Express Newspapers from Desmond. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; called it potentially the biggest change in the British newspaper industry for a decade.

===Reach era===
In February 2018, Trinity Mirror acquired the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and other publishing assets of Northern &amp; Shell, in a deal worth £126.7 million. To coincide with the purchase the Trinity Mirror group changed its name to &quot;Reach&quot;. Hugh Whittow resigned as editor and Gary Jones took over as editor-in-chief soon after the purchase.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; endorsed Liz Truss in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.

In 2023, Reach launched a US version of the Express, called the-express.com. It is based in New York City.

==&quot;Sunday Express&quot;==


The printing press of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; was first started by Lady Diana Manners on 29 December 1918. It was edited by Michael Booker from 2018 to 2021 when he left for GB News. Its circulation in December 2022 was 153,377.

==Controversies==

===John Bodkin Adams===
Suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams was arrested in 1956, accused of murdering up to 400 wealthy patients in Eastbourne. The press, &quot;egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty,&quot; except for Percy Hoskins, chief crime reporter for the &quot;Express&quot;. Hoskins was adamant that Adams was a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective, Herbert Hannam, whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases. The &quot;Express&quot;, under Hoskins&#x27;s direction, was the only major paper to defend Adams, causing Lord Beaverbrook to question Hoskins&#x27;s stance.

Adams was cleared in 1957 of the murder of Edith Alice Morrell (a second count was withdrawn controversially). After the case, Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said: &quot;Two people were acquitted today&quot;, meaning Hoskins as well. The &quot;Express&quot; carried an exclusive interview with Adams, whom Hoskins interviewed in a safe house away from other newspapers. According to archives released in 2003, Adams was thought by police to have killed 163 patients.

===Dunblane===

On 8 March 2009, the Scottish edition of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; published a front-page article critical of survivors of the 1996 Dunblane massacre, entitled &quot;Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors&quot;. The article criticised the 18-year-old survivors for posting &quot;shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet&quot;, revealing that they drank alcohol, made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives. The article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a fortnight later. The Press Complaints Commission described the article as a &quot;serious error of judgement&quot; and said, &quot;Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint, and rightly published an apology, the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it&quot;.

===Diana, Princess of Wales===
The &quot;Daily Express&quot; gained a reputation for printing conspiracy theories about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales as front-page news. &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006 both published a selection of then recent &quot;Express&quot; headlines on the topic. This practice was satirised in &quot;Private Eye&quot; as the &quot;Diana Express&quot; or the &quot;Di&#x27;ly Express&quot;, and has been attributed to Desmond&#x27;s friendship with regular &quot;Eye&quot; target Mohamed Fayed. The articles regularly quoted Fayed with the newspaper describing its campaign as &quot;Our relentless crusade for the truth&quot;. In 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on Mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the Madeleine McCann story (see below).

According to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2006: &quot;The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day.&quot; In February and March 2010, the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays.

In September 2013, following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an SAS operative, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories.

===Madeleine McCann===
In the second half of 2007 the &quot;Daily Express&quot; gave a large coverage to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. From 3 August 2007 to 10 November 2007, the &quot;Express&quot; dedicated at least part of the next 100 front pages to her. Of those, 82 used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance (often stylised by &quot;MADELEINE&quot; in red block capitals, plus a picture of the child).

Though the family initially said some journalists may have &quot;overstepped their mark&quot; they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye, but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful. In March 2008, the McCanns launched a libel suit against the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, as well as their Sunday equivalents, following their coverage. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing and covering up their daughter&#x27;s death. Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites.

In a settlement at the High Court of Justice, the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of 23 March and a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter. &quot;Guardian&quot; media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was &quot;unprecedented&quot; for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies but also said it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed &quot;a substantial libel&quot; that shamed the British press. Craig Silverman of &quot;Regret the Error&quot;, a blog that reports media errors, argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page, anything less than a front-page apology would have been &quot;unacceptable.&quot;

In its apology, the &quot;Express&quot; said &quot;a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter&#x27;s disappearance.&quot; This was followed in October by an apology and payout (forwarded to the fund again) to a group who had become known as the &quot;Tapas Seven&quot; in relation to the case.

===Accusations of xenophobia and hate speech ===
In 2013, the paper launched a &quot;crusade&quot; against new European Union rules on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania, inviting readers to sign a petition against lifting restrictions on immigration. The front page on Thursday 31 October declared: &quot;Britain is full and fed up. Today join your &quot;Daily Express&quot; Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants&quot;. The Aberystwyth University Student Union announced a ban on the sale of the paper. This ban was overturned in March 2016, following a student vote. UKIP Leader Nigel Farage declared that he had signed the &quot;Crusade&quot; petition, and urged others to do the same. Romanian politician Cătălin Ivan expressed &quot;outrage&quot; at the campaign.

In a statement released by The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 24 April 2015, the tabloid&#x27;s name was mentioned in an accusation of producing hate speech, initially referring to an article in &quot;The Sun&quot;: &quot;...To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the &quot;Daily Express&quot; ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period&quot; ... &quot;..the High Commissioner noted that Article 20 of the ICCPR, as well as elements relating to hate speech in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (both of which have been ratified by the UK, as well as by all other EU countries), were rooted in the desire to outlaw the type of anti-Semitic and other racially based hate speech used by the Nazi media during the 1930s&quot;.

Appearing in April 2018 before Parliament&#x27;s Home Affairs Select Committee, which was investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, &quot;Daily Express&quot; editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper &quot;downright offensive,&quot; adding that they made him feel &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; and contributed to an &quot;Islamophobic sentiment&quot; in the media.

==Political allegiance==
With the exception of the 2001 general election when it backed the Labour Party, and the 2015 general election when it backed the UK Independence Party, the newspaper has declared its support for the Conservative Party at every general election since World War II. In 2011, when the newspaper first endorsed UKIP, it became one of the first media outlets in the United Kingdom to demand a withdrawal from the European Union. 

===&quot;Crusade for Freedom&quot;===
&quot;Crusade for Freedom&quot; was the newspaper&#x27;s own campaign to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to add their names to a petition addressed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in favour of Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. Each edition of the 8 January 2011 issue had four cut-out vouchers where readers could sign the pledge and send them to the paper&#x27;s HQ where the petition was being compiled; there were also further editions with the same voucher included. The campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/TV personality Ian Botham as well as J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin, who both gave interviews for 8 January&#x27;s special edition of the paper. The first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received (just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the UK population).

<text>Old ale is a form of strong ale. The term is commonly applied to dark, malty beers in England, generally above 5% ABV, and also to dark ales of any strength in Australia. It is sometimes associated with &quot;stock ale&quot; or, archaically, &quot;keeping ale&quot;, in which the beer is held at the brewery. In modern times, the line has blurred between Old Ale and Barley wine.

==History==
Historically, old ales served as a complement to mild ales, and in pubs of the era typically the landlord would serve the customer a blend of the sharper stock ale with the fruitier, sweeter mild ale to the customer&#x27;s taste. In London especially, the aged ale would take on a tart note from a secondary fermentation with Brettanomyces yeast which was present either in the pitching yeast or in the wooden equipment. Because of the time required for the aging process, some investors would buy mild ale from brewers, age it into old ale, and sell it at the higher price. Eventually, brewers began to keep some beer behind at the brewery, age it themselves and sell it to the pubs. In some cases old ale was a blend of young and old. The &quot;stock ale&quot; was the brewery&#x27;s very aged ale and was used to inject an &quot;old&quot; quality, and perhaps acidity to the blend.

==Burton Ale==

In London especially, Burton was a synonym for old ale. 

==Winter warmer==
A winter warmer is a dark, malty-sweet strong ale that is brewed in the winter months. The average alcohol by volume ranges from 6% to 8%, and some reach 10% or more. Christmas beer is a type of winter warmer, similarly strong in alcohol and usually spiced. Mac&#x27;s Brewery in Hertford have brewed a Christmas beer known as Bootwarmer since 1995, and an old ale called Stronghart since the 1850s.

==Variations==

Some brewers will make a strong old ale for bottling. Some of these can mature for several years after bottling, and may or may not be bottle-conditioned. 

The &quot;October&quot; keeping ales are thought to have formed the basis for India pale ales shipped by the British East India Company.

Another historic version was so-called &quot;majority ale&quot;, a strong ale brewed on or around the birth of a child, and intended to be drunk on the child&#x27;s twenty-first birthday.

Some old ales blended older vintages with fresh beer in vats, on the solera system. Burton Ale brewed by the Ballantine brewery (Newark, New Jersey) was such a beer, and kept in production as a gift item for distributors and VIPs up until the closing of the brewery in 1972.
The only surviving representatives are Greene King 5X and The Bruery&#x27;s anniversary ales. Sour old ales fermented with &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; yeast were popular
in 19th-century Britain. The style is now associated more with Belgian brewing, for instance Oud bruin and Rodenbach Grand Cru, although there is one surviving British example, Gales Prize Old Ale.

A number of breweries, particularly in Sussex, produce a weaker style of old ale with some resemblance to a mild ale. Examples include King and Barnes (later W. J King) (4.5% ABV) and Harveys (4.3% ABV) These are typically consumed on draught dispense.

<text>Georg Friedrich Rudolph Theodor Herwegh (31 May 1817 – 7 April 1875) was a German poet, who is considered part of the Young Germany movement.

==Biography==
He was born in Stuttgart on 31 May 1817, the son of an innkeeper. He was educated at the Gymnasium Illustre of Stuttgart, and in 1835 proceeded to the University of Tübingen as a theological student, where, with a view to entering the ministry, he entered the Protestant theological seminary. However, he found the strict discipline distasteful; he broke the rules and was expelled in 1836. He studied law for a short time, but decided to return to Stuttgart, and became editor of August Lewald&#x27;s periodical &quot;Europa&quot;. Called out for military service, he had hardly joined his regiment when he became embroiled with a military officer with an act of insubordination, and had to flee to Emmishofen, Switzerland in 1839.

His &quot;Gedichte eines Lebendigen&quot; (&quot;Poems of a living man&quot;) were published in Zürich between 1841–1843 and immediately banned in Prussia. The lyrics combined revolutionary sentiment with a popular style and soon placed him at the forefront of the Vormärz revolutionary movement. The fervent effusions of his poems became immensely popular, so that when, after a short trip to Paris, Herwegh journeyed through Germany in 1842, he was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere.

King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. gave him an audience, and assured him that he liked nothing better than an energetic opposition. But Herwegh overstepped all the bounds of conventionality in a letter to the King, and was hurried out of Prussia. At Zürich, he found no pleasant reception. But the king of Württemberg pardoned him for desertion from military service, and in the canton of Basel, of which he now became a citizen, he married Emma Siegmund, daughter of a Jewish merchant at Berlin. He next took up his abode in Paris, and wrote a second volume of &quot;Gedichte eines Lebendigen&quot; (1844). He also translated all of Lamartine into German (1843–1844).

During the failed German revolution of 1848, together with a group of German emigrants, he led the German Democratic Legion in a military mission to Baden as part of the Hecker Uprising; with its defeat at Kadern, he had to flee to Switzerland once again. He lived in Zürich; after an amnesty he moved to Baden-Baden, Germany. Herwegh wrote songs for Lassalle&#x27;s Worker&#x27;s Society and the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party. In 1877, &quot;Neue Gedichte&quot; was published. The most important work of his later years was the translation of many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He died in Lichtental.

While other poets such as Ferdinand Freiligrath gave up their radical politics later on, Herwegh never changed his radical outlook and his commitment to radical democracy. He was disappointed by and criticised Prussian nationalism and Bismarck&#x27;s war against France and annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1870–71. In Herwegh&#x27;s mind, poetry is a first step towards political action, it should however not be artless. Consequently, he—like Heinrich Heine—defended Goethe.

<text>Mage Knight is a miniatures wargame using collectible figures, created by WizKids, Inc, and is the earliest example of what is now known as a collectible miniatures game (or CMG). The game was designed by founder Jordan Weisman along with Kevin Barrett. The game is the first to use WizKids&#x27; Clix system, combining roleplaying and wargaming elements with aspects of collectible card games. &quot;Mage Knight&quot; achieved success after it was introduced in 2000.

In October 2010 Wizkids relaunched the &quot;Mage Knight&quot; brand with Mage Knight Board Game, a cooperative board game designed by Vlaada Chvátil. In February 2013, WizKids announced that it would release Mage Knight: Resurrection, which utilizes its SwitchClix bases to be compatible with both Mage Knight 2.0 and HeroClix rules. The release date was Fall 2013.

==Design==
Unlike many other miniatures war-games, &quot;Mage Knight&quot; eliminates the need for reference to rule books and tables by integrating a dial into each figure that contains its current combat statistics - movement rate, attack and defense values, combat damage, and special abilities. While this system lacks the versatility of other miniatures games, mainly because players cannot customize their figures, it makes up for this by facilitating rapid gameplay and by having a large number of distinctive figures. The system, called the &quot;combat dial&quot;, has proved to be highly popular and is used in WizKids&#x27;s other games, including HeroClix and . The dial allows a figure&#x27;s displayed statistics to change as it takes damage.

All miniatures, called &quot;warriors&quot;, come pre-painted and are pre-assigned point costs based on their abilities. These costs range from 3 points (only the limited edition goblin volunteer Podo has achieved a point value this low) to over 500 points (for the tanks and the Apocalypse Dragon). To play a game, players will generally agree upon a point cost total, and then design their armies to maximize their strategic capabilities within the specified point cost total. Each player is allowed to take a number of actions per turn equal to the point cost total divided by 100. These actions include movement, combat, or the use of special abilities such as Regeneration and Necromancy. Game play is typically rapid, but often highly strategic, both in terms of traditional maneuvering and combat common to miniatures games and because of the unusual combinations of unit special abilities that make every army unique.

Each &quot;Mage Knight&quot; figure belongs to a specific faction. The factions in the initial release included the Atlantis Guild, the Elemental League, the Black Powder Rebels, the Draconum, The Knights Immortal, the Orc Raiders, and the Necropolis Sect. Other factions were added later. Each faction had its own strengths and weaknesses; for example the Atlantis Guild had many figures with powerful ranged attacks, but it lacked healers. A player could combine figures of different factions in their army at will, but only figures of the same faction could move in a formation together. Using formation rules, a player could move three to five adjacent figures while using only one action. A formation combat action could also be taken, in which multiple adjacent figures of the same faction attack and increase the chances of successfully hitting the target. Since the limited number of actions per turn is one of the most important strategic considerations in the game, a player making his army would have to balance the advantages of formation movement and formation combat against the desire to have the versatility of figures from different factions.

==Distribution==
&quot;Mage Knight&quot; figures were sold in Starter Packs (which historically contained eight or nine figures along with rules and dice) and Booster Packs (four or five figures). Figures were sold in base sets, as well as expansion sets, and distributed with seven rarity levels. Levels 1 through 5 were assigned to the standard &quot;infantry&quot; figures, each of which was available in 3 power levels: Weak, Standard and Tough. Low power and cost figure were of 1-2-3 rarity, middle range figures were 2-3-4, and stronger army figures were 3-4-5. Level 6 figures were Uniques, which carried the stipulation that only one of any individual Unique could appear in a player&#x27;s army. In addition, WizKids gave away limited edition, Unique versions of the non-Unique figures in the sets as prizes for tournaments in comic and game shops. These figures are not generally available for retail sale, and have different statistics and point costs than the regular figures. This novel prize policy was in part responsible for &quot;Mage Knight&quot;&#x27;s success. Some expansions had ultra-rare &quot;chase&quot; figures, listed as rarity level 7, which were produced in limited quantities and found randomly in boosters, such as the Apocalypse Horsemen in &quot;Sinister&quot; or the glow-in-the-dark variants from &quot;Minions&quot;. Finally, Wiz Kids also sold larger figures individually. The figures, which included dragons, chariots, war machines and giants, had multiple combat dials that applied to each side of the figure to make them harder to kill and allow them multiple attacks. Some of these larger, individual figures cost so many points that they could be utilized only in large armies.

In 2002, the &quot;Dungeons&quot; expansion was released in starters and boosters, which featured a new type of gameplay more akin to traditional RPG &quot;dungeon-crawl&quot; adventures. Instead of players each amassing armies to go head-to-head, &quot;Dungeons&quot; had players select a team of Hero characters, and enter a dungeon map filled with wandering monsters and treasure chests. During each player&#x27;s turn, the opponent controlled any monsters encountered, and the goal was to defeat the monsters and escape with the most gold from the treasure chests. Adventures could be played individually or as a collective campaign, with the Hero figures having 5 &quot;levels&quot; that were attained with experience from adventuring. All figures (Heroes and Mage Spawn monsters) were still fully compatible with regular Mage Knight rules. The &quot;Dungeons&quot; format featured two expansions of its own, &quot;Pyramid&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and two fixed 5-figure sets with special characters, maps and scenarios titled &quot;Heroic Quests&quot;. In addition, WizKids released 3-dimensional plastic floor tiles, walls, doors, and objects which could purchased to build a full scale dungeon.

In November 2003, WizKids released a new &quot;base&quot; set (their third, after &quot;Rebellion&quot; and &quot;Unlimited&quot;), colloquially referred to as &quot;&quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot;,&quot; with many rules overhauled or expanded, which introduced new strategic possibilities to the game, including capabilities to customize Unique warriors and battles via styrene cards called Items, Domains, and Constructed Terrain. Later expansions introduced more options via Spellbooks, Spells, and Adventuring Companies. The two &quot;versions&quot; can be distinguished by their logos; the original Mage Knight sets feature a straight short sword through the logo while &quot;2.0&quot; and its subsequent expansions have a curved scimitar. This change also made all original series character redundant as they were no longer tournament legal, this meant that loyal followers abandon the game and sales and popularity plummeted. As a matter of interest the current owners of the D&amp;D franchise also own Mage Knights and current proposed changes to D&amp;D by these owners seems to show they learnt nothing from the disastrous Mage Knight 2.0 experience. 

&quot;Mage Knight&quot; saw a total of 14 expansions in booster packs, as well as prepackaged sets of figures in the &quot;Heroic Quests&quot;, &quot;Conquest&quot;, and &quot;Titans&quot; supplements, and special holiday-themed figures (&quot;Santa Claus&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snow-Minion&quot;) released in 2001 and 2003. The &quot;Conquest&quot; version had a number of large castle wall and fortification pieces, including 2 unique figures. Several Army Packs were released, with one random figure and 8 fixed figures from a specific faction. In addition, the &quot;Unlimited&quot; set released a special &quot;Painter&#x27;s Edition&quot; which featured miniatures which were unpainted and removed from the bases for customizing purposes.

==Expansions==
The expansions are (in order of release):

*Rebellion - The original &quot;Mage Knight&quot; release from November, 2000.
*Lancers - Released in May 2001, this first expansion introduced cavalry figures, with double the base size of regular figures and unique rules regarding their use. The expansion also introduced the first figures using the &#x27;charge&#x27; and &#x27;bound&#x27; special abilities which allowed figures to move and attack in the same action.
*Whirlwind - Released in October 2001, the 2nd &quot;Mage Knight&quot; expansion introduced the Shyft, a faction that allows the Mage Spawn (monster) faction to use formations and new figures with special abilities such as &#x27;venom&#x27; and &#x27;ram&#x27;, which allows the infliction of automatic damage if one moved into contact with an opposing figure.
*Dungeons - Released in 2002, &quot;Mage Knight Dungeons&quot; is a complete, stand alone game as opposed to being a mere expansion to the &quot;Mage Knight&quot; system. Players take on the role of heroes fighting monsters in a dungeon and collecting treasure. &quot;Dungeons&quot; starter sets included a map, as well as two heroes, six mage spawn (monsters), and two chests, while boosters contained half as many of each. Dungeon kits with new maps and terrain were also available as part of the release. Though many of the &quot;Dungeons&quot; rules differ from &quot;Mage Knight&quot; rules, all &quot;Mage Knight Dungeons&quot; figures are fully compatible with regular &quot;Mage Knight&quot;.
*Unlimited - This 2002 expansion was actually the re-release of a base (introductory) set. &quot;Unlimited&quot; took 160 figures from &quot;Rebellion&quot; and &quot;Lancers&quot;, some of which featured new sculpts.
*Conquest - Released in June 2002, &quot;Mage Knight Conquest&quot; was not a true expansion but a rules set for large scale, high point-total &quot;Mage Knight&quot; battles to be played in a reasonable period of time. &quot;Conquest&quot; came with a 96-page rulebook, 3 unique figures, and several pieces of new siege equipment. Also, several connectable castle fortifications were released, including a castle keep and gatehouse which each came with a unique figure, a round tower, and 2 sets of walls.
*Sinister - This expansion, released in 2002, featured a new faction, the Solonavi, that featured powerful, high point cost figures with unique clear plastic sculpts. The expansion also featured &#x27;dual faction&#x27; figures, figures that count as being members of two different factions. This set also featured the four ultra-rare Riders of the Apocalypse as chase figures, randomly inserted in boosters.
*Minions - Released in September 2002, &quot;Minions&quot; featured more Solonavi and Draconum figures, including the first non-unique Solonavi figures and the first dual faction Draconum unique figures. In addition, the Tough versions of the first 10 figures in the set were made in limited edition glow-in-the-dark plastic variants, randomly inserted in boosters.
*Heroic Quests - Also released in September 2002. Another supplement for &quot;Dungeons&quot;, &quot;Heroic Quests&quot; consisted of 2 fixed 5-figure scenario-based boxed sets, &quot;Magestone Mines&quot; and &quot;The Citadel&quot;, each of which included 4 unique Heroes, a powerful Master Adversary figure, a unique double-sided map, and special scenario rules and monster tokens.
*Pyramid - Released in January 2003, &quot;Pyramid&quot; was not a true expansion but a new starter set for the &quot;Mage Knight Dungeons&quot; game. Like &quot;Dungeons&quot;, all figures are compatible with regular &quot;Mage Knight&quot; play.
*Uprising - Released in April 2003, &quot;Uprising&quot; was a relatively small expansion, with 96 figures released.
*Dragon&#x27;s Gate - This expansion was another addition to the &quot;Mage Knight Dungeons&quot; game, with all figures again being compatible with standard &quot;Mage Knight&quot; rules.
*Mage Knight - Commonly known as &quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot;, this Base Set was released in November 2003 and represented a major revision to the &quot;Mage Knight&quot; ruleset. Figures from prior sets remained compatible with this ruleset. Figures from the prior sets were phased out from tournament play. Figures released with &quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot; and later also included more features that enabled them to be more versatile and customizable on the battlefield, such as a wider variety of special abilities, subfactions giving units a more &quot;permanent&quot; ability, and proficiencies which gave warriors abilities based on their combat value types. One of the major enhancements with &quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot; was the introduction of styrene cards which influenced gameplay in various ways.
*Dark Riders - Released in April 2004, &quot;Dark Riders&quot; introduces the &quot;mount&quot; and &quot;rider&quot; units. Certain warriors are removable from their bases, and can be placed in slots on the front of larger &quot;mount&quot; units to create a &quot;cavalry&quot; unit, and gain significant benefits from doing so. Certain &quot;relics&quot; are only equipable by riders. &quot;Dark Riders&quot; also introduces Faith and Catastrophe Domain cards, new Item cards, the Dark Riders and Wylden Host subfactions, and four ultra-rare &quot;chase&quot; figures: the Avatars of Apocalypse (whose subfaction the set is named after).
*Sorcery - Released in September 2004, &quot;Sorcery&quot; introduced a new rules mechanic for spellcasting and a new proficiency for blocking spells cast by opposing players. Associated with this new ruleset were two new types of styrene cards - Spellbooks and Spells. &quot;Sorcery&quot; also was the first 2.0 expansion to have non-unique warriors with Item slots, allowing for even greater versatility in army building. Although no new factions were introduced with &quot;Sorcery&quot;, 10 new subfactions were introduced to give even more variety to the types of armies players could build.
*Omens - Released in April 2005, &quot;Omens&quot; introduced two new rules mechanics: Adventuring Companies, which allowed an army to have a universal ability, and could be made cheaper by choosing specific characters; and Champions, figures with a removable base that allowed the player to choose from a set of 5 increasingly powerful combat dials, depending on the number of points the player wished to spend on it. Also reintroduced with the &quot;Omens&quot; expansion was the Shyft faction, as well as the first 2.0 non-unique Mage Spawn figures. Associated with the release, though not part of the release itself, was the introduction of a convention-exclusive figure known as the Apocalypse Dragon.
*Nexus - Released on August 24, 2005, and featured previously released figures from the &quot;Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Sinister&quot;, &quot;Minions&quot;, &quot;Uprising&quot;, &quot;Pyramid&quot;, and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot; sets. These figures use the same sculpts as the original figures, but are painted to 2.0 standards, and have combat dials and stats updated to reflect gameplay in the &quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot; ruleset. The set is unique in that unlike other sets, where &quot;common&quot; units had three levels of relative power (Weak, Standard, and Tough), &quot;Nexus&quot; had only Unique and Standard figures; no Weak or Tough versions were included in the set. Presumably this was to give a greater variety of figure sculpts, while keeping the amount of distinct figures on par with other &quot;Mage Knight&quot; expansion sets. On June 30, 2005, Wizkids announced the Nexus expansion would be the last in the current series and that after November 2005 all tournament support would cease. Neither Wizkids or Topps gave any official reason. However, WizKids was acquired in 2009 by NECA, and in February 2013 announced a new expansion appropriately titled Resurrection.
*Resurrection - Was released in Fall 2013 and utilizes WizKids&#x27; SwitchClix dials. SwitchClix allows the player to remove the figure from one base and attach it to another, so the same figure can be used on two different types of dials. Each of the 25 miniatures in the line will include two dials: one for Mage Knight 2.0 rules, and one that&#x27;s compatible with the main HeroClix line. The figures will be available through starter sets and booster packs. There is no word as to whether the company will support possible Mage Knight tournaments as it had in the past.

===Board game===

The Mage Knight Board Game was designed by Vlaada Chvátil and released in December 2011. There were also three distinct expansions and one collection released for &quot;Mage Knight Board Game&quot;.

==Factions==
The land of &quot;Mage Knight&quot; is split among several factions. Several of these factions split from Tezla&#x27;s original empire, and others have organized and grown since Tezla&#x27;s death. Based on the outcomes of various official storyline tournaments held at comics and gaming shops and major gaming conventions, when 2.0 was released most of the major factions were renamed, and also further divided into one or more subfactions, each of which possesses its own unique ability.

*Atlantis Guild/Atlantean Empire - This is the core remains of Tezla&#x27;s original empire. Upon his death, the Atlantis Guild leaders focused mostly on Technomantic magic, and their armies often consist of mixes between mages, troops, and magically-infused golems. Nujarek later further organized the Guild into the Atlantean Empire in an effort to regain the former glory of Atlantis. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Imperial Legion&quot;, &quot;Golemkore&quot; and &quot;Delphana&quot;.
*Apocalypse - First introduced in the &quot;Sinister&quot; set as the four ultra-rare Riders of the Apocalypse, this cult, also known as the Tur&#x27;aj, was dormant for many years. As chaos grew in the land, the Apocalypse gained power. At first, the heralds of the Apocalypse rode forth in the Land, and later several Avatars were created to build up the cult again. They sought to sow discord and death in the land, and brought about the rebirth of the terrible Apocalypse Dragon. They have one 2.0 subfaction, the &quot;Minions of the Apocalypse&quot;.
*Black Powder Rebels/Black Powder Revolutionaries - This faction began as a rag-tag group of dissidents to the Atlantis Guild who saw the injustice that the Guild inflicted upon many of the denizens of the land. This was especially due to the treatment of the Dwarves, who, due to their strong resistance to Magestone (a major source of magical power, used heavily in Technomancy), were conscripted into working in the various Magestone mines, often until they were worked to death. The Rebels became a major player after the assassination of Karrudan, and later grew in strength to become the Black Powder Revolutionaries. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Bloody Thorns&quot;, &quot;Northlanders&quot; and &quot;Forgemasters&quot;.
*Draconum - Not particularly allied with any faction, though opposed to the Apocalypse and tried to prevent the Apocalypse from claiming the egg of the Apocalypse Dragon. Mostly, however, they act as pseudo-mercenaries, who have a common quest to better themselves, as they continue to evolve into higher and more potent forms of Draconum. They have one 2.0 subfaction, the &quot;Dragon Mystics&quot;.
*Elemental League/Elemental Freeholds - A splinter faction from Tezla&#x27;s original empire, the Elemental League focuses mostly on Elemental magic, or magic of life. Opposed primarily to the Necropolis Sect/Dark Crusaders, they lost much ground and many troops to the latter faction. Eventually, they came to be more scattered, and fought to keep from being wiped out completely. As 2.0&#x27;s story begins, they retreated to an Elven castle in the forest and became the Elemental Freeholds. Distantly related to the Elven Lords, they are neither strong allies nor bitter enemies with them. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Wylden Host&quot; and &quot;Storm Druids&quot;.
*Heroes - Introduced primarily for Dungeons-style games, this faction represents individuals who seek glory in the Land. Many of the Hero faction are dual-aligned with another faction, though some are not. They are not in any 2.0 sets and have no subfactions.
*Knights Immortal/Elven Lords - An ancient race of elves that live in the Rivvenheim Mountains in the easternmost regions of the known Land. Their overarching goal is to eliminate chaos from the land, and often do so without mercy to those they consider unworthy. Allied with the Atlantis Guild for a time against the Orcs, they were eventually betrayed and left to fend for themselves, and have since sworn vengeance as the Elven Lords. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Free Armies&quot;, &quot;Temple Masters&quot; and &quot;Order of Sorcery&quot;.
*Mage Spawn - Not truly an organized &quot;faction&quot;, but in the game are figures without any faction. In the early sets, these represented various creatures, often twisted through magic (hence their name) that were of various levels of intelligence, but not organized into any formal faction. In later 2.0 sets, some mercenary-type figures were also included, and their subfaction, &quot;Order of the Ninth Circle&quot;, had a gameplay ability that let them bond more fully to any faction by assuming the faction of any and all figures in the army they are with.
*Necropolis Sect/Dark Crusaders. A split-off faction from Tezla&#x27;s empire, the Necropolis sect focused on Necromantic magic, or magic of death. Primarily opposed to the Elementals, they took much of their territory and did much damage. Later, they began the Dark Crusade to continue taking over the Land and convert all to the worship of the Dark Tezla. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Deathspeakers&quot;, the &quot;Order of Vladd&quot; and the &quot;Blood Cultists&quot;.
*Orc Raiders/Orc Khans - The Orc Raiders were a semi-organized group of nomadic raiders from the north, in a land called The Fist. They attacked and plundered, but eventually became hungrier for more spoils, and became more organized. The lowly goblin Podo stole a powerful Elven shield relic, and rose to a tenuous position of power among his larger cousins. As the various Orc Khans united, they became an even greater force in the land to reckon with. Their 2.0 subfactions are the &quot;Broken Tusk&quot;, the &quot;Shadow Khans&quot; and the &quot;Chaos Shamans&quot;.
*Shyft - Introduced in the &quot;Whirlwind&quot; expansion, these strange reptilian creatures seemed to have a strange psychic bond with the various Mage Spawn found in the Land. Originally relatively weak, they relied on this bond with more powerful Mage Spawn to help fight. Eventually, they withdrew from the Land, and were largely unknown. In the &quot;Omens&quot; set, they reemerged in a new, more powerful warrior form. While they maintained their affinity with the Mage Spawn, they became powerful warriors in their own right. They seem to have somewhat of an alliance with the Apocalypse faction, though the full connection between the two is unknown. They have a single 2.0 subfaction, the &quot;Darkmarch&quot;, and have the faction ability to grant Mage Spawn the Shyft faction for formation purposes.
*Solonavi - Originally introduced in the &quot;Sinister&quot; expansion as extremely powerful figures, they remain a fairly enigmatic race of energy creatures. They offer favors to various groups and individuals, in exchange for favors in return to be named later. At the beginning of the &quot;Mage Knight 2.0&quot; timeline, they revealed themselves more fully as being aligned with the Oracles of Rokos, and offered their services to the Atlantis Guild to become the most powerful empire in the land. When the offer was refused, they were outraged, and began claiming their own territory in the land. Consisting of beings of light and various &quot;oathsworn&quot; servants, they seem to be strongly dedicated to protecting the Land against the rise of the Apocalypse. However, it is strongly hinted they might have ulterior motives, and many still do not trust them. They cast a spell which reawakened many dormant magics in the Land. Their single 2.0 subfaction is the &quot;Oracle of Rokos&quot;.

<text>Brown ale is a style of beer with a dark amber or brown colour. The term was first used by London brewers in the late 17th century to describe a lightly hopped ale brewed from 100% brown malt. Brown ale is a type of Ale.

==History==

In the 18th century, British brown ales were brewed to a variety of strengths, with original gravities (OG) ranging from around 1.060 to 1.090. Around 1800, brewers stopped producing these types of beers as they moved away from using brown malt as a base. Pale malt, being cheaper because of its higher yield, was used as a base for most beers, including porter and stout.

The term &quot;brown ale&quot; was revived at the end of the 19th century when London brewer Mann introduced a beer with that name. However, the style only became widely brewed in the 1920s. The brown ales of this period were considerably stronger than most modern English versions. In 1926, Manns Brown Ale had an original gravity of 1.043 and an ABV of around 4%. Whitbread Double Brown was even stronger, an OG of 1.054 and more than 5% ABV. The introduction of these beers coincided with a big increase in demand for bottled beer in the UK. In the 1930s some breweries, such as Whitbread, introduced a second weaker and cheaper brown ale that was sometimes just a sweetened version of dark Mild. These beers had an original gravity of around 1.037. After World War II, most breweries stopped producing these stronger brown ales, with the exception of some breweries in the northeast of England. The majority had an OG in the range 1.030–1.035, or around 3% ABV, much like Manns Brown Ale today.

North American brown ales trace their heritage to American home brewing adaptations of certain northern English beers, and the English influence on American Colonial Ales.

==Description==
English brown ales range from beers such as Manns Original Brown Ale, which is quite sweet and low in alcohol, to northeastern brown ale such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith&#x27;s Nut Brown Ale. North American examples include Sam Adams Brown Ale and Brooklyn Brown Ale.

They range from deep amber to brown in colour. Caramel and chocolate flavours are evident. Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.

<doc id="362879" wikidata="Q929597" url="?curid=362879" title="John Gunther">
<text>John Gunther (August 30, 1901 – May 29, 1970) was an American journalist and writer.

His success came primarily by a series of popular sociopolitical works, known as the &quot;Inside&quot; books (1936–1972), including the best-selling &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; in 1947. However, he is now best known for his memoir &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot; (1949), on the death of his teenage son, Johnny Gunther, from a brain tumor.

==Life==
Gunther was born in 1901 in the Lakeview district of Chicago and grew up on the North Side of the city. He was the first child of a German-American family: his father was Eugene Guenther, a traveling salesman; his mother Lizette Schoeninger Guenther.

During World War I, the family changed the spelling of its name from Guenther to Gunther to avoid having an obviously-German name.

In 1922, he was awarded a Bachelor of Philosophy from the University of Chicago, where he was literary editor of the student paper.

He worked briefly in the city as a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, but he soon moved to Europe to be a correspondent with the &quot;Daily News&quot; London bureau, where he covered Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East.

Gunther met Frances Fineman in London in 1925 and the two were married in 1927. Until 1936, they worked together (Frances as a foreign correspondent for London&#x27;s &quot;News Chronicle&quot;) throughout Europe. Gunther wrote, &quot;I was at one time or another in charge of &quot;Daily News&quot; offices in London, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, Rome, and Paris, and I also visited Poland, Spain, the Balkans, and Scandinavia. I have worked in every European country except Portugal. I saw at first hand the whole extraordinary panorama of Europe from 1924 to 1936.&quot; In Vienna, Gunther worked alongside a group of English-speaking central European correspondents that included Marcel Fodor, Dorothy Thompson, Robert Best, and George Eric Rowe Gedye.

Gunther later described those years as

the bubbling, blazing days of American foreign correspondence in Europe. ... Most of us traveled steadily, met constantly, exchanged information, caroused, took in each other&#x27;s washing, and, even when most fiercely competitive, were devoted friends. ... We were scavengers, buzzards, out to get the news, no matter whose wings got clipped.

According to Michael Bloch, Gunther enjoyed a same-sex relationship in the 1930s in Vienna with the future Leader of the British Labour Party, Hugh Gaitskell.

Gunther&#x27;s experiences as a journalist in interwar Vienna formed the basis for his novel &quot;The Lost City&quot;.

His research and the contacts that Gunther developed as a reporter also led directly to the first of the &quot;Inside&quot; books, &quot;Inside Europe&quot;, which was intended by Gunther to summarize the European political situation for the general reader. With the success of the &quot;Inside&quot; books starting in the late 1930s, Gunther resigned his position to devote his full-time to the books. During World War II, he worked as a war correspondent in Europe.

The Gunthers had two children: Judy, who died in 1929 before the age of 1, and John Jr. (Johnny), who was born in 1929 and died in 1947 of a brain tumor. The Gunthers divorced in 1944.

Gunther married Jane Perry Vandercook in 1948; the two adopted a son. Jane P. Gunther, a devoted student of the arts who accompanied her husband on his voyages and contributed to his books, was born in August 1916. She died in New York City, on May 22, 2020, at the age of 103. She had been widowed for a week shy of half a century.

Gunther died of liver cancer in 1970.

==Writings==
===&quot;Inside&quot; series===
The books that made Gunther famous in his time were the &quot;Inside&quot; series of continental surveys. For each book, Gunther traveled extensively through the area the book covered, interviewed political, social, and business leaders; talked with average people; reviewed area statistics; and then wrote a lengthy overview of what he had learned and how he interpreted it.

About &quot;Inside Europe&quot; (published in 1936), Gunther wrote, &quot;This book has had a striking success all over the world. I was fortunate in that it appeared at just the right time, when the three totalitarian dictators took the stage and people began to be vitally interested in them.&quot;

In 1947, Gunther tackled &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, visiting all 48 states. On the 50th anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., appraised the book and its impact:

This book, now half a century old, is an astonishing . It presents a shrewd, fast-moving, sparkling panorama of the United States at this historic moment of apparent triumph. Sinclair Lewis called it &quot;the richest treasure-house of facts about America that has ever been published, and probably the most spirited and interesting.&quot; At the same time, in its preoccupations and insights &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; foresaw dilemmas and paradoxes that were to harass and frustrate Americans for the rest of the century.

The &quot;Inside&quot; series grew to include volumes covering all populated continents: &quot;Inside Europe&quot;, &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Inside Asia&quot;, &quot;Inside Latin America&quot;, &quot;Inside Africa&quot;, &quot;Inside Russia Today&quot;, and, finally, &quot;Inside Australia and New Zealand&quot; (with W. H. Forbis). Several of the volumes were issued multiple times in updated and revised editions over the years, as world events demanded. &quot;Inside Africa&quot; proved particularly well-timed as a historical record. During 1952–53 Gunther and his wife visited nearly all forty-four African political entities then in existence during what was to prove the final stage of mainly colonial rule.

===Other nonfiction and fiction works===
In addition to the &quot;Inside&quot; series and related volumes, Gunther wrote eight novels and three biographies. The most notable of them are &quot;Bright Nemesis&quot;, &quot;The Troubled Midnight&quot;, &quot;Roosevelt in Retrospect&quot; (published in 1950) and &quot;Eisenhower&quot;, a biography of the famous general released in 1952, the year that Dwight Eisenhower was elected President. In addition, Gunther published several books for young readers, including a biography of Alexander the Great in 1953, and &quot;Meet Soviet Russia&quot;, a two-volume adaptation of &quot;Inside Russia Today&quot; in 1962.

===&quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;===
The book for which Gunther is best remembered today, however, does not deal with politics. &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot; is the story of his son, Johnny, who died of a brain tumor at the age of 17. In the book, &quot;a restrained and moving work intended for family and friends,&quot; the elder Gunther details the struggles that he and his ex-wife, Frances Fineman, had gone through in attempting to save their son&#x27;s life, the many treatments pursued (everything from radical surgery to strictly-controlled diet), the ups and downs of apparent remission and eventual relapse, and the strain that it placed on all three of them. Gunther portrays his son as a remarkable young man, who had corresponded intelligently with Albert Einstein about physics. The book became a bestseller, and in 1975, it was made into an Emmy-nominated television movie, starring Arthur Hill as John Gunther, Jane Alexander as his wife, and Robby Benson as Johnny. It remains a staple of many high-school curricula.

==Other media==
===Broadway: &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;===
&quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; was made into a Broadway revue, also titled &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, in 1948, with songs by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz. The production starred, among others, Beatrice Lillie and Jack Haley and played for 399 performances.

===Television – &quot;High Road&quot;===
From September 7, 1959, until September 17, 1960, Gunther was host and narrator of a television program on the ABC network entitled &quot;John Gunther&#x27;s High Road&quot;. It originally aired Monday nights at 8:30, but soon switched to Saturday night at 8 p.m., immediately following the Dick Clark variety show. The &quot;High Road&quot; program consisted of travelogues of various nations around the world. Some of the films were produced especially for this program and others were obtained from other sources. The common thread of all episodes was Gunther&#x27;s narration, although he had little or nothing to do with the actual content.

<text>NECA/WizKids, LLC (commonly known as simply WizKids) is an American company based in New Jersey that produces tabletop games. WizKids is best known for its collectible miniatures games (CMGs) Mage Knight, HeroClix, MechWarrior, and HorrorClix, all of which make use of the company&#x27;s Clix system, in which the changing combat statistics and abilities of each figure were indicated by a turnable dial inside the base underneath the figure. The company was founded in 2000 by Jordan Weisman, a veteran of the game company FASA. It was purchased by sports-card manufacturer Topps, Inc. in 2003.

WizKids was acquired by NECA in September 2009.

==History==

WizKids was founded in 2000 by Jordan Weisman, previously of FASA, to publish Mage Knight. Mage Knight was the first collectible miniatures game. Early employees joining Jordan in this endeavor were his wife Dawne, who led the company&#x27;s graphic design; his father Mort, who ran international sales; his brother-in-law Ray Wehrs, who ran domestic sales; and Jenny (Trisko) Berg, previously of Bungie, who was in charge of marketing.

In 2001 the company went from being &quot;virtual&quot; to having its own office in Bellevue, Washington. Employees had previously been spread through Washington, Illinois, and Missouri. Mage Knight was selling as fast as it could be made, and the company moved into the hobby&#x27;s list of 10 largest publishers. The employee count went up to over 30, including Don Gorski, COO; Tom Virgin, CFO; Martin A. Stever, Executive V.P; and Marc Sachnoff, President of WizKids Licensing and Media, who made the innovative deals bringing together the Marvel and DC comics character universes into the HeroClix line.

Though they proved less successful, WizKids also produced the short-lived CMGs Crimson Skies, Shadowrun Duels, and Creepy Freaks, as well as a baseball-themed CMG called MLB SportsClix. A CMG called ToonClix was announced in March 2006, but canceled before it was released.

In July 2004, WizKids created a new product category with the release of their first constructible strategy game (or CSG), Pirates of the Spanish Main, featuring miniature ships assembled from pieces punched out of styrene cards. Their next CSG was a science fiction game called Rocketmen, released in the summer of 2005, followed by a NASCAR CSG called &quot;RaceDay&quot; later that year, though these last two games were discontinued shortly after. By 2007, WizKids was also calling some of their releases involving CSG elements &quot;PocketModel&quot; games, beginning with the Star Wars PocketModel game.

In 2005, WizKids released their first collectible card game, High Stakes Drifter, which was discontinued after its initial set. In May 2006, they released their second CCG, a licensed game based on the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV series.

WizKids entered the board game market with a board game called Tsuro in 2005, followed in 2006 by Oshi and , a board game based on the Pirates constructible strategy game.

The company also owned the rights to the role-playing games Shadowrun and Classic Battletech, which they licensed to FanPro in 2001. A game created by the company called Zypods, with a physical structure similar to Matryoshka dolls, had a limited release, but was never distributed nationwide.

The Topps Company announced on November 10, 2008, that it intended to close WizKids and discontinue product lines including HeroClix. In the statement announcing the close of WizKids, Topps also indicated that it was pursuing alternatives to discontinuing brands so that brands such as HeroClix could continue on without any noticeable disruption in future product offerings.

===Sale to NECA===
At the July 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) displayed a Thor figure for Heroclix, indicating that they might be the new parent company for WizKids. On September 14, 2009, NECA announced that they had purchased the assets of WizKids from The Topps Company and will continue the HeroClix family of games under the WizKids brand. The WizKids assets sold did not include Shadowrun and Battletech, which were retained by Topps Inc.

The &quot;Buy It By the Brick&quot; retail promotion returned with the &quot;Marvel HeroClix: Hammer of Thor&quot; set. Unlike previous offerings, the promotional figure (Ragnarok Surtur) was available with the 10-pack brick purchase at retail locations, rather than through mail-in redemption. With the following set &quot;DC HeroClix: Brave and the Bold&quot; the promotional figure (a Batman and Catwoman duo-figure) returned to redemption through WizKids/NECA, though this time done online.

===Storyline Organized Play===
Beginning with The Infinity Gauntlet in 2012, WizKids began to implement Storyline Organized Play programs. These programs would let gamers go to their local store once a month to play in an event that built up to a grand finale. Players are typically rewarded for attending multiple events before the finale. Storyline Organized Play themes have included No Man&#x27;s Land for DC, Fear Itself for Marvel, The Dominion War for Star Trek, and others. WizKids continues to implement tweaks to their Storyline Organized Play programs.

==Production==
WizKids produces both licensed and first-party games. Many of the games WizKids utilize include patented elements like the Combat Dial System. WizKids produces both physical items, like HeroClix, as well as digital transliterations, like Quarriors! for IOS.&lt;ref name =&quot;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/205839/Quarriors_for_iPadreg__UberStrategic_MonsterBattlingTrailer_Available_Now.php&quot;&gt;Gamasutra, Press Releases- Quarriors! for iPad® - Uber-Strategic Monster-Battling Trailer Available Now, 11/27/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="362882" wikidata="Q7371513" url="?curid=362882" title="Route 66 State Park">
<text>Route 66 State Park is a public recreation area located on the Meramec River at the site of the former town of Times Beach, Missouri. The state park encompasses east of Eureka. The park offers hiking, cycling, and equestrian trails, picnicking areas, and a boat ramp.

==History==

Times Beach was bought, dismantled, and decontaminated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency following the discovery of widespread dioxin contamination in the 1980s. Fields of wild grass and brush now grow where the homes of evacuated residents formerly stood. Deserted streets line the park and hint at what once was a community in west Saint Louis County.

==Activities and amenities==
The park has a boat ramp providing access to the river as well as a picnic area and trails for hiking, cycling, and equestrian use. The visitor center exhibits photos and memorabilia of structures along Route 66 in the Saint Louis area which have been torn down and replaced by modern shopping centers and strip malls. Displays include the first historic Route 66 marker, originally erected on the highway in Springfield, Missouri, as well as an interpretation of the ecological disaster and 20-year cleanup of the area.

===Route 66 bridge===
The visitor center, located in the old Bridgehead Inn on the east side of the Meramec River, was joined to the park on the west side by the old Route 66 bridge, which has been closed due to safety concerns. The park itself is accessible only from east-bound Interstate 44 at exit 265. The visitor center is accessed from either direction at exit 266 and is cut off from the park it serves. A plan to restore the bridge to usability is projected to be completed in 2026.

<text>Death Be Not Proud is a 1949 memoir by American journalist John Gunther. The book describes the decline and death of Gunther&#x27;s son, Johnny, due to a brain tumor. The title comes from by John Donne, also known from its first line as the poem &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;.

At the time the book was published in the late 1940s, memoirs about illness and grief were uncommon.

==Synopsis==

The book is an account of Johnny Gunther&#x27;s experience with a brain tumor, and ends with his death at age 17.

The book consists of two parts. Part 1 contains the primary narrative of the book, while Part 2 contains additional letters written by Johnny, excerpts from his diary, and a short essay by his mother, Frances Gunther.

The primary narrative consists of five chapters, and an Aftermath section.

Chapter 1 begins with Johnny&#x27;s diagnosis with a brain tumor in the spring of 1946. It describes the first operation that Johnny underwent, at the Neurological Institute of New York. The surgery confirmed the existence of the tumor. One of his doctors, Tracy Putnam, said, &quot;It was about the size of an orange. I got half of it.&quot; Johnny recovered from the surgery, while the nature of the tumor was assessed: it was described as an &quot;astroblastoma undergoing transformation&quot;.

Chapter 2 begins in June 1946 when Johnny underwent daily X-ray treatment of his tumor until June 20. Johnny&#x27;s vision was impaired to varying degrees because of papilledema (pressure on the nerves to the eyes) caused by the tumor. Johnny&#x27;s parents, John and Frances, sought help from many sources. Between August 1 and 5, 1946, Johnny was treated with chlormethine, described by the author as mustard. Dr. Max Gerson was consulted, and Johnny began a special, highly regimented program of diet and enemas on September 7, 1946, visiting Dr. Gerson&#x27;s nursing home for the first time.

Chapter 3 describes Johnny&#x27;s initial ill state, and then seeming recovery, within a week of beginning the Gerson diet. His papilledema diminished, and his blood counts improved. Johnny began to be tutored in this period in an attempt to make up for lost classwork, with the hope of graduating with his class at Deerfield Academy the following spring. In December 1946, Johnny&#x27;s condition worsened, leading to a second operation. Dr. Lester Mount reporting that &quot;he had successfully drained an abscess that went five centimeters into the brain beyond the table of the skull, and had got out a full cup of pus and fluid.&quot; Johnny was discharged from the hospital on January 12, 1947, and his parents were hopeful at this time.

Chapter 4 begins with Johnny&#x27;s apparent recovery, and then, starting in late February, his decline. He began having episodes of amnesia and shivering. Through March and April, he continued studying in an effort to graduate and be admitted to Harvard University for the fall. The bump on Johnny&#x27;s skull, caused by the tumor, began growing, and Dr. Mount attempted to drain it of fluid. However, the bump was &quot;like stone again, and Mount had scarcely been able to drain a drop.&quot;

On May 1, 1947, Johnny underwent another major operation. Dr. Mount reported that &quot;the mass was even invading his scalp and that, despite the depth he had reached, 11 cm., he had never penetrated to the healthy brain tissue at all.&quot;

Chapter 5 describes Johnny&#x27;s graduation from high school and his death, on June 30, 1947.

The Aftermath section describes Johnny&#x27;s funeral and the reaction of people to Johnny&#x27;s death.

==Publication==
Gunther wrote the book in the months after his son&#x27;s death, originally with the idea of printing some copies to distribute privately, as some parents had done in remembrance of soldiers who were killed in action. After writing it, however, he changed his mind and sought to have it published. Although Gunther was an experienced and extremely popular author, his publisher, Harper &amp; Brothers, was reluctant to take on this book. They were concerned that it was too private a subject for the general public. To forestall criticism for profiting off of his death, both the author and the publisher agreed to donate all profits to children&#x27;s cancer research.

==Reception==

Soon after the book&#x27;s release, Dorothy Thompson wrote

But had [Johnny] lived to be 90 and had his achievements filled encyclopedias, he could have made no greater achievement than this, transmitted by his father: To show us what, on its highest levels of courage, serenity, truth and beauty, a human life can be; to show us that as we live we die, and life and death are one.
Katharine Graham, writing for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, wrote &quot;Without doubt, the outstanding work of the week is John Gunther&#x27;s &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;, in the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;. But it is only for the strong-minded or the very strong-hearted...Harper&#x27;s is publishing the book, of which this is a condensed version.&quot;

A reviewer in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;It is this memory [of Johnny] which John Gunther has attempted to preserve in a memoir heart-breaking in its quiet simplicity and restraint.&quot;

&quot;Vogue&quot; magazine described &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot; as &quot;a poignant, factual account of [Gunther&#x27;s] son&#x27;s death.&quot;

Albin Krebs, in his obituary for John Gunther, wrote

The vignette, “Death Be Not Proud,” the profits from which went to children&#x27;s cancer research, was probably Mr. Gunther&#x27;s most vividly memorable work.
==Adaptations==
The story was made into a television movie in 1975, starring Robby Benson as Johnny Gunther, and Arthur Hill as his father.

<text>Christian Dietrich Grabbe (11 December 1801 – 12 September 1836) was a German dramatist of the &quot;Vormärz&quot; era. He wrote many historical plays conceiving a disillusioned and pessimistic world view, with some shrill scenes. Heinrich Heine saw him as one of Germany&#x27;s foremost dramatists, calling him &quot;a drunken Shakespeare&quot; and Sigmund Freud described Grabbe as &quot;an original and rather peculiar poet.&quot;

==Life==
Born in Detmold, the son of a prison officer, he began to write plays in the age of sixteen, while attending the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. A scholarship awarded by Princess Pauline enabled him to study law at the universities of Leipzig and Berlin, where he became acquainted with Heinrich Heine. After graduating in 1823, he unsuccessfully applied as a theatre director.

Grabbe returned to Detmold, he passed the final &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; and tried to find an employment as a legal officer, though also to no avail. Finally in 1826 he was appointed to act as a military legal advisor, initially without remuneration. From 1831 he increasingly suffered from alcoholism. After his fiancée turned away from him, he married his beloved Louise Christina Clostermeier in 1833, but the marriage quickly turned out to be unhappy. The next year Grabbe quit and left Detmold for Frankfurt, where he also fell out with his publisher.

He proceeded to Düsseldorf, where he temporarily worked at the Altes Theater with Karl Leberecht Immermann. Grabbe returned to Detmold in 1836 as a broken man, his wife filed for divorce. He died from general paresis in the same year.

==Legacy==
With Georg Büchner, Grabbe was one of the principal German dramatists of his time. His debut &quot;Herzog Theodor von Gothland&quot; overtaxed contemporary critics by its all-pervasive nihilism. Influenced by Shakespeare and the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement, his plays were very ambitious, with crowd scenes and rapid scene changes that challenged the technical capacity of the theaters of the time. He resolved the strict forms of the classical drama in a loose series of scenes that were a precursor of the realist drama. His plays &quot;Napoleon oder Die hundert Tage&quot; or &quot;Hannibal&quot; reveal a realistic, heterogeneous concept of history.

After his death, he was at first forgotten, but his work was rediscovered by the Naturalist and Expressionist dramatists. He was honored by the Nazis as a great national poet, based on occasional antisemitic statements (particularly in &quot;Aschenbrödel&quot;), and on his nationalistic portrayal of German history, like &quot;Die Hermannsschlacht&quot; on the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In the 1930s, numerous streets were named after him.

The city of Detmold awards the Christian-Dietrich-Grabbe Prize for new dramatic literature since 1994 in association with the &quot;Grabbe-Gesellschaft&quot; literary society and the &quot;Landesverband Lippe&quot; municipal association.

<text>Polyphenols () are a large family of naturally occurring phenols. They are abundant in plants and structurally diverse. Polyphenols include phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannic acid, and ellagitannin, some of which have been used historically as dyes and for tanning garments.


==Etymology==
The name derives from the Ancient Greek word (, meaning &quot;many, much&quot;) and the word ‘phenol’ which refers to a chemical structure formed by attachment of an aromatic benzenoid (phenyl) ring to a hydroxyl (-OH) group (hence the &quot;-ol&quot; suffix). The term &quot;polyphenol&quot; has been in use at least since 1894.

==Definition==
The term polyphenol is not well-defined, but it is generally agreed that they are natural products with &quot;several hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings&quot; including four principal classes: &quot;phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and lignans&quot;.
* Flavonoids include flavones, flavonols, flavanols, flavanones, isoflavones, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins. Particularly abundant flavanoids in foods are catechin (tea, fruits), hesperetin (citrus fruits), cyanidin (red fruits and berries), daidzein (soybean), proanthocyanidins (apple, grape, cocoa), and quercetin (onion, tea, apples).
* Phenolic acids include caffeic acid
* Lignans are polyphenols derived from phenylalanine found in flax seed and other cereals.

===WBSSH definition===

The White–Bate-Smith–Swain–Haslam (WBSSH) definition characterized structural characteristics common to plant phenolics used in tanning (i.e., the tannins).

In terms of properties, the WBSSH describes the polyphenols as follows:
* generally moderately water-soluble compounds
* with molecular weight of 500–4000 Da
* with &gt;12 phenolic hydroxyl groups
* with 5–7 aromatic rings per 1000 Da
In terms of structures, the WBSSH recognizes two structural family that have these properties:
* proanthocyanidins and its derivatives
* galloyl and hexahydroxydiphenoyl esters and their derivatives

===Quideau definition===
According to Stéphane Quideau, the term &quot;polyphenol&quot; refers to compounds derived from the shikimate/phenylpropanoid and/or the polyketide pathway, featuring more than one phenolic unit and deprived of nitrogen-based functions.

Ellagic acid, a molecule at the core of naturally occurring phenolic compounds of varying sizes, is itself not a polyphenol by the WBSSH definition, but is by the Quideau definition. The raspberry ellagitannin, on the other hand, with its 14 gallic acid moieties (most in ellagic acid-type components), and more than 40 phenolic hydroxyl groups, meets the criteria of both definitions of a polyphenol. Other examples of compounds that fall under both the WBSSH and Quideau definitions include the black tea theaflavin-3-gallate shown below, and the hydrolyzable tannin, tannic acid.

==Chemistry==
Polyphenols are reactive species toward oxidation, hence their description as antioxidants in vitro.

=== Structure ===
Polyphenols, such as lignin, are larger molecules (macromolecules). Their upper molecular weight limit is about 800 daltons, which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes so that they can reach intracellular sites of action or remain as pigments once the cell senesces. Hence, many larger polyphenols are biosynthesized &quot;in situ&quot; from smaller polyphenols to non-hydrolyzable tannins and remain undiscovered in the plant matrix. Most polyphenols contain repeating phenolic moieties of pyrocatechol, resorcinol, pyrogallol, and phloroglucinol connected by esters (hydrolyzable tannins) or more stable C-C bonds (nonhydrolyzable condensed tannins). Proanthocyanidins are mostly polymeric units of catechin and epicatechin.
Polyphenols often have functional groups beyond hydroxyl groups. Ether ester linkages are common, as are carboxylic acids.
===Analytical chemistry===
The analysis techniques are those of phytochemistry: extraction, isolation, structural elucidation, then quantification.

===Reactivity===
Polyphenols readily react with metal ions to form coordination complexes, some of which form Metal-phenolic Networks.

====Extraction====
Extraction of polyphenols can be performed using a solvent like water, hot water, methanol, methanol/formic acid, methanol/water/acetic or formic acid. Liquid–liquid extraction can be also performed or countercurrent chromatography. Solid phase extraction can also be made on C18 sorbent cartridges. Other techniques are ultrasonic extraction, heat reflux extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, critical carbon dioxide, high-pressure liquid extraction or use of ethanol in an immersion extractor. The extraction conditions (temperature, extraction time, ratio of solvent to raw material, particle size of the sample, solvent type, and solvent concentrations) for different raw materials and extraction methods have to be optimized. 

Mainly found in the fruit skins and seeds, high levels of polyphenols may reflect only the &quot;measured extractable&quot; polyphenol (EPP) content of a fruit which may also contain non-extractable polyphenols. Black tea contains high amounts of polyphenol and makes up for 20% of its weight.

Concentration can be made by ultrafiltration. Purification can be achieved by preparative chromatography.

====Analysis techniques====
Phosphomolybdic acid is used as a reagent for staining phenolics in thin layer chromatography. Polyphenols can be studied by spectroscopy, especially in the ultraviolet domain, by fractionation or paper chromatography. They can also be analysed by chemical characterisation.

Instrumental chemistry analyses include separation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and especially by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), can be coupled to mass spectrometry. Purified compounds can be identified by the means of nuclear magnetic resonance.

=====Microscopy analysis=====
The DMACA reagent is an histological dye specific to polyphenols used in microscopy analyses. The autofluorescence of polyphenols can also be used, especially for localisation of lignin and suberin. Where fluorescence of the molecules themselves is insufficient for visualization by light microscopy, DPBA (diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester, also referred to as Naturstoff reagent A) has traditionally been used, at least in plant science, to enhance the fluorescence signal.

==== Quantification ====
Polyphenolic content in vitro can be quantified by volumetric titration. An oxidizing agent, permanganate, is used to oxidize known concentrations of a standard tannin solution, producing a standard curve. The tannin content of the unknown is then expressed as equivalents of the appropriate hydrolyzable or condensed tannin.

Some methods for quantification of total polyphenol content in vitro are based on colorimetric measurements. Some tests are relatively specific to polyphenols (for instance the Porter&#x27;s assay). Total phenols (or antioxidant effect) can be measured using the Folin–Ciocalteu reaction. Results are typically expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Polyphenols are seldom evaluated by antibody technologies.

Other tests measure the antioxidant capacity of a fraction. Some make use of the ABTS radical cation which is reactive towards most antioxidants including phenolics, thiols and vitamin C. During this reaction, the blue ABTS radical cation is converted back to its colorless neutral form. The reaction may be monitored spectrophotometrically. This assay is often referred to as the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. The reactivity of the various antioxidants tested are compared to that of Trolox, which is a vitamin E analog.

Other antioxidant capacity assays which use Trolox as a standard include the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays or inhibition of copper-catalyzed &quot;in vitro&quot; human low-density lipoprotein oxidation.

New methods including the use of biosensors can help monitor the content of polyphenols in food.

Quantitation results produced by the mean of diode array detector–coupled HPLC are generally given as relative rather than absolute values as there is a lack of commercially available standards for all polyphenolic molecules.

==Applications==
Some polyphenols are traditionally used as dyes in leather tanning. For instance, in the Indian subcontinent, pomegranate peel, high in tannins and other polyphenols, or its juice, is employed in the dyeing of non-synthetic fabrics.

Of some interest in the era of silver-based photography, pyrogallol and pyrocatechin are among the oldest photographic developers.

===Aspirational use as green chemicals===
Natural polyphenols have long been proposed as renewable precursors to produce plastics or resins by polymerization with formaldehyde, as well as adhesives for particleboards. The aims are generally to make use of plant residues from grape, olive (called pomaces), or pecan shells left after processing.

==Occurrence ==
The most abundant polyphenols are the condensed tannins, found in virtually all families of plants. Larger polyphenols are often concentrated in leaf tissue, the epidermis, bark layers, flowers and fruits but also play important roles in the decomposition of forest litter, and nutrient cycles in forest ecology. Absolute concentrations of total phenols in plant tissues differ widely depending on the literature source, type of polyphenols and assay; they are in the range of 1–25% total natural phenols and polyphenols, calculated with reference to the dry green leaf mass.

Polyphenols are also found in animals. In arthropods, such as insects, and crustaceans polyphenols play a role in epicuticle hardening (sclerotization). The hardening of the cuticle is due to the presence of a polyphenol oxidase. In crustaceans, there is a second oxidase activity leading to cuticle pigmentation. There is apparently no polyphenol tanning occurring in arachnids cuticle.

==Biochemistry==
Polyphenols are thought to play diverse roles in the ecology of plants. These functions include:
* Release and suppression of growth hormones such as auxin.
* UV screens to protect against ionizing radiation and to provide coloration (plant pigments).
* Deterrence of herbivores (sensory properties).
* Prevention of microbial infections (phytoalexins).
* Signaling molecules in ripening and other growth processes.
* In some woods can explain their natural preservation against rot.

Flax and &quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot; (a submerged aquatic plant) secrete polyphenols that are involved in allelopathic interactions.

===Biosynthesis and metabolism===
Polyphenols incorporate smaller parts and building blocks from simpler natural phenols, which originate from the phenylpropanoid pathway for the phenolic acids or the shikimic acid pathway for gallotannins and analogs. Flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives are biosynthesized from phenylalanine and malonyl-CoA. Complex gallotannins develop through the &quot;in vitro&quot; oxidation of 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose or dimerization processes resulting in hydrolyzable tannins. For anthocyanidins, precursors of the condensed tannin biosynthesis, dihydroflavonol reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) are crucial enzymes with subsequent addition of catechin and epicatechin moieties for larger, non-hydrolyzable tannins.

The glycosylated form develops from glucosyltransferase activity and increases the solubility of polyphenols.

Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of o-diphenols to produce o-quinones. It is the rapid polymerisation of o-quinones to produce black, brown or red polyphenolic pigments that causes fruit browning. In insects, PPO is involved in cuticle hardening.

===Occurrence in food===

Polyphenols comprise up to 0.2–0.3% fresh weight for many fruits. Consuming common servings of wine, chocolate, legumes or tea may also contribute to about one gram of intake per day. According to a 2005 review on polyphenols:

The most important food sources are commodities widely consumed in large quantities such as fruit and vegetables, green tea, black tea, red wine, coffee, chocolate, olives, and extra virgin olive oil. Herbs and spices, nuts and algae are also potentially significant for supplying certain polyphenols. Some polyphenols are specific to particular food (flavanones in citrus fruit, isoflavones in soya, phloridzin in apples); whereas others, such as quercetin, are found in all plant products such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, leguminous plants, tea, and wine.

Some polyphenols are considered antinutrients – compounds that interfere with the absorption of essential nutrients – especially iron and other metal ions, which may bind to digestive enzymes and other proteins, particularly in ruminants.

In a comparison of cooking methods, phenolic and carotenoid levels in vegetables were retained better by steaming compared to frying. Polyphenols in wine, beer and various nonalcoholic juice beverages can be removed using finings, substances that are usually added at or near the completion of the processing of brewing.

==== Astringency ====
With respect to food and beverages, the cause of astringency is not fully understood, but it is measured chemically as the ability of a substance to precipitate proteins.

Astringency increases and bitterness decrease with the mean degree of polymerization. For water-soluble polyphenols, molecular weights between 500 and 3000 were reported to be required for protein precipitation. However, smaller molecules might still have astringent qualities likely due to the formation of unprecipitated complexes with proteins or cross-linking of proteins with simple phenols that have 1,2-dihydroxy or 1,2,3-trihydroxy groups. Flavonoid configurations can also cause significant differences in sensory properties, e.g. epicatechin is more bitter and astringent than its chiral isomer catechin. In contrast, hydroxycinnamic acids do not have astringent qualities, but are bitter.

==Research==

Polyphenols are a large, diverse group of compounds, making it difficult to determine their biological effects. They are not considered nutrients, as they are not used for growth, survival or reproduction, nor do they provide dietary energy. Therefore, they do not have recommended daily intake levels, as exist for vitamins, minerals, and fiber. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance to manufacturers that polyphenols cannot be mentioned on food labels as antioxidant nutrients unless physiological evidence exists to verify such a qualification and a Dietary Reference Intake value has been established characteristics which have not been determined for polyphenols.

In the European Union, two health claims were authorized between 2012 and 2015: 1) flavanols in cocoa solids at doses exceeding 200 mg per day may contribute to maintenance of vascular elasticity and normal blood flow; 2) olive oil polyphenols (5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (e.g. oleuropein complex and tyrosol) may &quot;contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage&quot;, if consumed daily.

As of 2022, clinical trials that assessed the effect of polyphenols on health biomarkers are limited, with results difficult to interpret due to the wide variation of intake values for both individual polyphenols and total polyphenols.

Polyphenols were once considered as antioxidants, but this concept is obsolete. Most polyphenols are metabolized by catechol-O-methyltransferase, and therefore do not have the chemical structure allowing antioxidant activity in vivo; they may exert biological activity as signaling molecules. Some polyphenols are considered to be bioactive compounds for which development of dietary recommendations was under consideration in 2017.

=== Cardiovascular diseases ===
In the 1930s, polyphenols (then called &quot;vitamin P&quot;) were considered as a factor in capillary permeability, followed by various studies through the 21st century of a possible effect on cardiovascular diseases. For most polyphenols, there is no evidence for an effect on cardiovascular regulation, although there are some reviews showing a minor effect of consuming polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid or flavan-3-ols, on blood pressure.

=== Cancer ===
Higher intakes of soy isoflavones may be associated with reduced risks of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and prostate cancer in men.

A 2019 systematic review found that intake of soy and soy isoflavones is associated with a lower risk of mortality from gastric, colorectal, breast and lung cancers. The study found that an increase in isoflavone consumption by 10 mg per day was associated with a 7% decrease in risk from all cancers, and an increase in consumption of soy protein by 5 grams per day produced a 12% reduction in breast cancer risk.

=== Cognitive function ===
Polyphenols are under preliminary research for possible cognitive effects in healthy adults.

=== Phytoestrogens ===
Isoflavones, which are structurally related to 17β-estradiol, are classified as phytoestrogens. A risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority found no cause for concern when isoflavones are consumed in a normal diet.

=== Phlebotonic ===

Phlebotonics of heterogeneous composition, consisting partly of citrus peel extracts (flavonoids, such as hesperidin) and synthetic compounds, are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids. Some are non-prescription dietary supplements, such as diosmin, while one other – Vasculera (Diosmiplex) – is a prescription medical food intended for treating venous disorders. Their mechanism of action is undefined, and clinical evidence of benefit for using phlebotonics to treat venous diseases is limited.

=== Gut microbiome ===
Polyphenols are extensively metabolized by the gut microbiota and are investigated as a potential metabolic factor in function of the gut microbiota.

=== Toxicity and adverse effects ===
Adverse effects of polyphenol intake range from mild (e.g., gastrointestinal tract symptoms) to severe (e.g., hemolytic anemia or hepatotoxicity). In 1988, hemolytic anemia following polyphenol consumption was documented, resulting in the withdrawal of a catechin-containing drug. Polyphenols, particularly in beverages that contain them in high concentrations (tea, coffee, etc), inhibit the absorption of non-haem iron when consumed together in a single meal. Research is limited on the effect of this inhibition on iron status.

Metabolism of polyphenols can result in flavonoid-drug interactions, such as in grapefruit–drug interactions, which involves inhibition of the liver enzyme, CYP3A4, likely by grapefruit furanocoumarins, a class of polyphenol. The European Food Safety Authority established upper limits for some polyphenol-containing supplements and additives, such as green tea extract or curcumin. For most polyphenols found in the diet, an adverse effect beyond nutrient-drug interactions is unlikely.

<text>Ian Wallace was the pen name of American science-fiction author John Wallace Pritchard (1912–1998).

==Introduction==

Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois, but spent most of his life living in and around Detroit, Michigan. Wallace was a practicing clinical psychologist for many years, and also had an extensive background in education. Much of his career was spent working for the Detroit public schools system.

Wallace&#x27;s mystery and adventure novels were generally set deep in the future, and often included characters with superhuman or telepathic abilities.

<doc id="362895" wikidata="Q208120" url="?curid=362895" title="Caryatid">
<text>A caryatid ( ; ; ) is a sculpted female figure serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar supporting an entablature on her head. The Greek term &quot;karyatides&quot; literally means &quot;maidens of Karyai&quot;, an ancient town on the Peloponnese. Karyai had a temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis in her aspect of Artemis Karyatis: &quot;As Karyatis she rejoiced in the dances of the nut-tree village of Karyai, those Karyatides, who in their ecstatic round-dance carried on their heads baskets of live reeds, as if they were dancing plants&quot;.

An atlas or atlantid or telamon is a male version of a caryatid, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a sculpted male statue serving as an architectural support.

==Etymology==
The term is first recorded in the Latin form &quot;caryatides&quot; by the Roman architect Vitruvius. He stated in his 1st century BC work &quot;De architectura&quot; (I.1.5) that certain female figures represented the punishment of the women of Caryae, a town near Sparta in Laconia, who were condemned to slavery after betraying Athens by siding with Persia in the Greco-Persian Wars. However, Vitruvius&#x27;s explanation is doubtful; well before the Persian Wars, female figures were used as decorative supports in Greece and the ancient Near East. Vitruvius&#x27;s explanation is dismissed as an error by Camille Paglia in Glittering Images and not even mentioned by Mary Lefkowitz in Black Athena Revisited. They both say the term refers to young women worshipping Artemis in Caryae through dance. Lefkowitz says that the term &quot;comes from the Spartan city of Caryae, where young women did a ring dance around an open-air statue of the goddess Artemis, locally identified with a walnut tree.&quot; Bernard Sergent specifies that the dancers came to the small town of Caryae from nearby Sparta. Nevertheless, the association of caryatids with slavery persists and is prevalent in Renaissance art.

The ancient Caryae supposedly was one of the six adjacent villages that united to form the original township of Sparta, and the hometown of Menelaos&#x27; queen, Helen of Troy. Girls from Caryae were considered especially beautiful, strong, and capable of giving birth to strong children.

A caryatid supporting a basket on her head is called a &quot;canephora&quot; (&quot;basket-bearer&quot;), representing one of the maidens who carried sacred objects used at feasts of the goddesses Athena and Artemis. The Erectheion caryatids, in a shrine dedicated to an archaic king of Athens, may therefore represent priestesses of Artemis in Caryae, a place named for the &quot;nut-tree sisterhood&quot; – apparently in Mycenaean times, like other plural feminine toponyms, such as Hyrai or Athens itself.

The later male counterpart of the caryatid is referred to as a telamon (plural &quot;telamones&quot;) or atlas (plural &quot;atlantes&quot;) – the name refers to the legend of Atlas, who bore the sphere of the heavens on his shoulders. Such figures were used on a monumental scale, notably in the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Agrigento, Sicily.

==Ancient usage==

Some of the earliest known examples were found in the treasuries of Delphi, including that of Siphnos, dating to the 6th century BC. However, their use as supports in the form of women can be traced back even earlier, to ritual basins, ivory mirror handles from Phoenicia, and draped figures from archaic Greece.

The best-known and most-copied examples are those of the six figures of the Caryatid porch of the Erechtheion on the Acropolis at Athens. One of those original six figures, removed by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century in an act which severely damaged the temple and is widely considered to be vandalism and looting, is currently in the British Museum in London. The Greek government does not recognise the British Museum&#x27;s claims to own any part of the Acropolis temples and the return of the stolen Caryatid to Athens along with the rest of the so-called Elgin Marbles is the subject of a major international campaign. The Acropolis Museum holds the other five figures, which are replaced onsite by replicas. The five originals that are in Athens are now being exhibited in the new Acropolis Museum, on a special balcony that allows visitors to view them from all sides. The pedestal for the caryatid removed to London remains empty, awaiting its return. From 2011 to 2015, they were cleaned by a specially constructed laser beam, which removed accumulated soot and grime without harming the marble&#x27;s patina. Each caryatid was cleaned in place, with a television circuit relaying the spectacle live to museum visitors.

Although of the same height and build, and similarly attired and coiffed, the six Caryatids are not the same: their faces, stance, draping, and hair are carved separately; the three on the left stand on their right foot, while the three on the right stand on their left foot. Their bulky, intricately arranged hairstyles serve the crucial purpose of providing static support to their necks, which would otherwise be the thinnest and structurally weakest part.

The Romans also copied the Erechtheion caryatids, installing copies in the Forum of Augustus and the Pantheon in Rome, and at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa at Tivoli. Another Roman example, found on the Via Appia, is the Townley Caryatid.

==Renaissance and after==

In Early Modern times, the practice of integrating caryatids into building facades was revived, and in interiors they began to be employed in fireplaces, which had not been a feature of buildings in Antiquity and offered no precedents. Early interior examples are the figures of Heracles and Iole carved on the jambs of a monumental fireplace in the &quot;Sala della Jole&quot; of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, Venice, about 1450. In the following century Jacopo Sansovino, both sculptor and architect, carved a pair of female figures supporting the shelf of a marble chimneypiece at Villa Garzoni, near Padua. No architect mentioned the device until 1615, when Palladio&#x27;s pupil Vincenzo Scamozzi included a chapter devoted to chimneypieces in his &quot;Idea della archittura universale&quot;. Those in the apartments of princes and important personages, he considered, might be grand enough for chimneypieces with caryatid supporters, such as one he illustrated and a similar one he installed in the &quot;Sala dell&#x27;Anticollegio&quot;, also in the Doge&#x27;s Palace.
In the 16th century, from the examples engraved for Sebastiano Serlio&#x27;s treatise on architecture, caryatids became a fixture in the decorative vocabulary of Northern Mannerism expressed by the Fontainebleau School and the engravers of designs in Antwerp. In the early 17th century, interior examples appear in Jacobean interiors in England; in Scotland the overmantel in the great hall of Muchalls Castle remains an early example. Caryatids remained part of the German Baroque vocabulary and were refashioned in more restrained and &quot;Grecian&quot; forms by neoclassical architects and designers, such as the four terracotta caryatids on the porch of St Pancras New Church, London (1822).

Many caryatids lined up on the facade of the 1893 Palace of the Arts housing the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. In the arts of design, the draped figure supporting an acanthus-grown basket capital taking the form of a candlestick or a table-support is a familiar cliché of neoclassical decorative arts. The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota has caryatids as a motif on its eastern facade.
In 1905 American sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens created a caryatid porch for the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York in which four of the eight figures (the other four figures holding only wreaths) represented a different art form, &quot;Architecture, Painting, Sculpture&quot;, and &quot;Music&quot;.

Auguste Rodin&#x27;s 1881 sculpture &quot;Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone&quot; (part of his monumental &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot; work) shows a fallen caryatid. Robert Heinlein described this piece in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;: &quot;Now here we have another emotional symbol... for almost three thousand years or longer, architects have designed buildings with columns shaped as female figures... After all those centuries it took Rodin to see that this was work too heavy for a girl... Here is this poor little caryatid who has tried—and failed, fallen under the load... She didn&#x27;t give up, Ben; she&#x27;s still trying to lift that stone after it has crushed her...&quot;

In Act 2 of his 1953 play &#x27;Waiting for Godot&#x27;, author Samuel Beckett has Estragon say &quot;We are not caryatids!&quot; when he and Vladimir tire of &quot;cart(ing) around&quot; the recently blinded Pozzo.

Agnes Varda made two short films documenting Caryatid columns around Paris.
1984 Les Dites Cariatides
2005 Les Dites Cariatides Bis.

The musical group Son Volt evoke the caryatides and their burden borne in poetic metaphor on the song &quot;Caryatid Easy&quot; from their 1997 album Straightaways, with singer Jay Farrar reproving an unidentified lover with the line &quot;you play the caryatid easy.&quot;

<text>Märzen () or Märzenbier () is a lager that originated in Bavaria, Germany. It has a medium to full body and may vary in colour from pale through amber to dark brown. It was the beer traditionally served at the Munich Oktoberfest. The geographical indication Oktoberfestbier is protected in the EU and can only be used for &quot;Märzen&quot; that is brewed in Munich.

== History ==
&quot;Märzen&quot; has its origins in Bavaria, probably before the 16th century. A Bavarian brewing ordinance decreed in 1553 that beer may be brewed only between 29 September (St. Michael&#x27;s Day or Michaelmas) and 23 April (St. George&#x27;s Day or Georgi), as the high summertime temperatures were more likely to cause off-flavoured beer due to elevated ambient fermentation temperatures.

Märzen was brewed in March, with moderate and balanced hopping levels, malt and slightly higher alcohol content that would allow the beer to last while the brewing of new beer was forbidden from 24 April to 28 September. The beer was then allowed to lager in ice and straw filled beer cellars until autumn.

The original &quot;Märzen&quot; was described as &quot;dark brown, full-bodied, and bitter&quot;. The beer was often kept in the cellar until late in the summer, and then served at the Oktoberfest.

Common names for &quot;Märzen&quot; in Germany and Austria include &quot;Märzenbier&quot;, &quot;Wiener Märzen&quot;, &quot;Festbier&quot; and &quot;Oktoberfestbier&quot;.

=== &quot;Märzen&quot; in Germany and Austria ===
&quot;Märzen&quot; is now a rarity in Germany and is mainly found in the South, often in varieties that explicitly refer to its association with Oktoberfest, such as the &quot;Oktoberfest Bier&quot; from the Paulaner brewery. In Austria, however, &quot;Märzen&quot; is the name given to the most popular type of beer, but the Austrian &quot;Märzen&quot; is lighter in color and taste and corresponds, more or less, to a Bavarian Helles or Export beer. The reason for this has to do with Austrian post-war regulations which limited the prices of essential food and drink products. &quot;Märzenbier&quot; was a preferred variety due to its reputation as a festive drink and its high pre-war price, but brewers reduced its malt and alcohol content in order to maintain its profitability at its newly limited price.

==Description==
In comparison to a Bavarian pale lager, the traditional &quot;Märzen&quot; style is characterised by a fuller body, and a sweeter and often less hoppy flavour. It typically contains 5.1–6.0% alcohol by volume.

The Austrian style is light in colour, body and flavour balance, and is the most popular beer style among the beers in Austria. Austrian &quot;Märzenbiers&quot; often use caramel malts that impart a sweeter flavour than their German counterparts; other Austrian &quot;Märzen&quot; overlap stylistically with Munich-style &quot;Helles&quot;.

Brewers in the Czech Republic have been producing &quot;Märzen&quot; style beer, called &quot;březňák&quot; or &quot;marcovní&quot; (March beer), since the 15th century. Today&#x27;s equivalents are legally defined as 14° lagers called &quot;světlé speciální pivo&quot; (light special beer), &quot;polotmavé speciální pivo&quot; (half-dark special beer), and &quot;tmavé speciální pivo&quot; (dark special beer).

In Lithuania, Švyturys produces a Märzen stlye beer called &quot;Baltijos&quot;.

Żywiec, a Polish brewery, produces a &quot;Märzen&quot; style lager called &quot;piwo lager typu marcowe&quot; (March type lager beer), or simply &quot;Marcowe&quot;.
