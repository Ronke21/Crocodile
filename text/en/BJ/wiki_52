<text>Chernivtsi (, ; , ; see also other names) is a city in southwestern Ukraine on the upper course of the Prut River. Formerly the capital of the historic region of Bukovina, which is now divided between Romania and Ukraine, Chernivtsi serves as the administrative center for the Chernivtsi urban hromada, the Chernivtsi Raion, and the oblast itself. In 2022, the Chernivtsi population, by estimate, is and the latest census in 2001 was 240,600.

The first document that refers to this city dates back to 1408, when Chernivtsi was a town in the region of Moldavia, formerly as a defensive fortification, and became the center of Bukovina in 1488. In 1538, Chernivtsi was under the control of the Principality of Moldavia under Polish suzerainty, later under Ottoman Empire suzerainty, and the Moldavian control lasted for two centuries until 1774, when Austria took control of Bukovina in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War. Chernivtsi (known at that time as ) became the center of the Galicia&#x27;s Bukovina District until 1848, later becoming the Duchy of Bukovina until 1918. In the aftermath of World War I, Romania united with Bukovina in 1918, which led to the city regaining its Romanian name of ; this lasted until the Soviets occupied Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Chernivtsi was under the control of the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1941, after which Romania recovered the city, and then again from 1944 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, after which it became part of independent Ukraine.

Chernivtsi is viewed as one of Western Ukraine&#x27;s main cultural centers. The city is also considered one of Ukraine&#x27;s important educational and architectural sites. Historically a cosmopolitan community, Chernivtsi was once dubbed &quot;Little Vienna&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem upon the Prut&quot;. The city is a major regional rail and road transportation hub, also housing an international airport.

== Names ==
Aside from its Ukrainian name of Chernivtsi, the city is also known by several different names in various languages, which still are used by the respective population groups much as they used to be throughout the city&#x27;s history, either in connection with the rule by one country or another or independently from it:
* ();
* ,
* , (In ).

In the times of Halych-Volyn Principality (1199-1253), the city&#x27;s name was &quot;Chern&quot;.

In &quot;Documents of Western Russia&quot; () published in Saint Petersburg in 1846 (Volume 1, page 32, document #21), the city is mentioned as Chernov&#x27;tsi ().

== History ==


=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence discovered in the area surrounding Chernivtsi indicates that a population inhabited it since the Neolithic era. Later settlements included those of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, the Corded Ware culture; artifacts from the Bronze and Iron Ages were also found in the city. In the Middle Ages there lived East Slavic tribes White Croats and Tivertsi.

=== Under Principality of Halych ===
A fortified settlement located on the left (north-eastern) shore of the Prut dates back to the time of the Principality of Halych and is thought to have been built by Grand Prince Yaroslav Osmomysl. Legendary accounts refer to this fortress-city as &quot;Chern&quot;&#x27;, or &quot;Black city&quot;; it is said to owe its name to the black color of the city walls, built from dark oak layered with local black-colored soil. This early stronghold was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Europe by Boroldai in 1259. However, the remaining ramparts of the fortress were still used for defense purposes; in the 17th century they were augmented with several bastions, one of which is still extant.

Following the destruction of the fortress, later settlements in the area centered on the right (south-western) shore of the Prut River, at a more strategically advantageous, elevated location. In 1325, when the Kingdom of Poland seized control of Galicia, and came into contact with the early Vlach (Romanian) feudal formations, a fort was mentioned under the name &quot;Țețina&quot;; it was defending the ford and crossing point on the Prut River. It was part of a group of three fortifications; the other two being the fortress of Hotin on the Dniester to the east, and a fort on the Kolachin River, an upriver tributary of Prut.

=== Under the Principality of Moldavia ===

Between 1359 and 1775, the city and its surroundings were part of the Principality of Moldavia, one of the historic provinces of Romania; the city being the administrative center of the homonymous &quot;ținut&quot; (county). The name Cernăuți is first attested in a document by Alexandru cel Bun (Alexander the Good) on 8 October 1408. In Ottoman sources, the city was mentioned as &quot;Çernovi&quot;.

=== Under Austro-Hungarian rule and Romanian control ===
In 1775, the northwestern part of the territory of Moldavia was annexed by the Habsburg Empire; this region became known as Bukovina. The city became the region&#x27;s capital, organized as the Bukovina District part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, which in 1849 was raised in status and became known as the Duchy of Bukovina, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city received Magdeburg rights. The city began to flourish in 1778 when Knight Karl von Enzenberg was appointed the chief of the Military Administration. He invited many merchants, craftsmen and entrepreneurs to help develop trade and other businesses. Saint Peter&#x27;s Fairs (1–15 July) had given a new vibrant impulse to the market development from 1786. In the late 19th century the German language—due to the Habsburg and the very important Jewish influence—became the lingua franca and more and more newspapers were edited in German, also a remarkable literary production in German began in this period, featuring most prominently Karl Emil Franzos.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Chernivtsi became a center of both Romanian and Ukrainian national movements. In 1908, it was the site of the first Yiddish language conference, the Czernowitz Conference, coordinated by Nathan Birnbaum. When Austria-Hungary dissolved in 1918, followed by two years of political uncertainty in Europe due to the aftermath of World War I, the city and its surrounding area became part of the Kingdom of Romania, which gained worldwide diplomatic recognition by the end of 1920. During those two years, even most city residents did not know of which country they were citizens, with most assuming Czernowitz still belonged to Austria-Hungary. German remained the lingua franca of the city and its suburbs for another decade. In 1930, the city reached a population of 112,400: 26.8% Jews, 23.2% Romanians, 20.8% Germans, 18.6% Ukrainians, the remainder Poles and others. It was one of the five university centers of interwar Romania.

=== Soviet occupation and rule ===

In 1940, the Red Army occupied the area; the area around the city became known as Chernivtsi Oblast, and was allotted to the Ukrainian SSR by the Soviet Union. The city&#x27;s large Romanian intelligentsia found refuge in Romania; while the Bukovina Germans were &quot;repatriated&quot; according to a Soviet-Nazi agreement. Under the regime of military dictator Ion Antonescu, Romania had switched from an ally of France and Britain to one of Nazi Germany; subsequently, in July 1941, the Romanian Army retook the city as part of the Axis attack on the Soviet Union during World War II. Chernivtsi would become the capital of the Romanian Bukovina Governorate. In August 1941, Antonescu ordered the creation of a ghetto in the lowland part of the city, where 50,000 Bukovina Jews were crammed, two-thirds of whom would be deported in October 1941 and early 1942 to Transnistria, where the majority of the deportees died. The Romanian mayor of the city Traian Popovici managed to persuade Antonescu to raise the number of Jews exempted from deportation from 200 to 20,000.

In 1944, when Axis forces were driven out by the Red Army, the city was reincorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. Over the following years, most of the Jews emigrated to Israel; the city was an important node in the Berihah network. Bukovina Poles were expelled by the Soviets after World War II. The city became a predominantly Ukrainian one.

=== Independence ===
Since 1991, Chernivtsi has been a part of an independent Ukraine. In May 1999, Romania opened a consulate general in the city.

Until 18 July 2020, Chernivtsi was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to any raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernivtsi Oblast to three, the city was merged into Chernivtsi Raion.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city has been a host for refugees from the fighting in eastern and central Ukraine and a resting point for refugees on their way to nearby Romania. Some Chernivtsi residents have also left the country.

== Symbolics ==
=== Coat of arms ===
The Chernivtsi coat of arms is framed by a bronze ornamental cartouche, and a red heraldic shield depicting an open stone gate with a figured trident in the middle. Under the gate, there are two crossed laurel branches, tied with ribbons. The crown of the symbol is the stone crown.

=== Flag of Chernivtsi ===

The Chernivtsi flag consists of a tree, the top, and a rectangular cloth, the front of which forms framed by a red tooth-like ornament white background with an inscription in Ukrainian in the center, over which there is inscribed in Ukrainian: &quot;Chernivtsi&quot;. Under the coat of arms, there is the sign &quot;1408&quot; – the date of the first written mention of the city. On both sides of the coat of arms and all four corners of the field are filled with floral ornaments and with the addition of two beech branches with nuts and leaves. The reverse side is formed by a yellow background with the coat of arms of Ukraine in the center with frames and ornaments similar to the front side.

=== Honorary chain of the mayor of Chernivtsi ===
The mayor&#x27;s honorary chain is a symbol of Chernivtsi mayor&#x27;s authority, which is served on behalf of the territorial community. Founded in 1908 and restored in 2008. The symbol is a medallion with the inscription engraved on it: &quot;From Chernivtsi community to freely elected head&quot;, on the reverse – &quot;The foundation of a free state is a free community&quot;. The medallion is attached to a chain consisting of stylized coats of arms Ukraine, Chernivtsi region and the city of Chernivtsi. The symbol is made of gold colour metal.

=== Medal &quot;To the glory of Chernivtsi&quot; ===

The medal &quot;To the glory of Chernivtsi&quot; is an honorary distinction of the Chernivtsi City Council, introduced to the 600th Anniversary of Chernivtsi (2008) in order to reward individuals who actively contributed to the prosperity of the city and its promotion in Ukraine and the world. The award is made of silver-gilt, it has a circle shape with a diameter of 28 mm (1&quot;). The medal&#x27;s strip is white with red stripes, which corresponds to the colours of the Chernivtsi flag. At the bottom of the strip, there is a beech branch. The obverse depicts the emblem of Chernivtsi and the inscription – &quot;To the glory of Chernivtsi&quot;. On the reverse – the official Chernivtsi logo, designed and approved for the anniversary. The medal is awarded, according to the decision of the executive committee of the City Council, annually during the celebration of the city day.

The official motto of modern Chernivtsi, &quot;Спільними зусиллями!&quot;, is a Ukrainian-language version of the Latin &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; (&quot;With United Forces&quot;), the personal motto of Franz Joseph, who personally bestowed the right to use it on Chernivtsi. This indicates a special attitude of the emperor to the city. Along with the capital of Bukovina, only the first naval ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy (SMS &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;) was honoured with such honour.

=== Logotype of Chernivtsi ===
The official &quot;Chernivtsi 600&quot; logo was developed and approved by the anniversary of the city in 2008. It was recognized so successful that it continues to be used. The main idea of components for emblem is based on the antiquity of the city, its exceptional architectural heritage and the hard work of its inhabitants. The symbol is made in the form of a blacksmith&#x27;s work of art, which testifies to the soundness, prosperity, and success. The color scheme of the logo, represented by dark blue and yellow, has a higher degree of comfortable contrast and coincides with the colors of the State Flag of Ukraine.

In the early 2010s, a new city logo was developed and approved, and at the same time the official slogan was affixed: &quot;Chernivtsi is unique in diversity&quot;. Old and new symbols of Chernivtsi were chosen for its creation. To the left, in the foreground, there is a trumpet player who wins the trumpet tune &quot;Marichka&quot;. In the middle of the background, there is the town hall. The former Metropolitan Residence of Bukovina and Dalmatia which is recognized as the architectural pearl of the city is pictured to the right in the background.

The colour scheme of the logo represented in orange, blue and red, the name is purple. Such a combination is characteristic of tourism, which uses the notion of happiness, well-being, the joy of relaxation, visualizing positive symbols and images in a colourful, warm and vibrant colour scheme. The new logo uses old symbols from the &quot;Chernivtsi 600&quot; logo.

== Geography ==
Chernivtsi is located in the historic region of Bukovina, which is currently shared between Romania (south) and Ukraine (north). Chernivtsi is located in the southwest of Ukraine, in the eastern Carpathians, on the border between the Carpathians and the East European Plain, 40 km (25 miles) from the border with Romania. The city lies 248 meters (817&#x27;) above sea level and is surrounded by forests and fields. The River Prut runs through the city&#x27;s landscape. The city is located in the Eastern European time zone in the region of meridian 26.

Chernivtsi is located at the intersection of the transport arteries: E85, H03, and H10

=== Climate ===
The city is located in a temperate climate zone. The climate is continental with mild winters and warm summers. The average annual temperature is +8,6 °C (47 °F), the lowest in January (-2,9 °C; 27 °F), the highest – in July (+19,8 °C; 68 °F). Winter weather usually comes on 28 November and ends 9 March; summer weather begins on 20 May, and ends on 10 September. The average annual rainfall in Chernivtsi is 621 mm (&quot;), with the lowest – in October and January–February, the highest – in June–July. Sometimes there are heavy rains during the summer. Snow cover is formed each winter, but its altitude is insignificant. The average wind speed ranges from 3.3 m/s (7 mph) in July to 4.0 m/s (9 mph) in January. The average annual humidity is 76%.
=== Landscape ===
The total area of Chernivtsi within the administrative boundaries of 2013 is about . According to the functional purpose the lands of the city are divided as follows: land of residential and public buildings (64%), lands of agricultural purpose (17%), lands of industry (9%), lands of recreational and environmental purpose (5%), lands of general use (3%), commercial land (2%).

The main water source of Chernivtsi is the Prut River in its upper reaches, which divides the city in half. Besides, there are six small streams and nine lakes within the city.

The relief is characterized by significant relief dip – from 150 metres (492&#x27;) above sea level in the Prut valleys to 537 metres (1762&#x27;) in the western outskirts (Mount Tsetzino), which is caused by the location on the Chernivtsi Upland.

Chernivtsi is considered to be a &quot;green city&quot;: the large territory is occupied by parks, squares, gardens, alleys and flower gardens. Nine objects are recognized as monuments of landscape art. The city has a botanical garden at the Yuriy Fedkovych National University with a unique orangery.

=== State of the environment ===
At the end of the twentieth century, the main pollutants of the Chernivtsi environment were industrial enterprises, including the MIC. In the 1990s much of them ceased to exist or significantly reduced production capacity and thus reduced industrial emissions. Despite this, 58 enterprises (38.4% of the total amount in the region) are the main pollutants of the environment. Approximately 1.2 tonnes of pollutants are released into the air annually (34.9% of the total area emissions). Non-methane volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and substances in the form of solid suspended solids predominate in the structure of the emitted pollutants. In addition, carbon dioxide, which has a greenhouse effect, is periodically released into the atmosphere of the city. Emissions from stationary sources were 7.9 tonnes per of Chernivtsi territory. Each inhabitant of the regional center accounts for an average of of harmful emissions per year.

In 2008, Chernivtsi established an Environmental Monitoring System (EMS), an information structure that integrates environmental monitoring organizations and industrial enterprises that pollute the environment or which may adversely affect the environment or its components.

Since the late 1990s, transport is a significant factor in the negative impact on the environment. To some extent, the situation was improved with the construction of the first (2004) and the second (2010) queues of the bypass road, which connected the directions &quot;Kyiv-Chernivtsi&quot; and &quot;Chernivtsi-Suceava&quot;. The problem of transit transport in the city will be finally resolved after the construction of the third branch of the bypass road, which will connect the directions &quot;Suceava-Chernivtsi&quot; and &quot;Chernivtsi-Lviv&quot;.

== Government ==

Chernivtsi is the administrative center of the Chernivtsi Oblast (province) and the city itself has own government within the oblast under subordination to Chernivtsi Raion.

== Demographics ==
The population, according to the data of the 2001 population census in Ukraine, was 236,691 inhabitants. Among them, there 189,021 identified themselves as ethnic Ukrainians (79.86%), 26,733 as Russians (11.29%), 10,553 as Romanians (4.36%), 3,829 as Moldovans (1.62%), 1,408 as Poles; (0.59%), 1,308 as Jews (0.55%) and 971 as members of other groups (0.41%).

Based on the last available Soviet data, the population of the city, as of 1 January 1989, was 258,375 residents. Among these, there are some 171,925 Ukrainians (66.5%), 45,865 Russians (17.8%), 13,017 Romanians (5%), 6,361 Moldovans (2.5%), 2,205 Poles (0.9%), 1,725 Belarussians (0.7%) and 15,671 Jews (6.1%).

The Romanian population in Chernivtsi started decreasing rapidly after 1950. Many Romanians fled to Romania or were deported to Siberia (where most of them died), and the remaining Romanian population quickly became a minority and assimilated with the majority. According to minority organizations, the Romanian minority in Chernivtsi is still decreasing nowadays as a result of cultural assimilation and emigration to Romania.

Chernivtsi once had a Jewish community of over 50,000, less than a third of whom survived World War II. Romanian lawyer and reserve officer , as well as the then city mayor Traian Popovici, supported by General Vasile Ionescu saved 19,689 Jewish people. Initially, Governor of Bukovina Corneliu Calotescu allowed only 190 Jewish people to stay, but Traian Popovici, after an incredible effort, obtained from the then dictator of Romania Marshal Ion Antonescu an allowance of 20,000. After World War II, the city was a key node in the Berihah network, which helped Jews to emigrate to the then Mandate Palestine from the difficult conditions after the War. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and the United States. A famous member of this latter emigration is the actress Mila Kunis.

Chernivtsi was inhabited by Ukrainians, Romanians, Poles, Ruthenians, Jews, Roma, and Germans. During its affiliation with the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Chernivtsi enjoyed prosperity and culture as the capital of the Bukovina crown land. Until 1918, the main language of the city was German, which, in addition to the Germans, was also spoken by Jews (together they made up half the population of the city) and even partly by Ukrainians, Romanians and Poles. After World War II, the Shoah and Porajmos, and the resettlement and expulsion of the whole ethnic groups, including Germans and Romanians, this status was diminished. Today, the Ukrainians are the dominant population group.

Chernivtsi&#x27;s change in demographic diversity is demonstrated by the following population statistics. Once, Romanians and Ukrainians formed the majority of the population. However, after 1870, Yiddish-speaking or German-speaking Jews surpassed the Romanians as the largest population group of the town. After 1880, the Ukrainians surpassed the Romanians as the second-largest population group.

The city is sometimes dubbed &quot;Little Vienna&quot;, because its architecture is reminiscent of the Austro-Hungarian capital Vienna.

The main architectural attractions of the city include: Olha Kobylianska Chernivtsi Drama Theater (1905); Chernivtsi Town Hall (1847); the Residence of Bukovinian and Damatian Metropolitans (the building of Chernivtsi University)—UNESCO World Heritage Site (1882); Chernivtsi University Botanical Garden (1877); the Regional Museum of Fine Arts—the former savings bank (1900); the building of the Regional Council—former Palace of Justice (1906); and the Chernivtsi Palace of Culture—former Jewish National House (1908); among many others. The Moorish Revival Czernowitz Synagogue was heavily damaged by fire in 1941, the walls were used to create the &quot;Chernivtsi&quot; movie theater.

The Czech architect Josef Hlávka designed, in 1864–1882, the buildings that currently house the Chernivtsi State University. They were originally the residence of the Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans. The Romanesque and Byzantine architecture is embellished with motifs of Ukrainian folk art; for example, the tile roof patterns duplicate the geometric designs of traditional Ukrainian embroidery.

=== Polish National House in Chernivtsi ===

The history of the Polish community in Chernivtsi dates back to the late 18th century, when authorities of the Habsburg Empire encouraged Poles to move to Bucovina. By the mid-19th century, several Polish organizations existed in the city, including Bratnia Pomoc (Brotherly Aid) and Czytelnia Polska (Polish Reading Room). On the initiative of publishers of the Gazeta Polska daily newspaper, collection of money for the construction of Polish House was initiated. In the early 20th century, two Polish activists, doctor Tadeusz Mischke and judge Jakub Simonowicz purchased a house. In 1904, its expansion was initiated. It was carried out by architect Franciszek Skowron, interior decorator Konrad Górecki and sculptors from Zakopane, Skwarnicki and Gerasimowicz. The expansion was completed in 1905, and Polish House operated until World War II.

In 1945, Soviet authorities opened here a cinema, later a music school. Currently, the complex houses Adam Mickiewicz Association of Polish Culture.

Apart from the Polish House, Chernivtsi also has German, Romanian and Jewish Houses.

=== German National House in Chernivtsi ===

It was built in the early 20th century by the union of the German community in Chernivtsi, which became the center of German cultural and social life in Chernivtsi and Bukovina. The German House was built in 1908–1910 according to plans developed by architect Gustav Fric. The building measures 1700 square metres, 25,000 cubic metres. built as a profitable house and a partnership house for 700,000 kroons on the site of the old German school building. The German House also had its own bank, and its own printing house, where various books, brochures, newspapers, and magazines were published, including the newspaper &quot;German diary&quot;, which was popular at the time.

=== Jewish National House in Chernivtsi ===
The house was built in 1908 by the Jewish community and until the Second World War, it was the centre of Jewish life in Chernivtsi and home to various Jewish associations and organisations. At least 45,000 Jews from the Bukovina region fell victim to mass shootings, forced labour and deportations beginning in 1941. With the advent of the Soviet government (1944), the building was transferred to the City House of Culture. Today it is the Central Palace of Culture of Chernivtsi

=== Religion ===
* Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (Sviato-Dukhivskyi Cathedral) is a cathedral of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in Chernivtsi. The first stone in its foundation was laid in July 1844. The construction was carried out under the supervision of local engineer Adolf Marin and Viennese architect Anton Röll. In 1860 the facade of the church was rebuilt under the design of Josef Hlavka. Twenty years after the work began in July 1864, Bishop Yevhenii Hakman consecrated the cathedral. However, interior decoration work continued until the end of the century. In 1892–1896, a group of artists from Vienna painted the walls. It was built in the style of the Italian Renaissance, based on one of the projects of the St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral, which was presented to Bishop Hakman.
* The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has an increasingly large number of believers in Chernivtsi. UGCC has several churches in the city. The main temple representing the church in Bukovina is the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, completed in 1821.

* The Armenian Catholic Saints Peter and Paul Church was built and consecrated in 1875. In 1979, it was included on the list of architectural monuments of national significance. Since 1987, it houses the organ hall of Chernivtsi Philarmonic. 
* Basilica of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is a Roman Catholic church with the status of a minor basilica, the first stone building of the city. At the time of Bukovina&#x27;s annexation to Austria in 1774, there were no Roman Catholic churches in the province. The first holy mass was held at the wooden house of General Gabriel von Spleny, the first Austrian governor of Bukovina, attended by only a small number of Roman Catholics. In 1778, the building of the first Catholic church in Chernivtsi was completed. The architectural structure of the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is characterized by classic features.

His daily &quot;Kup&#x27;s Column&quot; was launched in 1943 and remained a fixture in the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; for the next six decades.

==Early life==
Kupcinet was youngest of four children born to Russian Jewish immigrants in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago. While attending Harrison Technical High School, he became editor of the school newspaper and the senior class president. He eventually won a football scholarship to Northwestern University, but a scuffle with another student led to his transferring to the University of North Dakota.

==Career==
Upon graduating from college, Kupcinet was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles football team in 1935. 
His football career was cut short due to a shoulder injury, which led him to take a job as a sports writer for the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot; in 1935. 

While writing his sports column, Kupcinet also wrote a short &quot;People&quot; section which became officially known as &quot;Kup&#x27;s Column.&quot; &quot;Kup&#x27;s Column&quot; chronicled the nightlife of Chicago, along with celebrity and political gossip. After the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot; combined in 1948 to form the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Kup&#x27;s Column&quot; would eventually be distributed to more than 100 newspapers around the world.

In 1952, Kupcinet became a pioneer in the television talk show genre when he landed his own talk show. In 1957, he was one of the set of hosts who replaced Steve Allen on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, before Jack Paar was brought in to change the program&#x27;s format. Kupcinet&#x27;s own series ran from 1959 until 1986 and was, at one point, syndicated to over 70 stations throughout the United States. The series garnered 15 Emmy Awards along with a Peabody Award.

In addition to writing his newspaper column and talk-show hosting duties, from 1953 to 1977 Kupcinet provided commentary for radio broadcasts of Chicago Bears football games with Jack Brickhouse (and was affectionately mocked for the signature phrase, &quot;Dat&#x27;s right, Jack&quot;).

===Film cameos===
Kupcinet made cameo appearances in two films directed by Otto Preminger – 1959&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; and the 1962 drama &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In 1982, Kupcinet was elected to Chicago&#x27;s Journalism Hall of Fame.

A statue of Kupcinet was erected in 2006, three years after his death, along Wacker Drive in Chicago, across the Chicago River from the site of the old Chicago Sun-Times building. A plaque on the base of the statue includes a quote by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.

==Published works==
In 1988, Kupcinet published his autobiography, &quot;Kup: A Man, an Era, a City&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kupcinet met Esther &quot;Essee&quot; Solomon while she was a Northwestern student, and married her in 1939. The couple had two children; a daughter, Karyn in 1941, and a son, Jerry in 1944.

The Kupcinets&#x27; daughter, Karyn, moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s to pursue an acting career. On November 30, 1963, her nude body was found in her West Hollywood apartment. Her mysterious death, ruled to be a homicide by strangulation because her hyoid bone had been broken, was never solved. The Kupcinets established a theater named in her honor at Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Before the murder, Irv Kupcinet had been aware of his daughter’s close relationship with actor Andrew Prine, and the three of them had been photographed together at a public event in Los Angeles. Irv Kupcinet conferred with Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigators and hired a private investigator, and he soon came to believe Prine had nothing to do with the murder. Sheriff’s Department investigators never made an arrest.

Irv Kupcinet’s wife Essee died in 2001; they were married for 62 years.

==Death==
On November 10, 2003, Kupcinet died from respiratory complications from pneumonia at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in Chicago. He was 91 years old.

<doc id="364887" wikidata="Q273314" url="?curid=364887" title="Antonio Meucci">
<text>Antonio Santi Giuseppe Meucci ( , ; 13 April 1808 – 18 October 1889) was an Italian inventor and an associate of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a major political figure in the history of Italy. Meucci is best known for developing a voice-communication apparatus that several sources credit as the first telephone. 
Meucci set up a form of voice-communication link in his Staten Island, New York, home that connected the second-floor bedroom to his laboratory. He submitted a patent caveat for his telephonic device to the U.S. Patent Office in 1871, but there was no mention of electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound in his caveat. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound by undulatory electric current. Despite the longstanding general crediting of Bell with the accomplishment, the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities supported celebrations of Meucci&#x27;s 200th birthday in 2008 using the title &quot;Inventore del telefono&quot; (Inventor of the telephone). The U.S. House of Representatives in a resolution in 2002 also acknowledged Meucci&#x27;s work in the invention of the telephone, although the U.S. Senate did not join the resolution and the interpretation of the resolution is disputed.

==Early life==

Meucci was born at Via dei Serragli 44 in the San Frediano borough of Florence, First French Empire (now in the Italian Republic), on 13 April 1808, as the first of nine children to Amatis Meucci and Domenica Pepi. Amatis was at times a government clerk and a member of the local police, and Domenica was principally a homemaker. Four of Meucci&#x27;s siblings did not survive childhood.

In November 1821, at the age of 13, he was admitted to Florence Academy of Fine Arts as its youngest student, where he studied chemical and mechanical engineering. He ceased full-time studies two years later due to insufficient funds, but continued studying part-time after obtaining employment as an assistant gatekeeper and customs official for the Florentine government.

In May 1825, because of the celebrations for the childbirth of Marie Anna of Saxony, wife of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Meucci conceived a powerful propellant mixture for flares. The fireworks went out of his control, causing damages and injuries in the celebration&#x27;s square. Meucci was arrested and suspected of conspiracy against the Grand Duchy.

Meucci later became employed at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence as a stage technician, assisting Artemio Canovetti.

In 1834 Meucci constructed a type of acoustic telephone to communicate between the stage and control room at the Teatro of Pergola. This telephone was constructed on the principles of pipe-telephones used on ships and still functions. He married costume designer Esterre Mochi, who was employed in the same theatre, on 7 August 1834.

==Havana, Cuba==
In October 1835, Meucci and his wife emigrated to Cuba, then a Spanish province, where Meucci accepted a job at what was then called the Teatro Tacón in Havana (at the time, the greatest theater in the Americas). In Havana he constructed a system for water purification and reconstructed the Gran Teatro.
In 1848 his contract with the governor expired. Meucci was asked by a friend&#x27;s doctors to work on Franz Anton Mesmer&#x27;s therapy system on patients with rheumatism. In 1849, he developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat illness and subsequently experimentally developed a device through which one could hear inarticulate human voice. He called this device &quot;telegrafo parlante&quot; (talking telegraph).

In 1850, the third renewal of Meucci&#x27;s contract with Don Francisco Martí y Torrens expired, and his friendship with General Giuseppe Garibaldi made him a suspect citizen in Cuba. On the other hand, the fame reached by Samuel F. B. Morse in the United States encouraged Meucci to make his living through inventions.

== Staten Island, New York==
On 13 April 1850, Meucci and his wife emigrated to the United States, taking with them approximately 26,000 pesos fuertes in savings (approximately $500,000 in 2010 dollars), and settled in the Clifton area of Staten Island, New York, New York.

The Meuccis would live there for the remainder of their lives. On Staten Island he helped several countrymen committed to the Italian unification movement and who had escaped political persecution. Meucci invested the substantial capital he had earned in Cuba into a tallow candle factory (the first of its kind in the Americas) employing several Italian exiles. For two years Meucci hosted friends at his cottage, including General Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Colonel Paolo Bovi Campeggi, who arrived in New York two months after Meucci. They worked in Meucci&#x27;s factory.

In 1854, Meucci&#x27;s wife Esterre became an invalid due to rheumatoid arthritis. Meucci continued his experiments.

==Electromagnetic telephone==
Meucci studied the principles of electromagnetic voice transmission for many years and was able to transmit his voice through wires in 1856. He installed a telephone-like device within his house in order to communicate with his wife, who was ill at the time. Some of Meucci&#x27;s notes written in 1857 describe the basic principle of electromagnetic voice transmission or in other words, the telephone:

Translated:
Meucci devised an electromagnetic telephone as a way of connecting his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus being able to communicate with his wife. Between 1856 and 1870, Meucci developed more than 30 different kinds of telephones on the basis of this prototype.

A postage stamp was produced in Italy in 2003 that featured a portrait of Meucci. Around 1858, artist Nestore Corradi sketched Meucci&#x27;s communication concept. His drawing was used to accompany the stamp in a commemorative publication of the Italian Postal and Telegraph Society.

Meucci intended to develop his prototype but did not have the financial means to keep his company afloat in order to finance his invention. His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi, in what was about to become Italy, had made the geopolitical situation too unstable for anybody to invest.

==Bankruptcy==
At the same time, Meucci was led to poverty by some fraudulent debtors. On 13 November 1861 his cottage was auctioned. The purchaser allowed the Meuccis to live in the cottage without paying rent, but Meucci&#x27;s private finances dwindled and he soon had to live on public funds and by depending on his friends. As mentioned in William J. Wallace&#x27;s ruling, during the years 1859–1861, Meucci was in close business and social relations with William E. Ryder, who invested money in Meucci&#x27;s inventions and paid the expenses of his experiments. Their close working friendship continued until 1867.

In August 1870 Meucci reportedly was able to capture a transmission of articulated human voice at the distance of a mile by using a copper plate as a conductor, insulated by cotton. He called this device the &quot;telettrofono&quot;. While he was recovering from injuries that befell him in a boiler explosion aboard a Staten Island ferry, the &quot;Westfield&quot;, Meucci&#x27;s financial and health state was so bad that his wife sold his drawings and devices to a second-hand dealer to raise money.

==Patent caveat==

On 12 December 1871 Meucci set up an agreement with Angelo Zilio Grandi (Secretary of the Italian Consulate in New York), Angelo Antonio Tremeschin (entrepreneur), Sereno G.P. Breguglia Tremeschin (businessman), in order to constitute the Telettrofono Company. The constitution was notarized by Angelo Bertolino, a Notary Public of New York. Although their society funded him with $20, only $15 was needed to file for a full patent application. The caveat his lawyer submitted to the US Patent Office on 28 December 1871 was numbered 3335 and titled &quot;Sound Telegraph&quot;.
The following is the text of Meucci&#x27;s caveat, omitting legal details of the Petition, Oath, and Jurat:


===Analysis of Meucci&#x27;s caveat===
Meucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable. The mouth piece is like a &quot;speaking trumpet&quot; so that &quot;the sound concentrated upon the wire&quot; is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire. &quot;Another instrument is also applied to the ears&quot;, but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound. In the third claim, he claims &quot;a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound&quot;, which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.

Meucci emphasizes that the conductors &quot;for mouth and ears ... must be metallic&quot;, but does not explain why this would be desirable. He mentions &quot;communication with the ground&quot; but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only &quot;the wire&quot; (singular, not plural) is used between the sender&#x27;s mouth piece and the receiver&#x27;s ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators (&quot;...consists in isolating two persons ... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire&quot;).

Robert V. Bruce, a biographer of Bell, asserted that Meucci&#x27;s caveat could never have become a patent because it never described an electric telephone.

===Conflicting opinions of Meucci biographers===
According to Bruce, Meucci&#x27;s own testimony as presented by Schiavo demonstrates that the Italian inventor &quot;did not understand the basic principles of the telephone, either before or several years after Bell patented it.&quot;

Other researchers have pointed to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Bruce&#x27;s account of the invention of the telephone, firstly with the name used by Meucci to describe his invention—Bruce refers to Meucci&#x27;s device as a &quot;telephone&quot;, not as the &quot;telettrofono&quot;. Bruce&#x27;s reporting of Meucci&#x27;s purported relationship with Dr. Seth R. Beckwith has been deemed inaccurate. Beckwith, a former surgeon and general manager of the Overland Telephone Company of New York, &quot;had acquired a substantial knowledge in the telephonic field and had become an admirer of Meucci&quot;. In 1885, he became general manager of the Globe Telephone Company, which had &quot;started an action attempting to involve the government in hindering U.S. Bell&#x27;s monopoly.&quot; However, Meucci and his legal representative had cautioned Beckwith against misusing Meucci&#x27;s name for financial gain after Beckwith founded a company in New Jersey named the Meucci Telephone Company.

Not only did Beckwith&#x27;s Globe Telephone Company base its claims against the Bell Telephone Company on Meucci&#x27;s caveat, but the claims were also supported by approximately 30 affidavits, which stated that Meucci had repeatedly built and used different types of electric telephones several years before Bell did.

English historian William Aitken does not share Bruce&#x27;s viewpoint. Bruce indirectly referred to Meucci as &quot;the silliest and weakest impostor&quot;, while Aitken has gone so far as to define Meucci as the first creator of an electrical telephone.

Other recognition of Meucci&#x27;s work in the past came from the International Telecommunication Union, positing that Meucci&#x27;s work was one of the four precursors to Bell&#x27;s telephone, as well as from the Smithsonian Institution, which listed Meucci as one of the eight most important inventors of the telephone in a 1976 exhibit.

Meucci and his business partners hired an attorney (J. D. Stetson), who filed a caveat on behalf of Meucci with the patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the $250 fee, so all that was prepared was a caveat, since the fee for that was only $20. However, the caveat did not contain a clear description of how the asserted invention would actually function. Meucci advocates claim the attorney erased margin notes Meucci had added to the document.

==Telettrofono Company==

In 1872, Meucci and his friend Angelo Bertolino went to Edward B. Grant, Vice President of American District Telegraph Co. of New York (not Western Union as sometimes stated), to ask for help. Meucci asked him for permission to test his apparatus on the company&#x27;s telegraph lines. He gave Grant a description of his prototype and a copy of his caveat. After waiting two years, Meucci went to Grant and asked for his documents back, but Grant allegedly told him they had been lost.

Around 1873, a man named Bill Carroll from Boston, who had news about Meucci&#x27;s invention, asked him to construct a telephone for divers. This device should allow divers to communicate with people on the surface. In Meucci&#x27;s drawing, this device is essentially an electromagnetic telephone encapsulated to be waterproof.

On 28 December 1874, Meucci&#x27;s Telettrofono patent caveat expired. Critics dispute the claim that Meucci could not afford to file for a patent or renew his caveat, as he filed for and was granted full patents in 1872, 1873, 1875, and 1876, at the cost of $35 each, as well as one additional $10 patent caveat, all totaling $150, for inventions unrelated to the telephone.

After Bell secured his patents in 1876 and subsequent years, the Bell Telephone Company filed suit in court against the Globe Telephone Company (amongst many others) for patent infringement. Purportedly too poor to hire a legal team, Meucci was represented only by lawyer Joe Melli, an orphan whom Meucci treated as his own son. While &quot;American Bell Telephone Company v. Globe Telephone Company, Antonio Meucci, et al.&quot; was still proceeding, Bell also became involved with &quot;The U.S. Government v. American Bell Telephone Company&quot;, instigated by the Pan-Electric Telephone Company, which had secretly given Augustus Hill Garland the U.S. Attorney General 10% of its shares, employed him as a director, and then asked him to void Bell&#x27;s patent. Had he succeeded in overturning Bell&#x27;s patent, the U.S. Attorney General stood to become exceedingly rich by reason of his shares.

===Trial===
The Havana experiments were briefly mentioned in a letter by Meucci, published by &quot;Il Commercio di Genova&quot; of 1 December 1865 and by &quot;L&#x27;Eco d&#x27;Italia&quot; of 21 October 1865 (both existing today).

An important piece of evidence brought up in the trial was Meucci&#x27;s &quot;Memorandum Book&quot;, which contained Meucci&#x27;s noted drawings and records between 1862 and 1882. In the trial, Antonio Meucci was accused of having produced records after Bell&#x27;s invention and that he backdated them. As proof, the prosecutor brought forward the fact that the Rider &amp; Clark company was founded only in 1863. At trial, Meucci said William E. Rider himself, one of the owners, had given him a copy of the memorandum book in 1862; however, Meucci was not believed.

On 13 January 1887, the United States Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided. By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 dated 7 March 1876 and No. 186,787 dated 30 January 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case&#x27;s importance as a &quot;precedent&quot;.

With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the U.S. Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on 30 November 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits. During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention&#x27;s priority. Meucci&#x27;s evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York. ADT did not merge with Western Union to become its subsidiary until 1901.

Meucci&#x27;s patent caveat had described a &quot;lover&#x27;s telegraph&quot;, which transmitted sound vibrations mechanically across a taut wire, a conclusion that was also noted in various reviews (&quot;The court further held that the caveat of Meucci did not describe any elements of an electric speaking telephone...&quot;, and &quot;The court held that Meucci&#x27;s device consisted of a mechanical telephone consisting of a mouthpiece and an earpiece connected by a wire, and that beyond this the invention of Meucci was only imagination.&quot;) Meucci&#x27;s work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon his death.

==Death==
Meucci became ill in March 1889, and died on 18 October 1889 in Clifton, Staten Island, New York.

==Invention of the telephone==

There has been much dispute over who deserves recognition as the first inventor of the telephone, although Bell was credited with being the first to transmit articulate speech by undulatory currents of electricity. The Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica has devoted a museum to Meucci featuring a chronology of his inventing the telephone and tracing the history of the two trials opposing Meucci and Bell. They support the claim that Antonio Meucci was the real inventor of the telephone. However, some scholars outside Italy do not recognize the claims that Meucci&#x27;s device had any bearing on the development of the telephone. Author Tom Farley writes that: &quot;Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys [Bell and Watson] were the first to transmit speech one could understand.&quot;

In 1834, Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre &quot;Teatro della Pergola&quot; in Florence. This telephone was constructed on the model of pipe-telephones on ships and is still functional.

In 1848, Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat rheumatism. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient&#x27;s scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the &quot;tongue&quot; of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an electroscope—which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device &quot;telegrafo parlante&quot; (talking telegraph).

On the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone—such as Charles Bourseul, Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti, and others—he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the &quot;make-and-break&quot; method). Instead, he looked for a &quot;continuous&quot; solution, meaning one that didn&#x27;t interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.

Meucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so-called &quot;local effect&quot;—using what we would call today a four-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short-circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses (clicks) that were louder than normal conversation. Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called &quot;skin effect&quot; through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). 

In 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device &quot;telettrofono&quot;. Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long-distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others (the court&#x27;s findings, reported in 31 Fed. Rep. 729).

In his &quot;History of the Telephone&quot;, Herbert Newton Casson wrote:

Judge Wallace&#x27;s ruling was bitterly regarded by historian Giovanni Schiavo as a miscarriage of justice.

===2002 U.S. Congressional resolution===
In 2002, on the initiative of U.S. Representative Vito Fossella (R-NY), in cooperation with an Italian-American deputation, the U.S. House of Representatives passed United States HRes. 269 on Antonio Meucci stating &quot;that the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged.&quot; According to the preamble, &quot;if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell.&quot; The resolution&#x27;s sponsor described it as &quot;a message that rings loud and clear recognizing the true inventor of the telephone, Antonio Meucci.&quot;

In 2002, some news articles reported that &quot;the resolution said his &#x27;telettrofono&#x27;, demonstrated in New York in 1860, made him the inventor of the telephone in the place of Bell, who took out a patent 16 years later.&quot;

A similar resolution was introduced to the U.S. Senate but no vote was held on the resolution.

Despite the House of Representatives resolution, its interpretation as supporting Meucci&#x27;s claim as &quot;the&quot; inventor of the telephone remains disputed, as the resolution only referred to &quot;his work in the invention of&quot; the telephone rather than a direct assertion that he was the inventor of the telephone.

The House of Commons of Canada responded ten days later by unanimously passing a parliamentary motion stating that Alexander Graham Bell was the inventor of the telephone.

The Italian newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot; hailed the vote to recognize Meucci as a belated comeuppance for Bell.

==Garibaldi–Meucci Museum==

The Order of the Sons of Italy in America maintains a Garibaldi–Meucci Museum on Staten Island. The museum is located in a house that was built in 1840, purchased by Meucci in 1850, and rented to Giuseppe Garibaldi from 1850 to 1854. Exhibits include Meucci&#x27;s models and drawing and pictures relating to his life.

<doc id="364888" wikidata="Q617651" url="?curid=364888" title="Gemini 8">
<text>Gemini 8 (officially Gemini VIII) was the sixth crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. It was launched on March 16, 1966, and was the 14th crewed American flight and the 22nd crewed spaceflight overall. The mission conducted the first docking of two spacecraft in orbit, but also suffered the first critical in-space system failure of a U.S. spacecraft which threatened the lives of the astronauts and required an immediate abort of the mission. The crew returned to Earth safely.

==Background==
Command pilot Neil Armstrong resigned his commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1960, and was selected as a crew member for Gemini 8 in September 1965. His flight marked the second time a U.S. civilian flew into space (after Joe Walker on X-15 Flight 90), and the first time a U.S. civilian flew into orbit.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===

===Support crew===
* Walter Cunningham (Cape CAPCOM)
* James A. Lovell (Houston CAPCOM)

==Mission parameters==

* Mass: 
* Perigee (min): 
* Apogee (max): 
* Inclination: 28.91°
* Period: 88.83 min

===Agena docking===
March 16, 1966
* Docked: 23:14 UTC
* Undocked: ~23:45 UTC

==Objectives==
Gemini VIII was planned to be a three-day mission. After being launched into an orbit, on the fourth revolution it was to rendezvous and dock with an Agena target vehicle, which had been earlier launched into a circular orbit. This was to be the first space docking in history. Four separate dockings were planned.

During the first docking, Pilot David Scott planned to perform an ambitious, two-hour-and-10-minute extra-vehicular activity (EVA), which would have been the first since Ed White&#x27;s June 1965 spacewalk on Gemini IV. On a tether for one and a half revolutions around the Earth, Scott would have retrieved a nuclear emulsion radiation experiment from the front of the Gemini&#x27;s spacecraft adapter, then activate a micrometeoroid experiment on the Agena. Then he was to move back to the Gemini and test a minimum-reaction power tool by loosening and tightening bolts on a work panel.

During the EVA, after Armstrong undocked from the Agena, Scott was to don and test an Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP) stored at the back of the spacecraft adapter. This was a backpack with a self-contained oxygen supply, extra Freon propellant for his Hand Held Maneuvering Unit, and a extension to his tether. He would practice several maneuvers in formation with the Gemini and Agena vehicles (separated at distances up to , in concert with Armstrong in the Gemini.

The flight also carried an additional three scientific, four technological, and one medical experiment.

==Flight==

===Agena and Gemini launch===
Five months earlier, NASA had launched an Agena Target Vehicle for Gemini 6, but the Atlas-Agena launch failed when the Agena&#x27;s engine exploded during orbital injection and the mission had to be rescheduled. The next attempt succeeded. Everything worked perfectly; the Agena put itself into a circular orbit and oriented itself to the correct attitude for the docking.

The Gemini spacecraft was launched into an orbit by a modified Titan II on March 16, 1966 (coincidentally the 40th anniversary of the launch of the world&#x27;s first liquid-fueled rocket by Dr. Robert H. Goddard), at 10:41:02 a.m. EST. Gemini 8&#x27;s launch was nominal and no significant anomalies occurred with either the Titan II or the spacecraft.

===Rendezvous and docking===
Their first course adjustment was made at one hour and 34 minutes into the mission, when the astronauts lowered their apogee slightly with a five-second Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) thruster burn. The second adjustment was made near apogee of the second orbit, and raised both the apogee and perigee by adding to their speed. The third adjustment was made over the Pacific Ocean, a southward orbital plane change, made with a sideways thruster burn. When they were over Mexico, Jim Lovell, the Houston capsule communicator, told them they needed one last correction, a speed addition.

The rendezvous radar acquired the Agena Target Vehicle at a distance of . At 3 hours, 48 minutes and 10 seconds into the mission they performed another burn that put them in a circular orbit below the Agena. They first sighted it when they were away, and at they gave the computer automatic control.

After several small burns they were away and with no relative velocity. After 30 minutes of visually inspecting the Agena to make sure that it had not been damaged by the launch, they were given the go for docking. Armstrong started to move towards the Agena at 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) per second. In a matter of minutes, the Agena&#x27;s docking latches clicked and a green light indicated that the docking had been successfully completed. &quot;Flight, we are docked! Yes, it&#x27;s really a smoothie,&quot; Scott radioed to the ground.

===Emergency===
There was some suspicion on the ground that the Agena&#x27;s attitude control system was malfunctioning and might not have the correct program stored in it. This suspicion was found to be incorrect. Shortly before radio blackout, Mission Control cautioned the astronauts to immediately abort the docking if any abnormalities occurred with the Agena.

After the Agena began execution of its stored command program, which instructed the Agena to turn the combined spacecraft 90° to the right, Scott noticed that they were rolling. Armstrong used the Gemini&#x27;s OAMS thrusters to stop the roll, but after it stopped, it immediately started again. Gemini 8 was out of range of ground communications at this time.

Armstrong reported that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high rate of rotation might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided to undock from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough to permit undocking. Scott then hit the undock button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters to back away from the Agena. Without the added mass of the Agena, Gemini started rotating more rapidly. The astronauts realized that the problem was on the Gemini. By now the tumble rate had reached 296 degrees per second and Armstrong decided to shut down the OAMS and use the Reentry Control System (RCS) thrusters, located on the Gemini&#x27;s nose, to stop the tumble. From start to finish the incident lasted nearly 30 minutes.

NASA turned off the squawk box at Armstrong&#x27;s home, alarming his wife. Scott later praised Armstrong&#x27;s actions as their spacecraft spun: &quot;The guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well. He found the solution, he activated the solution, under extreme circumstances ... it was my lucky day to be flying with him.&quot; The spacecraft came in range of the ground communications ship &quot;Coastal Sentry Quebec&quot;. After steadying the spacecraft, the crew tested each OAMS thruster in turn and found that Number 8 had stuck on. Almost 75% of the reentry maneuvering fuel had been used to stop the tumble, and mission rules dictated that the flight be aborted once the Reentry Control System was fired for any reason. Gemini 8 immediately prepared for an emergency landing.

===Landing and recovery===
It was decided to let the spacecraft reenter one orbit later so that it could land in a place that could be reached by secondary recovery forces. The original plan was for Gemini 8 to land in the Atlantic, but that was supposed to be three days later. started to steam towards the new landing site east of Okinawa and south of Yokosuka, Japan.

Reentry took place over China, out of range of NASA tracking stations.

Planes were also dispatched, and U.S. Air Force pilot Les Schneider spotted the spacecraft as it descended precisely on time and on target. Three pararescuers jumped from their C-54 and attached a flotation collar to the capsule.

All of the pararescuers and astronauts suffered from seasickness. Three hours after splashdown, &quot;Leonard F. Mason&quot; had both men and the spacecraft on board. The astronauts were exhausted, but had otherwise survived the flight and their time on the water in good condition. They were briefly checked and slept for nine hours.

The next morning, the ship docked at the port of Naha. Fellow astronaut Walter Schirra and other NASA officials flew in to greet them before the astronauts were summoned back to the ship for medical tests and debriefing. After release, they were brought by limousine to waiting helicopters where they flew to Kadena Air Base and then on to Florida on a C-135.

Upon the return, the spacecraft was covered with a tarp. As part of the investigation into the mishap, ground controllers tested the Agena stage for the next several days by ordering it to perform various in-orbit maneuvers until exhausting its propellant and electrical power.

Four months later, the crew of Gemini 10 rendezvoused with the inert Agena and astronaut Michael Collins retrieved its micrometeorite collector.

==Thruster incident: cause and outcome==
No conclusive reason for the thruster malfunction was found. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short, most likely due to a static electricity discharge. Power still flowed to the thruster, even when it was switched off. To prevent recurrence of this problem, spacecraft designs were changed so each thruster would have an isolated circuit.

Quote from &quot;Flight: My Life in Mission Control&quot; by Chris Kraft, page 256: 
Engineers tore into the OAMS system when the spacecraft got home and found a short circuit that made one thruster fire continuously. We learned an important lesson -never put electrical power to any system unless it’s supposed to be on. The OAMS was rewired so that a short circuit would always give us a dead thruster, not one that kept firing until a circuit breaker was opened by an astronaut.

The Deputy Administrator of NASA, Dr. Robert Seamans, was attending a celebratory dinner sponsored by the Goddard Space Flight Center, at which Vice President Hubert Humphrey was the guest speaker, when the problem arose. The incident inspired Seamans to review NASA&#x27;s problem investigation procedures, modeled after military crash investigations, and on April 14, 1966, to formalize a new procedure in &quot;Management Instruction 8621.1, Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures&quot;. This gave the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures, beyond those failure investigations for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared: &quot;It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations.&quot; Seamans first invoked this new procedure immediately following the fatal Apollo 1 spacecraft fire on January 27, 1967. It was also invoked after the next critical in-flight failure, which occurred on the Apollo 13 lunar mission in April 1970.

McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, the Gemini spacecraft prime contractor, also changed its procedures. Prior to the accident, McDonnell&#x27;s top engineers would be at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station for the launch, then fly to Mission Control in Houston, Texas for the rest of the mission. The problem occurred while they were en route, so it was decided to keep McDonnell engineers in Houston for the entire mission.

==Insignia==


The mission patch shows the whole spectrum of objectives that were hoped to have been accomplished on Gemini 8. The text at the bottom is composed of the zodiacal symbol for Gemini, , and the Roman numeral for eight, VIII. The two stars are Castor and Pollux, which are in the constellation of Gemini, and are refracted through a prism to provide the spectrum. Armstrong and Scott both designed the flight patch.

==Dramatizations==
The Gemini 8 mission was dramatized in episode 1 &quot;Can We Do This?&quot;, of the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, and in the 2018 Armstrong biopic, &quot;First Man&quot;. The story of the mission is told from the point of view of a fictional mission controller in the TV series &quot;For All Mankind&quot; (2021, Season 2, Episode 8).

<doc id="364896" wikidata="Q8900" url="?curid=364896" title="European Court of Auditors">
<text>The European Court of Auditors (ECA; French: &quot;Cour des comptes européenne&quot;) is the supreme audit institution of the European Union (EU). It was established in 1975 in Luxembourg and is one of the seven EU institutions. The Court comprises one member from each EU member state (currently ) supported by approximately 900 civil servants.

==History==

The ECA was created by the 1975 Budgetary Treaty and was formally established on 18 October 1977, holding its first session a week later. At that time the ECA was not a formal institution; it was an external body designed to audit the finances of the European Communities. It replaced two separate audit bodies, one which dealt with the finances of the European Economic Community and Euratom, and one which dealt with the European Coal and Steel Community.

The ECA did not have a defined legal status until the Treaty of Maastricht when it was made the fifth institution, the first new institution since the founding of the Community. By becoming an institution it gained some new powers, such as the ability to bring actions before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At first its audit power related only to the European Community pillar of the European Union (EU), but under the Treaty of Amsterdam it gained the full power to audit the finances of the whole of the EU.

==Functions==
Despite its name, the ECA has no jurisdictional functions. It is rather a professional external investigatory audit agency. The primary role of the ECA is to externally check if the budget of the European Union has been implemented correctly and that EU funds have been spent legally and with sound management. In doing so, the ECA checks the paperwork of all persons handling any income or expenditure of the Union and carries out spot checks. The ECA is bound to report any problems in its reports for the attention of the EU&#x27;s Member States and institutions, these reports include its general and specific annual reports, as well as special reports on its performance audits. The ECA &#x27;s decision is the basis for the European Commission decisions; for example, when the ECA found problems in the management of EU funds in the regions of England, the Commission suspended funds to those regions and is prepared to fine those who do not return to acceptable standards.

In this role, the ECA has to remain independent yet remain in touch with the other institutions; for example, a key role is the presentation of the ECA&#x27;s annual report to the European Parliament. It is based on this report that the Parliament makes its decision on whether or not to sign off the European Commission&#x27;s handling of the budget for that year. The Parliament notably refused to do this in 1984 and 1999, the latter case forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The ECA, if satisfied, also sends assurances to the Council and Parliament that the taxpayers&#x27; money is being properly used, and the ECA must be consulted before the adoption of any legislation with financial implications, but its opinion is never binding.

==Organisation==
The ECA is composed of one member from each EU Member State, each of whom is appointed unanimously by the Council of the European Union for a renewable term of six years. They are not all replaced every six years, however, as their terms do not coincide (four of the original members began with reduced terms of four years for this reason). Members are chosen from people who have served in national audit bodies, who are qualified for the office and whose independence is beyond doubt. While serving in the Court, members cannot engage in any other professional activities.

As the body is independent, its members are free to decide their own organisation and rules of procedure, although these must be ratified by the Council of the European Union. Since the Treaty of Nice, the ECA can set up &quot;chambers&quot; (with only a few Members each) to adopt certain types of reports or opinions.

The ECA is supported by a staff of approximately 800 auditors, translators and administrators recruited as part of the European Civil Service. Auditors are divided into auditor groups which inspect and prepare draft reports for the ECA to take decisions upon. Inspections take place not only of EU institutions but of any state which receives EU funds, given that 90% of income and expenditure is managed by national authorities rather than the EU. Upon finding a fault, the ECA—possessing no legal powers of its own—informs the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which is the EU&#x27;s anti-fraud agency. The ECA is also assisted by the Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, elected by the College of ECA Members, who—along with general management and assistance to the President—draws up draft minutes and keeps archives of decisions, as well as ensuring the publication of reports in the &quot;Official Journal of the European Union&quot;.

===President===
The members then elect one of their members as the President of the ECA for a renewable three-year term. The election takes place by a secret ballot of those members who applied for the presidency. The duties of the President (which may be delegated) are to convene and chair the meetings of the ECA, ensuring that decisions are implemented and the departments (and other activities) are soundly managed. The President also represents the institution and appoints a representative for it in contentious proceedings.

===Members===
List of members of the European Court of Auditors as of 11 February 2025:
=== Secretary-general ===
The Secretary-General is the ECA&#x27;s most senior member of staff. Appointed for a renewable term of six years, he is responsible for the management of the ECA&#x27;s staff and for the administration of the ECA. In addition, the Secretary-General is responsible for the budget, translation, training and information technology.

==== List of secretaries-general ====
* 1989–1994: Patrick Everard
* 1994–2001: Edouard Ruppert
* 2001–2008: Michel Hervé (France)
* 2008–2009: John Speed (ad interim, United Kingdom)
* 2009–2020: Eduardo Ruiz Garcia (Spain)
* 2020–2020: Philippe Froidure (ad interim)
* Since 2021: Zacharias Kolias (Greece)

=== Staffing ===
ECA staff are mainly officials recruited via the reserve lists from general competitions organised by the European Personnel Selection Office external link (EPSO). In certain circumstances, however, the ECA may also engage temporary or contract staff. To be eligible for a post at the ECA, one must be a citizen of one of the European Union Member States.

==== Traineeships ====
Just like the other EU institutions, the ECA organises three traineeship sessions per year in areas of interest to its work. Traineeships are granted for three, four or five months maximum, and may be remunerated (€1500 /month) or non-remunerated.

== Work ==
The ECA publishes the results of its audit work in a variety of reports – annual reports, specific annual reports and special reports – depending on the type of audit. Other published products include opinions and review-based publications. In total, the ECA published 93 reports in 2017.
All reports, opinions and reviews are published on the ECA&#x27;s website in the official EU languages.

==Criticism==
===Statement of assurance===
Since 1994 the ECA has been required to provide a &quot;statement of assurance&quot;, essentially a certificate that an entire annual budget can be accounted for. This has proved to be a problem, as even relatively minor omissions require the ECA to refuse a statement of assurance for the entire budget, even if almost all of the budget is considered reliable.

This has led to media reports of the EU accounts being &quot;riddled with fraud&quot;, where issues are based on errors in paperwork even though the underlying spending was legal. The auditing system itself has drawn criticism from this perception. The Commission in particular has stated that the bar is too high, and that only 0.09% of the budget is subject to fraud. The Commission has elsewhere stated that it is important to distinguish between fraud and other irregularities. The controversial dismissal in 2003 of Marta Andreasen for her criticism of procedures in 2002 has, for some, called into doubt the integrity of the institutions.

It is frequently claimed that annual accounts have not been certified by the external auditor since 1994. In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 EU Budget, the Court of Auditors found that the two biggest areas of the EU budget, agriculture and regional spending, have not been signed off on and remain &quot;materially affected by error&quot;. Nonetheless, the European Commission claims that every budget since 2007 has been signed off.

Terry Wynn, an MEP who served on the Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Budgetary Control and reached the position of chairman, has also backed these calls, stating that it is impossible for the Commission to achieve these standards. In a report entitled &quot;EU Budget – Public Perception &amp; Fact – how much does it cost, where does the money go and why is it criticised so much?&quot;, Wynn cites consensus that practice in the EU differs from that in the US. In the US, the focus is on the financial information, not on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, &#x27;So, other than in Europe, the political reaction in the US to the failure to obtain a clean audit opinion is only &quot;a big yawn&quot;&#x27;.

By comparison, the Comptroller and Auditor General for the United Kingdom stated that there were 500 separate accounts for the UK, and &quot;in the last year, I qualified 13 of the 500. If I had to operate the EU system, then, because I qualify 13 accounts, I might have to qualify the whole British central government expenditure&quot;. Despite the problems, the Barroso Commission stated that it aimed to bring the budget within the Court&#x27;s limits by the end of its mandate in 2009.

The ECA made clear in its year report for 2010 that &quot;Responsibility for the legality and regularity of spending on Cohesion Policies starts in the Member States, but the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the correct implementation of the budget&quot;. In previous reports, the ECA has noted that &quot;Regardless of the method of implementation applied, the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the European Communities (Article 274 of the Treaty)&quot;.

===Size===
The size of the ECA has also come under criticism. Owing to the one-member-per-state system, its College of Members grew from nine to twenty-eight as of 2013 (twenty-seven after completing of the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union/Brexit on 31 January 2020). Attempting to get consensus in the body has thus become more difficult; this led to the number of its special reports per year shrinking from fifteen to six between 2003 and 2005, despite its staff growing by 200 over the same period. Some proposals have been for its size to be reduced to five members or just one, possibly with an advisory board with members from each member state. However, neither the European Constitution nor the Treaty of Lisbon proposed any changes to its composition, despite calls by former ECA members and MEPs to embrace change.

<doc id="364899" wikidata="Q28987" url="?curid=364899" title="Ermanaric">
<text>Ermanaric (died 376) was a Greuthungian Gothic king who before the Hunnic invasion evidently ruled a sizable portion of Oium, the part of Scythia inhabited by the Goths at the time. He is mentioned in two Roman sources: the contemporary writings of Ammianus Marcellinus, and in &quot;Getica&quot; by the sixth-century historian Jordanes. He also appears in a fictionalized form in later Germanic heroic legends.

Modern historians disagree on the size of Ermanaric&#x27;s realm. Herwig Wolfram postulates that he at one point ruled a realm stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea as far eastwards as the Ural Mountains. Peter Heather is skeptical of the claim that Ermanaric ruled all Goths except the Tervingi, and furthermore points to the fact that such an enormous empire would have been larger than any known Gothic political unit, that it would have left bigger traces in the sources and that the sources on which the claim is based are not nearly reliable enough to be taken at face value.

==Etymology==
The first element of the name &quot;Ermanaric&quot; appears to be based on the Proto-Germanic root &quot;*&quot;, meaning &#x27;universal&#x27;. The second element is from the element &quot;*-&quot;, Gothic &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;ruler&#x27;; this is found frequently in Gothic royal names.

==In Roman sources==
According to Ammianus, Ermanaric was &quot;a most warlike king&quot; who eventually committed suicide, faced with the aggression of the Alani and of the Huns, who invaded his territories in the 370s. Ammianus says he &quot;ruled over extensively wide and fertile regions&quot;. Ammianus also says that after Ermanaric&#x27;s death, a certain Vithimiris was elected as the new king.

According to Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot;, Ermanaric ruled the realm of Oium. Jordanes describes him as a &quot;Gothic Alexander&quot; who &quot;ruled all the nations of Scythia and Germania as they were his own&quot;. Jordanes also states that the king put to death a young woman named Sunilda (Svanhildr) with the use of horses, as punishment for her husband&#x27;s treason. Thereupon her two brothers, Sarus and Ammius, severely wounded Ermanaric, leaving him unfit to defend his kingdom from Hunnic incursions. Variations of this legend had a profound effect on medieval Germanic literature, including that of England and Scandinavia (see Jonakr&#x27;s sons). Jordanes claims that he successfully ruled the Goths until his death aged 110.

Edward Gibbon gives the version of Ammianus and Jordanes as historical, reporting that Ermanaric successively conquered, during a reign of about 30 years from AD 337 to 367, the west-goths, the Heruli, the Venedi and the Aestii, establishing a kingdom which ranged from the Baltic to the Black Sea; and died aged 110 of a wound inflicted by the brothers of a woman whom he had cruelly executed for her husband&#x27;s revolt, being succeeded by his brother Vithimiris.

==In Germanic sources and legends==
Ermanaric appears in a variety of different Germanic heroic legends.

Iormunrek (Jörmunrekkr) is the Norse form of the name. Ermanaric appears in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian legend. In the former, the poem Beowulf focused on the image of &quot;Eormenric&#x27;s wiles and hatred&quot;. He is described in the tenth century poem Deor as a powerful but treacherous king: &quot;We have heard of the wolfish mind of Eormanric: far and wide he ruled the people of the realm of the Goths: he was a cruel king&quot;.

The death of Svanhildr (Svanhildr Sigurðardóttir) and Ermanaric&#x27;s (Jörmunrek) subsequent death at the hands of Jonakr&#x27;s sons occupies an important place in the world of Germanic legend. The tale is retold in many northern European stories, including the Norse poems Ragnarsdrápa, Hamðismál and Guðrúnarhvöt, the Prose Edda and the Volsunga Saga; the Norwegian Ragnarsdrápa; the Danish Gesta Danorum; and the German Nibelungenlied
and Annals of Quedlinburg.

In the Norse &quot;Thidreks Saga&quot;, translated from Low German sources, Ermanaric is ill-advised by his treacherous counsellor Bicke, Bikka, Sifka, or Seveke (who wants revenge for the rape of his wife by Ermanaric), with the result that the king puts his own wife to death for supposed adultery with his son; he is thereafter crippled by his brothers-in-law in revenge.

In the Middle High German poems &quot;Dietrichs Flucht&quot;, the &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot;, and &quot;Alpharts Tod&quot; about Dietrich of Bern, Ermanaric is Dietrich&#x27;s uncle who has driven his nephew into exile. The early modern Low German poem &quot;Ermenrichs Tod&quot; recounts a garbled version of Ermanaric&#x27;s death reminiscent of the scene told in Jordanes and Scandinavian legend.

== Name ==
Ermanaric&#x27;s Gothic name is reconstructed as &quot;*Airmanareiks&quot;. 
It is recorded in the various Latinized forms:
* in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot;, he is called &quot;Ermanaricus&quot; or &quot;Hermanaricus&quot;, but some of the manuscripts even have &quot;Armanaricus&quot;, &quot;Hermericus&quot;, &quot;Hermanericus&quot; etc.
* in Ammianus&#x27; &quot;Res gestae&quot;, he is &quot;Ermenrichus&quot; (his name occurs only once).

In medieval Germanic heroic legend, the name appears as:
* Old English &quot;Eormenric&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the alternative spelling &quot;Eormanric&quot; occurs in the poems &quot;Deor&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;,
* Old Norse &quot;Jǫrmunrekkr&quot;
** (or, borrowed from Low German) &quot;Ermenrekur&quot;, Old Swedish &quot;Ermenrik&quot; or &quot;Ermentrik&quot; in the Swedish &quot;Didrik Saga&quot;,
* Middle High German &quot;Ermenrîch&quot;.

Since the name &quot;Heiðrekr&quot; may have been confused with Ermanaric through folk etymology, Ermanaric is possibly identifiable with &quot;Heiðrekr Ulfhamr&quot; of the Hervarar saga.

<text>Sir Patrick Duncan, (21 December 1870 – 17 July 1943) was the sixth Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, holding office from 1937 until his death in 1943.

==Early life==

Born in Scotland in 1870, he took degrees in classics at the University of Edinburgh and at Balliol College, Oxford, and studied law in the Inner Temple, before joining the British civil service in 1894 as a Clerk of the Upper Division in the Secretaries&#x27; Office for Inland Revenue.

==Colonial service==

In 1901, during the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), he was recruited by Viscount Milner, to join a team of young administrators – known as &quot;Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten&quot; – to govern and anglicise the British-occupied Transvaal. He was Colonial Secretary of the Transvaal from 1903 until the colony was granted self-government in 1907, playing an important part in the repatriation of ex-prisoners of war, and in the social and financial reconstruction of the former Boer state.

Duncan practised as an attorney from 1907 to 1910, and was a legal adviser to the Transvaal delegation to the 1908-1909 National Convention that drew up the South Africa Act that established the Union of South Africa.

==Political career==

He was a member of the Union Parliament from 1910 to 1936, first as a member of the Unionist Party, then of the South African Party and its successor the United Party. He was Minister of Education, the Interior, and Public Health in the SAP administration from 1921 to 1924, and Minister of Mines in the UP administration from 1933 to 1936.

==Governor-General of South Africa==

Duncan was appointed Governor-General in 1937, the first South African citizen appointee to hold the post. King George VI, whom he represented as head of state, knighted him and appointed him to the Imperial Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

Although widely respected and above party politics, he made himself controversial in 1939 by refusing to call a general election on the question of whether or not the Union should enter World War II.
The prime minister, J.B.M. Hertzog, a former Boer General, wanted to stay neutral, but Parliament, included most members of his own party, supported his deputy, Jan Smuts. Like Hertzog, Smuts also famously commanded Boer forces during the war but nonetheless favored entering the war on the side of the Allies. Sir Patrick&#x27;s refusal to call a new election rendered Hertzog a lame duck, after losing a vote of no-confidence he resigned from office. Sir Patrick swiftly commissioned Smuts to form a new government.

With Smuts as Prime Minister, South Africa entered the war as a loyal ally of Great Britain, South Africa&#x27;s entry into World War II triggered both short and long term political re-alignments that eventually led to Smuts being forced out of politics after the war and South Africa withdrawing from the British Commonwealth on 31 May 1961. However, Sir Patrick would never witness these events transpire, dying in office in 1943. His ashes were interred in a monument at the new Duncan Dock in Cape Town harbour, which was named after him. The informal township of Duncan Village in East London, and the suburb of Duncanville near Vereeniging, were also named after him.

==Family==

Sir Patrick married Alice Dold in 1916. They had three sons and a daughter. One son, Andrew (1920–1942), was killed on active service in Libya. Another son, Patrick (1918–1967), was a well-known anti-apartheid activist.

<text>Die Stem van Suid-Afrika (, ), also known as &quot;The Call of South Africa&quot; or simply &quot;Die Stem&quot; (), was the national anthem of South Africa during the apartheid era. There are two versions of the song, one in English and the other in Afrikaans, which were in use early on in the Union of South Africa alongside God Save the Queen and as the sole anthem after South Africa became a republic. It was the sole national anthem from 1957 to 1994, and shared co-national anthem status with &quot;God Save the King/Queen&quot; from 1938 to 1957. After the end of apartheid, it was retained as a co-national anthem along with &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; until 1997, when a new hybrid song incorporating elements of both songs was adopted as the country&#x27;s new national anthem, which is still in use.

== History ==



===Background and inception===
In May 1918, C.J. Langenhoven wrote an Afrikaans poem called &quot;Die Stem&quot;, for which music was composed in 1921 by , a reverend. The music composed that ended up being accepted was actually a second version; the first did not satisfy Langenhoven. It was widely used by the South African Broadcasting Corporation in the 1920s, which played it at the close of daily broadcasts, along with &quot;God Save The King&quot;. It was recorded for the first time in 1926 when its first and third verses were performed by Betty Steyn in England for the Zonophone record label; it was sung publicly for the first time on 31 May 1928 at a raising of the new South African national flag. In 1938, South Africa proclaimed it to be one of the two co-national anthems of the country, along with &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

It was sung in English as well as Afrikaans from 1952 onward, with both versions having official status in the eyes of the state, while &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; did not cease to be a co-national anthem until May 1957, when it was dropped from that role. However, it remained the country&#x27;s royal anthem until 1961, as it was a Commonwealth realm until that point. The poem originally had only three verses, but the government asked the author to add a fourth verse with a religious theme. The English version is for the most part a faithful translation of the Afrikaans version with a few minor changes.

===Composition===
It is uplifting in tone, addressing throughout of commitment to the &quot;Vaderland&quot; () and to God. However, it was generally disliked by black South Africans, who saw it as triumphalist and strongly associated it with the apartheid regime where one verse shows dedication to Afrikaners (though the specific mention of Afrikaners is omitted in the English version to avoid alienating the British-descent Anglophone whites living in South Africa as they are not considered Afrikaners) and another to the Great Trek of the Voortrekkers. P. W. Botha, who was the state president of South Africa during the 1980s, was fond of the song and made his entourage sing it when they visited Switzerland during his presidency.

===Decline===
As the dismantling of apartheid began in the early 1990s, South African teams were readmitted to international sporting events, which presented a problem as to the choice of national identity South Africa had to present. Agreements were made with the African National Congress (ANC) that &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; would not be sung at rugby matches, due to its connection to the apartheid system and minority rule (which led the ANC and other such groups at the time to view the song as offensive). However, at a rugby union test match against New Zealand in 1992, the crowd spontaneously sang &quot;Die Stem&quot; during a moment of silence for victims of political violence in South Africa, and although it was ostensibly agreed upon beforehand that it would not be played, an instrumental recording of &quot;Die Stem&quot; was played over the stadium&#x27;s PA system&#x27;s loudspeakers after the New Zealand national anthem was performed, and spectators sang along, sparking controversy afterwards.

Although it remained the official national anthem of the state during this time period, both the usage of it and the then-national flag began to dwindle whenever possible, particularly overseas. For example, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona that year, Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, as set to Beethoven&#x27;s music, was used instead of it, along with a neutral Olympic-style flag instead of the South African flag at the time.

&quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot;&#x27;s future seemed in doubt as the country prepared to transition to majority rule, with many predicting that it would not remain after the transition into the new democratic dispensation. In 1993, a commission sought out a new national anthem for South Africa, with 119 entries being suggested, but none were chosen. Instead, it was decided to retain &quot;Die Stem&quot;&#x27;s official status after the advent of full multi-racial democracy which followed the 1994 general election. When the old South African flag was lowered for the last time at the parliament building in Cape Town, &quot;Die Stem&quot; was performed in Afrikaans and then in English as the new South African flag was raised. After 1994, it shared equal status with &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;, which had long been a traditional hymn used by the ANC. In 1995, &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; was sung by a black choir at the Rugby World Cup final match, as it had been done at the 1994 South African presidential inauguration in Pretoria, first in Afrikaans and then in English.

===Consolidation===
The practice of singing two different national anthems had been a cumbersome arrangement during the transition to post-apartheid South Africa. On most occasions, it was usually the first verse of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; that was sung at ceremonies, in both official languages prior to 1994, with some English medium schools in what was then Natal Province singing the first verse in Afrikaans and the second in English. During this period of two national anthems, the custom was to play both &quot;Die Stem&quot; and &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; during occasions that required the playing of a national anthem. However, this proved cumbersome as performing the dual national anthems took as much as five minutes to conclude. In 1997, with the adoption of a new national constitution, a new composite national anthem was introduced, which combined part of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel &#x27;iAfrika&quot; and part of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; into a single composition in order to form a new hybrid song.

===Legacy===
Since the end of apartheid and the adoption of a new national anthem in the 1990s, the status of &quot;Die Stem&quot; has become somewhat controversial in contemporary South Africa, due to its connection with the apartheid regime and white minority rule.

Although elements of it are used in the current South African national anthem, in recent years some South Africans have called for those segments to be removed due to their connection with apartheid, whereas others defend the inclusion of it, as it was done for post-apartheid re-conciliatory reasons. When &quot;Die Stem&quot; was mistakenly played by event organisers in place of the current South African national anthem during a UK-hosted women&#x27;s field hockey match in 2012, it sparked outrage and confusion among the South African staff members and players present.

The Afrikaans version remains popular with Afrikaner nationalists and far-right organisations such as the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, where it is sometimes performed at the funerals of such groups&#x27; members or at demonstrations by them. &quot;Die Stem&quot; was also the name of a far-right periodical during the apartheid era.

<text>Margot Elisabeth Wallström (; born 28 September 1954) is a Swedish politician of the Swedish Social Democratic Party who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2014 to 2019 and Minister for Nordic Cooperation from 2016 to 2019.

Wallström previously served as the first United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict from 2010 to 2012, as Vice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy from 2004 to 2010, European Commissioner for the Environment from 1999 to 2004, Minister for Consumer Affairs from 1988 to 1991 and Member of the Riksdag (MP) for Värmland from 1982 to 1999.

==Early life and career==
Born in Skellefteå, Wallström is a high school graduate without academic degrees. In 1973, she started her career as a banking clerk at the Alfa Savings bank in Karlstad. She worked there from 1977 to 1979, and briefly as an accountant from 1986 to 1987. Wallström was the CEO of a regional TV network in Värmland, Sweden from 1993 to 1994. Before taking up her appointment as EU Commissioner she was executive vice-president of Worldview Global Media in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

==Political career==
Wallström has had a long career in politics in the Swedish parliament, the Swedish government, and the European Commission. At 25, she was elected to parliament. She was Environment Commissioner from 1999 to 2004, and in the Swedish government she was Minister for Consumer Affairs, Women and Youth from 1988 to 1991, Minister for Culture from 1994 to 1996, and Minister for Social Affairs from 1996 to 1998.

===European Commissioner for the Environment, 1999–2004===

During her time in office, Wallström pushed the European Commission&#x27;s initial proposal for REACH, a regulation requiring manufacturers of industrial chemicals to test and register their products with the European Chemicals Agency before they can be used. In 2004, she approved the importation of a genetically modified corn from the United States for animal feed after a six-year moratorium, arguing in a statement that the corn produced by biotechnology company Monsanto, known as NK603 maize, had been rigorously tested and was considered &quot;as safe as any conventional maize&quot;.

===First Vice-President of the European Commission, 2004–2010===
In 2004, Wallström became the first member of the European Commission to operate a blog. The comments section of her site quickly became a hotspot for arguments concerning the policies of the European Union. After the rejection of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe by French and Dutch voters, Wallström pushed forward her &quot;plan D&quot; (for democracy, dialogue and debate) to reconnect Citizens with the Union. Her work on such platforms, including the backing of the oneseat.eu petition, has given her a good reputation in some quarters, even being dubbed &quot;the Citizens Commissioner&quot; – but has earned her names like &quot;the Propaganda Commissioner&quot; as well from political opponents. The Economist listed her among the least effective commissioners in 2009.

In 2006, Wallström presented her a plan to transform the EU&#x27;s Europe by Satellite (EbS) video-broadcast service into an EU news agency; the plan was scrapped after press organizations complained that it would undermine the work of reporters covering the EU. Following Sweden&#x27;s 2006 election, in which the Social Democratic Party lost power, former Prime Minister Göran Persson announced his withdrawal from politics in March 2007. Wallström was regarded as the favourite candidate to succeed Persson as Social Democratic party leader, but made clear that she did not wish to be considered for the position. The post instead went to Mona Sahlin.

Between 2006 and 2007, Wallström served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters. Immediately after the election of Mona Sahlin as party leader, Wallström accepted a membership in a group working to develop political strategies for the upcoming election to the European Parliament in 2009. The membership in this group was considered by Swedish liberal Carl B Hamilton (and later also Fredrik Reinfeldt) to constitute a breach of the oath every member of the European Commission gives, which states that any member of the commission should work for the community&#x27;s best interest with no influence from politicians. European Commission spokespeople Mikolaj Dowgielewicz and Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen stated that her new assignment was not in conflict with her commissioner position.

In December 2006, Wallström was voted the most popular woman in Sweden, beating royals and athletes in a survey carried out by &quot;ICA-kuriren&quot; and Sifo. In the previous year she had attained second place. Wallström was modest in response stating that &quot;it might be because I&#x27;m so far away&quot;. On 16 November 2007, Margot Wallström, became Chair of the Council of Women World Leaders Ministerial Initiative. This position was previously held by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.

===United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2010–2012===
On 31 January 2010, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, announced at the African Union summit in Ethiopia his intention to nominate Wallström as his first ever United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. As a reaction, Wallström said that she felt &quot;honoured&quot; and &quot;humble&quot; to have been chosen for the job, which she started in April 2010.

In August 2010, Ban sent Wallström to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to help investigate claims that rebel fighters raped more than 150 women and baby boys over four days within miles of a UN base in the country. Wallström later addressed the United Nations Security Council in a September 2010 session on the use of sexual violence as a weapon by both rebel militias and government troops in the eastern provinces of the DRC. In her speech, she demonstrated that the rapes in the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces &quot;were not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern of widespread systematic rape and pillage&quot;.

On 18 September 2010, Wallström confirmed that when her assignment with the UN came to an end in February 2012, she would become the chair of the University Board at Lund University in Sweden.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden, 2014–2019===
On 3 October 2014, when the Social Democratic leader Stefan Löfven became Prime Minister, Wallström was appointed to the Swedish government as Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 30 October 2014, Wallström became the first EU foreign minister to recognise the State of Palestine, with a view to &quot;facilitate a peace agreement by making the parties less unequal&quot;; as a result, Israel the same day recalled its ambassador for consultations. Although a visit by Wallström to Israel had been planned for January 2015, Israel&#x27;s foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to receive her. Wallström&#x27;s diplomatic immunity status in Israel was also revoked which meant that if she visited Israel she would do as an individual rather than an official of a foreign state, which would normally mean enjoying protection by security services. In a March 2018 interview, she stated that the intent behind the recognition was to speed up the process towards a Two-state solution but also admitted that no progress on that issue had been made.

In December 2014, Wallström called in the Russian ambassador to Sweden, Victor Ivanovitj Tatarintsev, over the behaviour of a Russian military jet which Swedish authorities said had caused an SAS flight from Copenhagen to Poznań, Poland, to change course off southern Sweden; the incident inflamed sensitivities over Russian flights in the Nordic region, driven in part by tensions over separatism in eastern Ukraine. On 11 September 2015, she again summoned Russia&#x27;s ambassador to explain comments from the Russian foreign ministry warning of &quot;consequences&quot; if Sweden joins NATO.
In January 2015, Wallström tweeted criticism of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s flogging of human rights activist blogger Raif Badawi, calling it a &quot;cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression&quot;. In May 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Wallström as member of the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing, an initiative aimed at preparing recommendations for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit. One of Wallström&#x27;s main foreign policy goals was to secure one of the non-permanent seats for Sweden on the UN Security Council in the 2016 elections. This was achieved on 28 June 2016.
In February 2018, Wallström cancelled her visit to Turkey that was due in two weeks to protest the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin. In December 2018, Wallström met with Iranian deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi in her office, a meeting which was unannounced by the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

==Political positions==

Wallström &quot;promised a &#x27;feminist&#x27; foreign policy when her Social Democrats formed the coalition government&quot; in October 2014. She has criticized the lack of women&#x27;s rights in Saudi Arabia. &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the oldest continuously published magazine in the English language, wrote:

On 10 March 2015 Sweden announced it would revoke a weapons export agreement with Saudi Arabia that had been in place since 2005. Saudi Arabia retaliated by stopping visa issues for Swedish businesspeople, boycotting Wallström&#x27;s speech from the Arab League, temporarily withdrawing their ambassador from Sweden, and refusing to accept four Amazonian monkeys from a Swedish zoo.

King Carl XVI Gustaf then offered to mediate with the Saudi king, and a fellow Social Democrat member of the government, Björn von Sydow, travelled to meet King Salman bin Abdul Aziz and Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, taking him private letters from the Swedish King and from Prime Minister Stefan Löfven. These have remained classified, but in a press conference on 28 March, Wallström said: &quot;I am very pleased to announce that we can normalize our relations immediately, and that we are able to welcome the Saudi ambassador back to Sweden. It is deeply satisfying that we have been able to clear the misunderstanding that we insulted the world religion Islam.&quot;

Wallström has called for more articles on Wikipedia about women related topics.

==Controversies==
===European integration===
In 2005, Wallström, in her capacity as EU Commissioner responsible for communications, came under pressure to justify her handling of a controversial speech that linked opposition to European integration with Nazi genocide, after it emerged she had changed the version published on the internet to remove the controversial passage. The original version of the speech, given to journalists ahead of Wallström&#x27;s visit to Terezin in the Czech Republic to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp, suggested that scrapping the idea of a supranational Europe could put the continent back on the road to a holocaust.

===Israel===
In the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks in which 137 were murdered, Wallström told Swedish television network SVT2: &quot;To counteract the radicalization we must go back to the situation such as the one in the Middle East of which not the least the Palestinians see that, for us, there is no future: we must either accept a desperate situation or resort to violence.&quot; The Israeli government reacted angrily to Wallström&#x27;s linking the attacks to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, summoning the Swedish ambassador and saying Wallström&#x27;s statement bordered on antisemitism and blood libel.

In December 2015, Wallström denounced the ongoing wave of Palestinian knife and car-ramming attacks in Israel. On 12 January 2016, Wallström called for an investigation into whether Israel was guilty of the extrajudicial killings of Palestinians during the violence, causing further anger in the Israeli political establishment. The Foreign Ministry of Israel issued an official statement saying that Wallström&#x27;s &quot;irresponsible and delirious statements are giving support to terrorism and encouraging violence&quot;. This also caused further deterioration in Israel-Sweden relations, and Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel Tzipi Hotovely declared that Swedish politicians of the rank of deputy minister and above are not welcome in Israel. Though she later clarified that it was only the Foreign Minister and her aids what are not welcome. International law expert Noah Feldman stated Wallström misunderstands international law, which does not apply in these cases. The Simon Wiesenthal Center placed Wallström at place eight on its annual list of the worst &quot;anti-semitic/anti-israel incidents&quot;.

Although she has criticized Israel, Wallström opposes the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, supports Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself, and is in favor of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. She expressed her condemnation of BDS during an &quot;Israel day&quot; conference held by the Jewish community in Sweden. During Wallström&#x27;s December 2016 visit to Israel and the Palestinian Authority, many Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, refused to meet her, citing scheduling conflicts. Some sources suggest that the refusal stemmed from Wallström&#x27;s policy on Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Wallström welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and said it confirms the position of both the EU and Sweden on the continued Israeli settlement of the occupied West Bank.

===Rented apartment===
On 15 January 2016, &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; published information that Wallström was one of several labour officials who rented apartment in Stockholm, owned by the Swedish Municipal Workers&#x27; Union, bypassing an average eight-year waiting list. Wallström replied that she acted in good faith and received a confirmation from highest-ranking officials, that all norms and rules were followed. Wallström accused the union&#x27;s general secretary Annelie Nordström of not being truthful. The affair caused a controversy and prompted an investigation by a special prosecutor. The prosecutor closed the investigation in May 2016 and cleared Wallström, stating that there was no evidence any crime had been committed.

===Turkish child sex tweet===
On 24 August 2016 Wallström tweeted that &quot;Turkish decision to allow sex with children under 15 must be reversed. Children need more protection, not less, against violence, sex abuse.&quot; This was after the Constitutional Court of Turkey cancelled a constitutional provision that made all sexual activities with children under the age of 15 criminal as sexual abuse. Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu summoned Swedish ambassador for reprimand meeting and deputy prime minister Mehmet Simsek accused Wallström of being misinformed and acting without checking all facts. The original case was brought to the Constitutional Court by a lower court that was afraid there is no legal discrimination between teenagers that may understand the meaning of sex and toddlers that do not understand it.

<text>Washington State Ferries (WSF) is a public ferry system in the U.S. state of Washington. It is a division of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and operates 10 routes serving 20 terminals within Puget Sound and in the San Juan Islands. The routes are designated as part of the state highway system. WSF maintains a fleet of 21 vessels that are able to carry passengers and vehicles.

The ferry system carried a total of 18.66 million riders in 2023—9.69 million passengers and 8.97 million vehicles. WSF is the largest ferry system in the United States and the second-largest vehicular ferry system in the world behind BC Ferries. The state ferries carried an average of per weekday in .

==History==

The ferry system has its origins in the &quot;mosquito fleet&quot;, a collection of small steamer lines serving the Puget Sound area during the later part of the nineteenth century and early part of the 20th century. By the beginning of the 1930s, two lines remained: the Puget Sound Navigation Company (known as the Black Ball Line) and the Kitsap County Transportation Company. A strike in 1935 caused the KCTC to close, leaving only the Black Ball Line.

Toward the end of the 1940s, the Black Ball Line wanted to increase its fares, to compensate for increased wage demands from the ferry workers&#x27; unions, but the state refused to allow this, and so the Black Ball Line shut down. In 1951, the state bought nearly all of Black Ball&#x27;s ferry assets for $5 million (Black Ball retained five vessels of its fleet). The state government intended to run ferry service only until cross-sound bridges could be built, but these were never approved and left the ferries as the only means of crossing for vehicles.

The new system was operated by the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority, which ordered ten new vessels that could carry 60 to 100 vehicles. A set of revenue bonds were also issued to purchase the 16 vessels and 20 terminals of the Puget Sound Navigational Company for a total of $4.94 million. The ten initial routes were reduced to eight by the end of the year. A route between Port Townsend and Keystone on Whidbey Island was launched in June 1974 to replace a privately-run service that had lost its franchise. The Toll Bridge Authority was dissolved and replaced by the consolidated Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) on September 21, 1977.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WSF reduced service on most routes and suspended trips to Sidney on the Anacortes–San Juan Islands route. The loss of workers who retired, transferred, or were fired during the pandemic caused delays and trip cancellations as service and ridership began to recover in 2021 and 2022, while vessel replacement also ran behind schedule. By early 2023, full levels of service were restored on four routes but remained limited across much of the system; the Sidney route is not expected to re-enter service until 2030. Staffing issues, particularly among ship captains and mates, continue to prevent the full restoration of service on the Seattle–Bremerton and Fauntleroy–Vashon–Southworth routes. As mitigation for the delay in restoring the Seattle–Bremerton run&#x27;s second vessel, WSF funded additional trips on the parallel Kitsap Fast Ferries that serves both terminals.

==Routes==
WSF has 10 routes that serve 20 terminals in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea in Western Washington. The busiest route is the Seattle–Bainbridge Island ferry, which carried 4.8 million total riders in 2023; the Mukilteo–Clinton ferry carried 2.1 million total vehicles in 2023, the most of any route.

===Former routes===

*Agate Pass, replaced by the Agate Pass Bridge on October 7, 1950
*Edmonds–Port Ludlow
*Port Gamble–Shine, replaced by South Point route on June 10, 1950
*Seattle–Suquamish, discontinued on October 1, 1951
*South Point–Lofall, replaced by Hood Canal Bridge in 1961
*Tacoma Narrows, replaced by Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 but reinstated from 1940 to 1950

==Operations==

In 2022, Washington State Ferries had an operating budget of $282.5 million and spent approximately $16.47 per passenger trip. The system has over 1,500 employees, but had had crew shortages in the early 2020s that have led to sailing cancellations and deferred maintenance. Onboard food service, primarily through the ship galley and vending machines, is operated by contractor Sodexo Live.

The agency allows weddings and other celebrations to take place on board ferries, as well as the scattering of cremated remains with advance reservations.

==Fleet==

, there are 21 ferries in the WSF fleet that serve Puget Sound. The largest vessels in this fleet carry up to 2500 passengers and 202 vehicles. They are painted in a distinctive white and green trim paint scheme, and feature double-ended open vehicle decks and bridges at each end so that they do not need to turn around. Most of the ferries feature an outdoor deck with two &quot;pickleforks&quot; where passengers board and disembark the vessel.

The fleet uses diesel fuel to power its engines and is the largest consumer of diesel fuel in the state government at 19 million gallons used annually prior to 2020; WSF plans to electrify its fleet over 20 years. By 2040, it intends to build 16 new hybrid-electric vessels and convert six others to have hybrid propulsion. This will reduce carbon emissions by up 180,000 tons annually and save $19 million per year in diesel fuel costs. The first vessel to undergo conversion to use hybrid-electric propulsion is , which is expected to return to service in summer 2025. The program was originally expected to begin in 2022 with a new boat constructed by Vigor Industrial, but cost overruns and disagreements led to delays. Vigor had been the sole shipbuilder for Washington State Ferries since 1997. Bids for the hybrid-electric ferries, which will carry 164 vehicles and 1,500 passengers, were opened to non-Washingtonian shipbuilders in 2024 with invitations sent to 15 interested companies.

, 9 of the 21 active ferries maintained by Washington State Ferries are considered to be in good condition. Cancellation of sailings due to mechanical problems and urgent maintenance increased in the 2010s and 2020s.

The ferry fleet consists of the following vessels:
==Retired vessels==

Since the beginning of state-run ferry service in 1951, WSF has retired many vessels as they have become older, too expensive to operate or maintain, or have become too small to provide adequate ferry service. WSF owned passenger-only vessels between 1985 and 2009, but after discontinuing its two passenger-only routes in the 2000s, WSF has sold its passenger-only ferries to other operators.

Below is a list of ferries that WSF has retired since 1951. Unless otherwise noted, all vessels introduced in 1951 were acquired from the Puget Sound Navigation Company (PSN), also known as the Black Ball Line, when the state took over the company&#x27;s routes and ferryboats in Puget Sound.

<text>Chaim Herzog (; 17 September 1918 – 17 April 1997) was an Israeli politician, military officer, lawyer and author who served as the sixth president of Israel between 1983 and 1993. Born in Belfast and raised primarily in Dublin, the son of Ireland&#x27;s Chief Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1935 and served in the Haganah Jewish paramilitary group during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt. He returned to Palestine after the war and, following the end of the British Mandate and Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence in 1948, fought in the Battles of Latrun during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He retired from the Israel Defence Forces in 1962 with the rank of major-general.

After leaving the military, Herzog practised law. In 1972 he was a co-founder of Herzog, Fox &amp; Ne&#x27;eman, which would become one of Israel&#x27;s largest law firms. Between 1975 and 1978 he served as Israel&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, in which capacity he denounced UN General Assembly Resolution 3379—the &quot;Zionism is Racism&quot; resolution—and symbolically tore it up before the assembly. Herzog entered politics in the 1981 elections, winning a Knesset seat as a member of the Alignment. Two years later, in March 1983, he was elected to the largely ceremonial role of President. He served for two five-year terms before retiring in 1993. He died four years later and was buried on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. 

His son Isaac Herzog, who between 2013 and 2017 led the Israeli Labor Party and was the parliamentary Opposition in the Knesset, is the incumbent President of Israel. The pair are the first father and son to have served as the nation&#x27;s president.

== Biography ==

Chaim Herzog was born on Cliftonpark Avenue in Belfast in Ulster as the son of Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, who was Chief Rabbi of Ireland from 1919 to 1937 (and later of Mandatory Palestine and the State of Israel), and his wife Sarah (née Hillman). His father was born in Łomża in what was then Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, and his mother Sarah Herzog was born in Radviliškis in Lithuania, also part of the Russian Empire at that time; his maternal grandfather was the Orthodox Jewish Talmudic scholar Shmuel Yitzchak Hillman. The family home from 1919 was at 33 Bloomfield Avenue, Portobello, Dublin.

Herzog&#x27;s father, a fluent Irish speaker, was known as &quot;the Sinn Féin Rabbi&quot; for his support of the First Dáil and the Irish republican cause during the Irish War of Independence. Herzog studied at Wesley College, Dublin, and was involved with the Federation of Zionist Youth and &quot;Habonim Dror&quot;, the Labour Zionist movement, during his teenage years.

He emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1935; Herzog subsequently served in the Jewish paramilitary group Haganah during the 1936–39 Arab revolt. He studied at University College, London (UCL), and was awarded Bachelor of Laws from the University of London in 1941. 

He later qualified as a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. Following his time at university, Herzog held the position of Chairman of the Union of Jewish Students (at that time named the Inter-University Jewish Federation).

== Military career ==

Herzog joined the British Army during the Second World War, operating primarily in Germany as a tank commander in the Royal Armoured Corps. There, he was given his lifelong parallel name of &quot;Vivian&quot; because his first commander could not pronounce &quot;Chaim&quot;; but another Jewish soldier explained to the commander that &quot;Vivian&quot; was the English equivalent of &quot;Chaim&quot;. He was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps in 1943. Herzog participated in the liberation of several Nazi concentration camps as well as identifying a captured German soldier as Heinrich Himmler. He left the British Army in March 1947 as a war substantive captain and was granted the honorary rank of Major. 

Immediately following the war, he returned to Palestine. After the establishment of the State of Israel, he fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, serving as an officer in the battles for Latrun. His intelligence experience during the Second World War was seen as a valuable asset, and he subsequently became head of the IDF Military Intelligence Branch, a position in which he served from 1948 to 1950 and again from 1959 to 1962. From 1950 to 1954, he served as defence attaché at the Israeli Embassy in the United States. Herzog left Washington in September 1954. A State Department official had informed him that he was about to be declared &quot;persona non grata&quot;. The decision to expel him had been taken following an FBI investigation into his attempt to recruit a Jordanian diplomat. He retired from the IDF in 1962 with the rank of major-general.

==Legal career==
After leaving the army, Herzog opened a private law practice. He returned to public life in 1967, when the Six-Day War broke out, as a military commentator for Kol Israel radio news. Following the capture of the West Bank, he was appointed Military Governor of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

In 1972, he went into partnership with Michael Fox and Yaakov Neeman, and established the law firm of Herzog, Fox &amp; Neeman, one of the largest law firms in Israel.

==Diplomatic and political career==

In 1975, Herzog was appointed Israel&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations, in which capacity he served until 1978. During his term the UN adopted the &quot;Zionism is Racism&quot; resolution (General Assembly Resolution 3379), which Herzog condemned and symbolically tore up (as his father had done to one of the British white papers regarding the British Mandate in Palestine), saying: &quot;For us, the Jewish people, this resolution based on hatred, falsehood and arrogance, is devoid of any moral or legal value. For us, the Jewish people, this is no more than a piece of paper and we shall treat it as such.&quot; In recent years British historians headed by Simon Sebag-Montefiore have included this speech in a book on speeches that changed the world, which includes others by Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. Furthermore, Herzog raised the voice against the indifference of some Jewish leaders who seemed &quot;to act with indifference&quot; to the light of the said condemnation against Zionism, he asked then: &quot;Where is the Jewish people?&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; article titled: &quot;Herzog Asserts Jews Didn&#x27;t Aid Israelis in U.N. Zionism Debate&quot;. After the publication of the editorial, &quot;several letters of support arrived to the Israel delegation at the United Nations&quot;, he had become a hero for the common Jewish American citizen.

In the 1981 elections, Herzog entered politics for the first time, winning a seat in the Knesset as a member of the Alignment, the predecessor to the Labor Party.

==President of Israel==

On 22 March 1983, Herzog was elected by the Knesset to serve as the sixth President of Israel, by a vote of 61 to 57, against Menachem Elon, the candidate of the right and the government coalition. He assumed office on 5 May 1983 and served two five-year terms (then the maximum permitted by Israeli basic law), retiring from political life in 1993. As president of Israel, Herzog made a number of visits abroad, being the first Israeli president to make an official visit to Germany, as well as visiting several far-east countries, such as Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. He was also noted for pardoning the Shin Bet agent involved in the Kav 300 affair.

In 1985, during his state visit to the Republic of Ireland, Herzog visited Wesley College, Dublin, opened the Irish Jewish Museum in Dublin, and unveiled a sculpture in honour of his childhood friend, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, former Chief Justice of Ireland and, later, the fifth President of Ireland, in Sneem Culture Park, County Kerry.

Herzog was an opponent of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq, to which he referred to as a nest &quot;of world terror&quot;. He said the world largely dismissed Israel&#x27;s warnings that Baghdad was becoming a capital of world terrorism, adding that some Western countries helped Hussein develop into a military power.

President Herzog reduced the sentences of Menachem Livni, Uzi Sharbaf and Shaul Nir, members of the Jewish Underground, who were sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1984 murder of four Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. Herzog reduced the sentences, first to 24 years, then to 15 years, and in 1989, to 10 years, which enabled the men to be released two years later on good behaviour.

== Commemoration ==
In 1998, the Ulster History Circle unveiled a commemorative blue plaque to Herzog at his birthplace on Cliftonpark Avenue, Belfast. The plaque was removed in August 2014 because it had been repeatedly vandalised with anti-Israel slogans. DUP councillor Brian Kingston said, &quot;This is a shocking indication of the level of tension and anti-Semitism which currently exists in parts of Belfast.&quot;

A park is also named for him, Herzog Park, in Rathgar in south Dublin.

A major thoroughfare in Jerusalem, Shderot Hanassi Hashishi (Sixth President Boulevard) is named for him.

== Personal life ==

===Death===
Herzog died on 17 April 1997 in Tel Aviv, from heart failure caused by pneumonia, at the age of 78. He is buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

===Family===
Herzog&#x27;s father was Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, chief rabbi of Ireland and later Israel. His brother Yaakov Herzog served as Israel&#x27;s ambassador to Canada and later as Director General of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. His brother-in-law was diplomat Abba Eban, their wives being sisters. He had four children, including Isaac Herzog, a politician who was the chairman of the Israeli Labor Party and chairman of the Jewish Agency and is now President of Israel, the first son of a president to serve as such.

<doc id="364917" wikidata="Q2621549" url="?curid=364917" title="Culture of South Africa">
<text>South Africa is known for its ethnic and cultural diversity. Almost all South Africans speak English to some degree of proficiency, in addition to their native language, with English acting as a lingua franca in commerce, education, and government. South Africa has twelve official languages, but other indigenous languages are spoken by smaller groups, chiefly Khoisan languages.

Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white and Indian but whose ranks include growing numbers of other groups, have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.

The Apartheid state legally classified South Africans into one of four race groups, determined where they could live, and enforced segregation in education, work opportunities, public amenities and social relations. Although these laws were abolished by the early 1990s, the apartheid racial categories remain ingrained in South African culture, with South Africans continuing to classify themselves, and each other, as belonging to one of the four defined race groups (blacks, whites, Coloureds and Indians) making it difficult to define a single &quot;South African culture&quot; that doesn&#x27;t make reference to these racial categories.

==History==


==Art==
The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Dating from 75,000 years ago, these small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. One of the defining characteristics of the human species is the creation of art (from Latin &quot;ars&quot;, meaning worked or formed from basic material).

The scattered tribes of Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by Bantu and Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. In the 20th century, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of apartheid.

New great forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner Trekboer and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards also contributed to this eclectic mix, which continues to evolve today.

One form of art developed during the period of apartheid. This new characterisation was termed &quot;township art&quot; and became common in the 1960s and 1970s. This art style tended to depict scenes from everyday life of poor black individuals in South Africa. Common visual elements in this art style are dilapidated houses, women washing clothes, penny whistlers, and black mother-and-child tableaux.

Contemporary South Africa has a vibrant art scene, with artists receiving international recognition. The recent &quot;Figures and Fictions&quot; exhibition of South African photography at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London included the work of Mikhael Subotzky, Zanele Muholi, David Goldblatt, Zwelethu Mthethwa and Guy Tillim. Contemporary South African artists whose work has been met with international acclaim include Marlene Dumas, William Kentridge and John Smith.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of South Africa mirrors the vast ethnic and cultural diversity of the country and its historical colonial period. In addition, influences from other distant countries have contributed to the variety of the South African architectural landscape.

Herbert Baker, among the country&#x27;s most influential architects, designed the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Other buildings of note include the Rhodes memorial and St George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town, and St John&#x27;s College in Johannesburg.

Cape Dutch architecture was prominent in the early days (17th century) of the Cape Colony, and the name derives from the fact that the initial settlers of the Cape were primarily Dutch. The style has roots in medieval Holland, Germany, France and Indonesia. Houses in this style have a distinctive and recognisable design, with a prominent feature being the grand, ornately rounded gables, reminiscent of features in townhouses of Amsterdam built in the Dutch style.

The rural landscape of South Africa is populated with traditional and European-influenced African architecture.

== Literature ==
There are 11 national languages in South Africa. South Africa&#x27;s unique social and political history has generated a rich variety of literatures, with themes spanning pre-colonial life, the days of apartheid, and the lives of people in the &quot;new South Africa&quot;.

Many of the first black South African print authors were missionary-educated, and many wrote in either English or Afrikaans. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje&#x27;s &quot;Mhudi&quot;, written in 1930.

Notable white English-language South African authors include Nadine Gordimer who was, in Seamus Heaney&#x27;s words, one of &quot;the guerrillas of the imagination&quot;, and who became the first South African and the seventh woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991. Her novel, &quot;July&#x27;s People&quot;, was released in 1981, depicting the collapse of white-minority rule.

Athol Fugard, whose plays have been regularly premiered in fringe theatres in South Africa, London (The Royal Court Theatre), and New York City. Olive Schreiner&#x27;s &quot;The Story of an African Farm&quot; (1883) was a revelation in Victorian literature: it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form.

Alan Paton published the acclaimed novel &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; in 1948. He told the tale of a black priest who comes to Johannesburg to find his son, which became an international best-seller. During the 1950s, &quot;Drum&quot; magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to urban black culture.

Afrikaans-language writers also began to write controversial material. Breyten Breytenbach was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid. Andre Brink was the first Afrikaner writer to be banned by the government after he released the novel &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; about a white South African who discovers the truth about a black friend who dies in police custody.

John Maxwell (JM) Coetzee was also first published in the 1970s, and became internationally recognise in 1983 with his Booker Prize-winning novel Life &amp; Times of Michael K. His 1999 novel &quot;Disgrace&quot; won him his second Booker Prize as well as the 2000 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. He is also the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003.

English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, was born in Bloemfontein in 1892.

===Poetry===

South Africa has a rich tradition of oral poetry. Several influential African poets became prominent in the 1970s such as Mongane Wally Serote, whose most famous work, &quot;No Baby Must Weep&quot;, gave insight into the everyday lives of black South Africans under apartheid. Another famous black novelist, Zakes Mda, transitioned from poetry and plays to becoming a novelist in the same time period. His novel, &quot;The Heart of Redness&quot; won the 2001 Commonwealth Writers Prize and was made a part of the school curriculum across South Africa.

== Cinema ==

While many foreign films have been produced about South Africa (usually involving race relations), few local productions are known outside South Africa itself. One exception was the film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; in 1980, set in the Kalahari. This is about how life in a traditional community of San (Bushmen) is changed when a Coke bottle, thrown out of a plane, suddenly lands from the sky. The late Jamie Uys, who wrote and directed &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, also had success overseas in the 1970s with his films &quot;Funny People&quot; and &quot;Funny People II&quot;, similar to the TV series &quot;Candid Camera&quot; in the US. Leon Schuster&#x27;s &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot; films are in the same genre, and hugely popular among South Africans. Schuster&#x27;s most successful film internationally is Mr Bones, which was also the best performing film locally at the time of its release, grossing 35m USD. This was surpassed by the sequel, Mr Bones 2: Back from the Past.

The most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was &quot;District 9&quot;. Directed by Neill Blomkamp, a native South African, and produced by Peter Jackson, the action/science-fiction film depicts a sub-class of alien refugees forced to live in the slums of Johannesburg in what many saw as a creative allegory for apartheid. The film was a critical and commercial success worldwide, and was nominated for Best Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards. Another notable film that was produced in South Africa is &quot;Chappie&quot;.

Other notable exceptions are the film &quot;Tsotsi&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 as well as &quot;U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha&quot;, which won the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival.

== Music ==
There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed unique styles called &quot;Kwaito&quot; and &quot;Amapiano&quot;. Of note is Brenda Fassie, who launched to fame with her song &quot;Weekend Special&quot;, which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include Ladysmith Black Mambazo, while the Soweto String Quartet performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles.

South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably Hugh Masekela, Jonas Gwangwa, Abdullah Ibrahim, Miriam Makeba, Jonathan Butler, Chris McGregor, and Sathima Bea Benjamin. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the contemporary Steve Hofmeyr and the punk rock band Fokofpolisiekar. Crossover artists such as Verity (internationally recognised for innovation in the music industry) and Johnny Clegg and his bands Juluka and Savuka have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad. Don Clarke who wrote &quot;Sanbonani&quot;, a local hit for P J Powers, and Hotline in 1986 wrote much of the music for Leon Schuster&#x27;s films including &quot;Till You&#x27;re Free Again&quot; which he recorded for the film &quot;Frank and Fearless&quot; in 2018. Rap-rave group Die Antwoord have also found international success.

The South African music scene includes &quot;Kwaito&quot; and &quot;Amapiano&quot;, new music genres that had developed in the mid-1980s and late 2010s, and have since developed to become a popular socio-economic form of representation among the populace. However, some argue that the political aspects of Kwaito have since diminished after Apartheid, and the relative interest in politics has become a very minor aspect of daily life. Others argue that in a sense, Kwaito is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions.

Today, major corporations like Sony, BMG, and EMI have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute Kwaito music. Due to its popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country, Kwaito has taken over radio, television, and magazines.

South African rock music is a very popular subculture, especially within the Johannesburg region. The alternative rock and metal band Seether gained international popularity in the early 2000s, with five of their albums achieving Gold or Platinum certification in the United States. Four other rock bands, KONGOS, Civil Twilight, Prime Circle, the Parlotones and have also achieved success abroad in the late 2000s. While metal bands such as Vulvodynia have achieved moderate success in the 2020s.

== Cuisine ==
The cuisine of South Africa is heavily meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a &quot;braai&quot;. A variation of the barbecue, braais often feature boerewors or spicy sausages, and mielies (maize) or Mielie-meal, often as a porridge, or pearl millet, a staple food of black South Africans. Pastries such like koeksisters and desserts like melktert (milk tart) are also universally popular.
Indian food like curry is also popular, especially in Durban with its large Indian population. Another local Indian Durban speciality is the &quot;bunny&quot;, or bunny chow, which consists of a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry.

The Portuguese community has also made its mark, with spicy peri-peri chicken being a favourite. The South African Portuguese-themed restaurant chain Nando&#x27;s now has restaurants in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Malaysia, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates.

===Wine===

South Africa has developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Barrydale. South African wine has a history dating back to 1659, and at one time Constantia was considered one of the greatest wines in the world. Access to international markets has unleashed a burst of new energy and new investment. Production is concentrated around Cape Town, with major vineyard and production centres at Paarl, Stellenbosch and Worcester.

There are about 60 appellations within the Wine of Origin (WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must be made 100% from grapes from the designated area. &quot;Single vineyard&quot; wines must come from a defined area of less than 5 hectares. An &quot;Estate Wine&quot; can come from adjacent farms, as long as they are farmed together and wine is produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type and/or climate, and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation.

== Education ==
Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R is a pre-primary foundation year. Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling. High School education spans a further five years. The Senior Certificate examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university.

Public universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called &quot;Technikons&quot;), which offer vocational oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. Public institutions are usually English medium, although instruction may take place in Afrikaans as well. There are also a large number of other educational institutions in South Africa – some are local campuses of foreign universities, some conduct classes for students who write their exams at the distance-education University of South Africa and some offer unaccredited or non-accredited diplomas.

Public expenditure on education was at 6.1% of the 2016 GDP.

Under apartheid, schools for blacks were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called &quot;Bantu Education&quot; which was only designed to give them sufficient skills to work as labourers. Redressing these imbalances has been a focus of recent education policy; see Education in South Africa: Restructuring.

===Scouting===
South Africa has also had a large influence in the Scouting movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of Robert Baden-Powell (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s-1900s. Scouts South Africa (then known as Boy Scouts of South Africa) was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.

== Society ==

===Gender roles===

===Sexual orientation===

South Africa enacted same-sex marriage laws in 2006 allowing full marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples. Although the Constitutional and legal system in South Africa theoretically ensures equality, social acceptance is generally lacking, especially outside of urban areas. Lesbian women from smaller towns (especially the townships) are often victims of beating or rape. This has been posited, in part, to be because of the perceived threat they pose to traditional male authority. Although evidence of hatred may influence rulings on a case-by-case basis, South Africa has no specific hate crime legislation; human rights organisations have criticised the South African police for failing to address the matter of bias-motivated crimes.

For example, the NGO &quot;ActionAid&quot; has condemned the continued impunity and accused governments of turning a blind eye to reported murders of lesbians in homophobic attacks in South Africa; as well as to so-called &quot;corrective&quot; rapes, including cases among pupils, in which cases the male rapists purport to raping the lesbian victim with the intent of thereby &quot;curing&quot; her of her sexual orientation.

===Science and technology=== 

Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967. Max Theiler developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever, Allan McLeod Cormack pioneered x-ray Computed tomography, and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all (with the exception of that of Barnard) recognised with Nobel Prizes. Sydney Brenner won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology.

Mark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte, that was subsequently bought out by world-leader VeriSign. Elon Musk was born in South Africa.

South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the $20 billion Square Kilometer Array project to be built in South Africa and Australia.

== Sports ==


The most popular sports in South Africa are association football, rugby, and cricket. Other sports with significant support are field hockey, swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis, netball and softball. Although association football commands the greatest following among the youth, other sports like basketball, surfing, judo and skateboarding are becoming increasingly popular.

Famous combat sport personalities include Baby Jake Jacob Matlala, Vuyani Bungu, Welcome Ncita, Dingaan Thobela, Corrie Sanders, Gerrie Coetzee, Brian Mitchell and Dricus du Plessis. Footballers who have played for major foreign clubs include Lucas Radebe and Philemon Masinga, (both formerly of Leeds United), Quinton Fortune (Atlético Madrid and Manchester United), Benni McCarthy (also first-team coach at Manchester United) (Ajax Amsterdam, F.C. Porto, Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United), Aaron Mokoena (Ajax Amsterdam, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth), Delron Buckley (Borussia Dortmund) and Steven Pienaar (Ajax Amsterdam and Everton). South Africa has also produced 1979 Formula One World Champion, Jody Scheckter, along with his son, two time Indycar Series race winner, Tomas Scheckter, who led the most laps in both his first two Indianapolis 500 starts during the 2002 and 2003 running of the race. In MotoGP, notable racers include Brad Binder and his younger brother, Darryn Binder. Durban Surfer Jordy Smith won the 2010 Billabong J-Bay competition making him the No. 1 ranked surfer in the world. Famous cricket players include Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, Dale Steyn, Jonty Rhodes, Jacques Kallis, JP Duminy, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, David Miller and AB de Villiers, etc. Most of them have also participated in the Indian Premier League.

South Africa has also produced numerous world class rugby players, including Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Danie Craven, Frik du Preez, Naas Botha, Bryan Habana, Siya Kolisi, Cheslin Kolbe, Duane Vermeulen, Eben Etzebeth and Makazole Mapimpi. South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup and won the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France as well as the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, and the 2023 Rugby World Cup, again in France. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations, with the national team going on to win the tournament. It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship, and it was the host nation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which was the first time the tournament was held in Africa. FIFA president Sepp Blatter awarded South Africa a grade 9 out of 10 for successfully hosting the event.

In 2004, the swimming team of Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Ryk Neethling won the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay. Penny Heyns won Olympic Gold in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. Swimmer Tatjana Smith (née Schoenmaker) won gold and silver medals at both the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games.

In golf, Gary Player is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the Career Grand Slam, one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have won major tournaments include Bobby Locke, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Trevor Immelman and Louis Oosthuizen.

<doc id="364919" wikidata="Q1773441" url="?curid=364919" title="Namib-Naukluft National Park">
<text>The Namib-Naukluft National Park is a national park in western Namibia, situated between the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the edge of the Great Escarpment. It encompasses part of the Namib Desert (considered the world&#x27;s oldest desert), the Naukluft mountain range, and the lagoon at Sandwich Harbour. The best-known area of the park and one of the main visitor attractions in Namibia is Sossusvlei, a clay pan surrounded by dunes, and Sesriem, a small canyon of the Tsauchab. The desert research station of Gobabeb is situated within the park.

==Location and description==
With an overall area of , the Namib-Naukluft National Park was at the time of its last expansion the largest game park in Africa and the fourth largest in the world. It consists of a strip of land on the Atlantic Ocean, including of sea, that extends roughly north-to-south from the Swakop River to the B4 road to Lüderitz.

==Wildlife==

A surprising collection of creatures survives in the hyper-arid region, including snakes, geckos, unusual insects, hyenas, gemsboks, springboks, leopards, African wildcats, cape foxes, baboons, caracals, bat-eared foxes and jackals.

==Geography==
The region is characterised by high, isolated inselbergs and kopjes (the Afrikaans term for rocky outcrops), made up of dramatic blood-red granites, rich in feldspars and sandstone. The easternmost part of the park covers the Naukluft Mountains.

More moisture comes in as a fog off the Atlantic Ocean then falls as rain, with the average of 106 millimeters of rainfall per year concentrated in February and April.

The winds that bring in the fog are also responsible for creating the park&#x27;s towering sand dunes, whose burnt orange color is a sign of their age. The orange color develops over time as iron in the sand is oxidized, like rusty metal; the older the dune, the brighter the color.

These dunes are the tallest in the world, in places rising more than 300 meters (almost 1000 feet) above the desert floor. The dunes taper off near the coast, and lagoons, wetlands, and mudflats located along the shore attract hundreds of thousands of birds.

&#x27;Namib&#x27; means &quot;open space&quot;, and the Namib Desert gave its name to form Namibia – &quot;land of open spaces&quot;.

==History==
The park was established in 1907 when the German Colonial Administration proclaimed three game reserves in German South West Africa. Today&#x27;s Namib-Naukluft park was proclaimed as &quot;Game Reserve No. 3&quot;. The other two were the Omuramba Omatako and Etosha. The northern border of the reserve was south of the Swakop River, and the southern border was south of the Kuiseb River, so that the park included the Kuiseb but excluded the Swakop due to the economic activities at its banks. After World War I the South African administration of South West Africa confirmed the proclamation of the Germans. For the Namib-Naukluft Park, the area of Sandwich Harbour was added in 1941, and a small extension of the southern border followed in 1962. 

In 1966 &quot;Game Reserve No. 3&quot; was deproclaimed, and the Namib Desert Park was established in its stead. The Namib Desert Park included a small area north of the Swakop River where &quot;Welwitschia&quot; grow, as well as the Moon Landscape east of Swakopmund. In 1979 two more large areas were added. The &quot;Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park&quot; was included so that the Naukluft Mountains now formed part of the protected area. It previously comprised 14 commercial farms that were bought by the government to protect the Hartmann mountain zebra. The second area added was a strip of the Atlantic Ocean, making the Namib-Naukluft Park Namibia&#x27;s first marine reserve.

The park&#x27;s present boundaries were established in 1986 when the government was given control over parts of the &quot;Sperrgebiet&quot;, an area restricted for diamond mining. This vast strip of land has remained inaccessible to the general population but is now part of the Namib-Naukluft Park.

<doc id="364923" wikidata="Q58070" url="?curid=364923" title="Ernst August von Hannover (born 1954)">
<text>Ernst August von Hanover (; born 26 February 1954) is the head of the House of Hanover, members of which reigned in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (Great Britain and Ireland were separate kingdoms, 1714 to 1801) from 1714 to 1901, the Kingdom of Hanover from 1814 to 1866 (electorate, from 1714 to 1814), and the Duchy of Brunswick from 1913 to 1918. As the husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco, he is the brother-in-law of Albert II, Prince of Monaco.

== Education ==
He left secondary school at the age of 15 to work on a farm, but returned to education later to study at the Royal Agricultural College in England and the University of Guelph in Canada.

== Ancestry and name ==
Ernst August was born in Hanover, the eldest son of Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover (1914–1987), the former Hereditary Prince of Brunswick and his first wife, Princess Ortrud of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1925–1980). He was christened &quot;Ernst August Albert Paul Otto Rupprecht Oskar Berthold Friedrich-Ferdinand Christian-Ludwig&quot;. As the senior male-line descendant of George III of the United Kingdom, Ernst August is head of the House of Hanover. He is a first cousin of Queen Sofía of Spain and King Constantine II of the Hellenes. 

The title of Prince of Great Britain and Ireland was recognised &quot;ad personam&quot; for Ernst August&#x27;s father and his father&#x27;s siblings by George V of the United Kingdom on 17 June 1914. The hereditary Dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale and the Earldom of Armagh, borne in 1917 by his paternal great-grandfather, were suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. However, the title &quot;Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; had been entered into the family&#x27;s German passports, together with the German titles, in 1914. After the German Revolution of 1918–19, with the abolition of the privileges of nobility, titles officially became parts of the last name. The result is that the British princely title is still part of the family&#x27;s last name in their German passports, while it is no longer mentioned in their British documents. Ernst August continues to claim the style, &quot;Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. However, in addition to being a German, Ernst August also has British citizenship since his father had successfully claimed it under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 (in the case of &quot;Attorney-General v. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover&quot;). Since foreign royal titles can&#x27;t be entered into a British passport, his father ended up being named &quot;Ernest Augustus Guelph&quot;, with the addition of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;. His children, including Ernst August, inherited British nationality under this name.

==Family==
By a 24 August 1981 declaration issued by his father as the Head of House, pursuant to Chapter 3, §§ 3 and 5 of the House laws of 1836, Ernst August was authorised to marry dynastically, and did firstly marry, civilly in Pattensen on 28 August 1981 and religiously on 30 August 1981, Chantal Hochuli (born 2 June 1955 in Zürich), the daughter and heiress of a Swiss German architect and real estate developer, Johann Gustav &quot;Hans&quot; Hochuli (14 March 1912 in Switzerland – ?), and his German wife Rosmarie Lembeck (8 April 1921, in Essen, Rhine, Prussia, Germany – 12 December 2011). They have two sons, Prince Ernst August (born 19 July 1983) and Prince Christian (born 1 June 1985). Ernst August and Chantal Hochuli divorced in London on 23 October 1997.

In 1988, Ernst August unsuccessfully claimed custody of his infant nephew Otto Heinrich, son of his younger brother, Prince Ludwig Rudolph of Hanover. The infant&#x27;s mother, Countess Isabella von Thurn und Valsássina-Como-Vercelli, died of a cocaine overdose on 28 November 1988. Ludwig Rudolph placed a call to his brother in London, imploring him to take care of the couple&#x27;s 10-month-old son, and shortly afterwards died by suicide. Custody of Otto Heinrich was eventually awarded, contrary to the expressed wishes of Ludwig Rudolph as the surviving parent and Ernst August&#x27;s legal efforts, to the child&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Count Ariprand (1925–1996) and Countess Maria von Thurn und Valsassina-Como-Vercelli (born 1929), to be raised at their family seat, Bleiburg Castle in southern Austria.

Ernst August married secondly, civilly in Monaco on 23 January 1999, Princess Caroline of Monaco, who was at the time expecting their daughter, Princess Alexandra (born 20 July 1999). As he was descended from George II of Great Britain in the male line, Ernst August sought and received permission to marry pursuant to the British Royal Marriages Act 1772, which would not be repealed until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 took effect on 26 March 2015. Similarly the Monégasque court officially notified the government of France of Caroline&#x27;s marriage to Ernst August, receiving assurance that there was no objection in compliance with the (since defunct) Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1918. Moreover, in order for Caroline to retain her claim to the throne of Monaco and to transmit succession rights to future offspring, the couple were also obliged to obtain the approval of yet a third nation, in the form of official consent to the marriage of Caroline&#x27;s father, Prince Rainier III as the sovereign of Monaco.

After their marriage, Ernst August and Caroline moved to Le Mée-sur-Seine, France, where they had purchased an 18th-century manor house from their friend Karl Lagerfeld. In 2009, it was reported that Caroline had separated from Ernst August and returned to live in Monaco.

==Controversies==
===Assault on journalist===
In 1999, Ernst August was accused of assaulting a journalist with an umbrella. He agreed to pay a fine in a settlement.

===Turkish Pavilion===
Ernst August was photographed urinating on the Turkish Pavilion at the Expo 2000 event in Hanover, causing a diplomatic incident and a complaint from the Turkish embassy accusing him of insulting the Turkish people. He successfully sued those who published (&quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;) the photograph for invasion of privacy, obtaining an award of 9,900 euros.

===Assault charge===
In 2000, Ernst August was involved in a dispute with a German man, Joseph Brunnlehner, on the island of Lamu in Kenya. Brunnlehner was the operator of a disco, and Ernst August allegedly assaulted him with a knuckleduster, upset about the noise coming from the disco.

In 2004, he was convicted in a German court of aggravated assault and causing grievous bodily harm. (Although he was not charged in Kenya, German law allows charges in a German court against a German citizen for possible criminal offences committed outside Germany.) 

In 2008, he successfully applied for a retrial of the case on the basis of false evidence. His lawyers publicly stated that he has never owned a knuckleduster nor held one in his hand. The retrial was held in 2009. During retrial, he was convicted of battery in 2010; this verdict was upheld in 2011 by the and has become final.

===Family property dispute===
In 2004, Ernst August had signed over his German property to his elder son, including Marienburg Castle, the agricultural estate of Calenberg Castle, the &quot;Princely House&quot; at Herrenhausen Gardens in Hanover and some forests near Blankenburg Castle (Harz) which he had repurchased in former East Germany after the German reunification of 1990. At the time, Ernst August&#x27;s wealth was estimated as high as $250 million. Since then, the younger Ernst August has taken over many representative tasks on behalf of his father. The latter remained in charge of the Austrian family assets. 

In 2013, however, Ernst August was removed from the chairmanship of a family foundation based in Liechtenstein, the &quot;Duke of Cumberland Foundation&quot;, which holds the properties near Gmunden in Austria, the Hanovers&#x27; main residence in exile after 1866 when their Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia. Instead, the younger Ernst August was put in charge, reportedly for negligence on part of his father, at the initiative of the foundation&#x27;s trustee Prince Michael of Liechtenstein. The foundation manages vast forests, a game park, a hunting lodge, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Villa&quot; and other property. 

In 2017, Ernst August filed legal action to recover his chairmanship, and he intends to revoke the bestowal of his German property. Due to this dispute over family assets, he also declared his intention to withhold consent for his son&#x27;s marriage to Ekaterina Malysheva, which he did not attend.

=== Assault on police ===
In 2020, under the influence of alcohol and medication, Ernst August injured a police officer at his hunting lodge in Austria. Five days later, he threatened another police officer with a baseball bat. In September 2020, he was arrested on charges of threatening employees. He later received a ten-month suspended jail sentence from an Austrian court, was required to move to a different residence, and obtain psychological counselling.

==Health==
On Monday, 3 April 2005, Ernst August was admitted to hospital with acute pancreatitis. The next day, he fell into a deep coma, two days before the death of his father-in-law, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. On Friday, 8 April 2005, hospital officials reported that he was no longer in a coma but remained in intensive care. A report the same day on BBC World described his condition as &quot;serious but not irreversible.&quot; After his release he was subsequently seen in public with his wife. In an interview he admitted at the time that his health crisis was caused by his hyperactive lifestyle and problems with alcohol.

His health deteriorated in subsequent years. He was hospitalized again in 2011, 2017 and 2018 for problems related to alcohol. In February 2019 he had another emergency surgery for pancreatitis. One week later, it was reported that he is suffering from throat cancer. In July 2020, he was taken to the psychiatric unit of a hospital after calling the police for immediate help, which was followed by a physical fight between him and the police upon their arrival.

==Titles and arms==
In Germany, the legal privileges of royalty and nobility were abolished in 1919; thereafter, for legal purposes, hereditary titles form part of the name only.

<doc id="364924" wikidata="Q2157757" url="?curid=364924" title="Theodore Dwight Weld">
<text>Theodore Dwight Weld (November 23, 1803 – February 3, 1895) was one of the architects of the American abolitionist movement during its formative years from 1830 to 1844, playing a role as writer, editor, speaker, and organizer. He is best known for his co-authorship of the authoritative compendium &quot;American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses&quot;, published in 1839. Harriet Beecher Stowe partly based &quot;Uncle Tom’s Cabin&quot; on Weld&#x27;s text; the latter is regarded as second only to the former in its influence on the antislavery movement. Weld remained dedicated to the abolitionist movement until slavery was ended by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.

According to Lyman Beecher, the father of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Weld was &quot;as eloquent as an angel, and as powerful as thunder.&quot; His words were &quot;logic on fire&quot;.

In 1950, Weld was described as being &quot;totally unknown to most Americans&quot;.

==Early life==
Weld was born in Hampton, Connecticut, the son and grandson of Congregational ministers. He was descended from Thomas Welde, one of the original trustees of Harvard College. His mother owned slaves. At age 14 Weld took over his father&#x27;s hundred-acre (forty-hectare) farm near Hartford, Connecticut, to earn money to study at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, attending from 1820 to 1822, when failing eyesight caused him to leave. After a doctor urged him to travel, he started an itinerant lecture series on mnemonics, traveling for three years throughout the United States, including the South, where he saw slavery first-hand. In 1825 Weld moved with his family to Fabius, in upstate New York. At the time of the Weld-Grimké marriage they were living in Manlius, New York.

==College education==
Weld then (1825) attended classes at Hamilton College in Clinton, Oneida County, New York, though he did not enroll as a student and does not appear in the College&#x27;s published lists of students. About 1825 he stayed at the College in the suite of tutor William Kirkland, and not only attended classes but was &quot;something of a leader among the students&quot;. The famous evangelist Charles Grandison Finney was based in Oneida County, and according to him, Weld &quot;held a very prominent place among the students of Hamilton College, and had a very great influence.&quot; He described himself as &quot;educated at Hamilton College.&quot; However, Hamilton turned down his proposal of a manual labor program.

While a student Weld attended some of Finney&#x27;s many revivals, for he became Finney&#x27;s disciple. In Utica, intellectual capital of western New York, center of abolitionism, and county seat of Oneida County, he met and became a good friend of Charles Stuart, an early abolitionist, who at that time (1822–1829) was head of the Utica Academy. They spent several years as members of Finney&#x27;s &quot;holy band&quot;.

In the winter of 1827, he and his brother Charles worked on a whaling vessel in Labrador.

Later in 1827, abandoning Hamilton on Stuart&#x27;s recommendation, he enrolled in the new Oneida Institute of Science and Industry in nearby Whitesboro, New York, the most abolitionist school in the country, his fees paid for him by Stuart, after first participating in a pilot program, staying at the farmhouse of founder George Washington Gale in Western, New York, working in exchange for instruction. While at the Oneida Institute, where he was in charge of the cow-milking operation, he would spend two weeks at a time traveling about, lecturing on the virtues of manual labor, temperance, and moral reform. &quot;Weld...had both the stamina and charisma to hold listeners spellbound for three hours.&quot; As a result, by 1831 he had become a &quot;well known citizen&quot; of Oneida County, according to a letter of Joseph Swan published in the &quot;Utica Elucidator&quot;.

Weld was described thus by James Fairchild, who knew him from when they were students together at Oberlin (of which Fairchild would later be President):

In an editorial comment in &quot;The Liberator&quot;, presumably by its editor Garrison, &quot;Weld is destined to be one of the great men not of America merely, but of the world. His mind is full of strength, proportion, beauty, and majesty. ...[In his writing] there is indubitable evidence of intellectual grandeur and moral power.&quot;

In his reminiscences of that period Dr. Beecher observed: 
In a completely different forum, William Garrison said that in a convention of antislavery &quot;agents&quot;, who travelled from town to town giving abolitionist lectures and setting up new local anti-slavery societies, &quot;Weld was the central luminary around which they all revolved&quot;.

His future wife Angelina Grimké said in 1836, when she first laid eyes on him and heard him speak for two hours on &quot;What is slavery?&quot;, that &quot;I never heard so grand &amp; beautiful an exposition of the dignity &amp; nobility of man in my life&quot;.

==Manual labor and education agent==
His reputation as a speaker had reached New York, and in 1831, at the age of 28, Weld was called there by the philanthropists Lewis and Arthur Tappan. He declined their offer of a ministerial position, saying he felt himself unprepared. Since he was &quot;a living, breathing, and eloquently-speaking exhibit of the results of manual-labor-with-study,&quot; the brothers then created, so as to employ Weld, the Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions [non-religious schools], which promptly hired him as its &quot;general agent&quot; and sent him on a factfinding and speaking tour. (The Society never carried out any activities except hiring Weld, hosting some of his lectures, and publishing his report.)

Weld carried out this commission during the calendar year 1832. His 100-page report on his activities, accompanied by 20 pages of letters received, is dated January 10, 1833. It received a review of 21 pages in the &quot;Quarterly Christian Spectator,&quot; and an abridgement was soon published.

In it he states that &quot;In prosecuting the business of my agency, I have traveled during the year four thousand five hundred and seventy-five miles [7,364 km]; in public conveyances [boat and stagecoach], 2,630 [4,230 km]; on horseback, 1,800 [2,900 km]; on foot, 145 [233 km]. I have made two hundred and thirty-six public addresses.&quot; He was nearly killed when a high river swept away the coach he was in.

During his year as a manual labor agent, Weld scouted land, found the location for, and recruited the faculty for the Lane Seminary, in Cincinnati. He enrolled there as a student in 1833, although he was informally the head, to the point of telling the trustees whom to hire. He had this power because on his recommendation the Tappans&#x27; subventions would continue, or go elsewhere (as they soon did, to Oberlin).

==Abolitionist==

Some of his travel was in slave states. What he saw there, together with what he read in Garrison&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot; (1831) and book &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization&quot; (1832), turned him into a committed abolitionist. He first worked, in 1833, at convincing the other students at Lane that immediatism, ending slavery completely and immediately, was the only solution and what God wanted. Successful, he next, with the Tappans&#x27; collaboration, sought to bring immediatism to a larger audience. He announced that the public was invited to a series of public debates, over 18 evenings in February 1834, on abolition versus colonization. In fact, the debates were not debates at all, as no one spoke in favor of colonization. They were instead presentations of the horrors of American slavery, together with an exposé of the inadequacy of the American Colonization Society&#x27;s project of helping free black people migrate to Africa and its intent to protect, rather than eliminate, slavery. At the end, the audience&#x27;s views were highly supportive of immediate abolition.

The debates were then local events. However, during the Seminary&#x27;s summer vacation of 1834, some of the students started teaching classes for, and in other ways working to help, the 1500 free African Americans of Cincinnati, with whom the students mixed freely. Given the pro-slavery sentiment in Cincinnati, many found his behavior unacceptable. After rumored threats of violence against the Seminary, the trustees passed rules abolishing the seminary&#x27;s colonization and abolition societies and forbidding any further discussion of slavery, even at mealtimes. Weld was threatened with expulsion. A professor was fired. What happened was the mass resignation of almost all of Lane&#x27;s student body, along with a sympathetic trustee, Asa Mahan. Later known as the Lane Rebels, they enrolled at the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute, insisting as conditions of their enrollment that they be free to discuss any topic (academic freedom), that Oberlin admit blacks on the same basis as whites, and that the trustees not be able to fire faculty for any or no reason. The fired professor was hired by Oberlin, and Mahan became its first president.
Weld declined an appointment at Oberlin as professor of theology, saying abolitionism was a higher priority; he directed Shipperd to Charles Finney. Instead, he took a position as agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society for Ohio. &quot;He has, with characteristic disinterestedness, accepted this agency at one half the salary he was offered by another institution.&quot;

==Anti-slavery activity==
Starting in 1834, Weld was an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, recruiting and training people to work for the cause, making converts of James G. Birney, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Henry Ward Beecher. Weld became one of the leaders of the antislavery movement, working with the Tappan brothers, New York philanthropists James G. Birney and Gamaliel Bailey, and the Grimké sisters. &quot;Public awareness of abolition [in New York State] reached its peak with the activities of Theodore Weld from February to early July, 1836.&quot;

In 1836, Weld discontinued lecturing when he lost his voice, and was appointed editor of its books and pamphlets by the American Anti-Slavery Society. Among the books he edited was James Thome and J. Horace Kimball&#x27;s &quot;Emancipation in the West Indies : a six months&#x27; tour in Antigua, Barbadoes, and Jamaica, in the year 1837&quot;. 

In 1838, Weld married Angelina Grimké. He was a strong abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights advocate; at the marriage there were two ministers, one white and one black. He renounced any power or legal authority over his wife, other than that produced by love. Two former slaves of the Grimkés&#x27; father were among the guests. Weld and Grimké would go on to have three children: Charles, Theodore, and Sarah.

Their first home as newlyweds was in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where he, his wife, and her sister researched and co-wrote the very influential 1839 book &quot;American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses&quot;. Angelina&#x27;s unmarried older sister Sarah (Angelina&#x27;s godmother) resided with them for many years. In 1840, they moved to a farm in Belleville, New Jersey, where Weld ran a school.

In June 1840, the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London denied seats to Lucretia Mott and other women, mobilizing them to fight for women&#x27;s rights. This led to a split in the U.S. abolitionist movement between the nonviolent (but wanting it immediately) &quot;moral suasion&quot; of William Lloyd Garrison and his American Anti-Slavery Society, which linked abolition with women&#x27;s rights, and Weld, the Tappan brothers, and other &quot;pragmatic&quot; (gradualist) abolitionists, who formed the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (AFASS) and entered politics through the anti-slavery Liberty Party (ancestor of the Free-Soil Party and Republican Party), founded by James Birney, their U.S. presidential candidate in 1840 and 1844, who also founded the National Anti-Slavery Society. In 1841–43, Weld relocated to Washington, D.C., to direct the national campaign for sending antislavery petitions to Congress. He assisted John Quincy Adams when Congress tried him for reading petitions in violation of the gag rule, which stated that slavery could not be discussed in Congress.

===Schools===
In early 1853, Weld was offered the position of Director of a school of the Raritan Bay Union at Eagleswood in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The school accepted students of all races and sexes. In 1862, the school having closed, they moved to Perth Amboy. In 1864 they moved to Hyde Park, Massachusetts, where Weld helped open another school, this one in Lexington, Massachusetts, dedicated to the same principles. Here, Weld had &quot;charge of Conversation, Composition, and English Literature&quot;, and Angelina taught history. The school burned in 1867, and the Welds were then in retirement.

==Family==
Weld was the son of Ludovicus Weld and Elizabeth (Clark) Weld. His brother Ezra Greenleaf Weld, a famous daguerreotype photographer, was also involved with the abolitionist movement (see Fugitive Slave Convention).

A member of the Weld family of New England, Weld shares a common ancestry with Bill Weld, Tuesday Weld, and others. This branch of the family never achieved the wealth of their Boston-based kin.

Weld died at his home in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, aged 91, on February 3, 1895.

<text>The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God (and Some Lesser Tales)
is a book of short stories written by George Bernard Shaw, published in London by Constable and Company in 1932. The title story is a satirical allegory relating the experiences of an African black girl, freshly converted to Christianity, who takes literally the biblical injunction to &quot;Seek and you shall find me.&quot; and attempts to seek out and actually speak to God.

==Synopsis==
After she becomes dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the answers the missionary who has converted her gives to her questions, the girl leaves to wander in the forest, searching for God. One by one, she actually meets several versions of &quot;God&quot;—from the vengeful deity of the early books of the Bible, to the philosophical version of the Book of Job. She also meets two versions of Jesus—a kindly but ineffective young man, and another who makes a living by posing for an artist depicting him on a cross. Muhammad, and the Muslim view of God, fare no better.

She then meets an atheist behaviourist (with a strong resemblance to Ivan Pavlov) and a coterie of intellectuals who explain that speculations about God are passé, and that a better quest lies in abstract mathematics. She disposes of them all, first and last, by trenchant logic and the occasional skilled use of her knobkerry (wooden club).

Eventually she meets an old gentleman who (like Voltaire) persuades her to seek God by working in a garden. He eventually persuades her to abandon her quest, settle down with a &quot;coarse&quot; red-headed Irishman and rear a &quot;charmingly coffee-coloured&quot; family. Only after the children are grown and gone does she resume her searching, and by then her &quot;strengthened mental powers take her far beyond the stage at which there is fun in smashing idols&quot;.

==Satire==

The Black Girl, as protagonist, serves the same purpose as Christian in John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;; that is to say her own &quot;inner&quot;, or &quot;spiritual&quot; life is represented as a series of physical events and encounters. The over-all tone of the argument is agnostic: through all the rejection of false gods there remains an implied conviction that there is a true god to find: at the end of the work the girl, now an old woman, resumes her search rather than finally abandoning it.

She may also be viewed as an emerging feminist figure, able to defend herself with her knobkerry and—although apparently naïve—having a powerful intellect capable of formulating searching theological questions, and exposing vapid answers.

Her intellectual powers and red-blooded humanity are contrasted with the &quot;white&quot; characters—especially the insipid missionary woman who &quot;converted&quot; her in the first place, and her thoroughly non-intellectual husband. This use of a superior person supposed by popular prejudice to be inferior, both by her sex and her race, is paralleled by the character of &quot;The Negress&quot;—a powerful figure in &quot;The Thing Happens&quot;, which is the third part of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;.

==Publishing history==
The book was first published in 1932, as &quot;Short Stories, Scraps and Shavings&quot;. In December 1932 Constable and Company published an edition engraved and designed by John Farleigh with the title &quot;The Adventures of the Black Girl in her Search for God&quot;.
A 1934 reprinting including &quot;Black Girl&quot;, already serialized in 1932, along with a companion essay that disclaimed the supernatural origin of the Bible. In the essay, Shaw declares the Bible to be a book without divine authority—but still important for its ethical messages and valuable as history.

==Reaction==
Both the story and the essay outraged the religious public, creating a demand that supported five reprintings.
Shaw was greatly distressed when the perceived &quot;irreligious&quot; tone of &quot;Black Girl&quot; caused a rift in his long-term friendship with Dame Laurentia McLachlan, Abbess of Stanbrook; although eventually they reconciled. Shaw exacerbated the general furore by proposing intermarriage of blacks and whites as a solution to racial problems in South Africa. This was taken as a bad joke in Britain and as blasphemy in Nazi Germany.
The full text of this story is available on-line.

Several books used variations on the title as satirical or serious replies to Shaw. A light-hearted riposte appeared in a similarly-presented volume, &quot;The Adventures of the White Girl in her Search for God&quot; by Charles Herbert Maxwell, which showed a modern young woman wielding a (golf club) on the cover. This book advanced different views of what is really taught by Christianity, defending orthodox Christian doctrine, and deflected the racial construct presented by Shaw. The story involves the modern white girl meeting Shaw and the black girl. She follows Shaw to meet H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley and other authors, discussing their various views of God. Every so often she hits Shaw with her niblick.

Another response, the &quot;Adventures of the Brown Girl (companion to the Black girl of Mr. Bernard Shaw) in her Search for God&quot; by Mr and Mrs I. I. Kazi was published in 1933 by A. H. Stockwell. This was a liberal Muslim reply which argued that the monotheistic view of the divine existed throughout history, and thus that &quot;every prophet preached Islam in its theistic aspects&quot;. Other titles include W. R. Matthews&#x27; &quot;The Adventures of Gabriel in his Search for Mr. Shaw&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Adventures of the White Girl in her Search for Knowledge&quot; (1934) by Marcus Hayman. In Matthews&#x27; book God sends the Archangel Gabriel to seek out the real Shaw, discovering four &quot;sham&quot; Shaws (his public personas) that hide the real individual. Hayman&#x27;s book was a left-wing criticism of Shaw&#x27;s religious ideology. In 1973 Brigid Brophy published &quot;The Adventures of God in his Search for the Black Girl&quot;, in which Shaw himself appears.

In 1968 the story was adapted into a play, which was first produced at the Mermaid Theatre under the direction of Basil Ashmore. Passages from the story were read out by a narrator (Edith Evans) and the Black Girl was played by Mona Hammond. Hammond later said that she had to push to get the part, as the casting director objected that she was not sufficiently black to play the character.

Mabel Dove&#x27;s satirical response, entitled &quot;The Adventures of the Black Girl in her Search for Mr Shaw&quot; (1933), was included in the British Library&#x27;s 2015–16 exhibition &quot;West Africa: Word, Symbol, Song&quot;.

<doc id="364931" wikidata="Q958562" url="?curid=364931" title="Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois">
<text>Prince Pierre of Monaco, Duke of Valentinois (born Count Pierre Marie Xavier Raphaël Antoine Melchior de Polignac; 24 October 1895 – 10 November 1964) was the father of Rainier III of Monaco. He was a promoter of art, music, and literature in Monaco and served as the head of the country&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and to the International Olympic Committee.

==Background and early life==
Count Pierre Marie Xavier Raphaël Antoine Melchior de Polignac was born at the Château de Kerscamp, Hennebont, Morbihan, France. He was the fourth son and youngest child of Count Maxence Melchior Édouard Marie Louis de Polignac (1857–1936) and his Mexican-born wife, Susana Mariana Estefanía Francisca de Paula del Corazón de Jesús de la Torre y Mier (1858–1913), whom he wed in Paris in 1881. Mexican politician Ignacio de la Torre y Mier was Pierre&#x27;s maternal uncle. Pierre was a member of a cadet branch of the House of Polignac, one of France&#x27;s most renowned ducal families, noble since at least the 12th century, duke in 1780, peer in 1817. 

Pierre was a descendant of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s favourite, Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac. A veteran of World War I, Pierre had fraternized in artistic social circles in France, becoming a good friend of Marcel Proust and Jean Cocteau.

==Prince==
Pierre married civilly on 19 March and religiously on 20 March 1920, in Monaco, Princess Charlotte of Monaco, the illegitimate but adopted daughter of Louis II of Monaco by Marie Juliette Louvet. He changed his name and coat of arms to those borne by the House of Grimaldi by Monegasque ordinance issued on 18 March 1920, the day before his wedding. He had become a subject of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, also by Monegasque Sovereign Ordinance, on 29 February 1920. From the date of the religious wedding the court of Monaco referred to him, &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, as Duke of Valentinois. That title had been conferred upon his wife as heiress presumptive on 20 May 1919. His surname and arms were altered by ordinance shortly after he became a Monegasque citizen, to ensure that his dynastic issue would bear the surname of Grimaldi in compliance with Article I of Monaco&#x27;s house law. Pierre remained in succession to the French title Duke of Polignac, as do his legitimate male-line descendants.

==Civic role==
Initially, the couple inaugurated a new focus in the principality on culture, as patrons of the arts. Serge Diaghilev and the prince agreed that financial sponsorship of the former&#x27;s dance troupe, the &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;, offered an opportune means to raise the national prestige of Pierre and the international prestige of the principality. In 1922 the &quot;Société des bains de mer de Monaco&quot; (SBM), the Blanc family corporation licensed to operate Monaco&#x27;s casinos, contracted with the impresario and his dancers to become Monte Carlo&#x27;s resident ballet corps, eventually bringing the resort city international renown for entertainment beyond gambling.

In 1926 Pierre solicited press agent Elsa Maxwell to improve the image of the principality. She conducted a media operation to pivot the principality&#x27;s reputation from that of an &quot;interior&quot; site of fancy gaming tables and midnight catering for wealthy adults to a family-oriented outdoors venue, offering roomy beachside cabanas, golfing, a circus and, in 1929, the first Monaco Grand Prix. Pierre persuaded his father-in-law to allow the nation&#x27;s streets to be converted annually into an auto race course for the event. 

While the increased tourist traffic swelled SBM&#x27;s 1928 profits to 98 million French francs, it also drove up citizen and worker demand for reforms, which Louis II publicly decried, while delegating Pierre to meet with the leaders of the National Council, all of whose members resigned that year in protest. Infuriated by failure to obtain workplace improvements at SBM, on 24 March 1929 600 Monegasques stormed the palace, prompting Pierre to negotiate with them and present their demands for constitutional and labor reform to the monarch, who agreed to fresh elections and other concessions that forestalled revolution.

In 1953 he was among the royal guests at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II representing his son, the Prince of Monaco.

==Marriage and family==
According to James Lees-Milne, a British writer and friend of Pierre&#x27;s, his unhappy arranged marriage was complicated by his homosexuality and Princess Charlotte&#x27;s affairs. In the mid-1920s, the couple unofficially separated.

Prince Pierre and Princess Charlotte were judicially separated on 20 March 1930 at Paris, and in a case titled &quot;Princesse héréditaire Grimaldi de Monaco c. Prince Pierre Grimaldi de Polignac&quot; were divorced by ordinance of Prince Louis II on 18 February 1933. The divorce was confirmed by a Paris tribunal in December of that year. One magazine story reported that &quot;The union ended ... under circumstances which prompted the temperamental father-in-law to vow he would call out the Monégasque army if the prince ever set foot in the principality again.&quot; The banishment from Monaco was lifted in April 1933, and Prince Pierre thereafter received an annuity of 500,000 francs a year.

He and his wife had two children:

*Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy (1920–2011)
*Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (1923–2005)

==Death==

Prince Pierre died on 10 November 1964, of cancer, at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Paris, France.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1947 described Prince Pierre as &quot;a slender and graceful gallant who wears his coat cape-fashion across his shoulders. His manners are exquisite; his voice so cultivated as to be practically inaudible&quot;.

==Honours==
* : Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour
* : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic
*: Grand Officer of the Order of Saint-Charles 
* : Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star – 1923
* : Recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal

<doc id="364934" wikidata="Q213923" url="?curid=364934" title="Porcupine Tree">
<text>Porcupine Tree are an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. During an initial career spanning more than twenty years, they earned critical acclaim from critics and fellow musicians, developed a cult following, and became an influence for new artists. The group carved out a career at a certain distance away from mainstream music, being described by publications such as &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;PopMatters&quot; as &quot;the most important band you&#x27;d never heard of&quot;.

The band began as a solo project for Wilson, who initially created all of the band&#x27;s music himself. By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri as keyboardist, Colin Edwin as bassist, and Chris Maitland as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and Gavin Harrison was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree&#x27;s early sound evoked various styles of psychedelic rock, space rock and experimental rock, later moving towards a more progressive/space rock direction comparable to that of Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction.

In 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album &quot;The Incident&quot;, the band became publicly inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. However, Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison continued to intermittently work on material in secrecy over the course of the following decade, leading to the release of their album &quot;Closure/Continuation&quot; on 24 June 2022.

==History==
===Origins (1987–1990)===
Porcupine Tree originated in 1987 as a collaborative hoax project by Steven Wilson and Malcolm Stocks. Partially inspired by the psychedelic/progressive bands of the 1970s, such as Pink Floyd, that had dominated the music scene during their youth, the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named The Porcupine Tree. The two fabricated a detailed back-story including information on alleged band members and album titles, as well as a &quot;colourful&quot; history which purportedly included events such as a meeting at a 1970s rock festival and several trips in and out of prison. As soon as he had put aside enough money to buy his own studio equipment, Wilson obliged this creation with several hours of music to provide &quot;evidence&quot; of its existence. Although Stocks provided a few passages of treated vocals and experimental guitar playing, his role in the project was mostly offering occasional ideas, with the bulk of the material being written, recorded, played, and sung by Wilson.

At this point, Porcupine Tree was little more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, No-Man, an endeavour with UK based singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. However, by 1989, he began to consider some of the Porcupine Tree music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long cassette titled &quot;Tarquin&#x27;s Seaweed Farm&quot; under the name of Porcupine Tree. Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an eight-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed Porcupine Tree backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.

Wilson sent out copies of &quot;Tarquin&#x27;s Seaweed Farm&quot; to several people he felt would be interested in the recordings. Nick Saloman, the cult UK guitarist better known as The Bevis Frond, had suggested that he send one to Richard Allen, a writer for the UK counter-cultural magazine &quot;Encyclopaedia Psychedelica&quot; and co-editor of the UK psychedelic garage rock magazine &quot;Freakbeat&quot;. Allen reviewed the tape in both magazines. Whilst he disliked some of the material, he gave much of it a positive review. Several months later, Allen invited Wilson to contribute a track to the double LP &quot;A Psychedelic Psauna&quot; that was being put together to launch the new Delerium label. Allen would also become the band&#x27;s manager, press agent, and promoter until 2004, his role in marketing the band&#x27;s image decreasing after &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot; album. In the meantime, Wilson had continued to work on new material. In 1990, he released the &quot;Love, Death &amp; Mussolini&quot; EP, issued in a very limited run of 10 copies. The EP remains an extremely rare, collectible piece. It was composed of nine at-the-time-unreleased tracks, as a preview for the upcoming second album. In 1991, Wilson released a second full-length Porcupine Tree cassette called &quot;The Nostalgia Factory&quot;, which further expanded Porcupine Tree&#x27;s underground fanbase, although at this point, the band was still carrying on the charade of being 1970s rock legends. By this point, Porcupine Tree was entirely a solo project, with Stocks having amicably moved on to other activities.

===The Delerium years (1991–1997)===

====&quot;On the Sunday of Life...&quot;====
Along with the &quot;A Psychedelic Psauna&quot; compilation, which featured the Porcupine Tree track &quot;Linton Samuel Dawson&quot;, the newly formed Delerium label, formed by &quot;Freakbeat&quot; editors Richard Allen and Ivor Trueman, offered to reissue the cassettes &quot;Tarquin&#x27;s Seaweed Farm&quot; and &quot;The Nostalgia Factory&quot;. Two hundred copies of each cassette were sold through &quot;Freakbeat&#x27;s&quot; mail order, The Freak Emporium, and soon Porcupine Tree became known as a mysterious new act amongst the then UK underground psychedelic music scene.

Shortly thereafter, Delerium invited Wilson to sign as one of the label&#x27;s founder artists. The first release after this, a double vinyl album and single CD compiling the best material from his two cassettes, was released in mid-1992 as &quot;On the Sunday of Life&quot;, a title chosen from a long list of possible nonsense titles compiled by Richard Allen. The rest of the music from the initial tapes was released on the limited edition compilation album &quot;Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape&quot;.

In 1992, Delerium released &quot;On the Sunday of Life&quot; as an edition of 1,000 copies, complete with a deluxe gatefold sleeve. The album sold very well, particularly in Italy, and it was briefly repressed on vinyl and has remained in print on CD ever since its release. The album featured future concert favourite and frequent encore song &quot;Radioactive Toy&quot;. By 2000, &quot;On the Sunday of Life...&quot; had accumulated sales of more than 20,000 copies. &quot;On the Sunday of Life&quot; was originally meant to be a quadruple (LP)/double (CD) album compiling both cassettes in full, but changed to the best (according to Wilson) songs from the tapes. In 2004, Wilson remixed and remastered all three tapes, releasing them as a three-CD box set called &quot;Footprints: Cassette Music 1988-1992&quot;. This box was only distributed to family and friends.

====&quot;Up the Downstair&quot;====
In the midst of Porcupine Tree&#x27;s rising success, Wilson&#x27;s other band, No-Man, had been getting excellent UK press, which led to the band being signed to leading UK independent music publisher, Hit &amp; Run Music Publishing, in 1991, which resulted in recording agreements with One Little Indian Records, and Epic 440/Sony in the US. No-Man&#x27;s success gave Wilson the opportunity to leave his regular job and devote his time solely to music. All of the Delirium releases were published by Hit &amp; Run, whose executive Dave Massey had signed No-Man and continued to be closely involved in the Porcupine Tree project.

In May 1993, the second Porcupine Tree album, &quot;Up the Downstair&quot;, was released, another prospective double album that was finally slimmed down to a single record. &quot;Voyage 34&quot; was actually going to take up the second disc, but it was last decided to be released alone as a single. The album was highly praised, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; describing it as &quot;a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year.&quot; The album continued the fusion of electronic music and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, Richard Barbieri, of 1970s-80s art rock band Japan, and Colin Edwin.

In November 1993, &quot;Voyage 34&quot; was reissued alongside an additional 12-inch remix by Astralasia. The album managed to enter the &quot;NME&quot; indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic, even without radio play.

====&quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;====
The profile of Porcupine Tree had now grown to the extent that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances. Thus, in December 1993, Porcupine Tree became a live unit featuring Wilson on lead vocals/guitar, Colin Edwin on bass, Chris Maitland on drums, and Richard Barbieri on keyboards.

All three new members of the group had worked with Wilson on various projects over the preceding years, especially Barbieri and Maitland, who had been part of No-Man&#x27;s touring band. The new line-up&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Spiral Circus&quot;, contained recordings from their first three performances, including a BBC Radio One session for Mark Radcliffe, an early champion of the group.

Porcupine Tree&#x27;s next album did not emerge until early 1995, but was preceded by the &quot;Moonloop&quot; EP, the last two tracks of which were recorded during the album sessions and were the first to feature the new band. Released in 1995, the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot; became a success among progressive rock fans and Porcupine Tree were hailed as the Pink Floyd of the 1990s. Wilson later lamented this, stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t help that. It&#x27;s true that during the period of &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;, I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn&#x27;t make albums any more. Moreover, I regret it&quot;.

&quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot; was an &quot;expansive soundscape of melody and ambient rock experimentation&quot;, but proved to be a transitional work, with half recorded before the formation of the band and half recorded after. Most of the album was taken up with the 35-minute title track, which at one point Wilson had intended to be long enough to occupy the whole album. An alternate version of the track, containing some of the excised music, was included on the 2004 remastered version of the album. It also entered the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and &quot;Music Week&quot; charts. Together with the &quot;Moonloop&quot; EP, this album was the first Porcupine Tree music issued in America in the autumn of 1995, and attracted favourable press on both sides of the Atlantic. The band supported the album with numerous concerts throughout the year at major music venues in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece.

====&quot;Signify&quot;====
Partly unsatisfied with the half band/half solo nature of &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;, Porcupine Tree promptly got down to the task of recording the first proper band record. Wilson admitted he was always &quot;in love with the idea of the rock band&quot; because &quot;bands have a kind of glamour, and appeal, and a romance about them the solo projects just don&#x27;t have.&quot; The band worked sporadically over the next year on developing a tighter and more ambitious rock sound.

After the release of the first real Porcupine Tree single, &quot;Waiting&quot;, which entered all UK indie charts and the UK National chart and attracting airplay all over Europe, &quot;Signify&quot; was released in September 1996. The album was a mixture of instrumental tracks and more song-oriented tunes, blending numerous rock and &quot;avant-garde&quot; styles, such as krautrock. Wilson expressed satisfaction in the direction of the album, stating &quot;tracks like &#x27;Every Home Is Wired&#x27; and &#x27;Dark Matter&#x27; totally transcend both genre and comparison. Finally, I think we are making a completely original and 1990s form of music, but which still has its root in progressive music.&quot; The musicians received writing credits for some tracks, most notably for &quot;Intermediate Jesus&quot;, which evolved from a jam session later released as &quot;Metanoia&quot; at the end of 1998. A large amount of major European media interest accompanied the album&#x27;s release.

In March 1997, they played three nights in Rome to an audience that surpassed 5,000 people. All three dates were recorded for use in the 1997 live album &quot;Coma Divine – Recorded Live in Rome&quot; that was released as a goodbye to Delerium Records, which felt it could no longer offer the kind of resources the band needed to continue to build its profile worldwide. In late 1997 Porcupine Tree&#x27;s first three albums were remastered and reissued. &quot;Signify&quot; also was released in the US on Miles Copeland&#x27;s Ark 21 label.

===The Snapper years (1998–2001)===

====&quot;Stupid Dream&quot;====
Wilson, Barbieri, Edwin, and Maitland spent all of 1998 recording their fifth studio album, a release that reflected the band&#x27;s move towards a more song-oriented writing. Wilson acknowledged this time he was &quot;much more interested in songwriting as an art form, as opposed to soundscape development&quot; and commented he took influence from The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Todd Rundgren, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and &quot;anything with really good ensemble singing&quot;. He also indicated that he was &quot;interested in the idea of the pop song as a kind of experimental symphony&quot;.

The band recorded the album without a label, but signed with Snapper/Kscope before releasing &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;, in March 1999. The album was supported by a tour of the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, Poland, and the United States. The three singles taken from the album: &quot;Piano Lessons&quot;, &quot;Stranger by the Minute&quot;, and &quot;Pure Narcotic&quot;, all achieved mainstream exposure in the US and in Europe, and placed well in the UK independent charts and on radio-station playlists. Although the album was a departure from their earlier sound, it brought the band new-found popularity and went on to become the band&#x27;s best-selling and most acclaimed release up to that time.

====&quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot;====
Completed for February 2000, with string arrangements provided by Dave Gregory of XTC, Porcupine Tree&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot;, built on the mix of songwriting, soundscaping, and rock dynamics of &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;. The album was released in May 2000, preceded by the single &quot;Four Chords That Made a Million&quot;. A sold-out show at the Scala in London began a short run of UK shows, that were followed later in the year by European festival dates and a major tour supporting Dream Theater. The band continued touring through the end of 2000 and start of 2001, including their first major tour of Germany. A special double CD edition of the &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; album was issued in Israel and Germany.

In May, the band released a compilation B-side album called &quot;Recordings&quot;, which featured nine tracks from the &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; and &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; sessions that had been left off both albums. In May 2001, Porcupine Tree did three consecutive dates as a support band to Marillion, in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. In June, the band played a short US tour, starting with an appearance in NEARfest of Pennsylvania, and culminating in a sold-out show at The Bottom Line in New York City. Shortly afterwards, the band announced that they had signed a new international record deal with Lava/Atlantic Records.

===The Lava years (2002–2005)===

====&quot;In Absentia&quot;====
In February 2002, Porcupine Tree&#x27;s first line-up change occurred when drummer Chris Maitland was dismissed after eight years with the band. The band welcomed drummer and longtime acquaintance Gavin Harrison as his replacement. In March 2002, a box set of the band&#x27;s early work was released, &quot;Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997&quot;, and the band commenced recording their first major label album, drawing from a pool of thirty new songs written by Wilson in the previous two years. Recording sessions took place at Avatar Studios in New York and London, with veteran audio engineer Paul Northfield and string arranger Dave Gregory also playing major roles in the making of the record. The album was mixed in Los Angeles in May with Tim Palmer.

The resulting album, &quot;In Absentia&quot;, was released by Lava Records in September 2002. The band also released a 5.1 surround-sound version of the album, mixed by Grammy Award-winning producer Elliot Scheiner. The surround-sound version of the album won the award for best 5.1 mix at the 2004 Surround Sound Music awards in Los Angeles.

To promote the album, the band undertook four tours of Europe and North America, including one with acclaimed Swedish metal band Opeth. On tour, the new line-up of the band was further augmented by additional touring vocalist/guitarist John Wesley. During these tours, the visual element of the band&#x27;s performance was taken to new heights with the involvement of filmmaker and photographer Lasse Hoile, who had created the cover art for &quot;In Absentia&quot; and now went on to create a dark and surreal visual to Porcupine Tree&#x27;s music. The long promotional campaign for &quot;In Absentia&quot; ended on 30 November 2003, as the band played a homecoming show to a sold-out London Astoria.

During 2003, Porcupine Tree set up their own label, Transmission, with an online store hosted by Burning Shed record label. The first release on the Transmission label was a studio session recorded for XM Radio in Washington, DC, followed in 2004 by a recording from Polish radio in 2001. The band used the label to issue supplemental content, such as EPs, demos, and live recordings. Additionally, a reissue/remaster campaign also began in 2003, with many of the early albums expanded to double CDs. These reissues included re-recorded/remixed double-CD versions of the &quot;Up the Downstair&quot;, &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;, and &quot;Signify&quot; albums, and the reissue of &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; and &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot;, both consisting of a CD with a new stereo mix of the album plus a DVD-Audio with a 5.1 surround mix.

====&quot;Deadwing&quot;====
In early 2004, the band embarked on the recording sessions for their next record, &quot;Deadwing&quot;, their second for Lava/Atlantic. The album takes its inspiration from a film script written by Wilson with his filmmaker friend Mike Bennion. The album sessions completed in November 2004, and &quot;Deadwing&quot; was released in Europe and the US during the spring of 2005 as both a stereo and 5.1 surround-sound album, preceded by the release of two singles, &quot;Shallow&quot; in the US and &quot;Lazarus&quot; in Europe. The album benefited from guest appearances by Adrian Belew from King Crimson and Opeth&#x27;s Mikael Åkerfeldt, and was a commercial success, due in part to &quot;Shallow&quot; receiving airplay, peaking at number 26 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. Additionally, &quot;Lazarus&quot; entered the German singles Top 100 at number 91. The song &quot;Shallow&quot; was also featured in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Four Brothers&quot;.

The album won the Surround Music Awards for &quot;Best Made-For-Surround Title&quot; the same year of its release and was voted number-two album of 2005 in &quot;Sound &amp; Vision&quot;, the most widely distributed US magazine in the field of home electronics and entertainment. Porcupine Tree released &quot;Deadwing&quot; in Japan on 22 March 2006, the first album by the band to be released in that country.

The tour to promote the album commenced in the UK at the end of March, and continued throughout the year. Mike Bennion created a Myspace page dedicated to the prospective &quot;Deadwing&quot; film, in which he posted the first 15 pages of the script and included a trailer. However, whilst the scripts are finished, the project is still on hiatus due to lack of budget.

===The Roadrunner years (2006–2010)===

====&quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot;====
In August 2006, Porcupine Tree announced that the band had signed with Roadrunner Records UK. Prior to their first release on Roadrunner, the band released their first live concert DVD, &quot;Arriving Somewhere...&quot;, on 10 October 2006. It was accompanied by a brief tour in which the group performed 50 minutes of new material from the forthcoming studio album for the first half of the shows. Supporting acts included Swedish band Paatos in Europe and ProjeKct Six in the United States.

The band announced the next album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; in January 2007 and the album was released on 16 April 2007. The album charted in almost all European countries, and peaked at number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A 92-date tour for 2007 took the band to countries where they had never performed, such as Finland and Mexico. The tour included appearances in multiple music festivals such as the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, the German twin-festivals, Hurricane and Southside, and the Download Festival of Donington Park. The band performed their first ever shows in Australia in 2008.

The lyrics of the album deal with some common behaviour tendencies concerning society, especially youth, in the beginning of the 21st century, such as bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder, drug abuse, alienation, and deprivation caused by mass media. The concept of the album was inspired by Bret Easton Ellis novel &quot;Lunar Park&quot; and the title alludes to Public Enemy&#x27;s album, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;, both sharing the particularity of reflecting notorious conflicts affecting society in the world at some time. Wilson notes that whilst race relationship was the main issue among young people when Public Enemy&#x27;s album was released, it was replaced in the 21st century by a general superficiality, boredom, and introversion. The album features contributions from Rush&#x27;s Alex Lifeson and King Crimson&#x27;s Robert Fripp.

Wilson: &quot;My fear is that the current generation of kids who&#x27;re being born into this information revolution, growing up with the Internet, cell phones, iPods, this download culture, &#x27;American Idol,&#x27; reality TV, prescription drugs, PlayStations—all of these things kind of distract people from what&#x27;s important about life, which is to develop a sense of curiosity about what&#x27;s out there.&quot;

On 5 November 2007, &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; won the Album of the Year award for the 2007 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine awards. In December 2007, it was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Surround Sound Album&quot; though &quot;Love&quot; by The Beatles won the award.

A new EP called &quot;Nil Recurring&quot; was released on 17 September 2007, featuring four unreleased tracks from the &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; sessions and including another contribution from Robert Fripp. The second leg of the tour started on 3 October 2007, now promoting new music from the EP. &quot;Nil Recurring&quot; entered the UK Top 30 Independent Label Albums at number eight. The EP was reissued on 18 February 2008 through Peaceville Records.

A recording from a 4 October 2007 in-store, mostly acoustic, performance at Park Avenue CDs in Orlando, Florida, was released on 18 February 2008 on CD under the name of &quot;We Lost The Skyline&quot;. The title is a reference to the lyrics of &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One)&quot;, which was the opening song on the live set. The album was released on vinyl of 21 March 2008. While intended to be a full-band show, the lack of space in the store only allowed the two guitarists, Wilson and John Wesley, to play.

====&quot;The Incident&quot;====
The band played a short European tour in October 2008 to shoot their second live-concert film, &quot;Anesthetize&quot;, preceded by three concerts in Australia in April. The filming took place on 15 and 16 October in the Netherlands at the 013 Tilburg venue. During one of these shows, Wilson mentioned that Porcupine Tree had started work on material for their next album, with an eye toward a release in 2009. The live-concert film on DVD and Blu-ray was released on 20 May 2010.

The band started recording their tenth studio album, &quot;The Incident&quot;, in February 2009. This was confirmed by the band, stating, &quot;Writing for the next PT studio record is well underway, with the band recently spending two weeks scheduled in the English countryside working on new tracks. Recording of these pieces and a new 35-minute SW song cycle were due to start in February...&quot; Months later, Wilson commented the 35-minute song kept evolving and now it has become a 55-minute song, occupying the entire disc.

On 12 June 2009, details were revealed on the Porcupine Tree website, &quot;the record is set to be released via Roadrunner Records worldwide on 21 September, as a double CD. The centrepiece is the title track, which takes up the whole of the first disc. The 55-minute work is described as a slightly surreal song cycle about beginnings and endings and the sense that &#x27;after this, things will never be the same again.&#x27; The self-produced album is completed by four standalone compositions that developed out of band writing sessions last December – Flicker, Bonnie The Cat, Black Dahlia, and Remember Me Lover feature on a separate EP-length disc to stress their independence from the song cycle.&quot; The album was the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success to date, reaching number 23 in the UK album charts and also reaching the US&quot; Billboard &quot;Top 25.

The band also released another live album, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, in June 2010. The performance was actually recorded during the tour of &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; at the Roxy theatre, Atlanta, on 29 October 2007. It was released via online distribution only, with all the sale proceeds donated to Mick Karn for his treatment against cancer.

===Inactivity and hiatus (2011–2020)===

After finishing the touring cycle for &quot;The Incident&quot; in 2010, Wilson spent the rest of the year, and 2011, recording and releasing his second solo album, &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot;, and Blackfield&#x27;s third album, &quot;Welcome to my DNA&quot;. Initially, the band had mentioned the possibility of working on new music in 2012, with Wilson mentioning &quot;early 2012&quot;, and Harrison guessing they would start work in 2012 and release music in 2013. However, this soon changed, with Wilson announcing that he would continue to focus his future on his solo career. This new focus included a second leg of touring in support of &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot; in the first half of 2012, recording a third solo album in the second half of the year with his touring band, releasing it in early 2013, and then touring in support of the third solo album for &quot;much of the year&quot; – throughout 2013. Wilson still maintained that the band &quot;haven&#x27;t split up&quot; and that there are &quot;no intentions of splitting up&quot;, but he also said there were no specific plans for a new album either. While he said that he still &quot;want(s) to get Porcupine Tree back together at some point&quot;, he said that he was not sure what direction he wants to take the band, only that he is &quot;tired of metal music&quot;, and that one member of the band does not like jazz, so it won&#x27;t go into the direction of his solo project either.

In June 2012, Wilson re-emphasised his continued focus on his solo career, with his answer to the question &quot;...is (there) a danger that Porcupine Tree might fall by the wayside?&quot; being, &quot;The honest answer is I don&#x27;t know. The solo career for me now is probably the most important. I think about it more than anything else, I&#x27;m more focused on it than anything else, I enjoy it more than anything else...&quot; A two-disc live album titled &quot;Octane Twisted&quot; was released that following November by their record label, Kscope, containing a live recording of &quot;The Incident&quot; in its entirety, from material recorded at 2010 concerts at the Riviera Theater, Chicago, and the Royal Albert Hall. In May 2013, Wilson reiterated his stance on the band&#x27;s status, stating that it&#x27;s &quot;...not to say the band has broken up or anything like that. It&#x27;s always conceivable that we could get back together in a year or five years, or 10 years. I really can&#x27;t say – there are no plans at the moment.&quot; Edwin&#x27;s stance mirrored this.

After Wilson released his third solo album, &quot;The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)&quot; in February 2013, and toured in support of it for the remainder of the year, its success led Wilson to commit to writing and recording a fourth solo album &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; over the course of 2014 and releasing it in 2015, pushing hypothetical work with Porcupine Tree into at least 2016. In March 2015, Wilson commented, &quot;if Porcupine Tree [were] to get back together—and, by the way, I have never ruled that out—it will be a side project. There should be no question in anyone&#x27;s mind that this is now my main musical path, my solo work.&quot;

Moving into 2016, Wilson&#x27;s views on a re-formation were conflicting. In February 2016, in an interview with &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;, he stated that there was a &quot;strong possibility&quot; of Porcupine Tree re-forming for another studio album at an undisclosed time in the future. However, in response to a question in August 2016 regarding a hypothetical Porcupine Tree performance, Wilson claimed, &quot;you&#x27;d be waiting for a long time, that band doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.&quot; In August 2017, Wilson explained: &quot;It&#x27;s no coincidence that since my solo project has taken off, other collaborations have receded to the background. Porcupine Tree hasn&#x27;t made a record since 2009 and No-Man hasn&#x27;t made a record since 2008. I feel less need now to be creatively involved in something other than my solo work. My solo work fulfills the musical needs I have now.&quot;

In a March 2018 interview when asked about the chances of further activity from Porcupine Tree he responded; &quot;Honestly, I would say zero, because I&#x27;m just not that kind of person. I don&#x27;t go backwards. I&#x27;m not interested in going backwards; I want to move forwards, I want to do different things, I want to work with different people, I want to explore different kinds of music. That would seem like a terribly backward step to me. I&#x27;m proud of the catalogue; it&#x27;s there, it exists, but it&#x27;s kind of closed, it&#x27;s finished.&quot; These statements caused an increased tension between him and Barbieri, who was waiting for Wilson to return to Porcupine Tree. However, in February 2021, Wilson suggested that a re-formation was still possible someday, when it was least expected.

===Reunion, &quot;Closure/Continuation&quot; and future (2021–present)===

On 27 October 2021, Porcupine Tree, Wilson, and Harrison all shared a teaser video and mailing list link across their social media accounts, along with a stylised &quot;P/T C/C&quot; image. On 1 November the band announced their eleventh album, &quot;Closure/Continuation&quot;, to be released in June 2022 on Music For Nations, along with their first single in over 12 years, &quot;Harridan&quot;. The lineup of the band now features just Wilson, Harrison, and Barbieri, with guitarist Randy McStine and bassist Nathan Navarro being added to the touring lineup. The album was recorded over 11 years in complete secrecy. Wilson explained Edwin&#x27;s absence with the two losing contact when the project went on hiatus and stylistic differences, though Barbieri was adamant to say &quot;I don&#x27;t want any of this to negatively impact Colin or imply this was somehow his fault.&quot; &quot;Closure/Continuation&quot; was released on 24 June 2022.

In a March 2022 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Wilson addressed the band&#x27;s future, stating that he was unsure whether this would be the final project by the band or if the reunion would continue past the album. He then stated it was most likely their last album, as he hoped to end the band on a strong note. In a late June 2022 interview with Under the Radar, however, Wilson expressed his interest in making another Porcupine Tree record that would be more keyboard dominant.

The band began the first leg of the Closure/Continuation tour in September 2022, with shows in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile. The tour&#x27;s second leg, starting in October 2022 and carrying through until November 2022, was composed of select cities in Europe and a single performance in the UK at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena. Wilson later noted that the band&#x27;s few 2023 live performances would likely be their last, though he stated that they would like to record again. The show at Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam on 7 November 2022 was filmed and recorded and was released on 8 December 2023 as &quot;Closure/Continuation.Live&quot;.

In a February 2025 interview with NME, Wilson revealed that the band had written a couple of new songs and said that he suspected a new record was possible in the future.

==Musical style==
===Influences===
Some of the inherent musical background of Porcupine Tree goes back to Wilson&#x27;s childhood, when his parents gave Christmas presents to each other. His father received Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; whilst his mother got Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;, both of which Wilson listened to heavily. These albums influenced his further songwriting. Other influences include The Beatles, Camel and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Later in his teens, Wilson briefly became a fan of the new wave of British heavy metal, but as soon as he discovered 1970s music and progressive rock, his interest in metal diminished in favour of experimental music. He later (in the 2000s) discovered bands in the likes of Gojira, Sunn O))), Neurosis, and Meshuggah, which restored his faith in metal music. &quot;For a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find where all these creative musicians were going...&quot;, said Wilson, &quot;and I found them, they were working in extreme metal.&quot; Shortly thereafter, he went on to produce three consecutive albums by Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth, which had a considerable influence in his further songwriting.

The influence of electronic music and krautrock is present, with Wilson namechecking bands such as Can, Neu!, Tangerine Dream, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin and artists such as Klaus Schulze and Conrad Schnitzler, among others. He has mentioned on multiple occasions that he admires the work of American musician Trent Reznor, the founding member of Nine Inch Nails. Wilson has also cited English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), along with other potentially &quot;surprising&quot; influences such as ABBA, The Carpenters, Electric Light Orchestra, and the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack album (1977), largely written and performed by the Bee Gees.
===Characteristics===
The music of Porcupine Tree is often described as melancholic. Wilson has stated music is a way for him to channel all his negative feelings, and &quot;an exorcism of those elements within&quot;, finding it &quot;easier to write songs about the negative side of the world than it is about the happy side of the world.&quot; In the &quot;Warszawa&quot; live radio broadcast album, before performing &quot;Stop Swimming&quot;, Wilson can be heard saying &quot;the saddest music is often the most beautiful.&quot;

Porcupine Tree is an album-oriented band, making records where many songs are related to each other. Wilson has said: &quot;The important thing with Porcupine Tree is that all our songs have a unique sound world that they inhabit. I don&#x27;t like the idea of any song sounding like any other song. So most of the time it&#x27;s a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path, or particular musical atmosphere, or flavour.&quot; For their recordings, the band has included mellotron, banjo, hammered dulcimer, and guimbri, among other instruments unusual for rock bands.

Above all, Porcupine Tree&#x27;s music has maintained a strong textural and experimental quality, often fusing many genres in a single track. The band&#x27;s work is noted for its atmospheric nature, largely due to Barbieri&#x27;s keyboard style and sound-processing abilities, and Wilson&#x27;s cinematic scope, as a declared fan of American filmmaker David Lynch, whose films are renowned for their sonic content. &quot;Very layered, very produced, very arranged and [with] complex arrangements&quot; is the way Wilson describes the sound of the band. Apart from their regular edition, the albums &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;, &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot;, &quot;In Absentia&quot;, &quot;Deadwing&quot;, &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot;, and &quot;The Incident&quot; are available in DTS (5.1 Surround Sound) mix; this mixing technique has become a tradition for the band in recent years.

The band&#x27;s live performances have also been praised, with Music Radar placing them fourth in their list of &quot;The 30 greatest live acts in the world today&quot; in 2010.

Porcupine Tree are often categorised as a progressive rock band. Although many listeners familiar with the group label them as such, Steven Wilson has been noted in the past to express a certain dislike for the use of the term &quot;progressive&quot; to refer to them. However, more recently, he made note that he has since become more relaxed toward the word considering it is becoming &quot;a much broader term&quot; as time passes. He has frequently stated that he dislikes the press comparing Porcupine Tree with neo prog bands or citing them as &#x27;the New Pink Floyd&#x27;.

== Legacy ==
Porcupine Tree have influenced a new generation of artists and bands.

Anders Nyström of the Swedish group Katatonia has cited the work of Porcupine Tree as a large influence for the band in their post-death metal eras. Luc Lemay, leader of the technical death metal band Gorguts, said that &quot;The Incident&quot; was &quot;a big revelation&quot; for him, inspiring his more recent songwriting. He singled out the concert of its tour as one of the two most important he has attended. Electronic producer Seven Lions also cited them as an inspiration for his dubstep and drum and bass compositions.

In addition to those artists who state that Porcupine Tree has been a direct influence on their own careers, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work including Neil Peart, Alex Lifeson, Adrian Belew, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, Arjen Lucassen, Rob Swire, Haken and many others.

<doc id="364937" wikidata="Q4051113" url="?curid=364937" title="The Hacker's Handbook">
<text>The Hacker&#x27;s Handbook is a non-fiction book in four editions, each reprinted numerous times between 1985 and 1990, and explaining how phone and computer systems of the period could be &#x27;hacked&#x27;. It contains candid and personal comments from the book&#x27;s British author, Hugo Cornwall, a pseudonym of Peter Sommer who is now Professor of Digital Forensics at Birmingham City University, and frequently appears in the United Kingdom courts as an expert on digital evidence and computer forensics for both prosecution and defence as well as being a media pundit and author on information security topics. He advised the UK Parliament on the Investigatory Powers Act, 2016.

One popular aspect of the book is the apparently salacious printouts of actual hacking attempts (although confidential details, such as passwords, are blacked out).

The first edition, the version most easily available for download, was published in 1985. The last of four editions , edited by Steve Gold appeared in 1989 with reprints running into 1990. In 1990, the UK Parliament passed the Computer Misuse Act. Publication of additional editions might have been construed to be incitement to commit an offence under that Act.

The book is now largely of historic interest. Cornwall / Sommer wrote two other books: DataTheft in 1987 and Industrial Espionage Handbook in 1992.

<doc id="364941" wikidata="Q608901" url="?curid=364941" title="Music of Barbados">
<text>The music of Barbados includes distinctive national styles of folk and popular music, including elements of Western classical and religious music. The culture of Barbados is a syncretic mix of African and British elements, and the island&#x27;s music reflects this mix through song types and styles, instrumentation, dances, and aesthetic principles.

Barbadian folk traditions include the Landship movement, which is a satirical, informal organization based on the Royal Navy, tea meetings, tuk bands and numerous traditional songs and dances. In modern Barbados, popular styles include calypso, spouge, contemporary folk and world music. Barbados is, along with Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, one of the few centres for Caribbean jazz.

==Characteristics and musical identity==

Bajan culture is syncretic, and the island&#x27;s musical culture is perceived as a mixture of African and British musics, with certain unique elements that may derive from indigenous sources. Tension between African and British culture has long been a major element of Barbadian history, and has included the banning of certain African-derived practices and black Barbadian parodies of British traditions. Simple entertainment is the basis for most Barbadians&#x27; participation in music and dance activities, though religious and other functional musics also occur. Barbadian folk culture declined in importance in the 20th century, but then rekindled in the 1970s, when many Barbadians became interested in their national culture and history. This change was heralded by the arrival of spouge, a popular national genre that reflects Barbadian heritage and African origins; spouge helped kindle a resurgence in national pride, and became viewed as Barbados&#x27; answer to the popular Caribbean genres reggae and calypso from Jamaica and Trinidad, respectively.

The religious music of the Barbadian Christian churches plays an important role in Barbadian musical identity, especially in urban areas. Many distinctive Barbadian musical and other cultural traditions derive from parodies of Anglican church hymns and British military drills. The British military performed exhibition drills to both provide security for the island&#x27;s population, as well as intimidate slaves. Modern Barbadian tea meetings, tuk bands, the Landship tradition and many folk songs come from slaves parodying the practices of white authorities. British-Barbadians used music for cultural and intellectual enrichment and to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the British Isles through the maintenance of British musical forms. Plantation houses featured music as entertainment at balls, dances and other gatherings. For Afro-Barbadians, drum, vocal and dance music was an integral part of everyday life, and songs and performance practices were created for normal, everyday events, as well as special celebrations including Whitsuntide, Christmas, Easter, Landship and Crop Over. These songs remain a part of Barbadian culture and form a rich folk repertoire.

Western classical music is the most socially accepted form of musical expression for Barbadians in Bridgetown, including a variety of vocal music, chamber and orchestral music, and piano and violin. Along with hymns, oratorios, cantatas and other religious music, chamber music of the Western tradition remains an important part of Barbadian music through an integral role in the services of the Anglican church.

==History==
Though inhabited prior to the 16th century, little is known about Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island&#x27;s heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the tobacco industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of the tobacco industry and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.

By the 19th century, the Barbadian colonialists grew to fear slave revolts, and specifically, the use of music as a tool of communication and planning for revolution. As a result, the government passed laws to restrict musical activities among slaves. At the same time, American and other forms of imported music were brought to Barbados, while many important elements of modern Barbadian music, such as &quot;tuk band&quot;s, also emerged. In the 20th century, many new styles were imported to Barbados, most influentially including jazz, ska, reggae, calypso and soca. Barbados became home to many performers of these new genres, especially soca and calypso, while the island also produced an indigenous style called spouge, which became an important symbol of Barbadian identity.

==Folk music==

Barbadian culture and music are mixtures of European and African elements, with minimal influence from the indigenous peoples of the island, about whom little is known. Significant numbers of Asian, specifically Chinese and Japanese, people have moved to Barbados, but their music is unstudied and has had little impact on Barbadian music.

The earliest reference to Afro-Barbadian music may come from a description of a slave rebellion, in which the rebels were inspired to fight by music played on skin drums, conch trumpets and animal horns. Slavery continued, however, and the colonial and slaveowning authorities eventually outlawed musical instruments among slaves. By the end of the 17th century, a distinctly Barbadian folk culture developed, based around influences and instruments from Africa, Britain and other Caribbean islands.

Early Barbadian folk music, despite legal restrictions, was a major part of life among the island&#x27;s slave population. For the slaves, music was &quot;essential for recreation and dancing and as a part of the life cycle for communication and religious meaning&quot;. African musicians also provided the music for the white landowners&#x27; private parties, while the slaves developed their own party music, culminating in the crop over festival, which began in 1688. The earliest crop over festivals featured dancing and call-and-response singing accompanied by &quot;shak-shak&quot;, banjo, bones and bottles containing varying amounts of water.

===Folk song===

Barbadian traditional folk songs are heavily influenced by the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current at the time of their composition, such as the emancipation of the slaves of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential Barbadian folk songs are associated with the island&#x27;s lower-class labourers, who have held on to their folk heritage.

Some Barbadian songs and stories made their way back to England, most famously &quot;Inckle the English Sailor&quot; and &quot;Yarico the Indian Maid&quot;, which became English plays and an opera by George Coleman with music by Samuel Arnold, and first performed in London in 1787.

Contemporary Barbadian folk songs, especially through the pioneering albums of author and singer-songwriter Anthony Kellman, show a bold fusion of indigenous rhythms such as tuk and calypso with African, Latin, jazz, pop, and East Indian influences. Kellman&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Mountain&quot; (from 2000 album &quot;Wings of A Stranger&quot;); &quot;King Jaja&quot; and &quot;My Dog, Your Dog&quot; (from 2005 album &quot;Limestone&quot;); and &quot;If You See My Girl&quot; and &quot;Tuk, Tabla, and Fedounoum&quot; (from 2009 album &quot;Blood Mates&quot;), exemplify his eclectic style. More than any of his contemporaries, Kellman, through his songs, poems and novels, demonstrates what it means to be Barbadian through a hybrid mix of African and European cultural elements.

===Dance===

Barbadian folk dances include a wide variety of styles, performed at Landship, holidays and other occasions. Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of Barbadian culture, known for dancing in the costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant to imitate the passage of a Royal Navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.

The &quot;Jean and Johnnie&quot; dance was an important part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed outdoors at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that it allowed women to show off to men and, more rarely, vice versa. The dance was eventually banned because it was associated with non-Christian African traditions.

===Instrumentation===

The Barbadian folk tradition is home to a great variety of musical instruments, imported from Africa, Great Britain or other Caribbean islands. The most central instrument group in Barbadian culture is the percussion instruments. These include numerous drums, among them the &quot;pump&quot; and the &quot;tum tum&quot;, made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, the side snare drum and a double-headed bass drum of tuk bands. Folk musicians also use gongs made from tree trunks, bones, rook jaw, triangle, cymbals, bottles filled with water, and xylophones. Rattles are also widespread, and include the pan-Antillean &quot;shak-shak&quot; and the calabash, &quot;de shot and rattle&quot;. More recently imported folk percussion instruments include the conga and bongo from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Cuba, and the tambourine.

String and wind instruments play an important role in Barbadian folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern groups also use an electric and bass guitar. The &quot;shukster&quot; is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between two sides of a house. Traditional Barbadian wind instruments are largely metal, but in their folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. Barbadian villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and trombone.

===Religious music===

Though Western classical and other musics play an important role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most Barbadians. The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian Barbadians come together with family members to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week&#x27;s work.

Pentecostal music has become a part of Barbadian religious and musical traditions since the 1920s. Music plays a role in Pentecostal ceremonies, and is provided by emotional and improvised performances accompanied tambourines. In addition to the Anglican and Pentecostal traditions, Rastafarian music has spread to the island in more recent years, along with African-American musical forms, especially gospel, and the Spiritual Baptist religion, which derives from the Trinidadian Shango cult that spread to Barbados in the 1960s. One of the more Internationally known religious music groups from Barbados are The Silvertones of Barbados.

===Holidays, festivals and other celebrations===
A number of holidays, festivals and other celebrations play an integral role in Barbadian folk, and popular, music. Whitsuntide, Christmas, and Easter are important, each associated with their own musical traditions, as are distinctly Barbadian festivities like the crop over festival and the Landship movement.

The original crop over festival celebrated the end of the sugarcane harvest. These festivals were held in the great house of the plantations, and included both slaves and plantation managers. Celebrations included drinking competitions, feasting, song and dance, and climbing a greased pole. Musical accompaniment was provided by triangle, fiddle, drums and a guitar, played by slave entertainers. Crop over festivals continue to play a part of Barbadian culture, and always feature music by performers in sugarcane-cutting costumes, even though many modern performers are not themselves sugarcane-cutters.

The Barbadian Landship movement is an informal entertainment organization which mocks, through mimicry and satire, the Royal Navy. Landship began in 1837, founded by an individual known variously as &quot;Moses Ward&quot; and &quot;Moses Wood&quot;, in Britton&#x27;s Hall in Seamen&#x27;s Village. The structure of the Landship organization mirrors the structure of the Royal Navy, with a &quot;ship&quot; which is connected to a &quot;dock&quot; (a wooden house similar to a chattel house), and leaders known as &quot;Lord High Admiral&quot;, &quot;Captain&quot;, &quot;Boatswain&quot; and other navy ranks. Each unit is named like a typical navy ship and may include actual names of British ships or places. Landship performances symbolize and reflect the passage of ships through rough seas. Parades, jigs, hornpipes, maypole dances and other music and dance types are a part of the Landship Society&#x27;s celebrations. The Council of the Barbados Landship Association regulates the movement.

Barbadian Christmas music is mostly based on church and concert hall performances, where typical North American Christmas carols are performed, such as &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silver Bells&quot;, alongside works by English composers including William Byrd, Henry Walford Davies and Thomas Tallis. In more recent years, calypso, reggae and other new elements have become a part of local Christmas traditions. As recently as the 1960s, Barbados was home to a distinctive practice, in which &quot;scrubbers&quot; travelled from house to house singing hymns and receiving rewards from households.

===Tuk bands and tea meetings===

Tuk bands are Barbadian musical ensembles, consisting of a bow-fiddle or pennywhistle flute, kittle triangle and a snare and double-headed bass drum. The kittle and bass drum provide the rhythm, while the flute gives the melody. The drums are light-weight so they can be carried easily, and are made by both rural villagers and drummers using cured sheepskin and goatskin. Tuk bands are based on the British military&#x27;s regimental bands, which played for many years for special occasions, such as visiting royalty and coronations. The tuk sound has evolved over the years, as has the instrumentation, with the bow-fiddle used before being most commonly replaced by the pennywhistle flute. Tuk bands are now most common in Landship events, but are still sometimes independent. On their own, tuk bands are generally accompanied by a range of iconic Barbadian characters, including &quot;shaggy bears&quot;, &quot;mother sally&quot;, &quot;the steel donkey&quot; and &quot;green monkeys&quot;. The upbeat modern sound of tuk ensembles are a distinctly Barbadian blend of African and British musics.

Tea meetings are celebrations held in society lodges or school halls, and feature both solo and group performance, theatrical rhetoric and oratory, and other activities. After declining following World War I, tea meetings have recently been revived and have regained their widespread popularity. They are held at nighttime, beginning at 9:00 pm and continuing until midnight, when there is a two-hour break for food and drink before the tea meeting is resumed.

==Popular music==
Barbados has produced few internationally popular musicians, with worldwide pop superstar Rihanna being the most famous. It has, however, created a well-developed local scene playing imported styles such as American jazz and calypso, as well as the indigenous spouge style. Calypso was the first popular music in Barbados, and dates back to the 1930s. Barbadian calypso is a comedic song form, accompanied by guitar and banjo. More recent styles of calypso have also kept a local scene alive, and produced a number of famous calypsonians. Spouge is a mixture of calypso and other styles, especially ska, and became very popular in the 1960s, around the same time as the Barbadian jazz scene grew in stature and became home to a number of famous performers. Modern Barbadian popular music is largely based around reggae, ragga and soca, and includes some elements of indigenous styles. Artists like Terencia Coward have used modern popular music with instrumentation borrowed from folk &quot;tuk&quot; bands. Two of the more popular bands of Barbadian popular music are Krosfyah and Square One [now defunct]. Artists such as Shirley Stewart, the lead singer of the band The Escorts International has gone on to produce hit songs such as the classic &quot;Walk Away From Love&quot;, which is one of the most-played songs on the party scene in Barbados and through the world. &quot;Walk Away From Love&quot; remained at number one on the charts for months both in Barbados and throughout the Caribbean. The new wave of singers, largely soca, include Rupee, Lil&#x27; Rick and Jabae with lead vocalist Bruce and Barry Chandler, all recent winners at crop over. A more experimental artist such as poet and fiction writer Anthony Kellman writes thoughtful poetic lyrics delivered in a musical style deeply rooted in Barbadian indigenous folk music with strong elements of African and Latin influences. His albums &quot;Wings of a Stranger&quot;, &quot;Limestone&quot;, and &quot;Blood Mates&quot; have been described as groundbreaking due to his highly original style.

==Calypso==

Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso was called &quot;banja&quot;, and was performed by labourers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels such as Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humour, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.

The mid-20th century brought new forms of music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the Barbadian calypso style came to be viewed as lowbrow or inferior. Promoters such as Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular tradition alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers set the stage for the development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.

In the early 1960s, Barbadian calypso grew in popularity and stature, led by Viper, Mighty Gabby and The Merrymen. The first calypso competitions were held in 1960, and they quickly grew larger and more prominent. The Merrymen became the island&#x27;s most prominent contribution to calypso by the 1970s and into the 1980s. Their style, known as &quot;blue beat&quot;, incorporated Barbadian folk songs and ballads, as well as American blues, country music, and a distinctive sound created by harmonica, guitar and banjo.

By the beginning of the 1980s, &quot;kaiso&quot;, a form of stage-presented calypso pioneered in Trinidad, was widespread at crop over and other celebrations. The foundation of the National Cultural Foundation in 1984 helped to promote and administer calypso festivals, which attracted tourists, stimulating the calypso industry. As a result, calypso has become a very visible and iconic part of Barbadian culture, and some calypsonians have become internationally renowned, including Mighty Gabby and Red Plastic Bag.

===Spouge===

Spouge is a style of Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is primarily a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by a wide variety of musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.

Two different kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, &quot;raw spouge&quot; (&quot;Draytons Two style&quot;) and &quot;dragon spouge&quot; (&quot;Cassius Clay style&quot;). The spouge industry grew immensely by the end of the 1970s, and produced popular stars including The Escorts International, Blue Rhythm Combo, the Draytons Two and The Troubadours. Recent years has seen a resurgence of interest in spouge among some quarters, with Desmond Weekes of the Draytons Two being among people indicating that spouge should be encouraged because it is a national form that can reach international audiences and inspire the nation&#x27;s pride in their cultural heritage.

In 2024 &quot;Pure Spouge Gospel&quot; EP album was released which features five original songs written and performed by Lana Spooner-Jack in the Barbadian-owned genre Spouge. The music for the album was composed by mixing and mastering engineer Jeffrey Y. Grosvenor at his studio &quot;Edge Cliff&quot;, in Gatineau, Quebec who added his own creativity by infusing African rhythms and Latin patterns. Each track on the album carries its own unique blend. The track &quot;Come and Buy (Isaiah 55)&quot; has a Meringue pattern that was altered to fit the Spouge rhythm; &quot;In the Same Boat&quot; has a Senagalese mbalax pattern. The congas are playing a Guaguancó pattern in &quot;Drop by Drop&quot;; and in the &quot;Christmas I Believe In&quot; track, the Spouge and the Cuban Bomba rhythms are played alternatively on the drum set. Very interesting combination! Of note, the song &quot;Singing Over Me&quot; is most likely the first Spouge song to be ever composed in the 3/4 time signature.

===Jazz===

Jazz is a genre of music from the United States that reached Barbados by the end of the 1920s. The first major performer from the island was Lionel Gittens, who was followed by Percy Green, Maggie Goodridge and Clevie Gittens. These bandleaders played a variety of music, including swing, a kind of pop-jazz, Barbadian calypso and waltzes. With little recorded music on the island, radio broadcasts such as Willis Conover&#x27;s &quot;Voice of America&quot; had a major influence. In 1937, riots over poverty and disenfranchisement occurred, and people such as Clement Payne had risen to fame advocating reform. In that year, Payne was deported and riots broke out in Bridgetown, spreading throughout the island. The following year, the Barbados Labour Party was formed by C. A. Braithwaite and Grantley Adams.

As political awareness among the black majority on the island spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad during a time when American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.

In the 1950s, R&amp;B and rock and roll became popular on the island, and many jazz bands found themselves pushed aside. A wave of Guyanese musicians also appeared on the island, including Colin Dyall, a saxophonist who later joined the Police Band, and the Ebe Gilkes Quartet. Though mainstream audiences were still listening to R&amp;B and rock, modern jazz retained a small core of followers into the 1960s. The foundation of the Belair Jazz Club in Bridgetown in 1961 helped to keep this scene alive. With independence in 1966 came a focus on black Barbadian culture, and music like calypso, reggae and spouge, rather than the preoccupation with British standards of musical development. Calypso jazz arose during this period, pioneered by groups like the Schofield Pilgrim. The genre had developed by 1965, when original works such as &quot;Jouvert Morning&quot; and &quot;Calypso Lament&quot; were composed. Artists including the pianist Adrian Clarke became popular during the &#x27;60s as well.

In the early 1970s, jazz fan and critic Carl Moore launched a project to keep jazz alive on the island, while Zanda Alexander&#x27;s performance in Bridgetown in 1972 is said to be the first Caribbean jazz festival. Oscar Peterson&#x27;s 1976 performance in Trinidad also inspired Barbadian musicians, as did the radio programme &quot;Jazz Jam&quot;, which was broadcast starting in the mid-&#x27;70s on the Caribbean Broadcast Corporation. In 1983, however, the Belair Jazz Club closed, and was not replaced by any long-term clubs. Later in the 1980s, jazz declined greatly in popularity, though The National Cultural foundation organized the International Barbados/Caribbean Jazz Festival, which after a brief hiatus due to lack of sponsorship was resurrected by Gilbert Rowe of GMR international tours. Other performances were organized by a group called the Friends of Jazz. More jazz calypso fusion musicians appeared on the scene during this period, including Arturo Tappin, Nicholas Brancker, Andre Woodvine and Raf Robertson.

===Rock===
Rock music is alive and well in Barbados, there have been several bands through the years that perform alternative, rock and even metal music. Most recently the Alt/Rock/Metal band Standing Penance formed in 2009. The band continues to operate in present-day and is the only act of this genre to be signed to an American record label.

==Education and musicology==

Academic study of Barbadian music remains limited. Some song collections and other activities have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due to a lack of archaeological and historical records, the island&#x27;s indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.

On modern Barbados, oral transmission remains the primary mode of music education, and there are few opportunities for most people to become formally educated in music of any kind. The elders of the island, who are the most educated in oral traditions, are held in high esteem due to their knowledge of folk culture. Modern Barbados is home to several institutions of musical education. There are dedicated schools for ballet: Dance Place and the Liz Mahon Dancers. A number of schools sponsor orchestras, steelbands and tuk bands, including the St. Lucy Secondary School Steel Orchestra. Music is a part of the curriculum for early childhood as well as primary and secondary education. The Barbados Community College has an associate degree programme in music. However, the University of the West Indies, though it has a campus on Barbados, does not offer degree programmes in music. As a matter of fact, only recently has the university started offering students the opportunity to pursue a minor in music.

==Music institutions and festivals==
The main music festival in Barbados is Crop Over, which is celebrated with song, dance, calypso tent competitions and parades, especially leading up to the first Monday in August, &quot;Kadooment Day&quot;. The crop over festival celebrates the end of the sugarcane harvest, and is inaugurated by the ritual delivery of the last of the harvest on a cart pulled by mules. The champion sugarcane workers are crowned King and Queen for the event. In addition to crop over, music plays an important role in many other Barbadian holidays and festivals. The Easter Oistins Fish Festival, for example features a street party with music to celebrate the signing of the &quot;Charter of Barbados&quot; and the fishing industry of the island, and the Holetown Festival, which commemorates the arrival of the first settlers in 1627.

The annual December Classical/Pops Festival comprises an all-star orchestra accompanied by pop and rock stars, Broadway performers, opera singers, and film composers as featured guests. Opera, cabaret and sports are a major part of the Easter Holders Season. On 30 November, the Barbadian Independence Day, military bands in parades play marches, calypsos and other popular songs. This is preceded for several weeks by the National Independence Festival of Creative Arts. The National Independence Festival of Creative Arts and Crop Over are two of the festivals sponsored by the National Cultural Foundation (NCF); the other is Congaline, a recently organized street party that begins in April and ends on May Day. NCF also assists with the Holers Opera Season, Oistins Fish Festival, Holetown Festival and the Barbados Jazz Festival.

Other major musical institutions in Barbados include the Barbados Chamber Orchestra and the Cavite Choral. There are also dance and ballet groups known as Dance National Afrique, Barbados Dance Theatre Company, Dance Strides, The Dance Place and Dancing Africa. The island&#x27;s music industry is home to several recording studios, the largest being &quot;Blue Wave&quot;, a 48-track system, and &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;, a 24-track system. Others include Chambers&#x27; Studio, Gray Lizard Productions and Ocean Lab Studios. 

The Barbados Music Awards is an annual event that started in 2006, honoring both local and international artists voted by both the public and a 50-strong committee. Previous winners have included Whitney Houston and Magnet Man.

<doc id="364942" wikidata="Q6941995" url="?curid=364942" title="Music of Anguilla">
<text>The music of Anguilla is part of the Lesser Antillean music area. The earliest people on the island were the Caribs and Arawaks, who arrived from South America. English settlers from St Kitts and Irish people colonized the island later. Unlike regional neighbors, however, the plantation system of agriculture which relied on chattel slavery never took root in Anguilla, causing a distinctly independent cultural makeup. The most recent influences on Anguilla&#x27;s musical life come from elsewhere in the Caribbean, especially the music of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, as well as abroad, especially the music of the United States and the United Kingdom. Anguilla&#x27;s Rastafarian heritage has played a role in the island&#x27;s music and culture and produced influential figures like activist Ijahnya Christian and Robert Athlyi Rogers, the author of &quot;The Holy Piby&quot;.

The island has produced a number of reggae, calypso, soca and country musicians. Of these, the latter is especially characteristic, as the genre of the country is not a part of the popular music in the Caribbean. Anguilla&#x27;s Island Harbour, an Irish-settled village on the east side of the island, is a major center for local country music. Soca is a recent musical influence and is often accompanied by frenzied, sexualized dancing called &quot;wukin up&quot;.

Notable musicians from Anguilla include Bankie Banx, who has released over ten albums and played with musicians such as Bob Dylan, Jimmy Cliff and Jimmy Buffett. He also opened a music bar called the Dune Preserve, built in order to save the Rendezvous Bay dune; the Dune Preserve is home to the Moonsplash Annual Music Festival. Other notable musicians include the soca group Xtreme Band, who gained regional fame following their success in the 2001 Carnival.

Music institutions in Anguilla include the Soroptimist Club and the annual Tranquility Jazz Festival, though the island&#x27;s most famous music celebration is Carnival, held near the beginning of August (the first Friday after the first Monday); it includes calypso competitions, &quot;j&#x27;ouvert&quot;, street dances, boat races, costumed parades and stilt walking, and beachside barbecues. Anguillans also celebrate the anniversary of emancipation in August and British holidays such as the King&#x27;s birthday. For the first time in 2005, Anguilla was home to a country music festival, which was promoted by American country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Other popular musicians from Anguilla include Evan Webster, who is the most famous recent performer to emerge from the island&#x27;s country music heritage.

In 2015, the island’s musical community was selected by music mogul and producer Kedar Massenburg to record a compilation collection titled &quot;Sounds of Anguilla (Volume 1)&quot;. The production marked the first album ever to feature artists from a single Caribbean island representing a multitude of genres: pop, reggae, hip-hop, soca, and R&amp;B.Proceeds from the sale of the compilation benefit the island&#x27;s musical community and support its efforts to record, tour, and present the island’s music to the world.

<text>Dubna () is a town in Moscow Oblast, Russia. It has a status of &quot;naukograd&quot; (i.e. town of science), being home to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, an international nuclear physics research center and one of the largest scientific foundations in the country. It is also home to MKB Raduga, a defense aerospace company specializing in design and production of missile systems, as well as to the Russia&#x27;s largest satellite communications center owned by Russian Satellite Communications Company. The modern town was developed in the middle of the 20th century and town status was granted to it in 1956. Population: 

==Geography==
The town is above sea level, situated approximately north of Moscow, on the Volga River, just downstream from the Ivankovo Reservoir. The reservoir is formed by a hydroelectric dam across the Volga situated within the town borders. The town lies on both banks of the Volga. The western boundary of the town is defined by the Moscow Canal joining the Volga, while the eastern boundary is defined by the Dubna River joining the Volga.

Dubna is the northernmost town of Moscow Oblast.

==History==

===Pre-World War II===
Fortress Dubna () belonging to Rostov-Suzdal Principality was built in the area in 1132 by the order of Yuri Dolgoruki and existed until 1216. The fortress was destroyed during the feudal war between the sons of Vsevolod the Big Nest. The village of Gorodishche () was located on the right bank of the Volga River and was a part of the Kashin Principality. Dubna customs post ( was located in the area and was a part of the Principality of Tver.

Before the October Revolution, few villages were in the area: Podberezye was on the left bank of the Volga, and Gorodishche, Alexandrovka, Ivankovo, Yurkino, and Kozlaki () were on the right bank.

Right after the Revolution one of the first collective farms was organized in Dubna area.

In 1931, the Orgburo of the Communist Party made a decision to build the Volga-Moscow Canal. Genrikh Yagoda, then the leader of the State Political Directorate, was put in charge of construction. The Canal was completed in 1937. Ivankovo Reservoir and Ivankovo hydroelectrical plant were also created as a part of the project. Many villages and the town Korcheva were submerged under water. Dubna is mentioned in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; as the town built by Gulag prisoners.

===Science===
The decision to build a proton accelerator for nuclear research was taken by the Soviet government in 1946. An impractical place where the current town is situated was chosen due to remoteness from Moscow and the presence of the Ivankovo power plant nearby. The scientific leader was Igor Kurchatov. The general supervisor of the project including construction of a settlement, a road and a railway connecting it to Moscow (largely involving penal labour of Gulag inmates) was the NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria. After three years of intensive work, the accelerator was commissioned on 13 December 1949.

The town of Dubna was officially inaugurated in 1956, together with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), which has developed into a large international research laboratory involved mainly in particle physics, heavy ion physics, synthesis of transuranium elements, and radiobiology. In 1960, a town of Ivankovo situated on the opposite (left) bank of the Volga was merged into Dubna. In 1964, Dubna hosted the prestigious International Conference on High Energy Physics.

Currently, a construction of the NICA particle collider, a megascience project is underway in Dubna.

Outstanding physicists of the 20th century including Nikolay Bogolyubov, Georgy Flyorov, Vladimir Veksler, and Bruno Pontecorvo used to work at the institute. A number of elementary particles and nuclei of transuranium elements (most recently, element 117) have been discovered and investigated there, leading to the honorary naming of chemical element 105 dubnium (Db) for the town.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Dubna Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Dubna Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Dubna Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
==Economics==
Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, JINR and MKB Raduga were the main employers in the town. Since then their role has decreased significantly. Several small industrial enterprises have emerged, however the town still experiences some employment difficulties. Proximity to Moscow allows many to commute and work there. Plans by AFK Sistema and other investors including government structures have been announced to build a Russian analogue of Silicon Valley in Dubna. As of the beginning of 2007, nothing has commenced.

===Transport===

Dubna is the starting point of the Moscow Canal. In addition to the canal, Dubna is connected to Moscow with the А104 highway, and the Savyolovsky suburban railway line provides access to Moscow.
Public transport connections to Moscow include express trains, suburban trains, and bus shuttles departing from the Savyolovsky Rail Terminal.

==Culture==

Among the city&#x27;s cultural facilities are: the Mir House of Culture, the Oktyabr Palace of Culture, a movie theater, 21 libraries, 4 music schools and a school of arts. In 1990, the Dubna Symphony Orchestra was established.

*Nine Days in One Year (1962)
*All Remains to People (1963)
*Vasili and Vasilisa (1981)
*Katya Ismailova (1994)
*Law of the Lawless (2002)

==Sports==

Dubna is located on the Moscow Canal and the Ivankovo Reservoir, making it a good destination for water sports such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, and water skiing.. In 2004, for the first time, a stage of the Water Ski World Cup took place in the city. In 2011, Dubna hosted the World Waterskiing Championships.
Dubna&#x27;s sports facilities include two stadiums, a waterskiing stadium on the Volga River, four swimming pools, tennis courts, and five sports complexes.

==Trivia==
One of the world&#x27;s tallest statues of Vladimir Lenin, high, built in 1937, is located at Dubna at the confluence of the Volga River and the Moscow Canal. The accompanying statue of Joseph Stalin of similar size was demolished in 1961 during the period of de-stalinization.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Dubna is twinned with:
* Giv&#x27;at Shmuel, Israel
* La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States
* Alushta, Ukraine
* Kurchatov, Kazakhstan
* Lincang, China

<text>Jet Set Willy is a platform video game written by Matthew Smith for the ZX Spectrum home computer. It was published in 1984 by Software Projects and ported to most home computers of the time.

The game is a sequel to &quot;Manic Miner&quot; published in 1983, and the second game in the Miner Willy series. It spent over three months at the top of the charts and was the UK&#x27;s best-selling home video game of 1984.

The player controls Miner Willy as he tidies up his mansion after a massive party to get some sleep. Players navigate Willy through 60 screens of the mansion and grounds, collecting glowing items while avoiding hazards and guardians.

The game features classical music from Beethoven, Grieg, Bach, and Mozart. Initially the game could not be completed due to various bugs, but fixes for these were released by Software Projects. &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; included a copy protection measure in the form of a card with coloured codes, making it more difficult to duplicate. Various expanded versions and ports were released, as well as third-party editing tools that allowed players to design their own rooms and sprites.

==Plot==
A tired Miner Willy has to tidy up all the items left around his house after a huge party. With this done, his housekeeper Maria will let him go to bed. Willy&#x27;s mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in &quot;Manic Miner&quot;, but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner&#x27;s experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; is a flip-screen platform game in which the player moves the protagonist, Willy, from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its predecessor, the player can explore the mansion at will. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging. The play area itself consists of 60 playable screens making up the mansion and its grounds and contains hazards (static killer objects), guardians (killer monsters which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other objects in the room.

Willy loses a life if he touches a hazard, guardian or falls too far. He is returned to the point at which he entered the room, which may lead to a game-ending situation where Willy repeatedly falls from a height or unavoidably collides with a guardian, losing all lives in succession.

One of the more bizarrely named rooms in the game is &quot;We Must Perform a Quirkafleeg&quot;. On some versions it is misspelt &quot;We Must a Quirkafleeg&quot;. The pre-release name for the screen was &quot;The Gaping Pit&quot;. This is a reference to the comic strip &quot;Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot;, a spin-off from the &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;; in the original comic, the quirkafleeg was an obscure ritual in a foreign country, required to be performed upon the sight of dead furry animals.

===Music===
Music on the Spectrum version is Beethoven&#x27;s Moonlight Sonata for the menu, and Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; during the game itself. Early versions played &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; as the in-game music, but this had to be removed when the publishers of the song demanded £36,000 for its use.

Music on the C64 version was Beethoven&#x27;s Moonlight Sonata during the title screen, and J.S. Bach - Inventions # 1 during gameplay. Some rooms also play Mozart&#x27;s Rondo alla Turca.

Music for the Atari 8-bit series was composed by Rob Hubbard.

===Bugs===
Upon release, the game could not be completed due to several bugs. Although four completely unrelated issues, they became known collectively as &quot;The Attic Bug&quot;. After entering &quot;The Attic&quot; screen, various rooms would undergo corruption for all subsequent playthroughs, including all monsters disappearing from &quot;The Chapel&quot; screen, and other screens triggering a game over. This was caused by an error in the path of an arrow in &quot;The Attic&quot;, resulting in the sprite traveling past the end of the Spectrum&#x27;s video memory and overwriting crucial game data. Initially Software Projects attempted to pass this bug off as an intentional feature to make the game more difficult, claiming that the rooms in question were filled with poison gas, but they later rescinded this claim and issued a set of POKEs to correct the flaws.

Despite these bugs, Ross Holman and Cameron Else won the competition that Software Projects had set for completion of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; and provided Software Projects with a set of bug fixes. Software Projects then hired Cameron Else to port both &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; to the MSX.

==Reception==

Reviewing &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for &quot;Your Spectrum&quot; magazine in June 1984, Sue Denham wrote that the game was &quot;every bit as good and refreshing as the original&quot;.

In the final issue of Your Sinclair, the ZX Spectrum version was ranked number 32 on &quot;The Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, and voted number 33 on &quot;The Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 2004, the ZX Spectrum version was voted the 6th best game all of time by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; readers in an article originally intended for a special issue of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; bundled with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;.

== Copy protection ==
&quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; came with a form of copy protection: a card with 180 coloured codes on it was bundled with the cassette. Upon loading, one of the codes from the card had to be entered before the game would start. Although the cassette could be duplicated, a copy of the card was also needed and at the time, home colour reproduction was difficult, making &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; harder to copy than most Spectrum games, but means of circumventing the card were quickly found, and one method was published in a UK computer magazine.

== Ports ==
A version of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for the Commodore 64 was released by Software Projects and ported by Shahid Kamal Ahmad.

The original releases of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for the BBC Micro and the Commodore 64 also contained bugs which made it impossible to complete the game. In the Commodore 64 version, it was impossible to reach all of the items in the &quot;Wine Cellar&quot;.

There are two versions of the original &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for the MSX. The Software Projects version that was sold in the UK is dated 1984 and was programmed by Cameron Else, co-winner of the &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; competition. The other version was published by Hudson Soft in 1985 as a Bee Card in Japan.

A port of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers was released by Tynesoft in 1986. It received generally poor reviews which criticised inferior graphics and animation, but Rob Hubbard&#x27;s theme music, unique to this version, was considered a highlight. Like the Spectrum version, it was impossible to complete but for different reasons. Some of the legitimate items that were needed caused the player to lose a life (e.g. the bottles in the &quot;Off Licence&quot;).

Ports from Software Projects for the Amiga and Atari ST were cancelled before release, but have since been made available on the internet.

== Legacy ==
=== Expanded versions ===
&quot;Jet Set Willy: The Final Frontier&quot;, an expanded version for the Amstrad CPC, was later converted back to the ZX Spectrum and released as &quot;Jet Set Willy II&quot;. Both the original game and &quot;Jet Set Willy II&quot; were released for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, MSX, Commodore 16 and Commodore 64.

A differently expanded version of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; was released for the Dragon 32/64, with extra rooms. This version could also not be completed as it was impossible to traverse &quot;The Drive&quot; in a right-to-left direction, which was necessary to return to bed after collecting all the items. The game could, however, be completed using a built-in cheat, accessed by holding down the keys M, A and X simultaneously, allowing the player to start Willy from any position on any screen, using the arrow keys and spacebar.

The Dragon port was itself converted to run on the Acorn Archimedes computers. Better collision detection meant that &quot;The Drive&quot; could now be completed right-to-left, unlike on the Dragon.

===Third-party modifications===
In its original Spectrum version, the rooms themselves are stored in a straightforward format, with no compression, making it relatively easy to create customised versions of the game.

The review of JSW in issue 4 of &quot;Your Spectrum&quot; included a section entitled &quot;JSW — A Hacker&#x27;s Guide&quot;; remarks in this section imply that the author had successfully deduced at least some of the data structures, since he was able to remove sections of wall in the Master Bedroom. The following year, issue 13 contained a program that added an extra room (&quot;April Showers&quot;) to the game, and issue 15 described the data formats in detail.

Several third-party editing tools were published between 1984 and 1986, allowing players to design their own rooms and sprites.

<text>Marvin Frederick Hamlisch (June 2, 1944 – August 6, 2012) was an American composer and conductor. He is one of a handful of people to win Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, a feat dubbed the &quot;EGOT&quot;. He and composer Richard Rodgers are the only people to have won those prizes and a Pulitzer Prize (&quot;PEGOT&quot;).

==Early life==
Hamlisch was born in Manhattan, to Viennese-born Jewish parents Lilly (née Schachter) and Max Hamlisch. His father was an accordionist and bandleader. Hamlisch was a child prodigy; by age five, he began mimicking the piano music he heard on the radio. A few months before he turned seven, in 1951, he was accepted into what is now the Juilliard School Pre-College Division. His favorite musicals growing up were &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

== Career ==
Hamlisch attended Queens College, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967. His first job was as a rehearsal pianist for &quot;Funny Girl&quot; with Barbra Streisand. Even on tour he would take time to book Kenny Veenstra&#x27;s Progressive Music Studio to send musical ideas back to &quot;Babs&quot; in NY. Shortly afterward, producer Sam Spiegel hired him to play piano at parties, and later to score Spiegel&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;The Swimmer&quot;. 

===Music for films===
Liza Minnelli&#x27;s 1964 debut album included &quot;The Travelin&#x27; Life&quot;, a song Hamlisch wrote in his teens (originally titled &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot;). His first hit arrived when he was 21 years old: &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows&quot;, co-written with Howard Liebling and recorded by Lesley Gore. It reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the summer of 1965. 

His first film score was for 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Swimmer&quot;. He also wrote music for several early Woody Allen films, including &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (1969) and &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971). 

Hamlisch and Liebling co-wrote the song &quot;California Nights&quot;, which was recorded by Lesley Gore for her 1967 hit album of the same name. The Bob Crewe-produced single peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100 in March 1967, two months after Gore had performed the song on the &quot;Batman&quot; television series, in which she guest-starred as an accomplice to Julie Newmar&#x27;s Catwoman.
Among Hamlisch&#x27;s better-known works during the 1970s were adaptations of Scott Joplin&#x27;s ragtime music for the film &quot;The Sting&quot;, including its theme song, &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. It hit No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart and No. 3 on the Hot 100, selling nearly 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. He had great success in 1973, winning two Academy Awards for the title song and the score for the motion picture &quot;The Way We Were&quot; and an Academy Award for the adaptation score for &quot;The Sting&quot;. He won four Grammy Awards in 1974, two for &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. 

In 1975, he wrote the original theme music for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;; the show used it for 12 years. He co-wrote &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) with his then-girlfriend Carole Bayer Sager, which would be nominated for an Oscar. In the 1980s, he had success with the scores for &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980) and &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982). He also received an Academy Award nomination in 1986 for the film version of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. 

In 1985, he worked on D.A.R.Y.L., a 1985 film about a boy who is in fact a U.S. military robot. He also worked on the score for &quot;The Informant!&quot; (2009), starring Matt Damon and directed by Steven Soderbergh. Late in his life, he wrote a children&#x27;s book &quot;Marvin Makes Music,&quot; which included the original music &quot;The Music in My Mind&quot; with words by Rupert Holmes; and the score for the HBO film &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot; (2013), also directed by Soderbergh and starring Matt Damon and Michael Douglas as Liberace.

===Stage===
Hamlisch&#x27;s first major stage work was in 1972 playing piano for Groucho Marx at Carnegie Hall for &quot;An Evening with Groucho&quot;. Hamlisch acted as both straight man and accompanist while Marx, at age 81, reminisced about his career in show business. The performances were released as a two-record set, and remained very popular.

He then composed the scores for the 1975 Broadway musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, for which he won both a Tony Award and a Pulitzer Prize; and for the 1978 musical &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, loosely based on his relationship with Carole Bayer Sager.

At the beginning of the 1980s, his romantic relationship with Bayer Sager ended, but their songwriting relationship continued. The 1983 musical &quot;Jean Seberg&quot;, based on the life of the real-life actress, failed in its London production at the UK&#x27;s National Theatre and never played in the U.S. In 1986, &quot;Smile&quot; was a mixed success and had a short run on Broadway. The musical version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1993) closed after only 188 performances, although he received a Drama Desk nomination, for Outstanding Music.

Shortly before his death, Hamlisch finished scoring a musical theatre version of &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, based on the 1963 film. The show played in July and August 2012, at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC) in Nashville, aiming for a Broadway run. The book is by Rupert Holmes, and the production was directed by Jerry Lewis.

===Conductor===

Hamlisch was musical director and arranger of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 1994 concert tour of the U.S. and England as well as of the television special, &quot;Barbra Streisand: The Concert&quot;, for which he received two of his Emmys. He also conducted several tours of Linda Ronstadt during this period, most notably on her successful 1996 &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot; tour of arenas and stadiums.

Hamlisch held the position of Principal Pops Conductor for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the Seattle Symphony, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, The National Symphony Orchestra Pops, The Pasadena Symphony and Pops, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.

On July 23, 2011, Hamlisch conducted his debut concert for Pasadena Symphony and Pops at The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Hamlisch replaced Rachael Worby. At the time of his death, he was preparing to assume responsibilities as Principal Pops Conductor for The Philly POPS.

==Accolades==
Hamlisch is one of ten people to win three or more Oscars in one night and the only one other than a director or screenwriter to do so. He also earned ten Golden Globe Award nominations, winning twice for Best Original Song, with &quot;Life Is What You Make It&quot; in 1972 and &quot;The Way We Were&quot; in 1974.

He shared the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1976 with Michael Bennett, James Kirkwood, Nicholas Dante, and Edward Kleban for his musical contribution to the original Broadway production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Hamlisch received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009 at the World Soundtrack Awards in Ghent, Belgium. He was also inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2008, he appeared as a judge in the Canadian reality series &quot;Triple Sensation&quot; which aired on CBC. The show was aimed to provide a training to a talented young man or woman with the potential to be a leader in song, dance, and acting. In 2008, Hamlisch was also inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

Hamlisch&#x27;s relationship with lyricist Carole Bayer Sager inspired the musical &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;. He was also in a relationship with actress Emma Samms. He was in a relationship with television personality Cyndy Garvey after her breakup with her husband, Steve Garvey.

In May 1989, Hamlisch married Terre Blair, from Columbus, Ohio, who was the weather and news anchor for that city&#x27;s ABC affiliate, WSYX-Channel 6. The marriage lasted until his death.

===Death===
After a brief illness, Hamlisch collapsed in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012, and died later that day at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center at age 68. According to Hamlisch&#x27;s death certificate, the cause of death was determined to be respiratory arrest, with hypertension and cerebral hypoxia as contributing factors.

The Associated Press described him as having written &quot;some of the best-loved and most enduring songs and scores in movie history&quot;. Barbra Streisand released a statement praising Hamlisch, stating it was &quot;his brilliantly quick mind, his generosity and delicious sense of humor that made him a delight to be around&quot;. Aretha Franklin called him &quot;classic and one of a kind&quot;, and one of the &quot;all-time great&quot; arrangers and producers. The head of the Pasadena Symphony and Pops commented that Hamlisch had &quot;left a very specific ... original mark on American music and added to the great American songbook with works he himself composed&quot;.

At 8:00 p.m. EDT on August 8, the marquee lights of the 40 Broadway theaters were dimmed for one minute in tribute to Hamlisch, an honor traditionally accorded upon their death to those considered to have made significant contributions to the theater arts.

Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, and Liza Minnelli took turns singing songs by Hamlisch during a memorial service for the composer on September 18, 2012. At the 2013 Academy Awards, Streisand sang &quot;The Way We Were&quot; in Hamlisch&#x27;s memory. On June 2, 2013, a tribute was held in New York City to remember Hamlisch in advance of the first anniversary of his death. At the tribute, Staples Players, a high school theatre group from Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut performed a selection of material from &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Other veterans of the screen and stage also performed at the event.

==Work==
===Orchestral work===

Hamlisch was the primary conductor for the Pittsburgh Pops from 1995 until his death.

The Dallas Symphony Orchestra performed a rare Hamlisch classical symphonic suite titled &quot;Anatomy of Peace&quot; (&quot;Symphonic Suite in one Movement For Full Orchestra/Chorus/Child Vocal Soloist&quot;) on November 19, 1991. It was also performed at Carnegie Hall in 1993, and in Paris in 1994 to commemorate D-Day. The work was recorded by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 1992. &quot;The Anatomy of Peace&quot; was a book by Emery Reves which expressed the world-federalist sentiments shared by Albert Einstein and many others in the late 1940s, in the period immediately following World War II.

<text>Mulhouse (; ; Alsatian: &quot;Mìlhüsa&quot; ; , meaning &quot;mill house&quot;) is a French city of the European Collectivity of Alsace (Haut-Rhin department, in the Grand Est region of France). It is near the France–Switzerland border and France–Germany border. It is the largest city in Haut-Rhin and second largest in Alsace after Strasbourg.

Mulhouse is known for its museums, especially the (also known as the , &#x27;National Museum of the Automobile&#x27;) and the (also known as , &#x27;French Museum of the Railway&#x27;), respectively the largest automobile and railway museums in the world. An industrial town nicknamed &quot;the French Manchester&quot;, Mulhouse is also the main seat of the Upper Alsace University, where the secretariat of the European Physical Society is found.

==Administration==
Mulhouse is a commune with a population of 108,312 in 2019. This commune is part of an urban unit also named Mulhouse with 247,065 inhabitants in 2018.

Additionally Mulhouse commune is the principal commune of the 39 communes which make up the of (m2A, population 280,000 in 2020).

Mulhouse commune is a subprefecture, the administrative centre of the Arrondissement of Mulhouse. It is one of the most populated sub-prefectures in France.

==History==


In 58 BC a battle took place west of Mulhouse and opposed the Roman army of Julius Caesar by a coalition of Germanic people led by Ariovistus. The first written records of the town date from the twelfth century. It was part of the southern Alsatian county of Sundgau in the Holy Roman Empire. From 1354 to 1515, Mulhouse was part of the Zehnstädtebund, an association of ten Free Imperial Cities in Alsace. The city joined the Swiss Confederation as an associate in 1515 and was therefore not annexed by France in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 like the rest of the Sundgau. An enclave in Alsace, it was a free and independent Calvinist republic, known as &quot;Stadtrepublik Mülhausen&quot;, associated with the Swiss Confederation until, after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798, it became a part of France in the Treaty of Mulhouse signed on 28 January 1798, during the Directory period of the French Revolution.

Starting in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Koechlin family pioneered cotton cloth manufacturing; Mulhouse became one of France&#x27;s leading textile centers in the nineteenth century. André Koechlin (1789–1875) built machinery and started making railroad equipment in 1842. The firm in 1839 already employed 1,800 people. It was one of the six large French locomotive constructors until the merger with Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden in 1872, when the company became Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques.

After the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Mulhouse was annexed to the German Empire as part of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine (1871–1918). The city was briefly occupied by French troops on 8 August 1914 at the start of World War I, but they were forced to withdraw two days later in the Battle of Mulhouse. French forces then reoccupied the city again on 19 August, before retreating again on 28 August having suffered heavy casualties. Alsatians who celebrated the appearance of the French army were left to face German reprisals, with several citizens sentenced to death. After World War I ended in 1918, French troops entered Alsace, and Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles. After the Battle of France in 1940, it was occupied by German forces until its return to French control at the end of World War II in May 1945.

The town&#x27;s development was stimulated first by the expansion of the textile industry and tanning, and subsequently by chemical and Engineering industries from the mid 18th century. Mulhouse was for a long time called the French Manchester. Consequently, the town has enduring links with Louisiana, from which it imported cotton, and also with the Levant. The town&#x27;s history also explains why its centre is relatively small.

===2025 Mulhouse stabbing attack===

On 22 February 2025, a 69-year-old Portuguese man, Lino Sousa Loureiro, was killed and several police officers were injured in a stabbing attack at a market in the centre of Mulhouse. A 37-year-old Algerian man, Ibrahim Abdessemed, was arrested at the scene and a terrorist inquiry was opened as the suspect reportedly shouted &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; when carrying out the attack.

==Geography==
Two rivers run through Mulhouse, the Doller and the Ill, both tributaries of the Rhine. Mulhouse is approximately from Strasbourg and Zürich; it is from Milan and about from Frankfurt. It is close to Basel, Switzerland and Freiburg, Germany. It shares the EuroAirport international airport with these two cities.

===Districts===
Medieval Mulhouse consists essentially of a lower and an upper town.
*The lower town was formerly the inner city district of merchants and craftsmen. It developed around the Place de la Réunion (which commemorates its reunion with France). Nowadays this area is pedestrianised.
*The upper town developed from the eighteenth century on. Previously, several monastic orders were established there, notably the Franciscans, Augustinians, Poor Clares and Knights of Malta.
*The &quot;Nouveau Quartier&quot; (New District) is the best example of urban planning in Mulhouse, and was developed from 1826 on, after the town walls had been torn down (as they were in many towns in France). It is focused around the &quot;Place de la République&quot;. Its network of streets and its triangular shape are a good demonstration of the town&#x27;s desire for a planned layout. The planning was undertaken by the architects G. Stolz and Félix Fries. This inner city district was occupied by rich families and the owners of local industries, who tended to be liberal and republican in their opinions.
*The Rebberg district consists of grand houses inspired by the colonnaded residences of Louisiana cotton planters. Originally, this was the town&#x27;s vineyard (the word &quot;Rebe&quot; meaning &quot;vine&quot; in German). The houses here were built as terraces in the English style, a result of the town&#x27;s close relationship with Manchester, where the sons of industrialists were often sent to study.

===Climate===
Mulhouse&#x27;s climate is temperate oceanic (Köppen: Cfb), but its location further away from the ocean gives the city colder winters with some snow, and often hot and humid summers, in comparison with the rest of France.

It is known for its &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings, and its pictures of allegories representing the vices and virtues.
* Workers&#x27; quarter (mid 19th century), inspired workers&#x27; quarters in many other industrial towns.

Many of these terms may vary between offensive, derogatory, neutral and affectionate depending on a complex combination of tone, facial expression, context, usage, speaker and shared past history.

== Terms for the British in English ==

=== Brit ===

Brit is a commonly used term in the United States, the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere, shortened from &quot;Briton&quot; or &quot;Britisher&quot;.

=== Limey ===

&quot;Limey&quot; (from lime / lemon) is a predominantly North American slang nickname for a British person. The word has been around since the mid-19th century. Intended as a pejorative, the word is not commonly used today, though it retains that connotation.

The term is thought to have originated in the 1850s as &quot;lime-juicer&quot;, later shortened to &quot;limey&quot;, and was originally used as a derogatory word for sailors in the Royal Navy. It derives from the Royal Navy&#x27;s practice, since the beginning of the 19th century, of adding lemon juice or lime juice to the sailors&#x27; daily ration of watered-down rum (known as grog), in order to prevent scurvy. Initially, lemon juice (from lemons imported from Europe) was used as the additive to grog on the Royal Navy ships, but that was later switched to limes, which were grown in British colonies. It was not understood that limes contain only one quarter as much vitamin C as lemons. Moreover, processing and storing the juice further reduced the amount of vitamin C present, and as a result, lime juice-based grog was not able to prevent scurvy.

In time, the term lost its naval connotation and was used to refer to British people in general and, in the 1880s, British immigrants in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Although the term may have been used earlier in the US Navy as slang for a British sailor or a British warship, such a usage was not documented until 1918. By 1925, the usage of &quot;limey&quot; in American English had been extended to mean any British person, and the term was so commonly known that it was featured in American newspaper headlines.

=== Pommy or pom ===

The terms pommy, pommie, and pom used in Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand usually denote a British person. Newspapers in Australia were using the term by 1912, with it appearing first in Western Australia, and was said to be short for pomegranate, with the terms &quot;jimmy&quot; and &quot;jimmigrant&quot; also in use. The term Ten-pound Pom refers to British (subsidized) migrants to Australia and New Zealand after World War II.

Disputes about whether the term &quot;Pom&quot; is derogatory or offensive have occurred since 1925. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot; defines its use as &quot;often derogatory&quot;, but after complaints to the Australian Advertising Standards Board about five advertisements using the term &quot;poms&quot;, the board ruled in 2006 that these words are inoffensive, in part because they are &quot;largely used in playful or affectionate terms&quot;. The New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority made a similar ruling in 2010. The BBC, the British national broadcaster, has used the phrase on occasion.

There are several folk etymologies for &quot;pommy&quot; or &quot;pom&quot;. The best-documented of these is that &quot;pommy&quot; originated as a contraction of &quot;pomegranate&quot;. According to this explanation, &quot;pomegranate&quot; was Australian rhyming slang for &quot;immigrant&quot; (like &quot;Jimmy Grant&quot;). Usage of &quot;pomegranate&quot; for English people may have been strengthened by a belief in Australia that sunburn occurs more frequently amongst English immigrants, turning those with fair skin the colour of pomegranates.

Another explanation – now generally considered to be a false etymology – was that &quot;pom&quot; or &quot;pommy&quot; were derived from an acronym such as POM (&quot;prisoner of Millbank&quot;), POME (&quot;prisoner of Mother England&quot;) or POHMS (&quot;prisoner of Her Majesty&#x27;s Service&quot;). However, there is no evidence that such terms, or their acronyms, were used in Australia when &quot;pom&quot; and &quot;pommy&quot; entered use there. Other theories are that they come from the use of &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns by the British in the First and Second Boer Wars, from a corruption of &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;, or from &quot;Pompey&quot;, a nickname for Portsmouth.

=== Tan ===

A pejorative used colloquially in Ireland, referring to the Black and Tan forces supplied by David Lloyd George to Ireland during the Irish War of Independence in order to assist the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in combating the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The force was composed mainly of First World War British Army veterans, who wore distinctive Khaki British Army uniforms with dark RIC overcoats. The term&#x27;s use is often used in Irish republican contexts. By extension, Great Britain is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tanland&quot;.

=== Tommy ===

The name Tommy for any soldier in the British Army is particularly associated with World War I. The German, the French and the British Commonwealth armies used the name &quot;Tommy&quot; for British soldiers. &quot;Tommy&quot; is derived from the name &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot; which had been used as a generic name for a soldier for many years (and had been used as an example name on British Army registration forms). The precise origin is the subject of some debate, but it is known to have been used as early as 1743. Rudyard Kipling published the poem &quot;Tommy&quot; (part of the &quot;Barrack Room Ballads&quot;) in 1892 and in 1893 the music hall song &quot;Private Tommy Atkins&quot; was published with words by Henry Hamilton and music by S. Potter. In 1898 William McGonagall wrote &quot;Lines in Praise of Tommy Atkins&quot;. The term is still used today in the British Army in the abridged version &quot;Tom&quot;, especially in the Infantry Regiments, to specifically refer to a junior enlisted soldier.

== In languages other than English ==

=== Europe ===

In Finnish the abbreviation of iso-britannialainen (literally &quot;Great/Large Briton&quot;) Britti is colloquially most commonly used for a British person, often also referring interchangeably to a person from England.

In Poland, a regular formal term to describe an English man is Anglik, in plural Anglicy, derived from the Polish word for England, Anglia, with the word Brytyjczyk meaning a British from the Polish name for Britain. Polish people often use terms &quot;Anglik&quot; and &quot;Anglia&quot; to talk about the whole UK, including Scotland, Wales etc. Derogatory or disdainful (or sometimes just funny or ironic) terms coined in recent years are Angol and Brytol however, due to negative connotations they are not used in formal writing or by the media or are used in social media and various alternative sources with varied connotations.

In the Czech Republic the term Anglán is often used, which has the same roots as the Polish &quot;Anglik&quot; – the Czechs call England Anglie. This word carried no derogatory connotations. However, unlike the formal Angličan, it is not used by the press because of its informality.

In Hungary the English are called angol or in plural angolok. England is called Anglia. British people in general are called brit or in plural britek but the term is less widespread and very uncommon. Great Britain is called Nagy-Britannia but the United Kingdom is called Egyesült Királyság.

==== &quot;Inselaffe&quot; / &quot;Insel-Affe&quot; ====
Inselaffe (&quot;island ape&quot;) is a pejorative German term allegedly dating back to English scientists Darwin and Wallace&#x27;s publications on evolution. 

==== &quot;Rosbif&quot;/&quot;Rosbeef&quot;/&quot;Bife&quot; ====
The original explanation of the French term rosbif is that it referred to the English tradition of cooking roast beef, and especially to the song &quot;The Roast Beef of Old England&quot;.

In Portugal, the term bife (literally meaning &#x27;steak&#x27;, but sounding like &quot;beef&quot;) is used as a slang term to refer to the English. There is a feminine form, bifa, mainly used to refer to English female tourists in Portugal.

==== &quot;Les goddams&quot; ====
&quot;Les goddams&quot; (sometimes &quot;les goddems&quot; or &quot;les goddons&quot;) is an obsolete ethnic slur historically used by the French to refer to the English, based on their frequent expletives. The name originated during the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453) between England and France, when English soldiers achieved notoriety among the French for their frequent use of profanity and in particular the interjection &quot;God damn&quot;.

==== &quot;Brittunculi&quot; ====
In one of the Vindolanda tablets from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall the pejorative Latin word &quot;Brittunculi&quot; (wretched little brits).

=== Africa ===

Afrikaans speakers may use the term rooinek (literally &#x27;red neck&#x27;, another reference to sunburning) in reference to the British, or to White South Africans of British descent. During the Second Boer War, the British became known as khakis, in reference to the colour of their uniforms – which, by then, was no longer the red coats as those were unsuitable for the South African climate.

Another now largely archaic term used by Afrikaners to describe South Africans of British descent is soutie or soutpiel, meaning &#x27;salty&#x27; or &#x27;salty penis&#x27; respectively. The meaning behind this is that they have one foot in Britain and one foot in South Africa, leaving their penis to hang in the salty sea water.

In the East African Bantu languages mzungu has come to mean any white European but more often than not especially the British or English, due to their prior presence in the region.

=== Latin America ===
Argentinians use the Spanish term pirata (pirate) to pejoratively refer to the British, in reference to the longstanding Falklands dispute.

=== Middle East ===
During the British Mandate in Palestine, British troops of the 6th Airborne Division were often referred to as כלניות or &quot;Kalaniot&quot;, being Hebrew for Anemones, reflecting their red berets.

In Iraq, British occupying forces post WWI were known as “Abu Naji”

=== Indian subcontinent ===

In Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu the term Angrez is used to refer to the British. This word has its origin in Portuguese &quot;Inglês&quot;, meaning &#x27;Englishman&#x27;. A derivative is the term Angrezan or Angrezni, meaning an Englishwoman. Among the Europeans, the Portuguese were the first to arrive in India. The influx of the Portuguese led to language contact between their tongue and the local languages. As a consequence of this, a Portuguese pidgin developed that served as the lingua franca.

The term Farangi (&quot;Franks&quot;) has been used in Persian language since the 13th century to refer to all Europeans, Western Europeans in particular. Hindustani/Hindi has adopted this word from Persian and it is used to refer to the Europeans in general (including the British).

The adjective Gora (Gori for females) is also commonly used amongst Britons with subcontinental roots to refer to white Britons, although the term literally translates to &#x27;fair-skinned one&#x27;, and thus could and is applied to individuals of any ethnicity with a fair complexion, including British Asians themselves. The adjective has also been used as a noun to describe white people – hence its potential usage as a racial slur.

In Nepal, the British are often referred to as Kuires/Khaires, which means &#x27;people of white or pale colour&#x27;. It is also used in general for any European person with white skin.

Ingraj is used in Maharashtra (Marathi) and West Bengal (Bengali) in India to refer to British people. The word Vilyati is also used for describing British people.It comes from Vilayat for foreign land. The English variation of Vilayat is Blighty.

Malayalis of Kerala use the term Sayyippu or Vellakkaran to refer to a male westerner.

In Assam (which became part of British India in 1828), the British are called Boga Bongal (literally meaning &#x27;white foreigners&#x27; or &#x27;white intruders&#x27;).

In Tamil Nadu the Tamil word Vellaikaaran means &#x27;white man&#x27; and usually refers to members of the British colonial government in the 18th to 19th century. It is used in the present day to refer anyone who is White with European origin; many rural Tamil villagers still believe that all Europeans are either British or of British descent.

=== Southeast Asia ===

In Malaysia, one common Malay equivalent is Mat Salleh. The term may have originated from the general depiction of Royal Navy sailors who were often drunk (Mad Sailors); due to the locals&#x27; unfamiliarity with English, it became corrupted as mat salleh (Mat and Salleh are both typical Malay names). Another possible origin of the phrase is the Mat Salleh Rebellion, led by North Borneo chief Mat Salleh, against the British North Borneo Company during the late 19th century. Another alternative to &quot;mat salleh&quot; is orang putih (literally &#x27;white people&#x27; in Malay) or its shortened rural form, omputih. In ancient Malaccan times, the term orang deringgi was also used.
Balanda from Hollander is another word from Malay used by Makassarese and in northern Australia.

In Thai, the word anggrit (อังกฤษ) is used to describe both the English in particular, and the British in general. In everyday speech the word Farang (ฝรั่ง) is usually used to describe British people as well as other light-skinned Europeans. Some foreigners regard this word as racist. In journalism, the expression puu dee (ผู้ดี) meaning &#x27;nobleman&#x27; is sometimes used to denote &#x27;English&#x27;.

Southeast Asian Hokkien and Teochew speakers also call the British ang mo (紅毛), which literally means &#x27;red-haired&#x27;. The term was originally used to describe Dutch traders, but is now used for all white people.

=== East Asia ===

The following terms are used to mean &#x27;Britain&#x27; or &#x27;British&#x27; and use etymologies mostly unrelated to &quot;Britain&quot;:
* Chinese: &quot;Yīngguó&quot; (Simplified characters: 英国, Traditional characters: 英國)
* Japanese: &quot;Eikoku&quot; (Kanji: )
* Korean: &quot;Yeongguk&quot; (Hangul: , Hanja: 英國)
* Vietnamese: &quot;Anh Quốc&quot; (Chữ nôm: )

These terms are also used to refer to England in unofficial contexts. More formal names also exist, such as the Chinese 聯合王國 Liánhéwángguó and Japanese 連合王国 Rengōōkoku literally meaning &#x27;United Kingdom&#x27;. Separate words exist in all of these languages for each of the constituent parts of the UK, including England, although, as elsewhere, there is little awareness of correct usage. The Chinese Dàbùlièdiān (Hanzi: 大不列颠) is used for historical purposes to mean &#x27;Great Britain&#x27;. The first character means &#x27;Great&#x27; and the other three have unrelated meanings, having been selected for the sound instead of meaning. In Chinese, yīngjílì (Simplified characters: 英吉利), a transliteration of &quot;English&quot;, is also used to refer Britain in general.

The Chinese &quot;Yīngguó&quot;, the Japanese &quot;Eikoku&quot;, and the Korean &quot;Yeongguk&quot; are all derived from the traditional Chinese characters 英国/國, where the first character 英 has no meaning in this context, although in Chinese, 英 is phonetically similar to &quot;Eng&quot;, as in &quot;England&quot;, and the second character 国 means &#x27;country&#x27;, &#x27;nation&#x27;, or &#x27;kingdom&#x27;. While Korean is now written in the phonetic Hangul alphabet, when writing or using Chinese characters Koreans will use the traditional character for &quot;kingdom,&quot; 國, rather than its simplified counterpart 国, which is in everyday use in China and Japan.

In Hong Kong, gweilo (pronounced [kʷɐ̌i lǒu]) is a slang word to generally refer to white westerners. It has a history of racial degradation, however it can be used non-racially and more generally in modern Hong Kong. &quot;Gwei&quot; means ghost and &quot;lo&quot; means guy, referring to their pale skin.

In Japanese, the term Igirisu (Katakana: ) is used interchangeably with &quot;Eikoku&quot;, but is considered slightly more foreign because it comes from the Portuguese word &quot;Inglês&quot; (English) – despite this origin, &quot;Igirisu&quot; refers to the United Kingdom as a whole, and not specifically to England, which is Ingurando (Katakana: ) and so &quot;Igirisu&quot; is more commonly used.

=== Oceania ===

As with the South East Asian term &quot;Farangi&quot; and the Northern Australian term &quot;Balanda&quot; (see above), the Māori term Pākehā and general Polynesian term Palagi have been used generically for Europeans for many years; given that the predominant early European settlers in Australia, New Zealand and many Pacific islands spoke English, these terms are occasionally used specifically for English or British people. The Māori term for the English language, for instance, is &quot;Reo Pākehā&quot;.

<text>Edward Paul Abbey (January 29, 1927 – March 14, 1989) was an American author and essayist noted for his advocacy of environmental issues, criticism of public land policies, and anarchist political views. His best-known works include the novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, which has been cited as an inspiration by radical environmental groups, and the non-fiction work &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Abbey was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania on January 29, 1927, to Mildred Postlewait and Paul Revere Abbey. Mildred was a schoolteacher and a church organist, and gave Abbey an appreciation for classical music and literature. Paul was a socialist, anarchist, and atheist whose views strongly influenced Abbey.

Abbey graduated from high school in Indiana, Pennsylvania, in 1945. Eight months before his 18th birthday, when he faced with being conscripted into the U.S. military, Abbey decided to explore the American southwest. He traveled by foot, bus, hitchhiking, and freight train hopping. During this trip he fell in love with the desert country of the Four Corners region. Abbey wrote:
&quot;[...] crags and pinnacles of naked rock, the dark cores of ancient volcanoes, a vast and silent emptiness smoldering with heat, color, and indecipherable significance, above which floated a small number of pure, clear, hard-edged clouds. For the first time, I felt I was getting close to the West of my deepest imaginings, the place where the tangible and the mythical became the same.&quot;

In the U.S. Army, Abbey applied for a clerk typist position but instead he served two years as a military police officer in Italy. Abbey was promoted in the army twice but due to his tendency to oppose authority, was twice demoted and was honorably discharged as a private. His experience in the military left him with a distrust for large institutions and regulations which influenced his writing throughout his career and strengthened his anarchist beliefs.

When he returned to the United States, Abbey took advantage of the G.I. Bill to attend the University of New Mexico, where he received a B.A. in philosophy and English in 1951, and a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1956. During his time in college, Abbey supported himself by working a variety of odd jobs, including being a newspaper reporter and bartending in Taos, New Mexico. During this time he had few male friends but had close relationships with a number of women. Shortly before getting his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Abbey married his first wife, Jean Schmechal (another UNM student). While an undergraduate, Abbey was the editor of a student newspaper in which he published an article titled &quot;Some Implications of Anarchy&quot;. A cover quotation of the article, &quot;ironically attributed to Louisa May Alcott&quot;, stated &quot;Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.&quot; University officials seized all of the copies of the issue and removed Abbey from the editorship of the paper.

Upon receiving his honorable discharge papers, he sent it back to the department with the words &quot;Return to Sender&quot;. The FBI took note and added a note to his file which was opened in 1947 when Edward Abbey committed an act of civil disobedience; he posted a letter while in college urging people to rid themselves of their draft cards. Abbey was on the FBI&#x27;s watch-list since then and he was watched throughout his life. In 1952, Abbey wrote a letter against the draft in times of peace and again the FBI took notice, writing, &quot;Edward Abbey is against war and military.&quot; Throughout his life, the FBI took notes, building a profile on Abbey, observing his movements and interviewing many people who knew him. Towards the later part of his life, Abbey learned of the FBI&#x27;s interest in him and said &quot;I&#x27;d be insulted if they weren&#x27;t watching me.&quot;

After graduating, Schmechal and Abbey traveled together to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Abbey spent a year at Edinburgh University as a Fulbright scholar. During this time, Abbey and Schmechal separated and ended their marriage. In 1951 Abbey began having an affair with Rita Deanin, who in 1952 would become his second wife after he and Schmechal divorced. Deanin and Abbey had two children, Joshua N. Abbey and Aaron Paul Abbey.

Abbey&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis explored anarchism and the morality of violence, asking the two questions: &quot;To what extent is the current association between anarchism and violence warranted?&quot; and &quot;In so far as the association is a valid one, what arguments have the anarchists presented, explicitly or implicitly, to justify the use of violence?&quot;. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Abbey spent 1957 at Stanford University on a Wallace Stegner Creative Writing Fellowship.

==Work for National Park Service==

In 1956 and 1957, Abbey worked as a seasonal ranger for the United States National Park Service at Arches National Monument (now a national park), near the town of Moab, Utah. Abbey held the position from April to September each year, during which time he maintained trails, greeted visitors, and collected campground fees. He lived in a house trailer that had been provided to him by the Park Service, as well as in a ramada that he built himself. During his stay at Arches, Abbey accumulated a large volume of notes and sketches which later formed the basis of his first non-fiction work, &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot;. Abbey&#x27;s second son Aaron was born in 1959, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

In the 1960s Abbey worked as a seasonal park ranger at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, on the border of Arizona and Mexico. In 1961, the movie version of his second novel, &quot;The Brave Cowboy,&quot; with screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, was being shot on location in New Mexico by Kirk Douglas who had purchased the novel&#x27;s screen rights and was producing and starring in the film, released in 1962 as &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot;. Douglas once said that when Abbey visited the film set, he looked and talked so much like friend Gary Cooper that Douglas was disconcerted. However, over 25 years later when Abbey died, Douglas wrote that he had &#x27;never met&#x27; him. In 1981, his third novel, &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, was also adapted into a TV movie by the same title.

On October 16, 1965 Abbey married Judy Pepper, who accompanied Abbey as a seasonal park ranger in the Florida Everglades, and then as a fire lookout in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Judy was separated from Abbey for extended periods of time while she attended the University of Arizona to get her master&#x27;s degree. During this time, Abbey slept with other women—something that Judy gradually became aware of, causing their marriage to suffer. On August 8, 1968 Pepper gave birth to a daughter, Susannah &quot;Susie&quot; Mildred Abbey. Ed purchased the family a home in Sabino Canyon, outside of Tucson. Judy died of leukemia on July 11, 1970, an event that crushed Abbey, causing him to go into &quot;bouts of depression and loneliness&quot; for years. It was to Judy that he dedicated his book &quot;Black Sun&quot;. However, the book was not an autobiographical novel about his relationship with Judy. Rather it was a story about a woman with whom Abbey had an affair in 1963. Abbey finished the first draft of &quot;Black Sun&quot; in 1968, two years before Judy died, and it was &quot;a bone of contention in their marriage&quot;.

&quot;Desert Solitaire&quot;, Abbey&#x27;s fourth book and first non-fiction work, was published in 1968. In it, he describes his stay in the canyon country of southeastern Utah from 1956 to 1957. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; is regarded as one of the finest nature narratives in American literature, and has been compared to Aldo Leopold&#x27;s &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; and Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;. In it, Abbey vividly describes the physical landscapes of southern Utah and delights in his isolation as a backcountry park ranger, recounting adventures in the nearby canyon country and mountains. He also attacks what he terms the &quot;industrial tourism&quot; and resulting development in the national parks (&quot;national parking lots&quot;), rails against the Glen Canyon Dam, and comments on various other subjects. In 1973, Abbey married his fourth wife Renee Downing. However, Abbey was always gone so they divorced after four years of marriage.

==Later life==
Abbey met his fifth and final wife, Clarke Cartwright in 1978, and married her in 1982. Together they had two children, Rebecca Claire Abbey and Benjamin C. Abbey. In 1995, Abbey&#x27;s granddaughter, Sophia Abbey-Kuipers, was born.

In 1984, Abbey went back to the University of Arizona to teach courses in creative writing and hospitality management. During this time, he continued working on his book &quot;Fool&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

In July 1987, Abbey went to the Earth First! Rendezvous at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. While there, he was involved in a heated debate over his views on immigration with an anarchist communist group known as Alien Nation. Abbey devoted an entire chapter in his book &quot;Hayduke Lives&quot; to the events that took place at the Rendezvous. In autumn of 1987, the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; published a letter by Murray Bookchin which claimed that Abbey, Garrett Hardin, and the members of Earth First! were racists and eco-terrorists. Abbey was extremely offended, and demanded a public apology, stating that he was neither racist nor a supporter of terrorism. All three of those Bookchin labelled &quot;racist&quot; opposed illegal immigration into the United States, contending that population growth would cause further harm to the environment. Regarding the accusation of &quot;eco-terrorism&quot;, Abbey responded that the tactics he supported were trying to defend against the terrorism he felt was committed by government and industry against living beings and the environment.

==Death and burial==
Edward Abbey died on March 14, 1989, at the age of 62, in his home in Tucson, Arizona. His death was due to hemorrhaging from esophageal varices; these are often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Showing his sense of humor, he left a message for anyone who asked about his final words: &quot;No comment.&quot; Abbey also left instructions on what to do with his remains: Abbey wanted his body transported in the bed of a pickup truck, and wished to be buried as soon as possible. He did not want to be embalmed or placed in a coffin. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag, and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. &quot;I want my body to help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree.&quot; said the message. For his funeral, Abbey stated &quot;No formal speeches desired, though the deceased will not interfere if someone feels the urge. But keep it all simple and brief.&quot; He requested gunfire and bagpipe music, a cheerful and raucous wake, &quot;[a]nd a flood of beer and booze! Lots of singing, dancing, talking, hollering, laughing, and lovemaking.&quot;

A 2003 &quot;Outside&quot; article described how his friends honored his request:

Abbey&#x27;s body was buried in the Cabeza Prieta Desert in Pima County, Arizona, where &quot;you&#x27;ll never find it.&quot; The friends carved a marker on a nearby stone, reading:

&lt;poem class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
EDWARD
PAUL
ABBEY
1927–1989
No Comment
&lt;/poem&gt;

In late March, about 200 friends of Abbey&#x27;s gathered near the Saguaro National Monument near Tucson and held the wake he requested. A second, much larger wake was held in May, just outside his beloved Arches National Park, with such notables as Terry Tempest Williams and Wendell Berry speaking.

== Documentaries ==
* &quot;Wrenched&quot;, by Jerome filmmaker ML Lincoln is a 2013 documentary film that picks up where Edward Abbey&#x27;s iconic novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; left off, chronicling Abbey&#x27;s legacy of environmental civil disobedience. This was originally called &quot;Lines Across the Sand&#x27;.
* &quot;Edward Abbey: A Voice in the Wilderness&quot; is a 1993 award-winning PBS documentary by Eric Temple.
* &quot;The Cracking of Glen Canyon Damn—with Edward Abbey and Earth First!&quot; (1982) captured the legendary first action of radical desert rats when they dropped a 300-foot long black plastic &quot;crack&quot; over the dam and called poetically for its demise. Produced by Toby McLeod, Glenn Switkes and Randy Hayes.

==Literature==

Abbey&#x27;s literary influences included Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Peter Kropotkin, and A. B. Guthrie, Jr. Although often compared to authors like Thoreau or Aldo Leopold, Abbey did not wish to be known as a nature writer, saying that he didn&#x27;t understand &quot;why so many want to read about the world out-of-doors, when it&#x27;s more interesting simply to go for a walk into the heart of it.&quot; The theme that most interested Abbey was that of the struggle for personal liberty against the totalitarian techno-industrial state, with wilderness being the backdrop in which this struggle took place. Most of Abbey&#x27;s writing criticizes the park services and American society for its reliance on motor vehicles and technology. He wanted to preserve the wilderness as a refuge for humans and believed that modernization was making us forget what was truly important in life.

Regarding his writing style, Abbey states: &quot;I write in a deliberately provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I have no desire to simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that&#x27;s entertaining as well as provocative. It&#x27;s hard for me to stay serious for more than half a page at a time.&quot; Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to &quot;speak the truth—especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic&quot;.

Abbey&#x27;s abrasiveness, opposition to anthropocentrism, and outspoken writings made him the object of much controversy. Agrarian author Wendell Berry claimed that Abbey was regularly criticized by mainstream environmental groups because Abbey often advocated controversial positions that were very different from those which environmentalists were commonly expected to hold.

Abbey has also drawn criticism for what some regard as his racist and sexist views. In an essay called &quot;Immigration and Liberal Taboos&quot;, collected in his 1988 book &quot;One Life at a Time, Please&quot;, Abbey expressed his opposition to immigration (&quot;legal or illegal, from any source&quot;) into the United States: &quot;[I]t occurs to some of us that perhaps ever-continuing industrial and population growth is &quot;not&quot; the true road to human happiness, that simple gross quantitative increase of this kind creates only more pain, dislocation, confusion and misery. In which case it might be wise for us as American citizens to consider calling a halt to the mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-genetically impoverished people. At least until we have brought our own affairs into order. Especially when these uninvited millions bring with them an alien mode of life which—let us be honest about this—is not appealing to the majority of Americans. Why not? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful—yes, beautiful!—society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty, and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see.&quot;

It is often stated that Abbey&#x27;s works played a significant role in precipitating the creation of Earth First!. &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; inspired environmentalists frustrated with mainstream environmentalist groups and what they saw as unacceptable compromises. Earth First! was formed as a result in 1980, advocating eco-sabotage or &quot;monkeywrenching&quot;. Although Abbey never officially joined the group, he became associated with many of its members, and occasionally wrote for the organization

<doc id="364976" wikidata="Q317167" url="?curid=364976" title="Bolide">
<text>A bolide is normally taken to mean an exceptionally bright meteor, but the term is subject to more than one definition, according to context. It may refer to any large crater-forming body, or to one that explodes in the atmosphere. It can be a synonym for a fireball, sometimes specific to those with an apparent magnitude of −4 or brighter.

==Definitions==

The word &quot;bolide&quot; (; from Italian via Latin, ) may refer to somewhat different phenomena depending on the context in which the word appears, and readers may need to make inferences to determine which meaning is intended in a particular publication. An early usage occurs in &quot;Natural History&quot;, where Pliny the Elder describes two types of prodigies, &quot;those which are called lampades and those which are called bolides&quot;. At least one of the prodigies described by Pliny (a &quot;spark&quot; that fell, grew to the &quot;size of the moon&quot;, and &quot;returned into the heavens&quot;) has been interpreted by astronomers as a bolide in the modern sense. His description of an object coming near the earth and continuing back into the sky matches the expected trajectory of a fireball crossing above an observer. A 1771 fireball that burst above Melun, France, was widely discussed by contemporary astronomers as a &quot;bolide&quot; and was the subject of an official French Academy of Sciences investigation led by Jean-Baptiste Le Roy. In 1794, Ernst Chladni published a book proposing that meteors were small objects that fell to Earth from space and that small bodies existed in space beyond the moon. Though initially ridiculed, Chladni&#x27;s book became the starting point for the modern field of meteoritics.

Astronomers use the word to describe any extremely bright meteor (or fireball), especially one that explodes in the atmosphere. Some astronomical definition specify an apparent magnitude of −4 or brighter. A superbolide reaches an apparent magnitude of −17 or brighter, which is roughly 100 times brighter than the full moon. Recent examples of superbolides include the Sutter&#x27;s Mill meteorite in California and the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia.

Geologists use the word to describe a very large impact event. The geological definition covers any generic large crater-forming impacting body whose composition (for example, whether it is a rocky or metallic asteroid, or an icy comet) is unknown.

The IAU has no official definition of &quot;bolide&quot;, and generally considers the term synonymous with fireball, a brighter-than-usual meteor; however, the term generally applies to fireballs reaching an apparent magnitude −4 or brighter. Astronomers tend to use &quot;bolide&quot; to identify an exceptionally bright fireball, particularly one that explodes (sometimes called a detonating fireball). It may also be used to mean a fireball that is audible.

=== Superbolide ===
Selected superbolide air bursts:
* Tunguska event (Russia, 1908)
* 2009 Sulawesi superbolide (Indonesia, 2009)
* Chelyabinsk meteor (Russia, 2013)

== Geology ==
Geologists use the term &quot;bolide&quot; differently from astronomers. In geology, it indicates a very large impactor. For example, the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center of the USGS uses &quot;bolide&quot; for any large crater-forming impacting body whose origin and composition is unknown, as, for example, whether it was a stony or metallic asteroid, or a less dense, icy comet made of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane. 

The most notable example is the bolide that caused the Chicxulub crater 66 million years ago. Scientific consensus agrees that this event directly led to the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs, and it is evidenced by a thin layer of iridium found at that geological layer marking the K–Pg boundary.

<text>The SAGEM Sperwer (Pronounced &quot;Spehr-wuhr&quot;, Dutch for Sparrowhawk) is an unmanned aerial vehicle manufactured by the French firm SAGEM. The aircraft is piloted remotely and can cruise at altitudes of over 16,000 feet for as long as five hours. It can send back images of targets up to 150 kilometers away from its ground control station.

==Operational history==
The Sperwer is currently in service with the French Army (61e régiment d&#x27;artillerie), the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Swedish Air Force, United States Air National Guard, Hellenic Army (Greece) with the Netherlands in the process of removing them from front line use.

Canadian Armed Forces operated the Sperwer in Afghanistan between 2003 and its last mission on 18 April 2009 when it was replaced with the Israeli built IAI Heron.

The Royal Danish Army also bought Sperwer, but a series of problems forced the Ministry of Defence to cancel the programme and sell the remainder to Canada. As well the Danish Army no longer operate any aircraft and there are no plans for UAVs by the Royal Danish Air Force. Canada itself removed the Sperwers from front-line use in 2009, while the Netherlands was planning to phase its Sperwer drones out of front line use in March 2009 in favor of rented UAVs from Israel&#x27;s Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd.

==Operators==
:Canadian Armed Forces. Designated CU-161 in service; retired.
:Danish Army. Programme cancelled.
:French Army. In service with three more ordered and an option on another five, all with enhanced sensors.
:Hellenic Army. In service.
:Royal Netherlands Air Force. Retired.
:Swedish Army. Designated UAV01 Ugglan (the Owl) in service; retired.
:Air National Guard.

==Aircraft on display==
Six of the retired Sperwers can be found in Canadian museums:

*AirForce Museum Society of Alberta – serial number 026
*Canada Aviation and Space Museum – serial number 001
*National Air Force Museum of Canada – serial number 007
*Greenwood Military Aviation Museum − 161026 and spare parts from 028

Two of the retired Sperwers can be found in Dutch museums:
*Nationaal Militair Museum, former Soesterberg Air Base Netherlands - serial number Z061

<doc id="364992" wikidata="Q8015712" url="?curid=364992" title="William Molineux">
<text>William Molineux ( 1713 – October 22, 1774) was a hardware merchant in colonial Boston of Irish descent best known for his role in the Boston Tea Party of 1773 and earlier political protests.

Molineux was unusual among the Boston Radical Whigs in having been born in England and emigrating to Massachusetts. He was also not part of the province&#x27;s Congregationalist orthodoxy, attending an Anglican church and reportedly dabbling with deist views. Insurance records show that Molineux broke British trade laws in his business by sending ships to the Dutch Republic, so he might have been motivated to join the radical cause by increased customs duties and enforcement in the 1760s. Colleagues like John Adams described him as a volatile man.

Molineux rose to prominence leading committees and crowds in demonstrations against the Townshend Acts, seizures by customs officers, and the stationing of British troops in Boston. He also organized a public works effort to employ the town&#x27;s poor at spinning and weaving linen. With Doctor Thomas Young he was one of the most radical among the genteel Whig organizers who sought to steer public demonstrations in Boston after 1765. On January 18, 1770, he advocated a march on acting governor Thomas Hutchinson&#x27;s mansion despite warnings that such an act against the king&#x27;s representative was tantamount to treason, and reportedly threatened to kill himself if his colleagues did not agree.

Molineux was the only top Whig organizer not in Old South Meeting House on the night of the Tea Party, meaning he was probably at the dock observing the destruction of the tea. In 1774, he set an example by refusing jury duty under royal judges and may have helped to gather field artillery for the province. However, in late October, he suddenly became ill, and on October 22 he died, reportedly saying, &quot;O save my Country, Heaven.&quot;

Conflicting rumors circulated. The working-class Whigs who followed Molineux suggested he had been poisoned by British army officers. Friends of the royal government said he had committed suicide after being caught embezzling for the linen project from a New York merchant whose affairs he represented. His estate was in debt to that man, but Molineux may have died of entirely natural causes.

Because Molineux died before the American Revolutionary War began, and because some of his colleagues were uncomfortable with his radical methods, he was largely omitted in histories of America&#x27;s independence. In fact, his name was preserved most prominently in a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne titled &quot;My Kinsman, Major Molineux,&quot; set in the 1740s, in which the title character is a victim, not a leader, of a Boston crowd. Molineux&#x27;s home on Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts was torn down to make room for the Massachusetts State House.

He is a featured character in the 2012 video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;.

In statistics, the Wishart distribution is a generalization of the gamma distribution to multiple dimensions. It is named in honor of John Wishart, who first formulated the distribution in 1928. Other names include Wishart ensemble (in random matrix theory, probability distributions over matrices are usually called &quot;ensembles&quot;), or Wishart–Laguerre ensemble (since its eigenvalue distribution involve Laguerre polynomials), or LOE, LUE, LSE (in analogy with GOE, GUE, GSE).

It is a family of probability distributions defined over symmetric, positive-definite random matrices (i.e. matrix-valued random variables). These distributions are of great importance in the estimation of covariance matrices in multivariate statistics. In Bayesian statistics, the Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior of the inverse covariance-matrix of a multivariate-normal random-vector.

==Definition==
Suppose is a matrix, each column of which is independently drawn from a -variate normal distribution with zero mean:

:formula_4

Then the Wishart distribution is the probability distribution of the random matrix 

:formula_5

known as the scatter matrix. One indicates that has that probability distribution by writing

:formula_6

The positive integer is the number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot;. Sometimes this is written . For the matrix is invertible with probability if is invertible.

If then this distribution is a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom.

==Occurrence==
The Wishart distribution arises as the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for a sample from a multivariate normal distribution. It occurs frequently in likelihood-ratio tests in multivariate statistical analysis. It also arises in the spectral theory of random matrices and in multidimensional Bayesian analysis. It is also encountered in wireless communications, while analyzing the performance of Rayleigh fading MIMO wireless channels .

==Probability density function==

The Wishart distribution can be characterized by its probability density function as follows:

Let be a symmetric matrix of random variables that is positive semi-definite. Let be a (fixed) symmetric positive definite matrix of size .

Then, if , has a Wishart distribution with degrees of freedom if it has the probability density function

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the determinant of formula_9 and is the multivariate gamma function defined as

:formula_10

The density above is not the joint density of all the formula_11 elements of the random matrix (such density does not exist because of the symmetry constrains formula_12), it is rather the joint density of formula_13 elements formula_14 for formula_15 (, page 38). Also, the density formula above applies only to positive definite matrices formula_16 for other matrices the density is equal to zero.

=== Spectral density ===
The joint-eigenvalue density for the eigenvalues formula_17 of a random matrix formula_18 is,

: formula_19

where formula_20 is a constant.

In fact the above definition can be extended to any real . If , then the Wishart no longer has a density—instead it represents a singular distribution that takes values in a lower-dimension subspace of the space of matrices.

==Use in Bayesian statistics==
In Bayesian statistics, in the context of the multivariate normal distribution, the Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior to the precision matrix , where is the covariance matrix.

===Choice of parameters===
The least informative, proper Wishart prior is obtained by setting .

A common choice for V leverages the fact that the mean of X ~&quot;Wp&quot;(V, &quot;n&quot;) is &quot;nV. Then V is chosen so that &quot;nV equals an initial guess for X. For instance, when estimating a precision matrix Σ−1 ~ &quot;Wp&quot;(V, &quot;n&quot;) a reasonable choice for V would be &quot;n&quot;−1Σ0−1, where Σ0 is some prior estimate for the covariance matrix Σ.

==Properties==

===Log-expectation===
The following formula plays a role in variational Bayes derivations for Bayes networks
involving the Wishart distribution. From equation (2.63),

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the multivariate digamma function (the derivative of the log of the multivariate gamma function).

===Log-variance===
The following variance computation could be of help in Bayesian statistics:

: formula_23

where formula_24 is the trigamma function. This comes up when computing the Fisher information of the Wishart random variable.

===Entropy===
The information entropy of the distribution has the following formula:

:formula_25

where is the normalizing constant of the distribution:

:formula_26

This can be expanded as follows:

:formula_27

===Cross-entropy===
The cross-entropy of two Wishart distributions formula_28 with parameters formula_29 and formula_30 with parameters formula_31 is

:formula_32

Note that when formula_33 and formula_34 we recover the entropy.

===KL-divergence===
The Kullback–Leibler divergence of formula_30 from formula_28 is

:formula_37

===Characteristic function===
The characteristic function of the Wishart distribution is

:formula_38

where denotes expectation. (Here is any matrix with the same dimensions as , indicates the identity matrix, and is a square root of ). Properly interpreting this formula requires a little care, because noninteger complex powers are multivalued; when is noninteger, the correct branch must be determined via analytic continuation.

==Theorem==
If a random matrix has a Wishart distribution with degrees of freedom and variance matrix — write formula_39 — and is a matrix of rank , then 

:formula_40

===Corollary 1===
If is a nonzero constant vector, then:

:formula_41

In this case, formula_42 is the chi-squared distribution and formula_43 (note that formula_44 is a constant; it is positive because is positive definite).

===Corollary 2===
Consider the case where (that is, the -th element is one and all others zero). Then corollary 1 above shows that

:formula_45

gives the marginal distribution of each of the elements on the matrix&#x27;s diagonal.

George Seber points out that the Wishart distribution is not called the “multivariate chi-squared distribution” because the marginal distribution of the off-diagonal elements is not chi-squared. Seber prefers to reserve the term multivariate for the case when all univariate marginals belong to the same family.

==Estimator of the multivariate normal distribution==
The Wishart distribution is the sampling distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution. A derivation of the MLE uses the spectral theorem.

==Bartlett decomposition==
The Bartlett decomposition of a matrix from a -variate Wishart distribution with scale matrix and degrees of freedom is the factorization:

:formula_46

where is the Cholesky factor of , and:

:formula_47

where formula_48 and independently. This provides a useful method for obtaining random samples from a Wishart distribution.

==Marginal distribution of matrix elements==
Let be a variance matrix characterized by correlation coefficient and its lower Cholesky factor:

:formula_49

Multiplying through the Bartlett decomposition above, we find that a random sample from the Wishart distribution is

:formula_50

The diagonal elements, most evidently in the first element, follow the distribution with degrees of freedom (scaled by ) as expected. The off-diagonal element is less familiar but can be identified as a normal variance-mean mixture where the mixing density is a distribution. The corresponding marginal probability density for the off-diagonal element is therefore the variance-gamma distribution

:formula_51

where is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Similar results may be found for higher dimensions. In general, if formula_52 follows a Wishart distribution with parameters, formula_53, then for formula_54, the off-diagonal elements 
:formula_55. 

It is also possible to write down the moment-generating function even in the &quot;noncentral&quot; case (essentially the &quot;n&quot;th power of Craig (1936) equation 10) although the probability density becomes an infinite sum of Bessel functions.

==The range of the shape parameter==
It can be shown that the Wishart distribution can be defined if and only if the shape parameter belongs to the set

:formula_56

This set is named after Gindikin, who introduced it in the 1970s in the context of gamma distributions on homogeneous cones. However, for the new parameters in the discrete spectrum of the Gindikin ensemble, namely,

:formula_57

the corresponding Wishart distribution has no Lebesgue density.

==Relationships to other distributions==
* The Wishart distribution is related to the inverse-Wishart distribution, denoted by formula_58, as follows: If and if we do the change of variables , then formula_59. This relationship may be derived by noting that the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of this change of variables is , see for example equation (15.15) in.
* In Bayesian statistics, the Wishart distribution is a conjugate prior for the precision parameter of the multivariate normal distribution, when the mean parameter is known.
* A generalization is the multivariate gamma distribution.
* A different type of generalization is the normal-Wishart distribution, essentially the product of a multivariate normal distribution with a Wishart distribution.

<doc id="365001" wikidata="Q1308944" url="?curid=365001" title="Hypnic jerk">
<text>A hypnic jerk, hypnagogic jerk, sleep start, sleep twitch, myoclonic jerk, or night start is a brief and sudden involuntary contraction of the muscles of the body which occurs when a person is beginning to fall asleep, often causing the person to jump and awaken suddenly for a moment. Hypnic jerks are one form of involuntary muscle twitches called myoclonus.

Physically, hypnic jerks resemble the &quot;jump&quot; experienced by a person when startled, sometimes accompanied by a falling sensation. Hypnic jerks are associated with a rapid heartbeat, quickened breathing, sweat, and sometimes &quot;a peculiar sensory feeling of &#x27;shock&#x27; or &#x27;falling into the void. It can also be accompanied by a vivid dream experience or hallucination. A higher occurrence is reported in people with irregular sleep schedules. When they are particularly frequent and severe, hypnic jerks have been reported as a cause of sleep-onset insomnia.

Hypnic jerks are common physiological phenomena. Around 70% of people experience them at least once in their lives with 10% experiencing them daily. They are benign and do not cause any neurological sequelae.

== Causes ==
According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), there is a wide range of potential causes, including anxiety, stimulants like caffeine and nicotine, stress, and strenuous activities in the evening. It also may be facilitated by fatigue or sleep deprivation. However, most hypnic jerks occur essentially at random in healthy people. Nevertheless, these repeated, intensifying twitches can cause anxiety in some individuals and a disruption to their sleep onset.

Sometimes, hypnic jerks are mistaken for another form of movement during sleep. For example, hypnic jerks can be confused with restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, hypnagogic foot tremor, rhythmic movement disorder, and hereditary or essential startle syndrome, including the hyperplexia syndrome. But some phenomena can help to distinguish hypnic jerk from these other conditions. For example, the occurrence of hypnic jerk arises only at sleep onset and it happens without any rhythmicity or periodicity of the movements and EMG bursts. Also, other pertinent history allows to differentiate it.

This physiological phenomenon can also be mistaken for myoclonic seizure, but it can also be distinguished by different criteria such as the fact that hypnic jerk occurs at sleep onset only or that the EEG is normal and constant. In addition, unlike seizures, there are no tongue bites, urinary incontinence and postictal confusion in hypnic jerk. This phenomenon can therefore be distinguished from other more serious conditions.

The causes of hypnic jerk are yet unclear and under study. None of the several theories that have attempted to explain it have been fully accepted.
One hypothesis posits that the hypnic jerk is a form of reflex, initiated in response to normal bodily events during the lead-up to the first stages of sleep, including a decrease in blood pressure and the relaxation of muscle tissue. Another theory postulates that the body mistakes the sense of relaxation that is felt when falling asleep as a sign that the body is falling. As a consequence, it causes a jerk to wake the sleeper up so they can catch themselves. A researcher at the University of Colorado suggested that a hypnic jerk could be &quot;an archaic reflex to the brain&#x27;s misinterpretation of muscle relaxation with the onset of sleep as a signal that a sleeping primate is falling out of a tree. The reflex may also have had selective value by having the sleeper readjust or review his or her sleeping position in a nest or on a branch in order to assure that a fall did not occur&quot;, but evidence is lacking.

During an epilepsy and intensive care study, the lack of a preceding spike discharge measured on an epilepsy monitoring unit, along with the presence only at sleep onset, helped differentiate hypnic jerks from epileptic myoclonus.

According to a study on sleep disturbances in the &quot;Journal of Neural Transmission&quot;, a hypnic jerk occurs during the non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and is an &quot;abrupt muscle action flexing movement, generalized or partial and asymmetric, which may cause arousal, with an illusion of falling&quot;. Hypnic jerks are more frequent in childhood with 4 to 7 per hour in the age range from 8 to 12 years old, and they decrease toward 1 or 2 per hour by 65 to 80 years old.

== Treatment ==
There are ways to reduce hypnic jerks, including reducing consumption of stimulants such as nicotine or caffeine, avoiding physical exertion prior to sleep, and consuming sufficient magnesium.

Some medication can also help to reduce or eliminate the hypnic jerks. For example, low-dose clonazepam at bedtime may make the twitches disappear over time.

In addition, some people may develop a fixation on these hypnic jerks leading to increased anxiety, worrying about the disruptive experience. This increased anxiety and fatigue increases the likelihood of experiencing these jerks, resulting in a positive feedback loop.

<text>Angelina Emily Grimké Weld (February 20, 1805 – October 26, 1879) was an American abolitionist, political activist, women&#x27;s rights advocate, and supporter of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. At one point she was the best known, or &quot;most notorious,&quot; woman in the country. She and her sister Sarah Moore Grimké were considered the only notable examples of white Southern women abolitionists. The sisters lived together as adults, while Angelina was the wife of abolitionist leader Theodore Dwight Weld.

Although raised in Charleston, South Carolina, Angelina and Sarah spent their entire adult lives in the North. Angelina&#x27;s greatest fame was between 1835, when William Lloyd Garrison published a letter of hers in his anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, and May 1838, when she gave a speech to abolitionists with a hostile, noisy, stone-throwing crowd outside Pennsylvania Hall. The essays and speeches she produced in that period were incisive arguments to end slavery and to advance women&#x27;s rights.

Drawing her views from natural rights theory (as set forth in the Declaration of Independence), the United States Constitution, Christian beliefs in the Bible, and her own childhood memories of the cruel slavery and racism in the South, Grimké proclaimed the injustice of denying freedom to any man or woman. When challenged for speaking in public to mixed audiences of men and women in 1837, she and her sister Sarah fiercely defended women&#x27;s right to make speeches and participate in political discourse.

In May 1838, Angelina married Theodore Dwight Weld, a prominent abolitionist. They lived in New Jersey with her sister Sarah and raised three children, Charles Stuart (1839), Theodore Grimké (1841), and Sarah Grimké Weld (1844). They earned a living by running two schools, the latter located in the Raritan Bay Union utopian community. After the Civil War ended, the Grimké–Weld household moved to Hyde Park, Massachusetts, where they spent their final years. Angelina and Sarah were active in the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association.

==Family background==
Grimké was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to John Faucheraud Grimké and Mary Smith, both from wealthy planter families. Her father was an Anglican lawyer, planter, politician, and judge, a Revolutionary War veteran, and a distinguished member of Charleston society. Her mother Mary was a descendant of South Carolina Governor Thomas Smith. Her parents owned a plantation and were major slaveholders. Angelina was the youngest of 14 children. Her father believed women should be subordinate to men and provided education to only his male children, but the boys shared their studies with their sisters.

==Early years and religious activity==
Both Mary and John Grimké were strong advocates of the traditional, upper-class, Southern values that permeated their rank of Charleston society. Mary would not permit the girls to socialize outside the prescribed elite social circles, and John remained a slaveholder his entire life.

Nicknamed &quot;Nina&quot;, young Angelina Grimké was very close to her older sister Sarah Moore Grimké, who, at the age of 13, persuaded her parents to allow her to be Angelina&#x27;s godmother. The two sisters maintained a close relationship throughout their lives, and lived together for most of their lives, albeit with several short periods of separation.

Even as a child, Angelina was described in family letters and diaries as the most self-righteous, curious, and self-assured of all her siblings. In her biography &quot;The Grimké Sisters from South Carolina&quot;, historian Gerda Lerner writes: &quot;It never occurred to [Angelina] that she should abide by the superior judgment of her male relatives or that anyone might consider her inferior, simply for being a girl.&quot; More so than her elder sister (and later, fellow abolitionist) Sarah, Angelina seemed to be naturally inquisitive and outspoken, a trait which often offended her traditional family and friends.

When the time came for her confirmation in the Episcopal Church at the age of 13, Angelina refused to recite the creed of faith. An inquisitive and rebellious girl, she concluded that she could not agree with it and would not complete the confirmation ceremony. Angelina converted to the Presbyterian faith in April 1826, aged 21.

Angelina was an active member of the Presbyterian church. A proponent of biblical study and interfaith education, she taught a Sabbath school class and also provided religious services to her family&#x27;s slaves—a practice her mother originally frowned upon, but later participated in. Grimké became a close friend of the pastor of her church, Rev. William McDowell. McDowell was a Northerner who had previously been the pastor of a Presbyterian church in New Jersey. Grimké and McDowell were both very opposed to the institution of slavery, on the grounds that it was a morally deficient system that violated Christian law and human rights. McDowell advocated patience and prayer over direct action and argued that abolishing slavery &quot;would create even worse evils&quot;. This position was unacceptable to the young Angelina.

In 1829, she addressed the issue of slavery at a meeting in her church and said that all members of the congregation should openly condemn the practice. Because she was such an active member of the church community, her audience was respectful when it declined her proposal. By this time the church had come to terms with slavery, finding biblical justification and urging good Christian slaveholders to exercise paternalism and improve the treatment of their slaves. But Angelina lost faith in the values of the Presbyterian church and in 1829 she was officially expelled. With her sister Sarah&#x27;s support, Angelina adopted the tenets of the Quaker faith. The Quaker community was very small in Charleston, and she quickly set out to reform her friends and family. However, given her self-righteous nature, her condescending comments about others tended to offend more than persuade. After deciding that she could not fight slavery while living in the South among white slaveowners, she followed her older sister Sarah to Philadelphia. She would never see Charleston or her mother again.

==Activism==

The Grimké sisters joined a Philadelphia chapter of the Quakers. During this period, they remained relatively ignorant of certain political issues and debates; the only periodical they read regularly was &quot;The Friend&quot;, the weekly paper of the Society of Friends. &quot;The Friend&quot; provided limited information on current events and discussed them only within the context of the Quaker community. Thus, at the time, Grimké was unaware of (and therefore uninfluenced by) events such as the Webster–Hayne debates and the Maysville Road veto, as well as controversial public figures such as Frances Wright.

For a time in Philadelphia, Angelina lived with her widowed sister, Anna Grimké Frost. The younger woman was struck by the lack of options for widowed women, which during this period were mostly limited to remarriage. Generally, women of the upper classes did not work outside the home. Realizing the importance of education, Angelina decided to become a teacher. She briefly considered attending the Hartford Female Seminary, an institution founded and run by her future adversary Catharine Beecher, but she remained in Philadelphia for the time being.

Over time, she became frustrated by the Quaker community&#x27;s lack of involvement in the contemporary debate on slavery. In the first two decades after the Revolution, its preachers had traveled in the South to preach manumission of slaves, but increased demand in the domestic market with the development of cotton in the Deep South ended that window of freedom. She began to read more abolitionist literature, including the periodicals &quot;The Emancipator&quot; and William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s &quot;The Liberator&quot; (in which she would later be published). Sarah and the traditional Quakers disapproved of Angelina&#x27;s interest in radical abolitionism, but she became steadily more involved in the movement. She began to attend anti-slavery meetings and lectures, and joined the newly organized Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1835.

In the fall of 1835, violence erupted when the controversial abolitionist George Thompson spoke in public. William Lloyd Garrison wrote an article in &quot;The Liberator&quot; in the hopes of calming the rioting masses. Angelina had been steadily influenced by Garrison&#x27;s work, and this article inspired her to write him a personal letter on the subject. The letter stated her concerns and opinions on the issues of abolitionism and mob violence, as well as her personal admiration for Garrison and his values. Garrison was so impressed with Grimké&#x27;s letter, which he called &quot;soul-thrilling,&quot; that he published it in the next issue of &quot;The Liberator,&quot; praising her for her passion, expressive writing style, and noble ideas. The letter, reprinted in the &quot;New York Evangelist&quot; and elsewhere, gave Angelina great standing among many abolitionists, but its publication offended and stirred controversy within the Orthodox Quaker meeting, which openly condemned such radical activism, especially by a woman. Sarah Grimké asked her sister to withdraw the letter, concerned that such publicity would alienate her from the Quaker community. Though initially embarrassed by the letter&#x27;s publication, Angelina refused. The letter was later reprinted in the &quot;New York Evangelist&quot; and other abolitionist papers; it was also included in a pamphlet with Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to the Citizens of Boston&quot;. In 1836, Grimké wrote &quot;An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South&quot;, urging Southern women to petition their state legislatures and church officials to end slavery. It was published by the American Anti-Slavery Society. Scholars consider it a high point of Grimké&#x27;s sociopolitical agenda.

In the fall of 1836, the Grimké sisters were invited to Ohio to attend the American Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s two-week training conference for anti-slavery agents; they were the only women in the group. There they met Theodore Dwight Weld, a trainer and one of the Society&#x27;s leading agents; Angelina and Theodore later married. During the following winter, the sisters were commissioned to speak at women&#x27;s meetings and organize women&#x27;s anti-slavery societies in the New York City region and nearby New Jersey. In May, 1837, they joined leading women abolitionists from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia in holding the first Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, held to expand women&#x27;s anti-slavery actions to other states.

Immediately after this convention, the sisters went by invitation of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society to Massachusetts. New England abolitionists were accused of distorting and exaggerating the realities of slavery, and the sisters were asked to speak throughout New England on their firsthand knowledge. Almost from the beginning, their meetings were open to men. Although defenders later claimed that the sisters addressed mixed audiences only because men insisted on coming, primary evidence indicates that their meetings were open to men by deliberate design, not only to carry their message to male as well as female hearers, but as a means of breaking women&#x27;s fetters and establish &quot;a new order of things.&quot; Thus, in addition to petitioning, women were transgressing social mores by speaking in public. In response, a state convention of Massachusetts&#x27; Congregational ministers, meeting at the end of June, issued a pastoral letter condemning public work by women and urging local churches to close their doors to the Grimkés&#x27; presentations.

As the sisters spoke throughout Massachusetts during the summer of 1837, the controversy over women abolitionists&#x27; public and political work fueled a growing controversy over women&#x27;s rights and duties, both within and outside the anti-slavery movement. Angelina responded to Catharine Beecher&#x27;s letter with open letters of her own, &quot;Letters to Catharine Beecher,&quot; printed first in &quot;The New England Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Liberator&quot;, and then in book form in 1838. Sarah Grimké wrote &quot;Letters on the Province of Woman, addressed to Mary S. Parker&quot;, which appeared first in the &quot;Liberator&quot; before being published in book form. Addressed to the president of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, who in the wake of the pastoral letter wanted women abolitionists to withdraw from public work, Sarah&#x27;s letters were a strong defense of women&#x27;s right and duty to participate on equal terms with men in all such work.

In February 1838, Angelina addressed a committee of the Massachusetts State Legislature, becoming the first woman in the United States to address a legislative body. She not only spoke against slavery, but defended women&#x27;s right to petition, both as a moral-religious duty and as a political right. Abolitionist Robert F. Wallcut stated that &quot;Angelina Grimké&#x27;s serene, commanding eloquence enchained attention, disarmed prejudice and carried her hearers with her.&quot;

On May 17, 1838, two days after her marriage, Angelina spoke at a racially integrated abolitionist gathering at the new Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia. As she spoke, an unruly mob outside of the hall grew more and more aggressive, shouting threats at Angelina and the other attendees. Rather than stop her speech, Angelina incorporated their interruptions into her speech:Men, brethren and fathers -- mothers, daughters and sisters, what came ye out for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? Is it curiosity merely, or a deep sympathy with the perishing slave, that has brought this large audience together? [A yell from the mob without the building.] Those voices without ought to awaken and call out our warmest sympathies. Deluded beings! &quot;they know not what they do.&quot; They know not that they are undermining their own rights and their own happiness, temporal and eternal. Do you ask, &quot;what has the North to do with slavery?&quot; Hear it -- hear it. Those voices without tell us that the spirit of slavery is &quot;here&quot;, and has been roused to wrath by our abolition speeches and conventions: for surely liberty would not foam and tear herself with rage, because her friends are multiplied daily, and meetings are held in quick succession to set forth her virtues and extend her peaceful kingdom. This opposition shows that slavery has done its deadliest work in the hearts of our citizens. Rioters outside the building began to throw bricks and stones, breaking the windows of the hall. Angelina continued the speech, and after her conclusion, the abolitionist women left the building arm-in-arm, a white woman with a Black woman, for the latter&#x27;s protection. Within hours, Pennsylvania Hall was destroyed by arson. Angelina was the final speaker in the Hall.

Angelina&#x27;s lectures were critical not only of Southern slaveholders but also of Northerners who tacitly complied with the status quo, by purchasing slave-made products and exploiting slaves through the commercial and economic exchanges they made with slave owners in the South. They were met with a considerable amount of opposition, both because Angelina was a female and because she was an abolitionist.

==Major writings==
Two of Grimké&#x27;s most notable works were her essay &quot;An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South&quot; and her series of letters to Catharine Beecher.

===&quot;An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South&quot; (1836)===
&quot;An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South&quot;, published by the American Anti-Slavery Society, is unique because it is the only written appeal made by a Southern woman to other Southern women regarding the abolition of slavery, written in the hope that Southern women would not be able to resist an appeal made by one of their own. The style of the essay is very personal in nature and uses simple language and firm assertions to convey her ideas. Angelina&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; was widely distributed by the American Anti-Slavery Society, and was received with great acclaim by radical abolitionists. However, it was also received with great criticism by her former Quaker community and was publicly burned in South Carolina.

&quot;The Appeal&quot; makes seven main arguments:

* First: that slavery is contrary to the Declaration of Independence;
* Second: that slavery is contrary to the first charter of human rights bestowed upon man in the Bible;
* Third: that the argument that slavery was prophesied, gives no excuse to slaveholders for encroaching on another man&#x27;s natural rights;
* Fourth: that slavery was never supposed to exist under patriarchal dispensation;
* Fifth: that slavery never existed under Hebrew Biblical law;
* Sixth: that slavery in America &quot;reduces man to a thing&quot;;
* Seventh, that slavery is contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles.

In this way, and as a devout believer, Angelina uses the beliefs of the Christian religion to attack the idea of slavery:

After walking through the seven-step theological argument against slavery, Angelina states the reasons for directing her plea toward Southern women in particular. She acknowledges a foreseeable objection: that even if a Southern woman agrees that slavery is sinful, she has no legislative power to enact change. To this, Grimké responds that a woman has four duties on the issue: to read, to pray, to speak, and to act. While women do not have the political power to enact change on their own, she points out that these women are &quot;the wives and mothers, the sisters and daughters of those who do.&quot; Her vision, however, was not so simple as what would later be called &quot;Republican Motherhood.&quot; She also exhorts women to speak and act on their moral opposition to slavery and to endure whatever persecution might result as a consequence. She dismisses the notion that women are too weak to withstand such consequences. Thus, she proposes the notion of women as empowered political actors on the slavery issue, without even touching on the question of suffrage.

Angelina also states, in a reply letter to Catharine E. Beecher, what she believes to be the abolitionist&#x27;s definition of slavery: &quot;Man cannot rightfully hold his fellow man as property. Therefore, we affirm that every slaveholder is a man-stealer; To steal a man is to rob him of himself.&quot; She reiterates well-known principles from the Declaration of Independence regarding the equality of man. Grimké argues that &quot;a man is a man, and as a man he has inalienable rights, among which is the right to personal liberty ... No circumstances can ever justify a man in holding his fellow man as property ... The claim to him as property is an annihilation of his rights to himself, which is the foundation upon which all his other rights are built.&quot;

The essay also reflects Angelina&#x27;s lifelong enthusiasm for the universal education of women and slaves. Her &quot;Appeal&quot; emphasizes the importance of women&#x27;s educating their slaves or future laborers: &quot;Should [your slaves] remain [in your employ] teach them, and have them taught the common branches of an English education; they have minds and those minds, ought to be improved.&quot;

===&quot;Letters to Catharine Beecher&quot;===
Angelina&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Catharine Beecher&quot; began as a series of essays made in response to Beecher&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Slavery and Abolitionism with Reference to the Duty of American Females,&quot; which was addressed directly to Grimké. The series of responses that followed Beecher&#x27;s essay were written with the moral support of her future husband, Weld, and were published in both &quot;The Emancipator&quot; and &quot;The Liberator&quot; before being reprinted as a whole in book form by Isaac Knapp, the &quot;Liberator&quot;&#x27;s printer, in 1838.

Beecher&#x27;s essay argues against the participation of women in the abolitionist movement on the grounds that women hold a subordinate position to men as &quot;a beneficent and immutable Divine law&quot;. It argues, &quot;Men are the proper persons to make appeals to the rulers whom they appoint ... [females] are surely out of their place in attempting to do it themselves.&quot; Grimké&#x27;s responses were a defense of both abolitionist and feminist movements. The arguments made in support of abolitionism reflect many of the points that Weld made in the Lane Seminary debates. Openly critical of the American Colonization Society, Grimké states her personal appreciation for people of color and writes, &quot;[I]t is because I love the colored Americans that I want them to stay in this country; and in order to make it a happy home to them, I am trying to talk down, and write down, and live down this horrible prejudice.&quot;

Angelina&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; are recognized widely as an early feminist argument, although only two of the letters address feminism and woman&#x27;s suffrage. &quot;Letter XII&quot; reflects some of the rhetorical style of the Declaration of Independence and is indicative of Grimké&#x27;s religious values. She argues that all humans are moral beings and should be judged as such, regardless of their sex: &quot;Measure her rights and duties by the unerring standard of moral being ... and then the truth will be self-evident, that whatever it is morally right for a man to do, it is morally right for a woman to do. I recognize no rights but human rights—I know nothing of men&#x27;s rights and women&#x27;s rights; for in Christ Jesus, there is neither male nor female. It is my solemn conviction, that, until this principle of equality is recognized and embodied in practice, the Church can do nothing effectual for the permanent reformation of the world.&quot;

Grimké directly responds to Beecher&#x27;s traditionalist argument on the place of women in all spheres of human activity: &quot;I believe it is the woman&#x27;s right to have a voice in all the laws and regulations by which she is to be governed, whether in Church or State: and that the present arrangements of society, on these points, are a violation of human rights, a rank usurpation of power, a violent seizure and confiscation of what is sacredly and inalienably hers.&quot;

===&quot;American Slavery as It Is&quot;===
In 1839 she, her husband Theodore Dwight Weld and her sister Sarah published &quot;American Slavery as It Is&quot;, an encyclopedia of slave mistreatment, which became the second most important work of abolitionist literature after &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who recorded her indebtedness to &quot;American Slavery as It Is&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1831, Grimké was courted by Edward Bettle, the son of Samuel Bettle and Jane Temple Bettle, a family of prominent Orthodox Friends. Diaries show that Bettle intended to marry Grimké, though he never actually proposed. Sarah supported the match. However, in the summer of 1832, a large cholera epidemic broke out in Philadelphia. Grimké agreed to take in Bettle&#x27;s cousin Elizabeth Walton, who, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, was dying of the disease. Bettle, who regularly visited his cousin, contracted the disease and died from it shortly thereafter. Grimké was heartbroken and directed all of her energy into her activism.

Grimké first met Theodore Weld in October 1836, at an abolitionist training meeting in Ohio that Weld was leading, She was greatly impressed with Weld&#x27;s speeches and wrote in a letter to a friend that he was &quot;a man raised up by God and wonderfully qualified to plead the cause of the oppressed.&quot; In the two years before they married, Weld encouraged Grimké&#x27;s activism, arranging for many of her lectures and the publication of her writings. They confessed their love for each other in letters in February 1838. Grimké wrote to Weld stating she didn&#x27;t know why he did not like her. He replied &quot;you are full of pride and anger&quot; and then in letters twice the size of the rest he wrote: &quot;And I have loved you since the first time I met you.&quot; On May 14, 1838, two days before her speech at Pennsylvania Hall, they were married in Philadelphia, writing—actually improvising—their vows, with a black minister and a white minister leading the guests in prayer.

Although Weld was said to have been supportive of Angelina&#x27;s desire to remain politically active after their marriage, she eventually retreated to a life of domesticity due to failing health. Sarah lived with the couple in New Jersey, and the sisters continued to correspond and visit with their friends in the abolitionist and emerging women&#x27;s rights movements. They operated a school in their home, and later a boarding school at Raritan Bay Union, a utopian community. At the school, they taught the children of other noted abolitionists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton. In the years after the Civil War, they raised funds to pay for the graduate education of their two mixed-race nephews, the sons of their brother Henry W. Grimké (1801–1852) and an enslaved woman he owned. The sisters paid for Archibald Henry Grimké and Rev. Francis James Grimké to attend Harvard Law School and Princeton Theological Seminary, respectively. Archibald became a lawyer and later an ambassador to Haiti and Francis became a Presbyterian minister. Both became leading civil rights activists. Archibald&#x27;s daughter, Angelina Weld Grimké, became a poet and author.

Sarah Grimké died in 1873. The following year, Angelina suffered a paralyzing stroke, which afflicted her until her death. Her grave is unmarked, apparently at her own request. In 1880, Weld published an &quot;In memory&quot; volume, containing the remarks from her funeral and Sarah&#x27;s, and others that had been contributed.

==Archival material==
The papers of the Grimké family are in the South Carolina Historical Society, Charleston, South Carolina. The Weld–Grimké papers are at the William L. Clements Library, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.

==Legacy==

In 1880, Theodore Weld published a volume titled &quot;In Memory: Angelina Grimké Weld&quot;.

The first volume of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, published in 1881, is inscribed to the memory of the Grimké sisters, among others.

The Grimké sisters and Theodore Dwight Weld are featured prominently in the juvenile fiction book &quot;The Forge and the Forest&quot; (1975) by Betty Underwood.

Angelina Grimké is memorialized in Judy Chicago&#x27;s 1979 artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;.

In 1998, the Grimké sisters were inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

The Grimké sisters appear as main characters in Ain Gordon&#x27;s 2013 play &quot;If She Stood&quot;, commissioned by the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia.

In 2016 Angelina Grimké was inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame.

&quot;The Grimké Sisters at Work on Theodore Dwight Weld’s &quot;American Slavery As It Is&quot; (1838)&quot; is a poem by Melissa Range, published in the September 30, 2019, issue of &quot;The Nation&quot;.

In November 2019, a newly reconstructed bridge over the Neponset River in Hyde Park was renamed for the Grimké sisters. It is now known as the Grimké Sisters Bridge.

The Grimké sisters are remembered on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

In 2024, a play recounting her speech was performed in the space where Angelina spoke to the Massachusetts Senate chamber; &quot;A Light Under the Dome&quot; was written by Patrick Gabridge and directed by Courtney O&#x27;Connor, and starring Amanda Collins as Angelina.

<text>Rollen Fredrick Stewart (born February 23, 1944), also known as Rock&#x27;n Rollen and Rainbow Man, is a man who was a fixture in American sports culture best known for wearing a rainbow-colored afro-style wig and, later, holding up signs reading &quot;John 3:16&quot; at stadium sporting events around the United States and overseas in the 1970s and 1980s. He was convicted of multiple kidnapping charges following an incident in 1992 and is now serving three life sentences in Mule Creek State Prison.

==Early life==
Stewart grew up in Spokane, Washington. Both his parents were alcoholics. His father died when Stewart was 7 and his mother died in a house fire when he was 15, the same year his sister was strangled by a boyfriend. He operated an auto parts store until his wife left him and he closed the shop and moved to the mountains. From 1972 until at least 1977, he operated a ranch with a new wife in Cle Elum, Washington.

==Publicity==
Stewart and his wife, Linda, were dyeing their hair rainbow colors by 1977 at the latest. A 1977 article in &quot;The Everett Herald&quot; described the duo as &quot;amateur disco dancers&quot; who traveled to clubs and festivals throughout the Pacific Northwest, including the Portland Rose Festival. Stewart said the couple called themselves &quot;the People Pleasers&quot; and their goal was to make it onto &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. His first major television appearance was at the 1977 NBA Finals; by the time of the 1979 MLB All-Star Game, broadcasters actively tried to avoid showing him.

After the 1980 Super Bowl, he discovered televangelist Charles R. Taylor and was inspired to become a born again Christian. Shortly thereafter, he began carrying a &quot;John 3:16&quot; sign during his appearances. He &quot;appeared behind NFL goal posts, near Olympic medal stands, and even at the Augusta National Golf Club.&quot; At the 1982 Indianapolis 500, he was behind the pits of race winner Gordon Johncock. Stewart would strategically position himself for key shots of plays or athletes. He made no money from this and was homeless for a period. He is believed to have acquired tickets as donations from supportive Christians. Stewart&#x27;s fame led to a Budweiser beer commercial and a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody sketch, in which he was portrayed by Christopher Walken.

Stewart was briefly jailed by Moscow police at the 1980 Summer Olympics. In the late 1980s, he began a string of stink bomb attacks. Targets included Robert Schuller&#x27;s Crystal Cathedral, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and a Christian bookstore. The stated intent of an attempted attack at the American Music Awards was to show the public that &quot;God thinks this stinks.&quot;

==Arrest==
Stewart was arrested in 1992 after a standoff in a Los Angeles hotel. He had entered a vacant room with two men whom he tried to recruit for a job. The men later fled the scene after he attempted to kidnap a surprised maid who then locked herself in the bathroom. Reportedly, Stewart believed that the Rapture was due to arrive in six days. During the standoff, he threatened to shoot at airplanes taking off from nearby Los Angeles International Airport, and covered the hotel room windows with &quot;John 3:16&quot; placards. 

Stewart was charged with eight felonies, including three counts of kidnapping and hostage taking. He rejected a plea deal of 12 years in order to spread his message in open court. He was convicted on all charges and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. After being sentenced, he began a religious tirade and had to be restrained by bailiffs. Stewart is currently serving three consecutive life sentences in prison on kidnapping charges, He became eligible for parole in 2002, but it was denied. He was also denied parole in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2019 and 2020. After this conviction, he was found guilty of four stink bomb attacks.

Stewart ran a blog until the time of his parole denial. He is the subject of the 1997 documentary &quot;Rainbow Man&quot;, directed by Sam Green. In a 2004 interview with ESPN, he admitted that if he had had a chance to do it all over again, he would have taken the plea deal. However, he said that the standoff happened &quot;at the wrong time.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stewart was married four times. In November 1964, he married Suzanne Hoffarth in a Catholic ceremony in a chapel of St. Paul Cathedral in Yakima, Washington. He was next married to Janet Longneeker in Skagit County, Washington in April 1968. Janet was granted a divorce in Pierce County, Washington in October 1971 on the grounds of &quot;burdensome home life.&quot; He was married again in a Lutheran ceremony in King County to Linda J. Orff in July 1976 but was divorced by January 1979.

He was most notably married to Margaret Hockridge. The two met at a church in Virginia in 1984. They began traveling across the country together in 1985. While on the road, they married in St. Louis in 1986. During the 1986 World Series, Hockridge said that Stewart tried to choke her for standing in the wrong spot with a &quot;John 3:16&quot; sign. They divorced in 1990, but kept in touch for many years.

<doc id="365012" wikidata="Q1369020" url="?curid=365012" title="Encephalitis lethargica">
<text>Encephalitis lethargica is an atypical form of encephalitis. Also known as &quot;sleeping sickness&quot; or &quot;sleepy sickness&quot; (distinct from tsetse fly–transmitted sleeping sickness), it was first described in 1917 by neurologist Constantin von Economo and pathologist Jean-René Cruchet. The disease attacks the brain, leaving some victims in a statue-like condition, speechless and motionless. Between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world. The exact number of people infected is unknown, but it is estimated that more than one million people contracted the disease during the epidemic, which directly caused more than 500,000 deaths. Most of those who survived never recovered their pre-morbid vigour.

==Signs and symptoms==
Encephalitis lethargica is characterized by high fever, sore throat, headache, lethargy, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, sleep inversion and catatonia. In severe cases, patients may enter a coma-like state (akinetic mutism). Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements (&quot;oculogyric crises&quot;), Parkinsonism, upper body weakness, muscular pains, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. Klazomania, a vocal tic involving compulsive screaming, is sometimes present.

==Cause==

The causes of encephalitis lethargica are uncertain. Though it used to be believed that it was connected to the Spanish flu epidemic, modern research provides arguments against this claim. Some studies have explored its origins in an autoimmune response, and, separately or in relation to an immune response, links to pathologies of infectious disease – viral and bacterial, such as in the case of influenza, where a link with encephalitis is clear.
Postencephalitic Parkinsonism was clearly documented to have followed an outbreak of encephalitis lethargica following the 1918 influenza pandemic; evidence for viral causation of the Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms is circumstantial (epidemiologic, and finding influenza antigens in &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot; patients), while evidence arguing against this cause is of the negative sort (for example, lack of viral RNA in postencephalitic Parkinsonian brain material).

In reviewing the relationship between influenza and &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot; (EL), McCall and coauthors conclude, as of 2008, that &quot;the case against influenza [is] less decisive than currently perceived ... [yet] there is little direct evidence supporting influenza in the etiology of EL,&quot; and that &quot;[a]lmost 100 years after the EL epidemic, its etiology remains enigmatic.&quot;
Hence, while opinions on the relationship of &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot; to influenza remain divided, the preponderance of literature appears skeptical.

The German neurologist , who examined hundreds of encephalitis lethargica patients during the 1920s, noted that their encephalitis lethargica typically evolved over time:
* The early symptoms would be dominated by sleepiness or wakefulness.
* A second symptom would lead to an oculogyric crisis.
* The third symptom would be recovery, followed by a Parkinson-like syndrome.
If patients of Stern followed this course of disease, he diagnosed them with &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot;. Stern suspected encephalitis lethargica to be close to poliomyelitis, but had no evidence. Nevertheless, he experimented with the convalescent serum of survivors of the first acute syndrome. He vaccinated patients with early-stage symptoms, telling them that it might be successful. Stern is author of the definitive book, &quot;&quot;.

In 2010, in a substantial compendium reviewing the historic and contemporary views on EL, it quotes a researcher, writing in 1930, who stated, &quot;we must confess that etiology is still obscure, the causative agent still unknown, the pathological riddle still unsolved&quot;, and went on to offer the following conclusion, as of that publication date:
Subsequent to publication of this compendium, an enterovirus was discovered in encephalitis lethargica cases from the epidemic.
In 2012, Oliver Sacks, the author of the book &quot;Awakenings&quot;, about institutionalized survivors, acknowledged this virus as the probable cause of the disease. Other sources have suggested &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; as a cause.

== Diagnosis ==
There have been several proposed diagnostic criteria for encephalitis lethargica. One, which has been widely accepted, includes an acute or subacute encephalitic illness where all other known causes of encephalitis have been excluded. Another diagnostic criterion, suggested more recently, says that the diagnosis of encephalitis lethargica &quot;may be considered if the patient&#x27;s condition cannot be attributed to any other known neurological condition and that they show the following signs: influenza-like signs; hypersomnolence (hypersomnia), wakeability, ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles that control the movement of the eye), and psychiatric changes&quot;.
Others describe lethargy, &quot;mask-like faces&quot;, excess blood in the meninges, and other general neurological symptoms.

== Treatment ==

Modern treatment approaches to encephalitis lethargica include immunomodulating therapies, and treatments to remediate specific symptoms.

There is little evidence so far of a consistent effective treatment for the initial stages, though some patients given steroids have seen improvement. The disease becomes progressive, with evidence of brain damage similar to that of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Treatment is then symptomatic. L-DOPA (Levodopa) and other anti-Parkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses; however, most people given -DOPA experience improvements that are short-lived.

== History ==
=== Occurrences ===
Retrospective diagnosis tentatively suggests various historical outbreaks of encephalitis lethargica:
* In 1580, Europe was swept by a serious febrile and lethargic illness that led to Parkinsonism and other neurological sequelae.
* From 1673 to 1675, a similar serious epidemic occurred in London, which Thomas Sydenham described as .
* In 1695, a 20 year-old woman in Germany experienced oculogyric crises, Parkinsonism, diplopia, strabismus, and other symptoms following an attack of somnolent brain fever, as described by Albrecht of Hildesheim.
* In 1712–1713, a severe epidemic of (&#x27;sleep sickness&#x27;) occurred in Tübingen, Germany, followed in many cases by persistent slowness of movement and lack of initiative (aboulia).
* Between 1750 and 1800, France and Germany experienced minor epidemics of with features of Parkinsonism, including hyperkinetic hiccup, myoclonus, chorea, and tics.
* Between 1848 and 1882, Paris-based neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot documented many isolated cases of juvenile Parkinsonism, associated with diplopia, oculogyria, tachypnoea, retropulsion, and obsessional disorders, which were almost certainly post-encephalitic in origin.
* In 1890 in Italy, following the influenza epidemic of 1889–1890, a severe epidemic of somnolent illnesses (nicknamed the &quot;Nona&quot;) appeared. For the few survivors of the &quot;Nona&quot;, Parkinsonism and other sequelae developed in almost all cases.
* Between 1915 and 1927, a world-wide encephalitis lethargica pandemic occurred, impacting nearly 5 million people and killing an estimated 1.6 million people.

=== Pandemic of 1915–1927 ===

In the winter of 1916–1917, a &quot;new&quot; illness suddenly appeared in Vienna and other cities, and rapidly spread world-wide over the next three years. Earlier reports appeared throughout Europe as early as the winter of 1915–1916, but communication about the disease was slow and chaotic, given the varied manifestation of symptoms and difficulties disseminating information in wartime; it was officially recognized as a distinct disease in 1917. Some authors define the span of the outbreak as being from 1918 to 1930.

Neurologist Constantin von Economo published a paper in April 1917 describing some of the cases he encountered in the winter months of 1916–1917. These patients, despite varying diagnoses, had a similar pattern of symptoms which led von Economo to suggest a novel disease, which he called Encephalitis Lethargica. In France, physician Jean-René Cruchet was experiencing something similar, and he published his findings within a few days of von Economo.After these two, many more reports began being released about the disease, starting in Europe before moving around the globe.

Until Constantin von Economo identified a unique pattern of damage among the brains of deceased patients and introduced the unifying name &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot;, reports of the protean disease came in under a range of names: botulism, toxic ophthalmoplegia, epidemic stupor, epidemic lethargic encephalitis, acute polioencephalitis, Heine-Medin disease, bulbar paralysis, hystero-epilepsy, acute dementia, and sometimes just &quot;an obscure disease with cerebral symptoms&quot;. Just 10 days before von Economo&#x27;s breakthrough in Vienna, Jean-René Cruchet described 40 cases of &quot;subacute encephalomyelitis&quot; in France.

The number of people infected during the ten years of the pandemic is unknown, but it is estimated that more than 1 million people contracted the disease, which directly caused more than Encephalitis lethargica assumed its most virulent form between October 1918 and January 1919.

In the United States the epidemic peaked from 1920 to 1924. It is estimated that as many as one million people were diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica during the epidemic period.

The pandemic disappeared in 1927, as abruptly and mysteriously as it first appeared. The great encephalitis pandemic coincided with the 1918 influenza pandemic, and it is likely that the influenza virus potentiated the effects of the causative agent of the encephalitis or lowered resistance to it in a catastrophic way.

====Aftermath====
Many surviving patients of the 1915–1927 pandemic seemed to make a complete recovery and return to their normal lives. However, the majority of survivors subsequently developed neurological or psychiatric disorders, often after years or decades of seemingly perfect health.

Post-encephalitic syndromes varied widely: Sometimes they proceeded rapidly, leading to profound disability or death; sometimes very slowly; sometimes they progressed to a certain point and then stayed at this point for years or decades; and sometimes, following their initial onslaught, they remitted and disappeared. It is also known to cause postencephalitic parkinsonism (PEP). Though often thought of as a disease of the past, it is still seen in occasional cases today.

==Notable cases==
Notable cases include:
* Muriel &quot;Kit&quot; Richardson (née Hewitt), first wife of actor Sir Ralph Richardson, died of the condition in October 1942, having first shown symptoms in 1927–1928.
* There is speculation that Adolf Hitler may have had encephalitis lethargica when he was a young adult (in addition to the more substantial case for Parkinsonism in his later years).
* Mervyn Peake (1911–1968), author of the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; books, began his decline towards death which was initially attributed to encephalitis lethargica with Parkinson&#x27;s disease–like symptoms, although others have later suggested his decline in health and eventual death may have been due to Lewy body dementia.
* Those described in the book &quot;Awakenings&quot; by the British neurologist Oliver Sacks.
* Jane Norton Grew Morgan, wife of J. P. Morgan Jr., died of &quot;encephalitis lethargica&quot; in 1925. At the time, doctors attributed her encephalitis to having contracted influenza during the 1918 pandemic.

<text>Lasers is the third studio album by American rapper Lupe Fiasco, released on March 7, 2011, by Atlantic Records. Production for the album took place between 2008 and 2010. &quot;Lasers&quot; features production by The Audibles, The Neptunes, Needlz, Alex da Kid, Syience, and long-time collaborator Soundtrakk, among others. Trey Songz, John Legend, Skylar Grey, Sway, Matt Mahaffey, MDMA, Eric Turner and Sarah Green contribute vocals to the album.

&quot;Lasers&quot; was preceded by the lead single &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Words I Never Said&quot; featuring Skylar Grey. The former became Fiasco&#x27;s highest charting song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and has been certified double Platinum in the US. The latter, however, only achieved moderate success on the Hot 100.

The album has received mixed reviews from most major music critics, having a score of 57 out of 100 at the review aggregator Metacritic. It fared well commercially however, debuting at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of over 200,000 copies sold, making the album Fiasco&#x27;s second top ten album as well as his highest entry on the chart.

== Background ==
Lupe Fiasco was supposedly going to release a triple album, titled &quot;LupE.N.D.&quot; as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed &quot;LupE.N.D.&quot; indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled &quot;The Great American Rap Album&quot; in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled &quot;We Are Lasers&quot; and then changed to &quot;Lasers&quot;. &quot;Lasers&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile&quot;. Referring to the title of the album, Fiasco has stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve always had that word in my head, I&#x27;m a word guy. And I thought &#x27;lasers&#x27; would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just put it in my &#x27;think-tank&#x27; and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That&#x27;s why I made it an acronym [sic] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it&#x27;s bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do – bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and &#x27;L.A.S.E.R.S&#x27; is no different.
In 2010, to promote the message of the album, Fiasco released a viral video onto the internet titled &quot;The L.A.S.E.R.S. Manifesto&quot;, which can be found on both YouTube and the official website. The manifesto reads: 

On January 4, 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; revealed two guest appearances on Fiasco&#x27;s album &quot;Lasers&quot;. The guests confirmed were Trey Songz and British rapper Sway. In the interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Fiasco expressed his thoughts on music piracy and fighting track leaks on various blogs. Speaking about the problems with his record label, Fiasco has stated: &quot;I think I set the precedent for record labels — showed everyone that you can have rappers that don&#x27;t fit the format and still have a presence [...] You look at a person like me, or Kanye [West], and it was sort of a shock to the system. I definitely think I was part of changing that, and an influence to a lot dudes that are coming out today.&quot;

In a 2011 interview with MTV UK, Fiasco said that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a storyline, whereas &quot;The Cool&quot; was a concept album and this is more just a collection of songs that share some of the same tones, which is basically just positivity and consciousness. Some of the records are controversial, but it&#x27;s less cohesive than &quot;The Cool&quot;.&quot; Talking about the album with &quot;Details&quot;, Fiasco has stated that he wanted to make &quot;a popular record [...] but by my definition of popular [...] an uprising of the people&quot;. He has also stated that the creation of the album was &quot;a very painful, dark, fucked-up process.&quot;

In a February 2011 interview with &quot;Complex&quot;, Fiasco has stated: 

Speaking about the album with the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Fiasco has stated: &quot;&quot;Lasers&quot; is a great album. I&#x27;m actually happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with – It doesn&#x27;t make up for what it took to get through it. It&#x27;s still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: &quot;It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I&#x27;m past it [...]. I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely.&quot; A remix of the song &quot;All Black Everything&quot; featuring Chamillionaire was released in April 2011 for free download.

== Release conflict and petition ==
Lupe Fiasco had announced on Twitter that the album was complete and was waiting for Atlantic Records to release it. A fan awaiting the release of the album, put together an online petition with the help of Rhymestyle from the &quot;LupEND Blog&quot; fan site, demanding that Atlantic Records release &quot;Lasers&quot;, due to the fact that the album was announced for a 2010 release and at the time still did not have a release date. The petition garnered considerable attention on hip hop blog sites and attained over 5,000 signatures on its first day. In response to the petition, Lupe Fiasco released a song titled &quot;B.M.F. (Building Minds Faster)&quot; (a remix of &quot;B.M.F. (Blowin&#x27; Money Fast)&quot; by Rick Ross) as a gift for his fans. The story was featured on many websites, including CNN
and MTV. On October 7, 2010, Lupe Fiasco posted a picture of himself with Atlantic president, Julie Greenwald. On October 8, Atlantic Records revealed that the release date for &quot;Lasers&quot; would be March 8, 2011. Even though the release date of the album had been confirmed prior, a number of fans protested outside Atlantic Records&#x27; offices in New York City on October 15, 2010. Protest co-organizer Matthew La Corte has told &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that it should be considered as a &quot;celebration of the release and everyone&#x27;s hard work&quot;. Lupe Fiasco also attended, and gave a speech.

Speaking in a March 2011 interview with &quot;New York&quot; about the support that his fans have given him to release the album, Fiasco has said: &quot;It was amazing, humbling, and inspiring, to the point where I went back in the studio and did more records … it made everything real, that your music is actually something that people want. And it&#x27;s something that is successful, not in selling records, but the way it moves people and inspires them to do better for themselves.&quot;

== Singles and leaked material ==
During a concert at Boston College, Fiasco played the chorus of a song called &quot;Shining Down&quot;, which eventually led to a snippet being leaked onto the internet. On May 17, 2009, a low quality version of the single leaked onto the internet, possibly stemming from a rip from the &quot;FNF TV Stream&quot;. &quot;Shining Down&quot; was intended to be the first single from &quot;Everywhere&quot;, the first of the three CDs that &quot;LupE.N.D.&quot; would have been composed of. But because its release was withheld, there was speculation circulating that it may be the first single from &quot;Lasers&quot;. Fiasco later confirmed that it is in fact the first single from the album. The song was produced by Soundtrakk and featured Matthew Santos, in the same collaborative manner that Fiasco featured Santos on his hit lead single, &quot;Superstar&quot; from his second album, &quot;Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s The Cool&quot;. It was released on July 7, 2009. The song had received mixed reviews, with Pitchfork Media giving it a 5/10 rating, calling it a &quot;bland refix of &quot;The Cool&quot; first single&quot;. &quot;Shining Down&quot; did not do as well as Fiasco had hoped for, charting only at number 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during its initial run.

In a February 2010 interview with Australian radio station Triple J, Fiasco revealed that although the album had been submitted to his label, they still had no solid release date for it. He stated: &quot;It&#x27;s one of the sadder parts of being on a major record label. At a certain point it&#x27;s out of your hands. About a date for &quot;Lasers&quot;, it&#x27;s truly on them. I have no idea what they&#x27;re going to do.&quot; It has also been reported that Fiasco had initially recorded B.o.B&#x27;s &quot;Nothin&#x27; on You&quot; as well as &quot;Airplanes&quot; featuring Hayley Williams, but both songs had been rejected by Fiasco&#x27;s label. Another unreleased song from &quot;Lasers&quot; was &quot;Who Are You Now&quot; featuring B.o.B, which has leaked onto the internet in March 2011.

=== Singles ===
On October 26, 2010, the official lead single from &quot;Lasers&quot;, &quot;The Show Goes On&quot;, premiered on Fiasco&#x27;s official website after the initial debut single &quot;I&#x27;m Beaming&quot; was removed from the iTunes store and demoted to a deluxe edition bonus track. It was produced by Kane Beatz and interpolates Modest Mouse&#x27;s &quot;Float On&quot; as part of the chorus. The music video for the single was directed by Hiro Murai and premiered on Fiasco&#x27;s official website on Christmas day, December 25, 2010. As of June 2011, the song has been certified double Platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling over two million copies, thus making it his second single to go Platinum and first to go double Platinum. &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; has peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming his highest-charting song on the Hot 100. On other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; has peaked at number 45 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 14 on the Pop Songs chart and five on the Hot Rap Songs chart. In Australia, it peaked at number five on the Australian Singles Chart and has since been certified Gold for selling over 35,000 units. In Europe, the single has charted on the Irish Singles Chart where it peaked at number 19, as well as on the UK Singles Chart peaking at number 49.

On January 11, 2011, Fiasco revealed during an interview with Providence&#x27;s Hot 106 that the follow-up single to &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; is titled &quot;Words I Never Said&quot;, he said about the song that &quot;It&#x27;s gonna be really big. It&#x27;s a big, controversial record&quot;. The song was produced by Alex da Kid and features American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey. &quot;Words I Never Said&quot; was released as a digital download on February 8, 2011. It has since peaked at number 89 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A teaser trailer for the Sanaa Hamri-directed music video was released in January 2011, while the full clip premiered on April 28, 2011.

&quot;Out of My Head&quot; featuring American R&amp;B singer Trey Songz was confirmed as the album&#x27;s third single. The song was released on May 10, 2011 and has since peaked at number 40 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, 11 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and four on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The official single cover was revealed on May 23, 2011. Fiasco and Songz performed &quot;Out of My Head&quot; live for the first time at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards on June 5, 2011. The music video for the single, directed by Gil Green, was released on June 29, 2011.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Care Right Now&quot;, featuring MDMA, was confirmed to be the album&#x27;s fourth single. The single&#x27;s official music video was released on December 2, 2011 on YouTube. The video was filmed during a concert at Iowa State University.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Lasers&quot; received mixed reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 57, based on 27 reviews, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman gave it three out of five stars and criticized its &quot;lumbering, overwrought choruses&quot;, writing that &quot;If there is one MC whose rhymes should not be dulled for the sake of chasing pop trends, it&#x27;s Lupe Fiasco&quot;. Jeff Leven of &quot;Paste&quot; gave &quot;Lasers&quot; a six out of 10 rating and found its musical arrangements polished and &quot;radio-friendly&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alex Macpherson viewed its content as a concession to pop music trends, panning its &quot;synthy choruses&quot; and &quot;trite empowerment anthems&quot;. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; gave the album two out of five stars and criticized Fiasco&#x27;s lyrics, stating &quot;while his flow has a nice bounce and monotonal glide, too many tracks end with one wondering what exactly he&#x27;s said, if anything at all&quot;. David Amidon of &quot;PopMatters&quot; panned the album as &quot;a disgustingly awkward effort from everyone involved [...] Listenability? Credibility? These, &quot;Lasers&quot; is lacking in seismic qualities&quot;. Brandon Soderberg of &quot;Spin&quot; found it to be affected by crossover tendencies and wrote that &quot;&quot;Lasers&quot; works best, however, when the grabby hooks, electro beats, and conscious rap rants are all turned down a notch&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Todd Martens shared a similar sentiment and commented that the album &quot;feels more like a compromise than a cohesive album&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ian Cohen criticized the album for &quot;surveying the current pop-rap landscape and retaining nothing worthwhile&quot;, commenting that &quot;&quot;Lasers&quot; simply &quot;sounds&quot; bad, playing against every single one of Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s strengths and creating new weaknesses&quot;.

However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Brad Wete complimented its themes and stated &quot;Simply put, &quot;Lasers&quot; beams&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jon Dolan noted Fiasco&#x27;s &quot;athletic, whiplash flow and rich imagination&quot; and found the album &quot;shorter, brighter and – most admirably – more optimistic&quot; than his previous album &quot;The Cool&quot;. Despite writing that &quot;RnB syrup starts to swamp the lyrical invention&quot;, BBC Music&#x27;s Johnny Sharp noted &quot;several inspired moments&quot; and commented that &quot;Lupe remains a singular hip hop voice, and &quot;Lasers&quot; is still worth a listen&quot;. Carrie Battan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; viewed that &quot;the album&#x27;s real sweet spots lie somewhere in the brief, breezy middle ground&quot; between &quot;angsty rap-metal crossover tracks&quot; and &quot;clubby, bass-thumping radio-rap jams&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Kyle Ryan gave the album a B− and commented that its synthesizers &quot;[give] it an au courant hip-hop sound&quot;, but criticized its lyrics and called it &quot;schizophrenic&quot;. Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the album three out of four stars and wrote that it &quot;has several shining moments but falls short of the overall excellence&quot; of his previous albums. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Greg Kot gave the album two-and-half out of four stars and stated &quot;Its best music shows what it might have been. The rest feels more like an obligation reluctantly met, a difficult bridge to the next phase of Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s career&quot;. Jon Caramanica of &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressed a mixed response towards its music and called &quot;Lasers&quot; &quot;a chaotic album full of gummy rhymes that look better on the page than they sound to the ear, delivered with a tone of tragic bombast&quot;. Slant Magazine&#x27;s Matthew Cole perceived &quot;no bridging the gap between &quot;Lasers&quot;″s radical message and its utterly conventional sound&quot;, commenting that &quot;In moments of dazzling clarity, Lupe spits hip-hop prophecy, but too much of &quot;Lasers&quot; is given over to self-serious jeremiads on race, rap, and politics, or pop-rap pandering&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 204,000 copies. &quot;Lasers&quot; marks Fiasco&#x27;s first number one album on the chart as well as his best selling first-week sales. The album is Fiasco&#x27;s second top ten album on the chart with his first album, &quot;Food &amp; Liquor&quot;, debuting at number eight in 2006, and &quot;The Cool&quot; debuting at number 15 in 2007. In its second week on the chart, it fell to number three selling 47,000 units, while in its third week, it fell to number ten selling an additional 29,000 copies. As of August 10, 2011, &quot;Lasers&quot; has sold approximately 452,000 copies in the United States. Internationally, &quot;Lasers&quot; has debuted within the top ten on the Australian and Canadian album charts, while also peaking at number 11 in New Zealand and number 25 in the United Kingdom. On March 23, 2014, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 500,000 copies. On February 27, 2025, it became certified Platinum.

<doc id="365019" wikidata="Q494930" url="?curid=365019" title="Matthew Ridgway">
<text>General Matthew Bunker Ridgway (3 March 1895 – 26 July 1993) was a senior officer in the United States Army, who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (1952–1953) and the 19th Chief of Staff of the United States Army (1953–1955). Although he saw no combat service in World War I, he was intensively involved in World War II, where he was the first Commanding General (CG) of the 82nd Airborne Division, leading it in action in Sicily, Italy and Normandy, before taking command of the newly formed XVIII Airborne Corps in August 1944. He held the latter post until the end of the war in mid-1945, commanding the corps in the Battle of the Bulge, Operation Varsity and the Western Allied invasion of Germany.

Ridgway held several major commands after World War II and is most well-known for resurrecting the United Nations (UN) war effort during the Korean War. Several historians have credited Ridgway for turning the war around in favor of the UN side. He also persuaded President Dwight D. Eisenhower to refrain from direct military intervention in the First Indochina War to support French colonial forces, thereby essentially delaying the United States&#x27; Vietnam War by over a decade. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 12 May 1986. Ridgway died in 1993 at the age of 98.

==Early life and education==
Ridgway was born 3 March 1895, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, to Colonel Thomas Ridgway, an artillery officer, and Ruth Starbuck (Bunker) Ridgway. He lived in various military bases all throughout his childhood. He later remarked that his &quot;earliest memories are of guns and marching men, of rising to the sound of the reveille gun and lying down to sleep at night while the sweet, sad notes of &#x27;Taps&#x27; brought the day officially to an end&quot;. He graduated in 1912 from English High School in Boston and applied to United States Military Academy at West Point because he thought that would please his father (who was a West Point graduate).

Ridgway failed the entrance exam the first time due to his inexperience with mathematics, but after intensive self-study he succeeded the second time. At West Point he served as a manager of the football team. He graduated from there on 20 April 1917, two weeks after the
American entry into World War I, and received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch of the United States Army. Among his fellow graduates were many other men who, like Ridgway himself, would eventually become generals, such as J. Lawton Collins, Aaron Bradshaw Jr., Daniel Noce, Charles S. Kilburn, Mark W. Clark, Ernest N. Harmon, Norman Cota, Charles H. Gerhardt, George H. Weems, William Kelly Harrison Jr., John T. Cole, William W. Eagles, Albert C. Smith, Bryant Moore, Elbert L. Ford, Robert W. Hasbrouck, John M. Devine, Raymond E. S. Williamson, Norman Schwarzkopf Sr., Theodore Leslie Futch and Laurence B. Keiser.

==Early military career==
Beginning his career during World War I, Ridgway was assigned to duty on the border with Mexico as a member of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and then to the West Point faculty as an instructor in Spanish. He was disappointed that he was not assigned to combat duty during the war, feeling that &quot;the soldier who had had no share in this last great victory of good over evil would be ruined&quot;.

During 1924 and 1925 Ridgway attended the company officers&#x27; course at the United States Army Infantry School in Fort Benning, Georgia, after which he was a company commander in the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tianjin, China. This was followed by a posting to Nicaragua, where he helped supervise free elections in 1927.

In 1930, Ridgway became an advisor to the Governor-General of the Philippines. He graduated from the Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and from the Army War College at Washington Barracks, District of Columbia, in 1937. During the 1930s he served as Assistant Chief of Staff of VI Corps, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Army, and Assistant Chief of Staff of the Fourth Army. General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, assigned Ridgway to the War Plans Division shortly after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939.

== World War II ==
After being promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1940, he served in the War Plans Division until January 1942, and was promoted to the one-star general officer rank of brigadier general that month, after being promoted to temporary colonel on 11 December the month before. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the American entry into World War II, Ridgway was promoted rapidly from lieutenant colonel to major general in the space of only four months. In February 1942 he was assigned as Assistant Division Commander of the 82nd Infantry Division, which was then in the process of formation. The division was under the command of Major General Omar Bradley, a fellow infantryman whom Ridgway highly respected. The two men trained the thousands of men joining the division over the next few months. In August, two months after Bradley&#x27;s reassignment to command of the 28th Infantry Division, Ridgway was promoted to the two-star rank of major general and was given command of the 82nd Division. The 82nd, having finished all of its basic training and already established an excellent combat record in World War I, had earlier been chosen to become one of the army&#x27;s five new airborne divisions. The conversion of an entire infantry division to airborne status was an unprecedented step for the United States Army, and required much training, testing, and experimentation. Thus the division was, on 15 August 1942, redesignated as the 82nd Airborne Division.

Initially composed of the 325th, 326th and 327th Infantry Regiments, all of which were due to be converted into glider infantry, the 327th was soon transferred out of the 82nd to help form the 101st Airborne Division, commanded by Major General William C. Lee. Unlike his men, Ridgway did not first go through airborne jump school before joining the division. He successfully converted the 82nd into a combat-ready airborne division and remained in command and eventually earned his paratrooper wings. To replace the 327th, Ridgway received the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Theodore Dunn, later replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Reuben Tucker. In February 1943 the 326th was also transferred out and replaced by the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under Colonel James M. Gavin. In April the 82nd, which in Ridgway&#x27;s mind had received only a third the training time given to most divisions, was sent to North Africa to prepare for the invasion of Sicily.

=== Italian campaign ===
Ridgway helped plan the airborne element of the invasion of Sicily. The invasion, which took place in July 1943, was spearheaded by Colonel Gavin&#x27;s 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (reinforced into the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team by the 3rd Battalion of Tucker&#x27;s 504th). Despite some successes, Sicily nearly saw an end to the airborne division. Due mainly to circumstances beyond Ridgway&#x27;s control the 82nd suffered heavy casualties in Sicily, including the division&#x27;s Assistant Division Commander, Brigadier General Charles L. Keerans. During the 504th&#x27;s drop on the morning of 9 July, which was widely scattered due to friendly fire, Ridgway had to report to Lieutenant General George S. Patton, commander of the Seventh United States Army (under whose command the 82nd fell), that, out of the more than 5,300 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division who had jumped into Sicily, he had fewer than 400 under his control.

During the planning for the invasion of the Italian mainland, the 82nd was tasked with taking Rome by coup de main in Operation Giant II. Ridgway strongly objected to this unrealistic plan, which would have dropped the 82nd on the outskirts of the Italian capital of Rome in the midst of two German heavy divisions. The operation was canceled only hours before launch. The 82nd did, however, play a significant role in the Allied invasion of Italy at Salerno in September which, but for a drop by Ridgway&#x27;s two parachute regiments, may well have seen the Allies pushed back into the sea. The 82nd Airborne Division subsequently saw brief service in the early stages of the Italian Campaign, helping the Allies to break through the Volturno Line in October. The division then returned to occupation duties in the recently liberated Italian city of Naples and saw little further action thereafter and in November departed Italy for Northern Ireland. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the Fifth United States Army, a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917, referring to Ridgway as an &quot;outstanding battle soldier, brilliant, fearless and loyal&quot;, who had &quot;trained and produced one of the finest Fifth Army outfits&quot;, was unwilling to give up either Ridgway or the 82nd. As a compromise, Colonel Tucker&#x27;s 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, along with supporting units, was retained in Italy, to be sent to rejoin the rest of the 82nd Airborne Division as soon as possible.

=== France and Germany ===
In late 1943, after the 82nd Airborne Division was sent to Northern Ireland, and in the early months of 1944, Ridgway helped plan the airborne operations of Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied invasion of Normandy, where he argued, successfully, for the two American airborne divisions taking part in the invasion, the 82nd and the inexperienced 101st, still commanded by Major General Lee (later replaced by Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor, formerly commander of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery), to be increased in strength from two parachute regiments and a single glider regiment (although with only two battalions) to three parachute regiments, and for the glider regiment to have a strength of three battalions. In the Battle of Normandy, he jumped with his troops, who fought for 33 days in advancing to Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte near Cherbourg (St Sauveur was liberated on 14 June 1944). Relieved from front-line duty in early July, the 82nd Airborne Division had, during the severe fighting in the Normandy bocage, suffered 46 percent casualties.

In August 1944, Ridgway was given the command of XVIII Airborne Corps. Command of the 82nd Airborne Division passed to Brigadier General James M. Gavin, who had served as Ridgway&#x27;s Assistant Division Commander. The first operation involving Ridgway was Operation Market Garden where his 101st Airborne Division dropped near Eindhoven to secure the Bridges between Eindhoven and Veghel on the road to Arnhem. Ridgway dropped with his troops and was in the forefront of the Divisions part of the fighting. The XVIII Airborne Corps helped stop and push back German troops during the Battle of the Bulge in December. In March 1945, with the British 6th Airborne Division and United States 17th Airborne Division under command, he led the corps into Germany during Operation Varsity, the airborne component of Operation Plunder, and was wounded in the shoulder by German grenade fragments on 24 March 1945. He led the corps in the Western Allied invasion of Germany. On 4 June 1945, he was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general.

At war&#x27;s end, Ridgway was on a plane headed for a new assignment in the Pacific theater of war, under General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, with whom he had served while a captain at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Ridgway spoke highly of British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, stating that his time serving under Montgomery was &quot;most satisfying&quot; and that &quot;He gave me the general outline of what he wanted and let me completely free&quot;. Ridgway noted that while Montgomery was a &quot;free spirit who was sometimes a bit hard to restrain&quot;, he also referred to Montgomery as &quot;a first-class professional officer of great ability ... and Monty could produce ... I don&#x27;t know anybody who could give me more complete support than Monty did when I was under British command twice ... I had no trouble with Monty at all&quot;.

===Interbellum===
Ridgway was a commander at Luzon until October 1945 when the XVIII Airborne Corps was disbanded. He was then given command of the United States forces in the Mediterranean Theater, with the title Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean. From 1946 to 1948, he served as the United States Army representative on the military staff committee of the United Nations. He was placed in charge of the Caribbean Command in 1948, controlling United States forces in the Caribbean, and in 1949 was assigned to the position of Deputy Chief of Staff for Administration under then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General J. Lawton Collins.

In December 1947, Ridgway married Mary Princess &quot;Penny&quot; Anthony Long, his third wife. They remained married until his death 46 years later. In April 1949, their only child, Matthew Bunker Ridgway, Jr., was born. Ridgway&#x27;s son was killed in an accident in 1971. His wife died in 1997.

== Korean War ==
=== Eighth Army Command ===
Ridgway&#x27;s most important command assignment occurred in 1950 after the death of Lieutenant General Walton Walker on 23 December. Ridgway was assigned as Walker&#x27;s replacement in command of the Eighth United States Army, which had been deployed in South Korea in response to the invasion by North Korea in June of that year.

When Ridgway took command of Eighth Army, the Army was still in a tactical retreat, after its strong foray into North Korea had been met with an unexpected and overwhelming Communist Chinese advance in the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River. Ridgway was successful in turning around the morale of Eighth Army.

Ridgway was unfazed by the Olympian demeanor of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, then overall commander of UN forces in Korea. MacArthur gave Ridgway a latitude in operations he had not given his predecessor. After Ridgway landed in Tokyo on Christmas Day 1950 to discuss the operational situation with MacArthur, the latter assured his new commander that the actions of Eighth Army were his to conduct as he saw fit. Ridgway was encouraged to retire to successive defensive positions, as was currently under way, and hold Seoul as long as he could, but not if doing so meant that Eighth Army would be isolated in an enclave around the capital city. Ridgway asked specifically that if he found the combat situation &quot;to my liking&quot; whether MacArthur would have any objection to &quot;my attacking&quot;. MacArthur answered, &quot;Eighth Army is yours, Matt. Do what you think best&quot;.

Upon taking control of the battered Eighth Army, one of Ridgway&#x27;s first acts was to restore soldiers&#x27; confidence in themselves. To accomplish this, he reorganized the command structure. During one of his first briefings in Korea at I Corps, Ridgway sat through an extensive discussion of various defensive plans and contingencies. At the end, he asked the staff about the status of their attack plans; the corps G-3 (operations officer) responded that he had no such plans. Within days, I Corps had a new G-3. He also replaced officers who did not send out patrols to fix enemy locations, and removed &quot;enemy positions&quot; from commanders&#x27; planning maps if local units had not been in recent contact to verify that the enemy was still there. Ridgway established a plan to rotate out those division commanders who had been in action for six months and replace them with fresh leaders. He sent out guidance to commanders at all levels that they were to spend more time at the front lines and less in their command posts in the rear. These steps had an immediate effect on morale.

With the entry of China, the complexion of the Korean War had changed. Political leaders, in an attempt to prevent expansion of the war, did not allow UN forces to bomb the supply bases in China, nor the bridges across the Yalu River on the border between China and North Korea. The American army moved from an aggressive stance to fighting protective, delaying actions. Ridgway&#x27;s second big tactical change was to make copious use of artillery.

China&#x27;s casualties began to rise, and became very high as they pressed waves of attacks into the coordinated artillery fire. Under Ridgway&#x27;s leadership, the Chinese offensive was slowed and finally brought to a halt at the battles of Chipyong-ni and Wonju. He then led his troops in Operation Thunderbolt, a counter-offensive in early 1951.

=== Supreme UN Commander ===
When General MacArthur was relieved of command by President Harry S. Truman in April, Ridgway was promoted to full general, assuming command of all United Nations forces in Korea. As commanding general in Korea, Ridgway gained the nickname &quot;Tin Tits&quot; for his habit of wearing hand grenades attached to his load-bearing equipment at chest level. He oversaw the desegregation and integration of United States Army units in the Far East Command, which significantly influenced the wider army&#x27;s subsequent desegregation. He also continued the bombing of North Korea, which destroyed much of the country&#x27;s infrastructure and killed many civilians.

In 1951 Ridgway was elected an honorary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.

Ridgway also assumed from MacArthur the role of military governor of Japan, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. During his tenure, Ridgway oversaw the restoration of Japan&#x27;s independence and sovereignty on April 28, 1952.

== Cold War ==

===Supreme Allied Commander, Europe===

In May 1952, Ridgway succeeded General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for the fledgling North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). While in that position Ridgway made progress in developing a coordinated command structure, oversaw an expansion of forces and facilities, and improved training and standardization. He upset other European military leaders by surrounding himself with American staff. His tendency to tell the truth was not always politically wise. In a 1952 review, General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported to President Harry S. Truman that &quot;Ridgway had brought NATO to &#x27;its realistic phase&#x27; and a &#x27;generally encouraging picture of how the heterogeneous defense force is being gradually shaped.&#x27;&quot;

Ridgway urged the Anglo-French-American high commissioners for Germany to pardon all German officers convicted of war crimes on the Eastern Front of World War II. He himself, he noted, had recently given orders in Korea &quot;of the kind for which the German generals are sitting in prison&quot;. His &quot;honor as a soldier&quot; forced him to insist upon the release of these officers before he could &quot;issue a single command to a German soldier of the European army&quot;.

===Chief of Staff of the United States Army===
On 17 August 1953, Ridgway succeeded General J. Lawton Collins as the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. After Eisenhower was elected president, he asked Ridgway for his assessment of United States military involvement in Vietnam in conjunction with the French. Ridgway prepared a comprehensive outline of the massive commitment that would be necessary for success, which dissuaded the President from intervening. A source of tension was Ridgway&#x27;s belief that air power and nuclear bombs did not reduce the need for powerful, mobile ground forces to seize land and control populations. Ridgway was concerned that Eisenhower&#x27;s proposal to significantly reduce the size of the army would leave it unable to counter the growing Soviet military threat, as noted by the 1954 Alfhem affair in Guatemala. These concerns would lead to recurring disagreements during his term as chief of staff. Ridgway was the leader of the &quot;Never Again Club&quot; within the U.S. Army that regarded the Korean War which ended in a draw as something of a debacle and were strongly opposed to fighting another land war in Asia, especially against China.

In the spring of 1954, Ridgway was very much opposed to Operation Vulture, the proposed American intervention in Vietnam with tactical nuclear weapons to rescue the French from certain defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, supported Operation Vulture and recommended it to Eisenhower, arguing that the United States could not permit the victory of the Communist Viet Minh over the French. Making matters more complicated on 20 March 1954, the chief of the French general staff, General Paul Ély, visited Washington and Radford had shown him the plans for Vulture and gave him the impression that the United States was committed to carrying it out. In a dissenting opinion, Ridgway argued that the plan would not work as he maintained that airpower alone, even with the use of tactical nuclear weapons, would not be enough to save the French. Ridgway argued that only the commitment of seven American infantry divisions could save the French at Dien Bien Phu, and predicted that if the United States intervened in Vietnam, then so too would China. Ridgway wrote that if China entered the Indochina War, then the United States would have to commit 12 divisions to Vietnam. Against Radford, Ridgway argued having the United States bogged down in a land war in Asia once again fighting the Chinese would be a costly distraction from Europe, a place that he maintained was far more important than Vietnam. In a dissenting report to Eisenhower against Radford&#x27;s recommendations, Ridgway stated &quot;Indochina is devoid of decisive military objectives&quot; and to fight a war there &quot;would be a serious diversion of limited U.S. capabilities&quot;. Ridgway felt that Radford as an admiral who had never fought against the Chinese was too dismissive of Chinese power, and he did not see the dangers of the United States fighting yet another trying struggle against the Chinese, in less than a year after the end of the Korean war.

Ridgway&#x27;s objections to Vulture gave Eisenhower pause, but Radford&#x27;s vehement insistence on nuclear weapon deployment – that three tactical atomic bombs dropped on the Viet Minh forces besieging the French at Dien Bien Phu would be enough to save Indochina for France – made the president indecisive. Both the Vice President, Richard Nixon, and the Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, were all for Vulture and lobbied Eisenhower hard to accept it. Eisenhower himself felt guilty over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and during one meeting told Admiral Radford and Air Force General Nathan F. Twining: &quot;You boys must be crazy. We can&#x27;t use those awful things against Asians for a second time in less than ten years. My God!&quot; Eisenhower finally agreed to carry out Vulture, but only if Congress gave its approval first and if Great Britain agreed to join in. The leaders of Congress gave an equivocal answer, rejecting the idea of Vulture as an American operation, but willing to support it if it was an Anglo-American operation. Finally, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill rejected the idea of British intervention in Vietnam, which killed Vulture. On 7 May 1954, what was left of the French forces at Dien Bien Phu surrendered, which brought down the government of Premier Joseph Laniel in Paris, and led to a new government being formed by Pierre Mendès France whose sole mandate was to pull all French forces out of Indochina.

President Eisenhower approved a waiver to the military&#x27;s policy of mandatory retirement at age 60 so Ridgway could complete his two-year term as Chief of Staff. Disagreements with the administration over its downgrading of the army in favor of the United States Navy and the United States Air Force, prevented Ridgway from being appointed to a second term. Ridgway retired from the army on 30 June 1955, and was succeeded by his one-time 82nd Airborne Division chief of staff, General Maxwell D. Taylor. Even after he retired, Ridgway was a constant critic of President Eisenhower. During the secon debate of 1960 presidential debate on 7 October, John F. Kennedy mentioned General Ridgway as among supporters of the position that the United States should not attempt to defend Quemoy (Kinmen) and Matsu from an attack by China (PRC).

===The &quot;Wise Men&quot;===
In November 1967, Ridgway was recruited to join the &quot;Wise Men&quot;, a group of retired diplomats, politicians and generals who assembled from time to time to give their advice on the Vietnam War to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Though the &quot;Wise Men&quot; group whose informal leader was the former Secretary of State Dean Acheson were widely dismissed as a gimmick to allow Johnson photo-opps, the president did have much respect for the &quot;Wise Men&quot; and took their counsel seriously. In early 1968, Ridgway together with General James M. Gavin and General David M. Shoup expressed their opposition to the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam and declared that South Vietnam was not worth the trouble it was taking to defend it. The criticism sufficiently rattled Johnson&#x27;s powerful National Security Adviser W.W. Rostow that he wrote a 5-page memorandum for the president arguing that Ridgway, Gavin and Shoup did not know what they were talking about and expressed supreme confidence that the bombing offensive would soon force North Vietnam to its knees.

In the aftermath of the Tet Offensive together with Johnson&#x27;s near-defeat in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, where Johnson defeated the anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy by only 300 votes, the White House was gripped by crisis with Johnson torn between continuing to seek a military solution to the Vietnam war or turning towards a diplomatic solution. Adding to the sense of crisis was a maneuver by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle Wheeler, to force Johnson to rule out the diplomatic solution and to continue with the military solution. On 23 February 1968 Wheeler told General William Westmoreland to advise Johnson to send another 206,000 troops to Vietnam, even through Westmoreland insisted that he did not need the extra troops. Under Wheeler&#x27;s prodding, Westmoreland did make the request for another 206,000 soldiers, insisting in his report to Johnson that he could not win the war without them. Wheeler&#x27;s real purpose in having Westmoreland make the troop request was to force Johnson to call out the reserves and the state National Guard. By 1968, there was no way to send another 206,000 men to join the half-million G.I.s already in Vietnam without abandoning the American commitments in Europe, South Korea and elsewhere except by mobilizing the reserves and the National Guard. Calling out the reserves and National Guard would disrupt the economy, which in turn would force Johnson to end the peacetime economy, and taking such a step would make it politically impossible to turn towards a diplomatic solution. The economic sacrifices that a wartime economy would entail could only be justified to the American people by saying the goal was to fight on until victory.

At the same time as the debate swirled over Westmoreland&#x27;s troop request, Clark Clifford, a longstanding friend of Johnson&#x27;s and a known hawk arrived at the Pentagon on 1 March as the newly appointed Defense Secretary. Clifford&#x27;s friend, Senator J. William Fulbright arranged for him to meet privately with Ridgway together with General Gavin. Both Ridgway and Gavin advised Clifford that victory in Vietnam was unobtainable and he should use his influence with Johnson to persuade him to seek a diplomatic solution. The advice from Ridgway and Gavin helped to convert Clifford from being a hawk to a dove.

The Defense Secretary Clifford realized the political implications of the request for 206,000 more troops and lobbied Johnson hard to reject it, urging him to seek a diplomatic solution instead while Rostow advised him to accept it. Since Westmoreland had maintained in his report that victory in Vietnam was impossible without the additional 206,000 troops, to reject the troop request would mean abandoning seeking a military solution. To resolve the debate, Johnson called a meeting of the &quot;Wise Men on 25 March 1968 to advise him what to do. The next day, the majority of the &quot;Wise Men&quot; advised Johnson that victory in Vietnam was impossible and that he should seek a diplomatic solution, counsel that was decisive in persuading him to open peace talks. Of the 14 &quot;Wise Men&quot;, only General Maxwell Taylor, Robert Murphy, Abe Fortas and General Omar Bradley advised Johnson to continue seeking a military solution with the rest all speaking for a diplomatic solution. Ridgway&#x27;s status as a war hero whom no-one could accuse of being &quot;soft on Communism&quot; added to the prestige of the &quot;Wise Men&quot; and made Johnson more likely to accept their advice. On 31 March 1968, Johnson went on national television to announce his willingness to open peace talks with North Vietnam, that he was unconditionally stopping bombing most of North Vietnam and finally declaring that he was withdrawing from the 1968 election.

==Personal life==
In 1917 he married Julia Caroline Blount (1895–1986). They had two daughters, Constance and Shirley, before divorcing in 1930.
Shortly after his divorce, Ridgway married Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;) Wilson Dabney (1891–1968), the widow of a West Point graduate (Henry Harold Dabney, class of 1915), and in 1936 he adopted Peggy&#x27;s daughter Virginia Ann Dabney (1919–2004). Ridgway and Peggy divorced in June 1947. Later that year he married Mary Princess Anthony Long (1918–1997), who was nicknamed &quot;Penny&quot;. They remained married until his death. They were the parents of a son, Matthew, Jr., who died in a 1971 accident shortly after graduating from Bucknell University and receiving his commission as a second lieutenant through the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps.

Ridgway remained active in retirement, both in leadership capacities and as a speaker and author. He relocated to the Pittsburgh suburb of Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania, in 1955 after accepting the chairmanship of the board of trustees of the Mellon Institute as well as a position on the board of directors of Gulf Oil Corporation, among others. The year after his retirement, he published his autobiography, &quot;Soldier: The Memoirs of Matthew B. Ridgway&quot;. In 1967, he wrote &quot;The Korean War&quot;.

In 1960, Ridgway retired from his position at the Mellon Institute but continued to serve on multiple corporate boards of directors, Pittsburgh civic groups and Pentagon strategic study committees.

Ridgway continued to advocate for a strong military to be used judiciously. He gave many speeches, wrote, and participated in various panels, discussions, and groups. In early 1968, he was invited to a White House luncheon to discuss Indochina. After the luncheon, Ridgway met privately for two hours with President Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey. When asked his opinion, Ridgway advised against deeper involvement in Vietnam and against using force to resolve the Pueblo Incident. In an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Ridgway stated that political goals should be based on vital national interests and that military goals should be consistent with and support the political goals, but that neither situation was true in the Vietnam War.

Ridgway advocated maintaining a chemical, biological, and radiological weapons capability, arguing that they could accomplish national goals better than the weapons currently in use. In 1976, Ridgway was a founding board member of the Committee on the Present Danger, which urged greater military preparedness to counter a perceived increasing Soviet threat.

On 5 May 1985, Ridgway was a participant in US President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s visit to Kolmeshöhe Cemetery near Bitburg, when former Luftwaffe ace fighter pilot Johannes Steinhoff (1913–1994) in an unscheduled act firmly shook his hand in an act of reconciliation between the former foes.

== Death ==
Ridgway died at his suburban Pittsburgh home on 26 July 1993, of cardiac arrest, at the age of 98. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. In a graveside eulogy, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, said: &quot;No soldier ever performed his duty better than this man. No soldier ever upheld his honor better than this man. No soldier ever loved his country more than this man did. Every American soldier owes a debt to this great man&quot;.

==Legacy==

During his career, Ridgway was recognized as an outstanding leader, earning the respect of subordinates, peers, and superiors. General Omar Bradley described Ridgway&#x27;s work turning the tide of the Korean War as &quot;the greatest feat of personal leadership in the history of the Army&quot;. A soldier in Normandy remarked about an intense battle while trying to cross a key bridge, &quot;The most memorable sight that day was Ridgway, Gavin, and Maloney standing right there where it was the hottest [heaviest incoming fire]. The point is that every soldier who hit that causeway saw every general officer and the regimental and battalion commanders right there. It was a truly inspirational effort&quot;.

On the day of the Germans&#x27; furthest advance in the Battle of the Bulge, Ridgway commented to his subordinate officers in the XVIII Airborne Corps: &quot;The situation is normal and completely satisfactory. The enemy has thrown in all his mobile reserves, and this is his last major offensive effort in this war. This Corps will halt that effort; then attack and smash him&quot;.

Ridgway considered leadership to have three primary ingredients: character, courage, and competence. He described character—including self-discipline, loyalty, selflessness, modesty, and willingness to accept responsibility and admit mistakes—as the &quot;bedrock on which the whole edifice of leadership rests&quot;. His concept of courage included both physical and moral courage. Competence included physical fitness, anticipating when crises will occur and being present to resolve them, and being close to subordinates—communicating clearly and ensuring that they are treated and led well and fairly.

<doc id="365025" wikidata="Q834385" url="?curid=365025" title="Silent Movie">
<text>Silent Movie is a 1976 American satirical silent comedy film co-written, directed by and starring Mel Brooks, released by 20th Century Fox in summer 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with cameos by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau, and Paul Newman as themselves, and character cameos by Harry Ritz of the Ritz Brothers, Charlie Callas, and Henny Youngman. The film was produced in the manner of an early-20th-century silent film, with intertitles instead of spoken dialogue; the soundtrack consists almost entirely of orchestral accompaniment and sound effects. It is an affectionate parody of slapstick comedies, including those of Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. The film satirizes the film industry, presenting the story of a film producer trying to obtain studio support to make a silent film in the 1970s.

==Plot==
Mel Funn, a once-great Hollywood film director, is now recovering from a drinking problem and down on his luck. He and his sidekicks, Marty Eggs and Dom Bell, want to make the first silent movie in 40 years, and Funn pitches the idea to the chief of Big Picture Studios. The chief rejects the idea at first, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood&#x27;s biggest stars to be in the film, it could save the studio from a takeover by New York conglomerate Engulf &amp; Devour.

Funn, Eggs and Bell proceed to recruit various stars for the film. They surprise Burt Reynolds in his shower, and revisit his mansion in disguise. They recruit James Caan filming on location, following slapstick fumbling in an unstable dressing room trailer. They find Liza Minnelli at the studio commissary, where she eagerly agrees to be in the film. They recruit Anne Bancroft by disguising themselves as nightclub Flamenco dancers. While visiting the ailing studio chief in the hospital, Funn phones mime artist Marcel Marceau, who responds in French with the only spoken word in the film: a resounding &quot;Non!&quot; Dom Bell asks, &quot;What did he say?&quot; Funn responds, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t speak French!&quot;

They see Paul Newman on the hospital grounds, and sign him to the film after a wild electric-wheelchair chase.

In the course of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief misadventures, including a mix-up between a seeing-eye dog and an untrained look-alike, several (mostly unsuccessful) efforts by Eggs to approach various women, and a Coca-Cola vending machine that launches cans like grenades.

Engulf &amp; Devour learn of the project, and try to sabotage it by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan to seduce Funn. He falls for her, but returns to drinking when he learns that she was part of a scheme. He buys a huge bottle of liquor and drinks himself into a stupor, surrounded by fellow &quot;winos&quot;. But Kaplan has genuinely fallen for Funn, and refused Engulf &amp; Devour&#x27;s money; she helps Eggs and Bell find him and restore him to sobriety.

The film is completed, but the only copy is stolen by Engulf &amp; Devour just before its theatrical premiere. Kaplan stalls the audience with her nightclub act, while Funn, Eggs and Bell successfully steal the film back. They are cornered by Engulf &amp; Devour&#x27;s thuggish executives, but use the Coke machine they encountered earlier to attack and subdue them with exploding cans. Lacking a separate spool to rewind the film, Eggs winds the film around his own body and upon returning to the theater he has to be rushed to the projection booth to show it.

The film is a huge success with the audience, which erupts with over-the-top applause. The studio is saved, and Funn, Eggs, Bell, Kaplan and Chief celebrate, as an onscreen caption identifies the film as a &quot;true story&quot;.

==Cast==
==Analysis==
Mel Brooks enjoyed success with the release of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in 1974, both being parodies of entire genres. He followed this success with &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, an affectionate parody of the slapstick films of the silent film era. Prior to the release of &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot;, a documentary about the golden age of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals, had been the most successful film for MGM in 1974. The success of the documentary on the topic of the golden era of cinema may have been an inspiration for a parody.

Mel Brooks was planning the movie eight months before it began filming in January 1976. &quot;It will be the noisiest silent movie ever made,&quot; said Brooks. &quot;I&#x27;m going to have a lot of superstars. They don&#x27;t leave me alone. Jimmy Caan called and said he&#x27;d be very mad if he&#x27;s not in it. Why a silent movie in 1975, you are about to ask me? Because we can take advantage of all the technology and inventions, and the ways of life since 1925. A lot has happened. We have Coke machines now!&quot; True to his word, he worked a Coke machine into the script. The working titles were &quot;Silent Movies Madness&quot;, &quot;Mel Brooks&#x27;s Silent Movies&quot;, and &quot;The Silent Movies of Mel Brooks&quot;.

&quot;Silent Movie&quot; feels like a throwback to this earlier era, despite using color and other up-to-date techniques. As a film about filmmaking, &quot;Silent Movie&quot; also parodies &quot;Hollywood deal-making&quot;. Cowriter Ron Clark was previously the producer of &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy Hour&quot;, while Rudy De Luca and Barry Levinson were writers for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. Unsurprisingly, the humor of &quot;Silent Movie&quot; would not be out of place in a sketch comedy. Henry Jenkins points out that for Brooks, the decision to make a silent comedy represents an allusion to an earlier era of his career. He used to be a writer for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, a show that included pantomime segments and parodies of silent films. Television audiences of the 1950s were familiar with the silents through their broadcast on late night television.

The film features an unflattering portrayal of the film industry. Big Picture Studios&#x27; front gate sign boasts of the multimillion-dollar scope of their films, never mentioning their quality. The film project is greenlit not on the merits of its script, but solely on the drawing power of the movie stars attached. Executives cannot tell good film footage apart from bad, while the &quot;Current Studio Chief&quot; is one box-office bomb away from losing his position. The studio is under threat of a takeover by a &quot;soulless&quot; conglomerate. The movie stars are portrayed as vain figures who flaunt their wealth. The moviegoing audience is portrayed as fickle and unpredictable. Villainous &quot;Engulf &amp; Devour&quot; is a parody of real-life conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries, which had acquired Paramount Pictures. The film also parodies corporate executives as essentially interchangeable yes-men, following the whims of their boss.

The logo of Big Picture Studios is a parody of the MGM logo. Instead of the majestic, roaring lion, it shows the studio chief (Sid Caesar) as a braying donkey, and MGM&#x27;s &quot;Ars Gratia Artis&quot; slogan (&quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;) is parodied with &quot;Ars Est Pecunia&quot; (&quot;art is money&quot;).

The film is literally silent for the first couple of minutes, as the shots establishing the main characters have no sound at all. Fortunately for the audience, the entire movie is not an exercise in silence, as the orchestra strikes up when the 20th Century-Fox logo appears on a billboard, just before the main title. Some of the gags do rely on the music and sound effects. For instance, a scene showing the New York City skyline begins with the song, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, only to have it come to a sudden stop, as the musicians realize they&#x27;re playing the wrong music. They then go into &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; instead. One joke makes use of the difference between the expressive gestures of silent cinema and those used in guessing games, such as charades. A secretary attempts to explain to the studio chief that Funn has a drinking problem, by pantomiming an uplifted bottle. Her boss misunderstands, figuring that Funn sucks his thumb. Another scene with the studio chief pays homage to slapstick; the chief proclaims slapstick to be dead, then his chair flips backwards, and sends him sliding across the room in it. He slams his head, with the sound of a bell ringing. The humor of the scene derives from the combination of the image and the unlikely sound. Many of the gags of the film actually depend on careful synchronizations of sound and image. For example, one sequence has Feldman tossed about between elevator doors. It is set to the sounds of a pinball machine.

Other gags are delivered through intertitles. For example, in a meeting of Engulf &amp; Devour, an underling whispers something in the ears of his boss. The intertitles report: &quot;whisper...whisper...whisper&quot;. The boss fails to understand, forcing the man to shout. In response the intertitle is written in capital letters: &quot;YOUR FLY IS OPEN!&quot;

Marcel Marceau reprises his &quot;walking into the wind&quot; routine. Part of the mime satire is that the mime&#x27;s props are actual instead of imaginary: a door that he strains to open; a strong wind he is struggling against, and a telephone that he picks up.

Liza Minnelli appears in a scene that makes no use of her dancing talents. Writer Robert Alan Crick, author of &quot;The Big Screen Comedies of Mel Brooks&quot; (2002), points out that the part could have easily been played by any well-known actress of the 1970s, with no apparent difference. The film was the first notable acting role for Brooks, who was previously limited to offscreen voiceovers and short cameos.

==Reception==
Reviews were largely very good, with the more critical ones commenting on the hit-and-miss assortment of jokes, but all of them agreed that the film offered some good gags and an evening&#x27;s entertainment. Ron Pennington of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; raved, &quot;Mel Brooks has reached a new peak in his career with &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, which must be ranked as one of the funniest film comedies since the advent of sound [and] easily Brooks&#x27;s best effort to date (no mean achievement). Brooks, Feldman, and DeLuise are simply brilliant together, performing in the best slapstick tradition of classic comedy teams.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;An almost nonstop parade of sight gags... the brisk 86-minute pic works surprisingly well. Several chase scenes are sure laugh-getters, and Harry Ritz, Charlie Callas, Henry Youngman, and the late Liam Dunn are standouts in a long array of amusing bit players.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, and called it &quot;not only funny, but fun&quot;. He cited as positive elements the ability of Brooks to do anything for a laugh, and the world of his films, in which everything is possible. He stated that Brooks took &quot;a considerable stylistic risk&quot; that he managed to pull off &quot;triumphantly&quot;. He considered the film equal in comedic ability to &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, superior to &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; but inferior to &quot;The Producers&quot;. He also praised the film for offering an encyclopedia worth of visual gags, both old and new.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and wrote that it offered &quot;a number of laughs&quot;, and felt that the unbilled cameos were as &quot;refreshing as they are brief&quot;.

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Some of the bits and pieces work better than others, but so many work so clownishly, zanily, idiotically well that &#x27;Silent Movie&#x27; is certain to have the year&#x27;s noisiest audiences.&quot;

A few reviews were milder. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film can be enjoyed as &quot;a virtually uninterrupted series of smiles&quot;, but &quot;doesn&#x27;t contain a single moment that ever seriously threatens to split the sides&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a misbegotten but tolerably amusing novelty item&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79%, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Stylistically audacious and infectiously nostalgic for the dawn of cinema, &quot;Silent Movie&quot; is another comedic triumph for Mel Brooks... now shush.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics.

It earned North American rentals of $21,240,000.

<text>In general topology, a branch of mathematics, a non-empty family &quot;A&quot; of subsets of a set formula_1 is said to have the finite intersection property (FIP) if the intersection over any finite subcollection of formula_2 is non-empty. It has the strong finite intersection property (SFIP) if the intersection over any finite subcollection of formula_2 is infinite. Sets with the finite intersection property are also called centered systems and filter subbases. 

The finite intersection property can be used to reformulate topological compactness in terms of closed sets; this is its most prominent application. Other applications include proving that certain perfect sets are uncountable, and the construction of ultrafilters. 

==Definition==

Let formula_4 be a set and formula_5 a nonempty family of subsets of that is, formula_5 is a nonempty subset of the power set of Then formula_5 is said to have the finite intersection property if every nonempty finite subfamily has nonempty intersection; it is said to have the strong finite intersection property if that intersection is always infinite. 

In symbols, formula_5 has the FIP if, for any choice of a finite nonempty subset formula_9 of there must exist a point formula_10 Likewise, formula_5 has the SFIP if, for every choice of such there are infinitely many such 

In the study of filters, the common intersection of a family of sets is called a kernel, from much the same etymology as the sunflower. Families with empty kernel are called free; those with nonempty kernel, fixed.

==Families of examples and non-examples==
The empty set cannot belong to any collection with the finite intersection property. 

A sufficient condition for the FIP intersection property is a nonempty kernel. The converse is generally false, but holds for finite families; that is, if formula_12 is finite, then formula_12 has the finite intersection property if and only if it is fixed. 

=== Pairwise intersection ===
The finite intersection property is &quot;strictly stronger&quot; than pairwise intersection; the family formula_14 has pairwise intersections, but not the FIP. 

More generally, let formula_15 be a positive integer greater than unity, and Then any subset of formula_12 with fewer than formula_17 elements has nonempty intersection, but formula_5 lacks the FIP.

=== End-type constructions ===
If formula_19 is a decreasing sequence of non-empty sets, then the family formula_20 has the finite intersection property (and is even a –system). If the inclusions formula_19 are strict, then formula_5 admits the strong finite intersection property as well. 

More generally, any formula_5 that is totally ordered by inclusion has the FIP. 

At the same time, the kernel of formula_5 may be empty: if then the kernel of formula_12 is the empty set. Similarly, the family of intervals formula_26 also has the (S)FIP, but empty kernel. 

=== &quot;Generic&quot; sets and properties ===
The family of all Borel subsets of formula_27 with Lebesgue measure formula_28 has the FIP, as does the family of comeagre sets. If formula_4 is an infinite set, then the Fréchet filter (the family has the FIP. All of these are free filters; they are upwards-closed and have empty infinitary intersection. 

If formula_30 and, for each positive integer formula_31 the subset formula_32 is precisely all elements of formula_1 having digit formula_34 in the formula_35th decimal place, then any finite intersection of formula_32 is non-empty — just take formula_34 in those finitely many places and formula_38 in the rest. But the intersection of formula_32 for all formula_40 is empty, since no element of formula_41 has all zero digits.

=== Extension of the ground set ===
The (strong) finite intersection property is a characteristic of the family not the ground set If a family formula_5 on the set formula_4 admits the (S)FIP and then formula_5 is also a family on the set formula_45 with the FIP (resp. SFIP). 

=== Generated filters and topologies ===

If formula_46 is a non-empty set, then the family formula_47 has the FIP; this family is called the principal filter on formula_4 generated by The subset formula_49 has the FIP for much the same reason: the kernels contain the non-empty set If formula_50 is an open interval, then the set formula_50 is in fact equal to the kernels of formula_5 or and so is an element of each filter. But in general a filter&#x27;s kernel need not be an element of the filter. 

A proper filter on a set has the finite intersection property. Every neighbourhood subbasis at a point in a topological space has the FIP, and the same is true of every neighbourhood basis and every neighbourhood filter at a point (because each is, in particular, also a neighbourhood subbasis).

== Relationship to -systems and filters ==

A –system is a non-empty family of sets that is closed under finite intersections. The set formula_53of all finite intersections of one or more sets from formula_12 is called the –system generated by because it is the smallest –system having formula_5 as a subset. 

The upward closure of formula_56 in formula_4 is the set formula_58For any family the finite intersection property is equivalent to any of the following:

* The –system generated by formula_12 does not have the empty set as an element; that is, formula_60
* The set formula_56 has the finite intersection property.
* The set formula_56 is a (proper) prefilter.
* The family formula_12 is a subset of some (proper) prefilter.
* The upward closure formula_64 is a (proper) filter on In this case, formula_64 is called the filter on formula_1 generated by because it is the minimal (with respect to formula_67) filter on formula_1 that contains formula_12 as a subset.
* formula_12 is a subset of some (proper) filter.
==Applications==

=== Compactness ===
The finite intersection property is useful in formulating an alternative definition of compactness: 

This formulation of compactness is used in some proofs of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem.

=== Uncountability of perfect spaces ===
Another common application is to prove that the real numbers are uncountable. All the conditions in the statement of the theorem are necessary:
# We cannot eliminate the Hausdorff condition; a countable set (with at least two points) with the indiscrete topology is compact, has more than one point, and satisfies the property that no one point sets are open, but is not uncountable.
# We cannot eliminate the compactness condition, as the set of rational numbers shows.
# We cannot eliminate the condition that one point sets cannot be open, as any finite space with the discrete topology shows.



=== Ultrafilters ===
Let formula_1 be non-empty, formula_72 formula_73 having the finite intersection property. Then there exists an formula_74 ultrafilter (in formula_75) such that formula_76 This result is known as the ultrafilter lemma.

<doc id="365027" wikidata="Q2609480" url="?curid=365027" title="Sketches by Boz">
<text>Sketches by &quot;Boz,&quot; Illustrative of Every-day Life and Every-day People (commonly known as Sketches by Boz) is a collection of short pieces the English author Charles Dickens originally published in various newspapers and other periodicals between 1833 and 1836. They were re-issued in book form, under their current title, in February and August 1836, with illustrations by George Cruikshank.

Sketches by &quot;Boz,&quot; was Charles Dickens first book. The 56 sketches concern London scenes and people, and the whole work is divided into four sections: &quot;Our Parish&quot;, &quot;Scenes&quot;, &quot;Characters&quot; and &quot;Tales&quot;. The material in the first three sections consists of non-narrative pen-portraits, but the last section comprises fictional stories.

==The History of &quot;Boz&quot;==

The sketch &quot;Mr Minns and his Cousin&quot; (originally titled &quot;A Dinner at Poplar Walk&quot;), was the first work of fiction Dickens ever published. It appeared in &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot; in December 1833. Although Dickens continued to place pieces in that magazine, none of them bore a signature until August 1834, when &quot;The Boarding House&quot; appeared under the strange pen-name &quot;Boz&quot;. A verse in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; for March 1837 recalled the public&#x27;s perplexity about this pseudonym:

:&quot;Who the dickens &#x27;Boz&#x27; could be
:Puzzled many a learned elf,
:Till time unveiled the mystery,
:And &#x27;Boz&#x27; appeared as Dickens&#x27;s self.&quot;

Dickens took the pseudonym from a nickname he had given his younger brother Augustus, whom he called &quot;Moses&quot; after a character in Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. This, &quot;being facetiously pronounced through the nose,&quot; became &quot;Boses&quot;, which in turn was shortened to &quot;Boz&quot;. The name remained coupled with &quot;inimitable&quot; until &quot;Boz&quot; eventually disappeared and Dickens became known as, simply, &quot;The Inimitable&quot;. The name was originally pronounced but is now usually .

==Illustrations==

The popularity of Dickens&#x27;s writings was enhanced by the regular inclusion of detailed illustrations to highlight key scenes and characters. Each sketch typically featured two black-and-white illustrations, as well as an illustration for the wrapper. The images were created with wood engravings or metal etchings. Dickens worked closely with several illustrators during his career, including George Cruikshank, Hablot Knight Browne (aka &quot;Phiz&quot;), and John Leech. The accuracy of the illustrations was of the utmost importance to Dickens, as the drawings portrayed the characters just as he envisioned them and gave readers valuable insights about the characters&#x27; personalities and motives, as well as the plot.

==Publication==
The earliest version of &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; was published by John Macrone in two series: the first as a two-volume set in February 1836, just a month before the publication of the first number of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836–37), and then a &quot;Second Series&quot; in August 1836. After Dickens&#x27;s fame skyrocketed, he purchased the rights to the material from Macrone.

==Instalment contents==
The majority of the 56 sketches that appeared together in 1839 were originally published individually in popular newspapers and periodicals, including &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Evening Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Carlton Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;, between 1833 and 1836:

<doc id="365029" wikidata="Q5372220" url="?curid=365029" title="Emily Howland">
<text>Emily Howland (November 20, 1827 – June 29, 1929) was a philanthropist, humanitarian, and educator. She supported the education of African-Americans. She was also a strong supporter of women&#x27;s rights and the temperance movement. Howland personally financed the education of many black students and contributed to institutions such as the Tuskegee Institute, Henry Damon Davidson&#x27;s Centerville Industrial Institute, and Kowaliga Institute in Kowaliga, Alabama where Howland Hall was named for her.

==Early life and education==
Emily Howland was born at Sherwood in Cayuga County, New York, on November 20, 1827. She was the daughter of Slocum and Hannah Tallcot Howland, who were prominent in the Society of Friends. Her brother, William Howland, served in the 106th New York State Legislature. She was educated in small private schools in the community, and the Margaret Robinson School, a Friends school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
An active abolitionist, Howland taught at Normal School for Colored Girls (also known as the Miner School and now University of the District of Columbia) in Washington, D.C., from 1857 to 1859. During the Civil War she worked at the contraband refugee settlement of Camp Todd in Arlington, Virginia, establishing a school where she taught freed slaves to read and write as well as administering to the sick during a smallpox outbreak, coordinating relief efforts, and ultimately serving as director of the camp during 1864-1866.

Beginning in 1867, she started a community for freed people in Heathsville, Northumberland County, Virginia, called Arcadia, on 400 acres purchased by her father, including a school for the education of children of freed slaves, the Howland Chapel School. She continued to maintain an active interest in African-American education, donating money and materials as well as visiting and corresponding with administrators at many schools. Returning to Sherwood NY after her father&#x27;s death in 1881, she inherited $50,000 ($ in dollars) and ran the Sherwood Select School until 1926 when it became a public school and was renamed the Emily Howland Elementary School by the state of New York.

Howland was also active in women&#x27;s suffrage, peace, and temperance movements and was a member of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. In 1858, she began organizing women&#x27;s rights lectures and meetings with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. In 1878, she spoke at the 30th anniversary of the Seneca Falls woman&#x27;s rights convention and in 1894 the New York State legislature. When the suffrage movement split into two groups, the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association, Howland did not take sides, but attended meetings of both groups. In 1904, she spoke in front of Congress and attended the 1912 and 1913 suffrage parades in New York. She has been credited with persuading Ezra Cornell that, as a Quaker, he should make Cornell University a coeducational institution.

In 1926 she received an honorary Litt.D. degree from the University of the State of NY, in Albany, the first woman to have this honor conferred upon her from this institution. She was also the author of an historical sketch of early Quaker history in Cayuga County, NY: &quot;Historical Sketch of Friends in Cayuga County&quot;.

Howland became one of the first female directors of a national bank in the United States, at the First National Bank of Aurora in Aurora, New York, in 1890, serving until her death, at age 101.

==Legacy==
Her papers are held by several universities, including Cornell University, Haverford College, and Swarthmore College. A photo album containing family, friends, and colleagues, as well as souvenir images of notable abolitionists and famous figures during the 1860s and 1870s is jointly owned by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress. In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="365036" wikidata="Q409100" url="?curid=365036" title="Carnotite">
<text>Carnotite is a potassium uranium vanadate radioactive mineral with chemical formula K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O. The water content can vary and small amounts of calcium, barium, magnesium, iron, and sodium are often present.

==Occurrence==

Carnotite is a bright greenish-yellow mineral that occurs typically as crusts and flakes in sandstones. Amounts as low as one percent will color the sandstone a bright yellow. The high uranium content makes carnotite an important uranium ore. It is a secondary vanadium and uranium mineral usually found in sedimentary rocks in arid climates.

In the United States it is an important ore of uranium in the Colorado Plateau region of the United States where it occurs as disseminations in sandstone and concentrations around petrified logs. It also occurs in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. It also occurs incidentally in Grants, New Mexico, and Carbon County, Pennsylvania.

Carnotite is reported in Congo (Kinshasa), Morocco, Australia (Radium Hill) and Kazakhstan. In Pakistan carnotite occurs in the Upper Miocene middle Siwaliks sandstone (Dhokpathan Formation), in the vicinity of Takhat Nasrati, Karak District.

==Name and discovery==
The mineral was first described in 1899 by French scientists M. M. C. Freidel and E. Cumenge, who identified it in specimens from Roc Creek in Montrose County, Colorado, United States. It is named for Marie Adolphe Carnot (1839–1920), French mining engineer and chemist.

== Uses ==
Carnotite is an ore of uranium. At times in the early 20th century, it was mined primarily for radium or vanadium.

The mineral was used to produce quack devices involving radioactive substances.

==Related mineral species==
Several related mineral species exist, including: margaritasite ((Cs,K,H3O)2(UO2)(VO4)2·H2O) and tyuyamunite, (Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2·5-8H2O).

<doc id="365038" wikidata="Q1290288" url="?curid=365038" title="Negative and positive atheism">
<text>Negative atheism, also called weak atheism and soft atheism, is any type of atheism where a person does not believe in the existence of any deities but does not necessarily explicitly assert that there are none. Positive atheism, also called strong atheism and hard atheism, is the form of atheism that additionally asserts that no deities exist. 

The terms &quot;negative atheism&quot; and &quot;positive atheism&quot; were used by Antony Flew in 1976 and have appeared in George H. Smith&#x27;s and Michael Martin&#x27;s writings since 1990.

==Scope of application==
Because of flexibility in the term &quot;god&quot;, it is possible that a person could be a positive/strong atheist in terms of certain conceptions of God, while remaining a negative/weak atheist in terms of others. For example, the God of classical theism is often considered to be a personal supreme being who is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent, caring about humans and human affairs. One might be a positive atheist for such a deity, while being a negative atheist with respect to a deistic conception of God by rejecting belief in such a deity but not explicitly asserting it to be false.

Positive and negative atheism are frequently used by the philosopher George H. Smith as synonyms of the less-well-known categories of implicit and explicit atheism, also relating to whether an individual holds a specific view that gods do not exist. &quot;&quot;Positive&quot; atheists explicitly assert that it is false that any deities exist. &quot;Negative&quot;&quot; atheists assert they do not believe any deities exist, but do not necessarily explicitly assert it is &quot;true&quot; that no deity exists. Those who do not believe any deities exist, but do not assert such non-belief, are included among &quot;implicit atheists&quot;. Among &quot;implicit&quot; atheists are thus included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief. All &quot;implicit&quot; atheists are included in the &quot;negative/weak&quot; categorization.

Under the negative atheism classification, agnostics are atheists. The validity of this categorization is disputed, however, and a few prominent atheists such as Richard Dawkins avoid it. In &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, Dawkins describes people for whom the probability of the existence of God is between &quot;very high&quot; and &quot;very low&quot; as &quot;agnostic&quot; and reserves the term &quot;strong atheist&quot; for those who claim to know there is no God. He categorizes himself as a &quot;de facto atheist&quot; but &quot;not&quot; a &quot;strong atheist&quot; on this scale. Within negative atheism, philosopher Anthony Kenny further distinguishes between agnostics, who find the claim &quot;God exists&quot; uncertain, and theological noncognitivists, who consider all talk of gods to be meaningless.
