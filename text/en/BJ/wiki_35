<text>Latin School of Chicago is a private elementary, middle, and high school located in the Gold Coast neighborhood on the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. The school was founded in 1888 by Mabel Slade Vickery. Latin School is a member of the Independent School League (ISL).

==Background==
===History===

Latin School was formed in 1888 by a group of parents seeking a better education for their children. Mabel Slade Vickery, a teacher from the East Coast, was invited to Chicago to open the school with a small class of ten 10-year-old boys. During the early years, classes were held in private homes on Chicago&#x27;s near North Side. The parent-owned institution flourished and in 1899, with enrollment of more than 100 boys, the school moved into its own building and officially became Chicago Latin School.

In 1913, a girls section was incorporated by Miss Vickery and became The Chicago Latin School for Girls. The schools merged in 1953 to form the co-educational Latin School of Chicago. The school was designed to provide students with a rigorous college-preparatory education in the classical tradition, with a curriculum that was heavily influenced by Classical studies and the study of the Greek and Latin languages, hence the name “Latin School.&quot; The Latin language is still taught in the middle and upper schools today. While it was started as a neighborhood school, Latin School currently is home to more than 1,100 students from approximately 70 ZIP codes throughout the Chicago area. The school awards more than $3 million in need-based financial aid each year.

In April 2020, the school received an unspecified amount in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school returned it after receiving scrutiny over this loan, which meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that the schools should return the money. The New York Times noted the school&#x27;s endowment is $58.5 million.

===Campus and Academics===
The current campus has three buildings. The lower school (junior kindergarten to grade 4) building is the oldest structure dating to 1926 and is located at 1531 N. Dearborn. The upper school (grades 9–12) building at 59 W. North was completed in 1969. The middle school (grades 5–8) building, located at 45 W. North, was completed in the fall of 2007. It includes a green roof garden and was designed with environmentally friendly materials. The building was awarded LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council in 2012.

The upper school building was designed by internationally acclaimed architect Harry Weese. The upper and middle school buildings are connected by two bridges, and both divisions use both buildings, with many middle school arts and PE classes held in the US and all HS science classes in the designated science center in the MS. The average class size is 14 students and the student-to-faculty ratio is 8:1. The school offers over 150 courses, several at honors level and about a dozen at AP level. Several electives are also offered.

=== Visual Arts ===
Latin has a visual arts department, notable for its many extracurricular/elective opportunities and its Global Studies: Visual Arts class. The school is also noted for its Mickey &amp; The Masters project where, as a culmination of their study of the History of Western Painting, ninth grade students recreate master paintings with the added challenge of substituting Mickey Mouse as the main character. The school has two galleries with 14 events hosted annually in Gallery 2.

=== Musical and Performing Arts ===
Several electives and extracurriculars focus on performing arts, music, and public presentation. The school holds around 20 yearly performing arts productions and concerts, including faculty and student directed plays, semesterly band and chorus concerts, a student-faculty chorale, and semesterly dance performances. The productions are well funded by the school.

<doc id="362141" wikidata="Q499807" url="?curid=362141" title="Pybba of Mercia">
<text>Pybba (570?–606/615) (also Pibba, Wibba, or Wybba) was an early King of Mercia. He was the son of Creoda and father of Penda and Eowa. Unusually, the names Pybba and Penda are probably of British Celtic origin rather than Germanic.

His dates are sometimes given in genealogies as birth in 570, the beginning of his reign in 593, and death in either 606 or 615, but with no apparent evidence; the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; merely mentions him as the father of Penda, with no additional detail.

Pybba is said by the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; to have had 12 sons. Cearl, a Mercian king, is mentioned by Bede, and may have been Pybba&#x27;s successor, but his relationship to Pybba, if any, is unknown. Pybba&#x27;s son Penda eventually became king; the &quot;Chronicle&quot; gives the date of this as 626, although Bede suggests it was not until after the battle of Hatfield Chase in 633.

Besides Penda and Eowa (who the author of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; said were the sons of Pybba who were the best known to him), Pybba also apparently had a son named Coenwalh. Every king from Penda until Ceolwulf, who was deposed in 823, was said to be a descendant of Pybba, either through Penda, Eowa, or Coenwalh (perhaps excluding Beornrad, who ruled briefly and whose background is unknown).

Pybba also is said to have had a daughter. Though unnamed, she was possibly the first wife of Cenwalh, King of Wessex (648–674).

<doc id="362148" wikidata="Q3453651" url="?curid=362148" title="Ruthanasia">
<text>Ruthanasia, a portmanteau of &quot;Ruth&quot; and &quot;euthanasia&quot;, is the pejorative name (typically used by opponents) given to the period of free-market policies conducted during the first term of the fourth National government in New Zealand, from 1990 to 1993. As the first period of reform from 1984 to 1990 was known as Rogernomics after the Labour Party Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, so the second period became known as &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;, after the National Party&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Ruth Richardson.

==Background==
Ruthanasia and Rogernomics can be viewed as complementary reform packages implemented by successive governments, which were both aimed at liberalising the New Zealand economy. The packages came after a period of intense protectionism and fiscal control, particularly under the administration of Robert Muldoon&#x27;s National government between 1975 and 1984. Muldoon, who simultaneously held the posts of Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, implemented a three-year wage and price freeze in a protectonist attempt to suppress rampant inflation.

==Conflict with manifesto==
Ruthanasia was controversial as the National Party had fought the 1990 election on a manifesto promising &quot;The Decent Society&quot; and implicitly repudiating the radicalism of the Fourth Labour Government.

The new Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, defended the move on the grounds that he had been badly misled in the run-up to the 1990 election as to the actual state of the New Zealand economy. He was told by officials on Sunday afternoon, the day after the election, of two unrelated financial crises: &quot;the country&#x27;s broke ... and the largest bank ... was bankrupt&quot;. Bolger said that his &quot;electoral honeymoon lasted seventeen hours&quot;. So he immediately summoned Don McKinnon, Bill Birch and Ruth Richardson to Wellington. The partly state-owned Bank of New Zealand required an immediate injection of capital to avoid insolvency as a result of the poor performance of a NZ$2.8bn loan portfolio in Australia. The bank held 40 per cent of the commercial paper (loans to businesses) in New Zealand.

Secondly; the outgoing finance minister David Caygill&#x27;s projection of a modest fiscal surplus was inaccurate, and the country instead faced a fiscal deficit of NZ$3.7bn (4.8%) for 1991–92 if current fiscal policies continued. Current net public debt was 52% of GDP (43% after Telecom sale).

==Focus==
Where Roger Douglas had deregulated the industrial, financial, fiscal and agricultural sectors of the New Zealand economy, Ruth Richardson, under the auspices of a National (predominantly conservative) administration, was able to focus on social services and labour relations. These were sensitive areas where the preceding Labour administration had rejected the need for changes due to the impact they could have on their traditional working class constituency.

Richardson and the then Minister of Social Welfare, Jenny Shipley, immediately reformed the Social Welfare programme in the &quot;Mother of all Budgets&quot; by reducing available unemployment, sickness and welfare benefits across the board. In 1991, the National government enacted the Employment Contracts Act (ECA), which effectively demolished New Zealand&#x27;s post-war industrial relations framework, replacing collective bargaining and compulsory union membership in many sectors with the concept of the individual employment contract. Whilst the ECA did not directly address unions, the practical effect of removing the requirement for employees to be members, and allowing those employees who did want union membership to choose &quot;which&quot; union they wished to join, dramatically reduced the bargaining position of the unions in the New Zealand economy. This reform of labour laws had already been outlined in the 1990 National manifesto.

Ken Douglas, then president of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, recalled in the 1996 documentary &quot;Revolution&quot;:

Roger Douglas, minister of finance in the preceding fourth Labour government, said (after his retirement from politics):

&quot;Ruthanasia&quot; came to an end after the 1993 election, when National&#x27;s majority was reduced from 18 (out of 99 seats) to 1. Jim Bolger responded by replacing Richardson with Bill Birch. Bolger then acknowledged both the benefits and unpopularity of Ruthanasia in his televised announcement of Richardson&#x27;s removal:

==Long-term consequences: 1993–2008==

Internal party ideological tensions also led to the secession of Winston Peters from the National Party caucus and the formation of New Zealand First in 1993. Peters was viewed as an acolyte of Rob Muldoon&#x27;s protectionist economic policies and had a substantial support base amongst New Zealand&#x27;s senior citizens and their related lobby organisations.

Peters&#x27; erstwhile prominence was due to the other consequence of Roger Douglas and Ruth Richardson&#x27;s New Right economic policies, which fuelled a movement for electoral reform in New Zealand after Sir Geoffrey Palmer convened a Royal Commission on the Electoral System in 1985–1986. In two electoral reform referendums, the general public endorsed the Mixed Member Proportional electoral system as a response to what they perceived as an unaccountable New Right government. Jim Bolger believes that, had his government not instituted such unpopular policy prescriptions, MMP may not have passed.

After Richardson&#x27;s resignation, National retained power for six more years against a divided Labour Party and splintered opposition, hampered by its own legacy of economic retrenchment. While several MPs seceded to form non-viable centre-right satellite parties before the 1996 general election National retained power by going into coalition with Winston Peters and New Zealand First. It eventually proved unpopular, and party rightists launched a coup against Jim Bolger in December 1997. As a consequence, Peters abandoned the National/New Zealand First coalition, splitting his party. National then governed for a further year, with the support of post-split ex-New Zealand First MPs, but the 1999 general election saw Helen Clark lead a centre-left coalition to victory. She would remain Prime Minister for most of the next decade, as National was paralysed by factional infighting over ideology and direction. When National won office again after the 2008 general election, National sought to shift towards the centre and projected an image that it had eschewed &quot;radical&quot; New Right industrial relations and welfare reform. Jettisoning Richardson&#x27;s legacy.

As for Richardson herself, she became a member of ACT New Zealand, her philosophical successors.

A 2015 Treasury report said that inequality in New Zealand increased in the 1980s and 1990s but has been stable for the last 20 years although another 2015 article said that New Zealand&#x27;s rate of rise of inequality had been the highest in the OECD, and that New Zealand&#x27;s inequality had previously been low by OECD standards. The 1991 budget had profound social effects, child poverty rose from 15% in 1990 to 29% in 1994 while violent crime peaked between 1990 and 1997. Income inequality also accelerated, New Zealand&#x27;s GINI index rose from 0.30 in 1990 to 0.33 in 1996 and thereafter 0.34 at the turn of the century. Poorer New Zealanders saw their standard of living fall from their 1984 level. Unemployment also remained high for much of the decade, from 11% in 1991 to 6% in 1996 and then up again to 8% following the Asian Financial Crisis.

<text>The OMAR Mine Museum in Kabul, Afghanistan, contains a collection of 51 types of land mines out of the 53 that have been used in that country. OMAR is an acronym for the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation. 
== Mine collection ==

The collection includes unexploded ordnance, cluster bombs and airdrop bombs used by the War in Afghanistan. The museum educates school groups to detect and avoid unexploded ordnance including landmines and cluster bomblets from historic and ongoing Afghan wars. The museum was seriously damaged in a July 1, 2019 attack.

The museum also displays a variety of other military hardware from wars fought in Afghanistan over the recent decades, including artillery, surface-to-air missiles, and a collection of Soviet military aircraft.

For security reasons, the museum is not open for casual visitors. All appointments must be made through the main OMAR office.

<text>Gemini 5 (officially Gemini V)
was a 1965 crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini. It was the third crewed Gemini flight, the eleventh crewed American spaceflight (including two X-15 flights above ), and the nineteenth human spaceflight of all time. It was also the first time an American crewed space mission held the world record for duration, set on August 26, 1965, by breaking the Soviet Union&#x27;s previous record set by Vostok 5 in 1963. This record might have been one day longer; however, Gemini V was cut short, due to the approach of Hurricane Betsy.

On August 21, 1965, at 16:07:15 UTC, the REP was released into orbit from the Gemini 5 spacecraft.

==Objectives==
Gemini 5 doubled the U.S. space-flight record of the Gemini 4 mission to eight days, the length of time it would take to fly to the Moon, land and return. This was possible due to new fuel cells that generated enough electricity to power longer missions, a pivotal innovation for future Apollo flights, instead of the chemical batteries used on previous crewed spacecraft. Cooper and Conrad were to have made a practice space rendezvous with a &quot;pod&quot; deployed from the spacecraft, but problems with the electrical supply forced a switch to a simpler &quot;phantom rendezvous,&quot; whereby the Gemini craft maneuvered to a predetermined position in space. Command Pilot and Mercury veteran Gordon Cooper was the first person to fly two Earth orbital missions. He and Conrad took high-resolution photographs for the United States Department of Defense, but problems with the fuel cells and maneuvering system forced the cancellation of several other experiments. The astronauts found themselves marking time in orbit, and Conrad later lamented that he had not brought along a book. On-board medical tests, however, continued to show the feasibility of longer flights.

Conrad, who had a reputation for frequently having a punchline on hand, called the mission &quot;Eight days in a garbage can.&quot; (the garbage can referring to the small size of the Gemini cabin, which was about the size of the front seat of a Volkswagen Beetle)
==Flight==
The launch went perfectly except for a few seconds of pogo oscillation (axial vibration of the rocket). This was measured at +0.38 &quot;g&quot; (3.7 m/s) during first stage flight, exceeding the permitted +0.25 &quot;g&quot; (2.5 m/s) for a total of about 13 seconds. Conrad and Cooper found their vision and speech momentarily impaired by the strong vibrations. The cause was traced to improper gas levels in an oxidizer standpipe, and severe oscillations did not affect any subsequent Gemini flights. The initial orbit was 

Film of the launch revealed a series of unexplained light flashes in the first stage exhaust plume, but telemetry data failed to indicate anything that could have caused them. Subsequent review of previous Gemini launches as well as film of Titan II ICBM tests also showed the presence of these light flashes. This phenomenon was thought to be caused by duct tape securing desiccant bags to the turbine exhaust pipe.

The top half of the Titan II&#x27;s first stage, comprising the nitrogen tetroxide tank and its surrounding fuselage, was found floating on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean and retrieved; it is now on display at the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

The first major event on the mission was the ejection of the Rendezvous Evaluation Pod (REP) at 2 hours and 13 minutes into the flight. The radar showed that the pod was moving at a relative speed of two meters per second. While out of radio contact with the ground, the crew found that the pressure in one fuel cell had dropped from 4 hours and 22 minutes into the flight. This was still above the minimum but Cooper decided to shut the fuel cells down. With only battery power, they would be unable to rendezvous with the REP, and it could also mean a premature end to the mission. The cause of this mishap was believed to be a short circuit in the oxygen tank heater that tripped a breaker.

Tests on the ground found that it was possible for the fuel cell to work, even with low oxygen pressure. However, with the fuel cells off, they would only be able to stay in orbit for a day and still have enough battery power for reentry.

It was decided to turn the fuel cells back on and test them by using equipment that required more and more power. These showed that the fuel cells were stable and the crew could continue the mission.

In the meantime, Buzz Aldrin had been working out an alternative rendezvous test. He had a doctorate in orbital mechanics and worked out a scheme where the crew could rendezvous with a given point in space.

The crew became cold as they drifted. Even with the coolant pipes in the suits turned off and the airflow on low, they still shivered. Stars slowly drifting by the windows also proved disorienting, so the crew put covers on the windows.

As with Gemini 4, the crew had difficulty sleeping in alternate rest periods. They still had little rest when they decided to take their sleep periods together.

The phantom rendezvous came on the third day. It went perfectly, even though it was the first precision maneuver on a spaceflight. They tried four maneuvers—apogee adjust, phase adjust, plane change, and coelliptical maneuver—using the orbit attitude and maneuvering system (OAMS).

The next day, flight controllers discovered another problem with the fuel cells: they were producing waste water not suitable for drinking, as it was too acidic, in 20% higher quantity than expected. The cells discharged into a storage tank on board used for both potable and non-potable water, separated by a bladder wall. However, as the astronauts would be draining the potable water for drinking, it was soon determined that there would still be room left over at the end of the mission. In general, the fuel cells were successful at producing cool drinking water, but the astronauts reported that it had a high quantity of gas bubbles in it.

On the fifth day, a major problem occurred when one of the OAMS thruster blocks (comprising thrusters 5, 6, 7, and 8) malfunctioned repeatedly. The exact reason for these problems was unclear and a variety of possible causes were suggested. This meant the cancellation of all experiments requiring the use of the thrusters and the crew were not able to get them operating again.

Seventeen experiments were planned, with one cancelled, as it involved photography of the REP. Experiment D-1 involved the crew photographing celestial objects, and D-6 was a ground photography experiment. Experiments D-4/D-7 involved making brightness measurements of celestial and terrestrial backgrounds and of rocket plumes. Experiments S-8/D-13 investigated whether the crew&#x27;s eyesight changed during the mission.

All of the medical experiments from Gemini 4 were performed, as well as experiment M-1 into the performance of the heart. This involved Conrad wearing inflatable leg cuffs. Experiment M-9 also investigated whether the astronauts&#x27; ability to measure horizontally changed.

The astronauts did not experience much of an appetite during the mission and averaged about 1000 calories a day, well below the intended 2700 calorie per day food intake. They reported dandruff to be a persistent problem to the point where their loose skin flakes would settle on the Gemini&#x27;s instrument panel and partially obscure some instrument readouts. This condition was believed to be due to very low ambient humidity in the cabin causing the astronauts&#x27; skin to become dry and flaky. Postflight medical examinations showed some loss of red blood cells and plasma. Conrad&#x27;s circulatory system returned to normal values within two days after the mission while Cooper took over four days.

S-1 involved Cooper taking the first photographs of the zodiacal light and the gegenschein from orbit. Another experiment involving using the crew&#x27;s Hasselblad camera to photograph metereological phenomenon such as cloud formations. One photograph of the Zagros Mountains revealed greater detail than the official geologic map of Iran. Experiment S-7, the Cloud-Top Spectrometer revealed that the height of clouds could be determined from orbit.

Retrofire was initiated over Hawaii at 190 hours, 27 minutes, and 43 seconds into the mission. The astronauts controlled the reentry, creating drag and lift by rotating the capsule. Due to a computing error, the crew landed 80 miles (130 kilometers) short of the planned landing point in the Atlantic Ocean. Although the computer had worked perfectly, a programmer had entered the rate of the Earth&#x27;s rotation as 360° per 24 hours instead of 360.98° &quot;See&quot; Sidereal day.

The Gemini 5 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources: 10,265 personnel, 114 aircraft and 19 ships. Recovery was by the aircraft carrier .

==Insignia==

This was the first NASA mission to have an insignia patch. After Gemini 3, NASA banned astronauts from naming their spacecraft. Cooper, having realized he had never been in a military organization without one, suggested a mission patch to symbolize the flight. NASA agreed, and the patches got the generic name of &quot;Cooper patch&quot;. Cooper chose the image of a covered wagon due to the pioneering nature of the flight. The slogan &quot;8 Days or Bust&quot; was emblazoned across the wagon, but NASA managers objected to this, feeling it placed too much emphasis on the mission length and not the experiments, and fearing the public might see the mission as a failure if it did not last the full duration. A piece of nylon cloth was sewn over the official slogan.

==Spacecraft location==

The spacecraft is on display at Space Center Houston, Houston, Texas. It is on loan from the Smithsonian.

<text>Leo Leandros (; born Leandros Papathanasiou; 23 August 1923) is a Greek musician, composer, singer, songwriter, lyricist and record producer.

==Biography==
Born on 23 August 1923 in Astakos, Leandros left in the 1950s for Germany to pursue a career in singing and composing. He had some success, but shifted his focus to his daughter, Vicky, who had been singing from a very early age. He became her manager, composer and producer when she was 13 and took charge of her training and career. Under his pseudonym Mario Panas () he was the co-composer (together with Klaus Munro) of &quot;Après toi&quot;, the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1972, which Vicky performed for Luxembourg.
Leandros has composed and produced for many other artists such as Julio Iglesias, Demis Roussos, Nana Mouskouri, Ulli Martin, Freddy Quinn and Jairo, among others. In 1983, he retired but returned exclusively to the studio in the early 1990s for three albums with Vicky Leandros. His albums have sold over 120 million worldwide. A low-profile personality, Leandros avoids public appearances. In October 2005 though, he appeared on German/Austrian TV as a surprise guest for his daughter who was celebrating her 30-year stage Jubilee. He was also the first singer of the Hymn of Panathinaikos. 

He turned 100 on 23 August 2023.

<text>Henry Kuttner (April 7, 1915 – February 3, 1958) was an American author of science fiction, fantasy and horror.

==Early life==
Henry Kuttner was born in Los Angeles, California in 1915. Kuttner (1829–1903) and Amelia Bush (c. 1834–1911), the parents of his father, the bookseller Henry Kuttner (1863–1920), had come from Leszno in Prussia and lived in San Francisco since 1859; the parents of his mother, Annie Levy (1875–1954), were from Great Britain. Henry Kuttner&#x27;s great-grandfather was the scholar Josua Heschel Kuttner. Kuttner grew up in relative poverty following the death of his father. As a young man he worked in his spare time for the literary agency of his uncle, Laurence D&#x27;Orsay (in fact his first cousin by marriage), in Los Angeles before selling his first story, &quot;The Graveyard Rats&quot;, to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in early 1936. It was while working for the d&#x27;Orsay agency that Kuttner picked Leigh Brackett&#x27;s early manuscripts off the slush pile; it was under his tutelage that she sold her first story (to John W. Campbell at &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;).

==Kuttner and Moore==
Kuttner was known for his literary prose and worked in close collaboration with his wife, C. L. Moore. They met through their association with the &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;, a group of writers and fans who corresponded with H. P. Lovecraft. Their work together spanned the 1940s and 1950s and most of the work was credited to pseudonyms, mainly Lewis Padgett and Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell.

L. Sprague de Camp, who knew Kuttner and Moore well, has stated that their collaboration was so seamless that, after a story was completed, it was often impossible for either Kuttner or Moore to recall who had written what. According to de Camp, it was typical for either partner to break off from a story in mid-paragraph or even mid-sentence, with the latest page of the manuscript still in the typewriter. The other spouse would routinely continue the story where the first had left off. They alternated in this manner as many times as necessary until the story was finished.

Among Kuttner&#x27;s most popular work were the Gallegher stories, published under the Padgett name, about a man who invented high-tech solutions to client problems (assisted by his insufferably egomaniacal robot) when he was drunk, only to be completely unable to remember exactly what he had built or why after sobering up. These stories were later collected in &quot;Robots Have No Tails&quot;. In her introduction to the 1973 Lancer Books edition, Moore stated that Kuttner wrote all the Gallegher stories himself.

==Influence==
Marion Zimmer Bradley is among many authors who have cited Kuttner as an influence. Her novel &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; is dedicated to him. Roger Zelazny has talked about the influence of &quot;The Dark World&quot; on his Amber series.

Kuttner&#x27;s friend Richard Matheson dedicated his 1954 novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot; to Kuttner, with thanks for his help and encouragement. Ray Bradbury has said that Kuttner actually wrote the last 300 words of Bradbury&#x27;s first horror story, &quot;The Candle&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, November 1942). Bradbury has referred to Kuttner as a neglected master and a &quot;pomegranate writer: popping with seeds—full of ideas&quot;.

William S. Burroughs&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ticket That Exploded&quot; contains direct quotes from Kuttner regarding the &quot;Happy Cloak&quot; parasitic pleasure monster from the Venusian seas.

Mary Elizabeth Counselman believed that Kuttner&#x27;s habit of writing under widely varied pseudonyms deprived him of the fame that should have been his. &quot;I have often wondered why Kuttner chose to hide his talents behind so many false faces for no editorial reason... Admittedly, the fun is in pretending to be someone else. But Kuttner cheated himself of much fame that he richly deserved by hiding his light under a bushel of pen names that many fans did not know were his. Seabury Quinn and I both chided him about this.&quot;

According to J. Vernon Shea, August Derleth &quot;kept promising to publish Hank&#x27;s and Catherine&#x27;s books under the Arkham House imprint, but kept postponing them.&quot;

==The Cthulhu Mythos==
A friend of Lovecraft&#x27;s as well as of Clark Ashton Smith, Kuttner contributed several stories to the Cthulhu Mythos genre, based on the writing of the former and added to, among other authors, by the latter. Among these were &quot;The Secret of Kralitz&quot; (Weird Tales, October 1936), &quot;The Eater of Souls&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, January 1937), &quot;The Salem Horror&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, May 1937), &quot;The Invaders&quot; (&quot;Strange Stories&quot;, February 1939) and &quot;The Hunt&quot; (&quot;Strange Stories&quot;, June 1939).

Kuttner added a few lesser-known deities to the Mythos, including Iod (&quot;The Secret of Kralitz&quot;), Vorvadoss (&quot;The Eater of Souls&quot;), the Hydra and Nyogtha (&quot;The Salem Horror&quot;). Critic Shawn Ramsey suggests that Abigail Prinn, the villain of &quot;The Salem Horror&quot;, might have been intended by Kuttner to be a descendant of Ludvig Prinn, author of &quot;De Vermis Mysteriis&quot;—a book that appears in Kuttner&#x27;s &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

&quot;Etchings and Odysseys&quot; No 4 (1984), edited by Eric A. Carlson, John J. Koblas and R. Alain Everts, was a special Kuttner tribute issue featuring three reprinted tales by Kuttner - &quot;It Walks By Night&quot;, &quot;The Frog&quot; and &quot;The Invaders,&quot; together with various essays on Kuttner, and an interview with his wife and fellow writer C.L. Moore.

&quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; 5, No 7 (whole number 41) (Lammas 1986), edited by Robert M. Price, was a special Henry Kuttner issue collecting eight Cthulhu Mythos stories by Kuttner. (It did not include &quot;Spawn of Dagon&quot; or &quot;The Invaders&quot;).

&quot;The Book of Iod: Ten Tales of the Mythos&quot; is a collection of Kuttner&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos stories edited by Robert M. Price (Chaosium, 1995). (It also contains three additional tales concerning &#x27;Iod&#x27;s dread tome&#x27; by Robert Bloch, Lin Carter and Robert M. Price). The Kuttner stories included are: &quot;The Secret of Kralitz&quot;, &quot;The Eater of Souls&quot;, &quot;The Salem Horror&quot;, &quot;The Jest of Droom-Avesta&quot;, &quot;Spawn of Dagon&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;The Frog&quot;, &quot;Hydra&quot;, &quot;Bells of Horror&quot; and &quot;The Hunt&quot; - thus, all the Mythos stories which had appeared in the special Kuttner issue of &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot;, plus &quot;Spawn of Dagon&quot; and &quot;The Invaders&quot;. The story &quot;The Black Kiss&quot; (printed here, as often elsewhere, under the joint byline of Kuttner and Robert Bloch), was in fact written entirely by Bloch; Bloch co-credited Kuttner on the tale due to using the character Michael Leigh from &quot;The Salem Horror&quot;. &quot;Beneath the Tombstone&quot; by Robert M. Price and &quot;Dead of Night&quot; by Lin Carter round out the volume. Price points out in his introduction to the volume that &quot;Henry Kuttner&#x27;s own private corner of the Cthulhu Mythos was, then, apparently derived in about equal measure from Lovecraft, Bloch, Zoroastrianism, and Theosophy.&quot;

==Later life==
Kuttner spent the mid-1950s getting his master&#x27;s degree but died of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1958.

<text>Theta Tau () is a professional collegiate engineering fraternity. The fraternity has programs to promote the social, academic, and professional development of its members. Theta Tau is the oldest and largest professional engineering fraternity and has a membership of more than 50,000 men and women who study engineering in all its various branches on over 100 college campuses.

The Theta Tau Central Office is located in Springfield, Missouri.

== History ==

=== Founding years (1904–1911) ===

Theta Tau was founded by four engineering students at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota as the Society of Hammer and Tongs on October 15, 1904. Its founders were Erich J. Schrader, Elwin L. Vinal, William M. Lewis, and Isaac B. Hanks, who were all mining engineering students. They agreed that character qualification should have top priority in membership selection.

Schrader served as its first Grand Regent and was chiefly responsible for the ritual, constitution, and bylaws adopted by the founders. He created one of the original artifacts of incorporation for the Society of Hammer and Tongs, the bolt of &quot;strength and unity&quot; in late 1904.

The constitution provided for the establishment of additional chapters at other leading engineering schools, and the fraternity soon began to expand nationally. Hanks spoke of the fraternity to his friend, Robert Downing, a member of the Rhombohedron Club at Michigan College of Mines. After correspondence and an inspection trip by Hanks, the club was installed as &quot;Beta chapter&quot; in 1906. Lewis transferred to the Colorado School of Mines and contacted the Square Set Club, which became the &quot;Gamma chapter&quot; in 1907. The Southwestern Alumni Association, the fraternity&#x27;s first, was established in Douglas, Arizona, in 1908.

In 1911, representatives of the three chapters and the alumni association met at the University of Minnesota for the first national convention. The name was changed to Theta Tau, a revised ritual was approved, and the present badge was adopted. Perhaps most important for its future expansion, they decided that Theta Tau would include all branches of engineering.

=== Pre-World War II growth (1911–1935) ===
In the next two years, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Epsilon&quot;, &quot;Zeta&quot;, and &quot;Eta chapters&quot; were installed. The second convention was held in Houghton, Michigan, in 1913. That convention designated &quot;The Gear of Theta Tau&quot; as the national fraternity&#x27;s magazine and appointed Jack E. Haynes, A &#x27;08, as its first editor-in-chief. Previously, the magazine had been published by &quot;Beta chapter&quot; with Herman H. Hopkins, B &#x27;08, as editor. Hopkins, a member of the Rhombohedron Club, had been initiated by &quot;Beta chapter&quot; as an alumnus. He served until 1919 as the Grand Scribe and later (1935) was elected Grand Regent.

The third (1915) and fourth (1919) conventions were held in Cleveland, Ohio. Meanwhile, &quot;Theta&quot;, &quot;Iota&quot;, and &quot;Kappa chapters&quot; were installed. Elected as Grand Regent in 1919 was Dr. George D. Louderback, E &#x27;96, a charter member of the &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot;. During his tenure, rapid growth continued, with nine more chapters being installed. In 1920, Schrader became the Grand Scribe, serving in this capacity for 35 years.

J. Sidney Marine, H &#x27;21, was elected Grand Regent in 1925, the youngest to serve in that position. In 1926, Donald D. Curtis, O Hon. &#x27;19, was appointed editor. Three more chapters were installed during the terms of Grand Regent Dr. Richard J. Russell, E &#x27;19. He designed and issued the first 5,000 membership certificates and also designed the officer robes. Joseph W. Howe, O &#x27;24, and Paul L. Mercer, O &#x27;21, became editors of &quot;The Gear&quot; in 1929, producing the publication for 32 years.

Fred Coffman, L &#x27;22, served as Grand Regent during the depression years through 1935. Despite the conditions, three more chapters were installed. A period of very conservative extension began during the thirties with charters generally being granted only to petitioning long-established locals.

=== World War II history (1935–1944) ===
Regional Conferences were established during Hopkins&#x27; term as Grand Regent (1935–37). Dr. John M. Daniels, N Hon. &#x27;22, was the last to serve out his term as Grand Regent in the pre-World War II period. At the 1939 convention, Russell G. Glass, S &#x27;24, was elected Grand Regent and reelected in 1941. At the 1941 Convention, Theta Tau began a tradition of honoring a student chapter delegate as the convention&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding Delegate.&quot;

During World War II, conventions were discontinued and chapters decreased in size, but few went inactive. Hopkins was named Acting Grand Regent for the 27 months that Glass served abroad in the Navy. When conventions were resumed in 1946, Ralph W. Nusser, Z &#x27;28, was elected Grand Regent. During his term, the chapters grew unusually large due to the influx of returning veterans. Norman B. Ames, GB &#x27;17, was elected Grand Regent in 1948.

=== Post World War II (1944–1962) ===
Donald D. Curtis, who a few months after his initiation into the fraternity had been appointed Editor in 1926, added to his years of continuous service as a national officer and began his term as Grand Regent in 1950. Another longtime officer, Jamison Vawter, Z &#x27;16, was elected Grand Regent for the term concluding Theta Tau&#x27;s first half-century. He had served for 27 years as Grand Treasurer and was honored by being the first for whom a Theta Tau Convention was named (1935).

The Founders&#x27; Golden Anniversary Convention was held in Minneapolis and was scheduled to include Founders&#x27; Day. It was a gala occasion marred only by the absence of founder Schrader and Editor Howe due to illness. It was attended by founders Lewis and Vinal and by many Past Grand Regents, including brother Louderback.

Donald D. Curtis served as Grand Regent from 1950 to 1952. A. Dexter Hinckley, T &#x27;25, was elected Grand Regent at the 1954 Convention. Norman B. Ames succeed Schrader as Grand Scribe but resigned to accept a Fulbright Lectureship in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). At its Founders&#x27; Golden Anniversary Convention in 1954, Theta Tau established the position of Counselor which only Schrader could hold. He continued to serve until he died in 1962. The position of Regional Director was established by the 1956 Convention.

At the 1958 Convention, Charles W. Britzius, A &#x27;33, was elected Grand Regent, the restriction of membership to those who were white was removed, and the fraternity appropriated funds to support extension efforts. Robert E. Pope, Z &#x27;52, was appointed Grand Scribe in April 1956 to succeed Ames, was repeatedly elected to that office for 38 years, and was first employed by the fraternity as the traveling secretary in October 1959. William E. Franklin, Z &#x27;57, was appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;The Gear&quot; in 1961, succeeding Howe and Mercer. He served until 1969.

=== Vietnam years (1962–1976) ===
At the convention in 1962, William K. Rey, M &#x27;45, was elected Grand Regent, and the fraternity established the position of executive secretary (now executive director) to which Pope was appointed. In 1963, for the first time, the fraternity had a central office. Britzius, retiring as Grand Regent, was elected Grand Treasurer, a position he was to hold for twelve years. The decade of the 1960s was one of moderate growth with seven new chapters installed. Annual alumni gifts were first solicited in 1964.

The convention in 1964 adopted the colony program as the standard route which a local fraternity would follow in becoming a Theta Tau chapter. It also adopted the official flag featuring four quadrants.

The 1966 convention elected C. Ramond Hanes, S 1924, as Grand Regent. The 1968 convention elected Dr. Charles E. Wales, EB &#x27;53, as Grand Regent. The position of a student member of the executive council was created in 1970.

The &quot;Executive Council Bulletin&quot;, in newsletter format, was first published during the 1970–72 biennium. Now generally issued monthly during the school year, it provides timely news and reminders to officers of the national fraternity, chapters, and alumni organizations.

Dr. George G. Dodd, Z &#x27;60, was elected Grand Regent in 1972; and the delegate-at-large (immediate Past Grand Regent) was made an official member of the executive council. The 1976 convention elected Grand Regent Stephen J. Barth, LB &#x27;67. In 1977, a plan adopted by the 1976 convention was implemented, making women eligible for membership with the &quot;Delta chapter&quot; at Case Western Reserve University, being one of the first to admit women.

=== A new era (1976–1991) ===
Richard A. Rummelhart, O &#x27;76, was appointed editor in 1978 and was succeeded by Arthur T. Petrzelka, O &#x27;79, who edited the magazine from 1979 to 1988. The first membership directory in forty years was published in 1979, and others in 1985, 1990, and 1994. &quot;A History of Theta Tau&quot;, compiled by Past Grand Regent Charles W. Britzius, was published in 1980. Regional conferences were replaced by a special convention in 1981, establishing the pattern of holding national meetings annually in August rather than biennially in the week after Christmas.

In 1982, A. Thomas Brown was elected Grand Regent. In 1983, Theta Tau moved the central office from the executive secretary&#x27;s home to space in the Theta Xi Memorial Headquarters Building in Creve Coeur; held its first national conference; and first employed a second member, Dean W. Bettinger, T &#x27;81, as extension director/chapter consultant. Since then, others have been employed for limited periods, including Michael T. Abraham, EB &#x27;92, who served as an administrative assistant in 1988 and briefly in 1989.

The Theta Tau Alumni Hall of Fame was established in 1986 to honor members who distinguish themselves through the excellence of their contributions to their professions and/or to the fraternity. Randall J. Scheetz, O &#x27;79, was first elected Grand Regent in 1986. The fraternity experienced significant growth during his tenure with the installation of eight chapters and the certification of thirteen colonies. This extension effort was sparked by Jerome R. Palardy, EB &#x27;90, then a student member of the executive council in the Detroit area. The result was &quot;Xi Beta&quot;, &quot;Omicron Beta&quot;, and &quot;Phi Beta chapters&quot;. &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;Gamma Beta chapters&quot; were re-established after being inactive since the late 1970s. &quot;Pi Beta&quot;, &quot;Rho Beta&quot;, &quot;Sigma Beta&quot;, and &quot;Tau Beta chapters&quot; were installed and four new alumni clubs were authorized.

The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest originated at Purdue University in 1949 as a competition between the &quot;Phi chapter&quot; of Theta Tau and Triangle; it was held annually until 1956. &quot;Phi chapter&quot; revived the contest in 1983 as a competition open to all Purdue students. From 1988 to 2013, the Theta Tau Rube Goldberg Machine Contest was a national competition held at Purdue University in March each year, with participation by winning entries from local competitions sponsored by Theta Tau chapters across the nation. The national contest gained much coverage by the press and television media.

Sean Donnelly, T&#x27;88, and Lawrence El-Hindi, T &#x27;87, were appointed co-editors-in-chief of &quot;The Gear of Theta Tau&quot; in 1988. At the direction of the executive council, the central office staff assumed responsibility for the regular publication of the magazine beginning with the spring 1994 issue. Dean W. Bettinger, who had served as a staff member in 1983, was first elected Grand Regent at the 1990 convention and was reelected in 1992 and 1994. During his tenure, nine chapters were installed: &quot;Upsilon Beta&quot;, &quot;Phi Beta&quot;, &quot;Chi Beta&quot;, &quot;Psi Beta&quot;, &quot;Tau&quot; (reestablished), &quot;Omega Beta&quot;, &quot;Delta Gamma&quot;, &quot;Epsilon Gamma&quot;, and &quot;Zeta Gamma&quot;; and six colonies certified.

The Theta Tau Outstanding Student Member Program was created in 1991 so each chapter could designate an outstanding student member for recognition by the national fraternity. The national fraternity gives recipients an engrossed certificate and an award dangle which the recipient displays on their badge&#x27;s guard chain. One of these each year is selected as the fraternity&#x27;s Outstanding Student Member with the announcement made at the national meeting. The national honoree is presented with a special certificate and with a jeweled dangle.

=== The present-day (1991-present) ===
In 1991, the central office moved to the 655 Office Building in the Creve Coeur Executive Office Park. Michael T. Abraham returned as a permanent staff member with the title of assistant executive director in 1992 and was elected Grand Scribe in 1994. In 1994, the appointive position of executive director was added to the executive council. Pope, who had served on staff for 37 years, retired in 1996 and was designated executive director emeritus by the executive council. Abraham was appointed executive director.

Lee C. Haas was elected Grand Regent in 1996 and reelected in 1998. He was instrumental in establishing the Theta Tau Educational Foundation in 1998 and served as its first president. In 1999, the foundation sponsored the fraternity&#x27;s first Leadership Academy which replaced the National Conference. Haas presided at the installation of &quot;Eta Gamma&quot;, &quot;Theta Gamma&quot;, and &quot;Iota Gamma chapters&quot;.

At the fraternity&#x27;s first convention held in Arizona, Glen A. Wilcox was elected Grand Regent. At the 2000 meeting, many structural changes were made in the constitution and bylaws to more fully integrate the central office into the laws. These changes reflected many practices already in place and allowed the executive council to focus on its responsibilities as the fraternity&#x27;s board of directors. The convention also endorsed the national fraternity liability insurance standard adopted by the executive council in the spring of 1999.

In 2000, past Grand Regent Haas presided at the installation of the &quot;Kappa Gamma chapter&quot; at the Virginia Commonwealth University. Grand Regent Wilcox presided at the installation of &quot;Lambda Gamma&quot; at Clemson University on January 13, 2001, and he later presided at the installations of &quot;Mu Gamma&quot; and &quot;Nu Gamma&quot; in the spring of 2003. In November 2001, the central office moved from the St. Louis metropolitan area to Austin, Texas, and the fraternity&#x27;s archives were moved from a room in the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; house to the central office.

As the fraternity reached its centennial in 2004, Theta Tau had initiated over 30,000 members and had more active student chapters than at any time in its history. At the 2004 convention, Michael D. Livingston was elected Grand Regent. During his term, &quot;Omicron Gamma&quot;, &quot;Pi Gamma&quot;, &quot;Rho Gamma&quot;, &quot;Sigma Gamma&quot;, &quot;Tau Gamma&quot;, &quot;Upsilon Gamma&quot;, &quot;Phi Gamma&quot;, &quot;Chi Gamma&quot;, &quot;Psi Gamma&quot;, &quot;Omega Gamma&quot;, &quot;Zeta Delta&quot;, &quot;Eta Delta&quot;, &quot;Theta Delta&quot;, and &quot;Iota Delta chapters&quot; were installed. Additionally, &quot;Kappa&quot;, and &quot;Epsilon&quot; were re-installed, and &quot;Epsilon Delta&quot; and &quot;Pi Delta&quot; were installed.

In 2007, the central office moved from leased office space to its first fraternity-owned headquarters. The roughly office condo is located at the corner of 11th and San Jacinto, within blocks of the capitol and university in downtown Austin, Texas. In the same year, the National Alumni Club of Theta Tau was created.

In the spring of 2010, Grand Marshal Brandon Satterwhite led a group of students and alumni on the fraternity&#x27;s first national service project with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Bonnell,

== Symbols ==
The primary symbols of Theta Tau are the Hammer and Tongs, and the gear wheel. One of the fraternity&#x27;s original artifacts of incorporation is the bolt of &quot;strength and unity&quot;, fabricated by Schrader in 1904. Made of brass and painted the historic dark red found in the official crest, this bolt has survived almost unscathed over the years.

The flag of Theta Tau is broken into four quadrants, alternately colored dark red and gold. In the upper left corner is the crest of Theta Tau. In the opposing corner are Greek letters &#x27; in gold. There is also an alternate flag that is divided along its length into three equal sections, the left and right dark red with gold in the center bearing dark red letters &#x27; and arranged vertically. The letters ΘΤ in dark red are found in the center section.

The fraternity&#x27;s colors are dark red and gold, while its gem is dark red garnet. The more common pyrope garnet, used in the member&#x27;s badge, is used based on color and availability. The oldest symbol of the fraternity still in use is the coat of arms adopted in 1906. It may only be displayed or worn by members.

The first badge was a gold skull with the letters &#x27; and &#x27; on its forehead and a crossed hammer and tongs beneath, but this was replaced in 1911. The four items of official jewelry remain the member&#x27;s badge, gear pin (called the sister pin until 1994), pledge insignia, and official recognition button. Other insignia have been adopted over the years. The colony program sparked the design of the simple colony pin and colony pledge pin.

The fraternity&#x27;s open motto is &quot;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;...&quot; – Ecclesiastes 

== Conferences ==
== Chapters ==
== Notable alumni ==
== Local chapter or individual misconduct ==
In December 2013, the Michigan Technological University chapter of Theta Tau was suspended for violations of &quot;alcohol, endangerment, community order, disruptive behavior, and hazing provisions.&quot; Multiple times during their suspension, they were found in violation of alcohol provisions and failure to comply with the terms of their suspension, and as a result, were expelled in May 2017.

In April 2018, the Syracuse University chapter of Theta Tau was expelled after video surfaced of members using language that was &quot;extremely racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities.&quot;

In April 2024, The Cornell University chapter of Theta Tau was suspended for alleged drug and alcohol violations and hazing. Concerns arose after potential new members reported incidents involving cocaine use at fraternity events. Despite a cease and desist order, the chapter continued its activities until Theta Tau Central Office issued a suspension. Individual sanctions were imposed, and the fraternity&#x27;s charter was suspended for two years. The chapter is expected to be expelled at the 2025 Theta Tau National Convention.

<text>John Stewart Williamson (April 29, 1908 – November 10, 2006), who wrote as Jack Williamson, was an American science fiction writer, one of several called the &quot;Dean of Science Fiction&quot;. He is also credited with one of the first uses of the term &quot;genetic engineering&quot;. Early in his career he sometimes used the pseudonyms Will Stewart and Nils O. Sonderlund.

== Early life ==
Williamson was born April 29, 1908, in Bisbee, Arizona Territory. According to his own account, the first three years of his life were spent on a ranch at the top of the Sierra Madre Mountains on the headwaters of the Yaqui River in Sonora, Mexico. He spent much of the rest of his early childhood in western Texas. In search of better pastures, his family migrated to rural New Mexico in a horse-drawn covered wagon in 1915. The farming was difficult there and the family turned to ranching, which they continue to this day near Pep. He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II as a weather forecaster.

== Writing career ==




As a child Williamson enjoyed storytelling to his brother and two sisters. As a young man, he discovered the magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, established in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback, after answering an ad for one free issue. He strove to write his own fiction and sold his first story to Gernsback at age 20: &quot;The Metal Man&quot; was published in the December 1928 issue of &quot;Amazing&quot;. During the next year Gernsback published three more of his stories in the new pulp magazines &quot;Science Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Air Wonder Stories&quot;, and separately published &quot;The Girl from Mars&quot; by Miles J. Breuer and Williamson as &quot;Science Fiction Series #1&quot;. His work during this early period was heavily influenced by A. Merritt, author of &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; (1920) and other fantasy serials. Noting the Merritt influence, Algis Budrys described &quot;The Metal Man&quot; as &quot;a story full of memorable images&quot;.

Early on, Williamson became impressed by the works of Miles J. Breuer and struck up a correspondence with him. A doctor who wrote science fiction in his spare time, Breuer had a strong talent and turned Williamson away from dreamlike fantasies towards more rigorous plotting and stronger narrative. Under Breuer&#x27;s tutelage, Williamson would send outlines and drafts for review. Their first work together was the novel &quot;Birth of a New Republic&quot; in which Moon colonies were undergoing something like the American Revolution, a theme later taken up by many other SF writers, particularly in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.

Wracked by emotional storms and believing many of his physical ailments to be psychosomatic, Williamson underwent psychiatric evaluation in 1933 at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, in which he began to learn to resolve the conflict between his reason and his emotion. From this period, his stories take on a grittier, more realistic tone.

By the 1930s, he was an established genre author, and the teenaged Isaac Asimov was thrilled to receive a postcard from Williamson, whom he had idolized, which congratulated him on his first published story and offered &quot;welcome to the ranks&quot;. Williamson remained a regular contributor to the pulp magazines but did not achieve financial success as a writer until many years later.

An unfavorable review of his novel &quot;Seetee Ship&quot;, which said his writing &quot;ranks only slightly above that of a comic strip adventure&quot;, brought Williamson to the attention of &quot;The New York Sunday News&quot;, which needed a science fiction writer for a new comic strip. Williamson wrote the resulting strip &quot;Beyond Mars&quot; (1952–55), loosely based on &quot;Seetee Ship&quot;, until the paper dropped all comics.

Beginning 1954 and continuing into the 1990s, Williamson and Frederik Pohl wrote more than a dozen science fiction novels together, including the series Jim Eden, Starchild, and Cuckoo.
Williamson continued to write as a nonagenarian and won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards during the last decade of his life, by far the oldest writer to win those awards.

In his later years, he would also criticize attempts to write &quot;serious&quot; science fiction:

== Academic career ==
Williamson received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in English in the 1950s from Eastern New Mexico University (ENMU) in Portales (near the Texas panhandle), joining the faculty of that university in 1960. He remained affiliated with the school for the rest of his life. In the late 1990s, he established a permanent trust to fund the publication of &quot;El Portal&quot;, ENMU&#x27;s journal of literature and art. In the 1980s, he made a sizable donation of books and original manuscripts to ENMU&#x27;s library, which resulted in the formation of a Special Collections department; the library now is home to the Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library, which ENMU&#x27;s website describes as &quot;one of the top science fiction collections in the world&quot;. In addition, Williamson hosted the &quot;Jack Williamson Lectureship Series&quot;, an annual lectureship where Guests of Honor and other noted authors give lectures, read from their works, and participate in lively panel discussions on a variety of topics. The lectureship is still celebrated at ENMU each year. The Jack Williamson Liberal Arts building houses the Languages &amp; Literature, Mathematical Sciences, History, Religion &amp; Social Sciences, and Psychology &amp; Political Science Departments of the university, as well as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean&#x27;s Office.

Williamson completed his PhD in English literature at the University of Colorado in Boulder, focused on H.G. Wells&#x27; earlier works, demonstrating that Wells was not the naive optimist that many believed him to be.

==Terms coined==

Williamson coined the word terraforming in a science-fiction story published in 1942 in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

He is also credited with one of the first uses of the term &quot;genetic engineering&quot;.

The word &quot;psionics&quot; first appeared in print in a novella by Williamson—&quot;The Greatest Invention&quot;—published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine in 1951.

== Later years ==
The Science Fiction Writers of America named Williamson its second Grand Master of Science Fiction after Robert Heinlein, presented 1976.

After having been let go from ENMU during the university&#x27;s financial crisis in 1977, Williamson spent some time concentrating on his writing, but after being named professor emeritus by ENMU, he was coaxed back to co-teach two evening classes, &quot;Creative Writing&quot; and &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (he pioneered the latter at ENMU during his full-time professorship days). Williamson continued to co-teach these two classes into the 21st century. After he made a large donation of original manuscripts and rare books from his personal collection to the ENMU library, a special collections area was created to house these and it was named the &quot;Jack Williamson Special Collection&quot;.

In 1994 Williamson received a World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Williamson in 1996, its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.

The Horror Writers Association conferred its Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1998 and the World Horror Convention elected him Grand Master in 2004. 

In November 2006, Williamson died at his home in Portales, New Mexico, at age 98. Despite his age, he had made an appearance at the Spring 2006 &quot;Jack Williamson Lectureship&quot; and published a 320-page novel, &quot;The Stonehenge Gate&quot;, in 2005.

Minor planets 5516 Jawilliamson and 235281 Jackwilliamson are named in his honor.

== Legion of Space series ==
While attending a Great Books course, Williamson learned that Henryk Sienkiewicz had created one of his works by taking &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; of Alexandre Dumas and pairing them with John Falstaff of William Shakespeare. Williamson took this idea into science fiction with &quot;The Legion of Space&quot;.

Desperate for money, he searched for a quick source of income. While most pulps of the time were slow to pay, the recently restarted &quot;Astounding&quot; was an exception. However, they did not accept novels, so Williamson submitted three short stories and a novelette. Learning that they were also accepting novels for serialization, he sent in &quot;The Legion of Space&quot;, which was published as an anthology in six parts. It quickly became a genre favorite, and was quickly collected into a hardcover.

The story takes place in an era when humans have colonized the Solar System but dare not go farther, as the first extra-solar expedition to Barnard&#x27;s Star failed and the survivors came back as babbling, grotesque, diseased madmen. They spoke of a gigantic planet, populated by ferocious animals and the single city left of the evil &quot;Medusae&quot;. The Medusae bear a vague resemblance to jellyfish, but are actually elephant-sized, four-eyed, flying beings with hundreds of tentacles. The Medusae cannot speak and communicate with one another via a microwave code.

The Falstaff character is named Giles Habibula. He was once a criminal, and can open any lock ever made. In his youth he was called Giles The Ghost. Jay Kalam (Commander of The Legion) and Hal Samdu are the names of the other two warriors. In this story, these warriors of the 30th Century battle the Medusae, the alien race from the lone planet of Barnard&#x27;s Star. The Legion itself is the military and police force of the Solar System after the overthrow of an empire called the Purple Hall that once ruled all humans.

In this novel, renegade Purple pretenders ally themselves with the Medusae as a means to regain their empire. But the Medusae, who are totally unlike humans in all ways, turn on the Purples, seeking to destroy all humans and move to the Solar System, as their own world, far older than Earth, is finally spiraling back into Barnard&#x27;s Star. One of the Purples, John Ulnar, supports the Legion from the start, and he is the fourth great warrior. His enemy is the Purple pretender Eric Ulnar, who sought the Medusae out in the first place, seeking to become the next Emperor of The Sun.

The Medusae conquered the Moon, set up their bases there, and went on to attempt conquest of the Solar System. The Medusae had for eons used a reddish, artificial greenhouse gas to keep their dying world from freezing. The Medusae learned from the first human expedition to their world that the gas rots human flesh, and the Medusae use it as a potent chemical weapon, attempting ecological destruction by means of projectiles fired from the Moon. Their vast spaceships also have very effective plasma weapons, very similar to those the Romulans had in a Star Trek episode called &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;.

The Legion works also featured a force field called AKKA which can erase from the Universe any matter, of any size, anywhere, even a star or a planet. AKKA was a weapon of mass destruction and the secret of it was entrusted to a series of women. AKKA was used in the past to overthrow the Purple tyranny. It was also used to wipe out most of the Medusae, though they had tried to steal the secret. When they were wiped out, the Moon where they had established their base was erased out of existence. At the end of the story, John Ulnar falls in love with the keeper of AKKA, Aladoree Anthar, and marries her. Aladoree Anthar is described as a young woman with lustrous brown hair and gray eyes, beautiful as a goddess.

Williamson next wrote &quot;The Cometeers&quot; which takes place twenty years after &quot;The Legion of Space&quot; in which the same characters battle another alien race, this one of different origin.

In this second tale, they fight The Cometeers who are an alien race of energy beings controlling a &quot;comet&quot; which is really a giant force field containing a swarm of planets populated by their slaves. The slave races are of flesh and blood, but none are remotely similar to humans. The Cometeers cannot be destroyed by AKKA, as they are incorporeal from the Universe&#x27;s point of view and exist for the most part in an alternate reality. The ruling Cometeers feed on their slaves and literally absorb their souls, leaving disgusting, dying hulks in their wake. It is said that they do so, as they were once fleshly entities themselves of various species. Hence, the ruling Cometeers keep other intelligent beings as slaves and &quot;cattle&quot;. They fear AKKA, though, as it can erase all their possessions.

They are defeated by the skills of Giles Habibula. Giles broke into a secret chamber guarded by complex locks and force fields that the incorporeal Cometeers could not penetrate. In it the ruler of the Cometeers had kept its own weapon of mass destruction, one that would cause the Cometeers to disintegrate. The ruling Cometeer kept this weapon to enforce its rule over the others of its kind. Once the Cometeers were destroyed, their slaves were ordered by the Legion to take the comet and leave the Solar System, and never return.

Another novel, &quot;One Against the Legion&quot;, tells of a Purple pretender who sets up a robotic base on a world over seventy light years from Earth, and tries to conquer the Solar System via matter transporter technology he has stolen. In this story robots are outlawed, as they are in &quot;Dune&quot;. The story also features Jay Kalam, lobbying to allow the New Cometeers to leave the Solar System in peace, as many people were demanding that AKKA be used to obliterate the departing swarm of planets once and for all.

In 1983, Williamson published a final Legion novel, &quot;The Queen of the Legion&quot;. Giles Habibula reappears in this final novel, which is set after the disbanding of the Legion.

<text>22 (twenty-two) is the natural number following 21 and preceding 23.

== In mathematics ==
22 is a semiprime, a Smith number, and an Erdős–Woods number. formula_1 is a commonly used approximation of the irrational number , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. 

22 can read as &quot;two twos&quot;, which is the only fixed point of John Conway&#x27;s look-and-say function.

The number 22 appears prominently within sporadic groups. The Mathieu group M22 is one of 26 sporadic finite simple groups, defined as the 3-transitive permutation representation on 22 points. There are also 22 regular complex apeirohedra.

<text>Edward Whymper FRSE (27 April 184016 September 1911) was an English mountaineer, explorer, illustrator, and author best known for the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865. Four members of his climbing party were killed during the descent. Whymper also made important first ascents on the Mont Blanc massif and in the Pennine Alps, Chimborazo in South America, and the Canadian Rockies. His exploration of Greenland contributed an important advance to Arctic exploration. Whymper wrote several books on mountaineering, including &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==

Edward Whymper was born at Lambeth Terrace on Kennington Road in London on 27 April 1840 to the artist and wood engraver Josiah Wood Whymper and Elizabeth Whitworth Claridge. He was the second of eleven children, his older brother being the artist and explorer Frederick Whymper. He was trained to be a wood-engraver at an early age. In 1860, he made extensive forays into the central and western Alps to produce a series of commissioned alpine scenery drawings. Among the objects of this tour was the illustration of an unsuccessful attempt made by Professor Bonney&#x27;s party to ascend Mont Pelvoux, at that time believed to be the highest peak of the Dauphiné Alps.

In 1861, Whymper successfully completed the ascent of Mont Pelvoux, the first of a series of expeditions that threw much needed light on the topography of an area which at the time was very poorly mapped. From the summit of Mont Pelvoux, Whymper discovered that it was overtopped by a neighbouring peak, subsequently named the Barre des Écrins, which, before the annexation of Savoy added Mont Blanc to the possessions of France, was the highest point in the French Alps. Whymper climbed the Barre des Écrins in 1864 with Horace Walker, A. W. Moore and guides Christian Almer senior and junior.

The years 1861 to 1865 were filled with new expeditions in the Mont Blanc massif and the Pennine Alps, among them the first recorded ascents of the Aiguille d&#x27;Argentière and Mont Dolent in 1864, and the Aiguille Verte, the Grand Cornier and &quot;Pointe Whymper&quot; on the Grandes Jorasses in 1865. That same year he also made the first crossing of the Moming Pass. According to his own words, his only failure was on the west ridge of the Dent d&#x27;Hérens in 1863. As a result of his Alpine experience, he designed a tent which came to be known as the &quot;Whymper tent&quot; and tents based on his design were still being manufactured 100 years later.

==The Matterhorn==
Professor John Tyndall and Whymper emulated each other in determined attempts to reach the summit of the Matterhorn by the south-western, or Italian, ridge. In 1865, Whymper, who had failed eight times already, attempted unsuccessfully to climb a couloir on the south-east face with Michel Croz. After Croz left for a prior engagement with Charles Hudson, Whymper was unable to secure the services of Val Tournanche guide Jean Antoine Carrel, and instead planned to try the eastern face with Lord Francis Douglas and the two Zermatt guides, Peter Taugwalder and his son of the same name.

Whymper was convinced that the Matterhorn&#x27;s precipitous appearance when viewed from Zermatt was an optical illusion, and that the dip of the strata, which on the Italian side formed a continuous series of overhangs, should make the opposite side a natural staircase. This party of four was joined by Hudson and Croz, and the inexperienced Douglas Hadow. Their attempt by what is now the normal route, the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party. On the descent, Hadow slipped and fell onto Croz, dislodging him and dragging Douglas and Hudson to their deaths; the rope parted, saving the other three.

A controversy ensued as to whether the rope had actually been cut, but a formal investigation could not find any proof, and the elder Peter Taugwalder was acquitted. The rope had snapped between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. Whymper asked Taugwalder to show him the rope. To his surprise, he saw that it was the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought, and one which had been intended only as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done. It can be deduced that Taugwalder had no other choice but to use a weaker rope, as the stronger rope was not long enough to connect Taugwalder to Douglas. The account of Whymper&#x27;s attempts on the Matterhorn occupies the greater part of his book, &quot;Scrambles amongst the Alps&quot; (1871), in which the illustrations are engraved by Whymper himself. The accident haunted Whymper:
==Exploration in Greenland==
Whymper&#x27;s 1865 campaign had been planned to test his route-finding skills in preparation for an expedition to Greenland in 1867. The exploration in Greenland resulted in an important collection of fossil plants, which were described by Professor Heer and deposited in the British Museum. Whymper&#x27;s report was published in the report of the British Association of 1869. Though hampered by a lack of supplies and an epidemic among the local people, he proved that the interior could be explored by the use of suitably constructed sledges, and thus contributed an important advance to Arctic exploration.

Another expedition in 1872 was devoted to a survey of the coastline.

==South American exploration==

Whymper next organised an expedition to Ecuador, designed primarily to collect data for the study of altitude sickness and the effect of reduced pressure on the human body. His chief guide was Jean-Antoine Carrel, who later died from exhaustion on the Matterhorn after bringing his employers to safety through a snowstorm.

During 1880, Whymper made two ascents of Chimborazo (6,267m), including its first ascent; though Alexander von Humboldt had climbed on the volcano in 1802, he did not reach the summit. Whymper spent a night on the summit of Cotopaxi and made first ascents of Sincholagua, Antisana, Cayambe, Sara Urco and Cotacachi. In 1892, he published the results of his journey in a volume entitled &quot;Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equator&quot;.

His observations on altitude sickness led him to conclude that it was caused by a reduction in atmospheric pressure, which lessens the value of inhaled air, and by expansion of the air or gas within the body, causing pressure upon the internal organs. The effects produced by gas expansion may be temporary and dissipate when equilibrium has been restored between the internal and external pressure. The publication of his work was recognised on the part of the Royal Geographical Society by the award of the Patron&#x27;s medal.

His experiences in South America having convinced him of certain serious errors in the readings of aneroid barometers at high altitudes, he published a work entitled &quot;How to Use the Aneroid Barometer&quot;, and succeeded in introducing important improvements in their construction. He afterwards published two guide-books to Zermatt and Chamonix.

While in Ecuador, Whymper made a collection of amphibians and reptiles that he handed over to George Albert Boulenger at the British Museum. The collection received some praise from Boulenger, who said that &quot;though containing no striking novelties&quot;, the collection was &quot;interesting on account of the care bestowed by its collector in recording the exact locality from which every specimen was obtained&quot;. Boulenger described four new species from the materials, three of them named after Whymper: the snake &quot;Coronella whymperi&quot; (now a junior synonym of &quot;Saphenophis boursieri&quot;) and the frogs &quot;Prostherapis whymperi&quot;, &quot;Phryniscus elegans&quot;, and &quot;Hylodes whymperi&quot; (now a junior synonym of &quot;Pristimantis curtipes&quot;).

==Canadian Rockies==

In the early 1900s, Whymper visited the Canadian Rockies several times and made arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to promote the Canadian Rockies and the railway in his talks in Europe and Asia. In exchange, the CPR agreed to pay transportation costs for him and his four guides. According to the surveyor and mountaineer A. O. Wheeler, Whymper was hired to “conduct explorations and surveys in the interests of the Canadian Pacific railway company” (Wheeler, 1905). In 1901, Whymper and his four guides (Joseph Bossoney, Christian Kaufmann, Christian Klucker and Joseph Pollinger) made the first ascents of Mount Whymper and Stanley Peak in the Vermilion Pass area of the Canadian Rockies.

His brother Frederick also has a mountain in British Columbia named after him, from his days as artist illustrator with the Robert Brown&#x27;s Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition in 1864.

==Illustrator==
When not climbing, Whymper pursued his profession as an engraver of illustrations for books and periodicals. Among the books he illustrated was his fellow-mountaineer Florence Crauford Grove&#x27;s &quot;The Frosty Caucasus&quot; (1875) Whymper also illustrated and engraved John Tyndall&#x27;s &quot;Hours of Exercise in The Alps&quot; (1871) and Augusta Bethell&#x27;s &quot;Helen in Switzerland&quot; (1867).
He illustrated books for Isabella L. Bird but his brother Charles Whymper was the designer of the Henrietta Amelia Bird memorial clock tower in Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland. It was built in 1905, funded by Isabella Bird (Mrs. Bishop) in memory of her sister.

==Final years==

On 25 April 1906, aged 65, Whymper married Edith Mary Lewin aged 23 (born 1883) at Emmanuel Church in Forest Gate, Essex (now London). The service was presided over by Canon J. M&#x27;Cormick, who had assisted the mountaineer after the Matterhorn accident. The marriage produced one daughter, Ethel. The couple separated in 1910. Edith remarried in 1913 and died the following year from complications of pregnancy.

Shortly after returning to Chamonix from another climb in the Alps, Whymper became ill, locked himself in his room at the Grand Hotel Couttet, and refused all medical treatment. Whymper died alone on 16 September 1911, at the age of 71. A funeral was held four days later. He is buried in the English cemetery in Chamonix.

<text>24 (twenty-four) is the natural number following 23 and preceding 25. It is equal to two dozen and one sixth of a gross.

==In mathematics==
24 is an even composite number, a highly composite number, an abundant number, a practical number, and a congruent number. The many ways 24 can be constructed inspired a children&#x27;s mathematical game involving the use of any of the four standard operations on four numbers on a card to get 24 (see 24 Game).

24 is also part of the only nontrivial solution pair to the cannonball problem, and the kissing number in 4-dimensional space. An icositetragon is a regular polygon with 24 sides. A tesseract has 24 two-dimensional square faces. 

==In religion==
*In Christian apocalyptic literature it represents the complete Church, being the sum of the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 Apostles of the Lamb of God. For example, in &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot;: &quot;Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.&quot;
*Number of Tirthankaras in Jainism.
*Number of spokes in the Ashok Chakra.

==In culture==
*In Brazil, twenty-four is associated with homosexuality as it is the number that stands for the deer in a game known as “jogo do bicho”.
*There are 24 hours in a day.

<text>23 (twenty-three) is the natural number following 22 and preceding 24.

== In mathematics ==
Twenty-three is the ninth prime number, the smallest odd prime that is not a twin prime. It is, however, a cousin prime with 19, and a sexy prime with 17 and 29; while also being the largest member of the first prime sextuplet (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23). Twenty-three is also the next to last member of the first Cunningham chain of the first kind (2, 5, 11, 23, 47), and the sum of the prime factors of the second set of consecutive discrete semiprimes, (21, 22). 23 is the smallest odd prime to be a highly cototient number, as the solution to formula_1 for the integers 95, 119, 143, and 529.

* 23 is the second Smarandache–Wellin prime in base ten, as it is the concatenation of the decimal representations of the first two primes (2 and 3) and is itself also prime, and a happy number.
* The sum of the first nine primes up to 23 is a square: formula_2 and the sum of the first 23 primes is 874, which is divisible by 23, a property shared by few other numbers.
* It is the fifth factorial prime, and since 14! + 1 is a multiple of 23, but 23 is not one more than a multiple of 14, 23 is the first Pillai prime.
* In the list of fortunate numbers, 23 occurs twice, since adding 23 to either the fifth or eighth primorial gives a prime number (namely 2333 and 9699713).
* 23 has the distinction of being one of two integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than 9 cubes of positive integers (the other is 239). See Waring&#x27;s problem.
* The twenty-third highly composite number 20,160 is one less than the last number (the 339th super-prime 20,161) that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers.
:Otherwise, formula_3 is the largest even number that is not the sum of two abundant numbers.

* 23 is the second Woodall prime, and an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form formula_4 It is the fifth Sophie Germain prime and the fourth safe prime.
* 23 is the number of trees on 8 unlabeled nodes. It is also a Wedderburn–Etherington number, which are numbers that can be used to count certain binary trees.
* The natural logarithms of all positive integers lower than 23 are known to have binary BBP-type formulae.
* 23 is the first prime &quot;p&quot; for which unique factorization of cyclotomic integers based on the &quot;p&quot;th root of unity breaks down.
* 23 is the smallest positive solution to Sunzi&#x27;s original formulation of the Chinese remainder theorem.
* 23 is the smallest prime formula_5 such that the largest consecutive pair of formula_5-smooth numbers (11859210, 11859211) is the same as the largest consecutive pair of formula_7-smooth numbers.
* According to the birthday paradox, in a group of 23 or more randomly chosen people, the probability is more than 50% that some pair of them will have the same birthday.A related coincidence is that 365 times the natural logarithm of 2, approximately 252.999, is very close to the number of pairs of 23 items and 22nd triangular number, 253.
* The first twenty-three odd prime numbers (between 3 and 89 inclusive), are all cluster primes formula_5 such that every even positive integer formula_9 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers that do not exceed formula_5.
* 23 is the smallest discriminant of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 3 (negated), and it is the smallest discriminant of complex cubic fields (also negated).
* The twenty-third permutable prime in decimal formula_11 is also the second to be a prime repunit (after formula_12), followed by formula_13 and formula_14.

Hilbert&#x27;s problems are twenty-three problems in mathematics published by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900.

=== Mersenne numbers ===

The first Mersenne number of the form formula_15 that does not yield a prime number when inputting a prime exponent is formula_16 with formula_17

On the other hand, the second composite Mersenne number contains an exponent formula_18 of twenty-three:
formula_19

The twenty-third prime number (83) is an exponent to the fourteenth composite Mersenne number, which factorizes into two prime numbers, the largest of which is twenty-three digits long when written in base ten:
formula_20

Further down in this sequence, the seventeenth and eighteenth composite Mersenne numbers have two prime factors each as well, where the largest of these are respectively twenty-two and twenty-four digits long,
formula_21

Where prime exponents for formula_22 and formula_23 add to 106, which lies in between prime exponents of formula_24 and formula_25, the index of the latter two (17 and 18) in the sequence of Mersenne numbers sum to 35, which is the twenty-third composite number.

formula_26 is twenty-three digits long in decimal, and there are only three other numbers formula_18 whose factorials generate numbers that are formula_18 digits long in base ten: 1, 22, and 24.

=== In geometry ===

The Leech lattice Λ24 is a 24-dimensional lattice through which 23 other positive definite even unimodular Niemeier lattices of rank 24 are built, and vice-versa. Λ24 represents the solution to the kissing number in 24 dimensions as the precise lattice structure for the maximum number of spheres that can fill 24-dimensional space without overlapping, equal to 196,560 spheres. These 23 Niemeier lattices are located at &quot;deep holes&quot; of radii in lattice points around its automorphism group, Conway group formula_29. The Leech lattice can be constructed in various ways, which include:
* By means of a matrix of the form formula_30 where formula_31 is the identity matrix and formula_32 is a 24 by 24 Hadamard matrix (Z/23Z ∪ ∞) with &quot;a&quot; = 2 and &quot;b&quot; = 3, and entries X(∞) = 1 and X(0) = -1 with X(&quot;n&quot;) the quadratic residue symbol mod 23 for nonzero &quot;n&quot;.
* Through the extended binary Golay code formula_33 and Witt design formula_34, which produce a construction of the 196,560 minimal vectors in the Leech lattice. The extended binary Golay code is an extension of the perfect binary Golay code formula_35, which has codewords of size 23. formula_35 has Mathieu group formula_37 as its automorphism group, which is the second largest member of the first generation in the happy family of sporadic groups. formula_37 has a minimum faithful complex representation in 22 dimensions and group-3 actions on 253 objects, with 253 equal to the number of pairs of objects in a set of 23 objects. In turn, formula_37 is the automorphism group of Mathieu group formula_40, which works through formula_34 to generate 8-element &quot;octads&quot; whose individual elements occur 253 times through its entire block design.
* Using Niemer lattice D24 of group order 223·24! and Coxeter number 46 = 2·23, it can be made into a module over the ring of integers of quadratic field formula_42, whereby multiplying D24 by a non-principal ideal of the ring of integers yields the Leech lattice.

Conway and Sloane provided constructions of the Leech lattice from all other 23 Niemeier lattices.

Twenty-three four-dimensional crystal families exist within the classification of space groups. These are accompanied by six enantiomorphic forms, maximizing the total count to twenty-nine crystal families. Five cubes can be arranged to form twenty-three free pentacubes, or twenty-nine distinct &quot;one-sided&quot; pentacubes (with reflections).

There are 23 three-dimensional uniform polyhedra that are cell facets inside uniform 4-polytopes that are not part of infinite families of antiprismatic prisms and duoprisms: the five Platonic solids, the thirteen Archimedean solids, and five semiregular prisms (the triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, and decagonal prisms).

23 Coxeter groups of paracompact hyperbolic honeycombs in the third dimension generate 151 unique Wythoffian constructions of paracompact honeycombs. 23 four-dimensional Euclidean honeycombs are generated from the formula_43 cubic group, and 23 five-dimensional uniform polytopes are generated from the formula_44 demihypercubic group.

In two-dimensional geometry, the regular 23-sided icositrigon is the first regular polygon that is not constructible with a compass and straight edge or with the aide of an angle trisector (since it is neither a Fermat prime nor a Pierpont prime), nor by neusis or a double-notched straight edge. It is also not constructible with origami, however it is through other traditional methods for all regular polygons.

== In religion ==
* In Biblical numerology, it is associated with Psalm 23, also known as the Shepherd Psalm. It is possibly the most quoted and best known Psalm.
* &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, the sacred text of Discordianism, holds that 23 (along with the discordian prime 5) is one of the sacred numbers of Eris, goddess of discord.

== In popular culture ==
=== Film and television ===
* In the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;, 23 is one of the 6 reoccurring numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) that appear frequently throughout the show.

=== Other fields ===

* 23 skidoo (phrase) (sometimes 23 skiddoo) is an American slang phrase popularized during the early 20th century. 23 skidoo has been described as &quot;perhaps the first truly national fad expression and one of the most popular fad expressions to appear in the U.S&quot;.
* The 23 enigma, proposed by William S. Burroughs, plays a prominent role in the plot of &quot;the Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. 
** &quot;The Number 23&quot; is a 2007 film starring Jim Carrey about a man who becomes obsessed with the 23 enigma. 
** The number 23 is used a lot throughout the visuals and music by the band Gorillaz, who have even devoted a whole page of their autobiography &quot;Rise Of The Ogre&quot; to the 23 enigma theory.

<text>25 (twenty-five) is the natural number following 24 and preceding 26.

==In mathematics==
It is a square number, being 52 = 5 × 5, and hence the third non-unitary square prime of the form &quot;p&quot;2.

It is one of two two-digit numbers whose square and higher powers of the number also ends in the same last two digits, e.g., 252 = 625; the other is 76.

25 has an even aliquot sum of 6, which is itself the first even and perfect number root of an aliquot sequence; not ending in (1 and 0).

It is the smallest square that is also a sum of two (non-zero) squares: 25 = 32 + 42. Hence, it often appears in illustrations of the Pythagorean theorem.

25 is the sum of the five consecutive single-digit odd natural numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

25 is a centered octagonal number, a centered square number, a centered octahedral number, and an automorphic number.

25 percent (%) is equal to .

It is the smallest decimal Friedman number as it can be expressed by its own digits: 52.

It is also a Cullen number and a vertically symmetrical number. 25 is the smallest pseudoprime satisfying the congruence 7&quot;n&quot; = 7 mod &quot;n&quot;.

25 is the smallest aspiring number — a composite non-sociable number whose aliquot sequence does not terminate.

According to the Shapiro inequality, 25 is the smallest odd integer &quot;n&quot; such that there exist &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot; such that

:formula_1

where &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;.

Within decimal, one can readily test for divisibility by 25 by seeing if the last two digits of the number match 00, 25, 50, or 75.

There are 25 primes under 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

=== F4, H4 symmetry and lattices Λ24, II25,1 ===

Twenty-five 24-cells with formula_2 symmetry in the fourth dimension can be arranged in two distinct manners, such that

&lt;/math&gt; symmetry can otherwise also be constructed, with cells overlapping.

The 24-cell can be further generated using three copies of the 8-cell, where the 24-cell honeycomb is dual to the 16-cell honeycomb (with the tesseract the dual polytope to the 16-cell).

On the other hand, the positive unimodular lattice formula_3 in twenty-six dimensions is constructed from the Leech lattice in twenty-four dimensions using Weyl vector

:formula_4

that features the only non-trivial solution, i.e. aside from formula_5, to the cannonball problem where sum of the squares of the first twenty-five natural numbers formula_6 in formula_7 is in equivalence with the square of formula_8 (that is the fiftieth composite). The Leech lattice, meanwhile, is constructed in multiple ways, one of which is through copies of the formula_9 lattice in eight dimensions isomorphic to the 600-cell, where twenty-five 24-cells fit; a set of these twenty-five integers can also generate the twenty-fourth triangular number, whose value twice over is formula_10

==In religion==
*In Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of a new temple: The number twenty-five is of cardinal importance in Ezekiel&#x27;s Temple Vision (in the Bible, Ezekiel chapters 40–48).

==In sports==
*In baseball, the number 25 is typically reserved for the best slugger on the team. Examples include Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Jim Thome, and Mark Teixeira.

==In other fields==
Twenty-five is:
* The number of years of marriage marked in a silver wedding anniversary.

<doc id="362206" wikidata="Q286845" url="?curid=362206" title="History of Western Australia">
<text>The human history of Western Australia commenced &quot;over 50,000 years ago and possibly as much as 70,000 years ago&quot; with the arrival of Aboriginal Australians on the northwest coast. The first inhabitants expanded across the east and south of the continent.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616, when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast, having been blown off course while en route to Batavia, current day Jakarta.

Although many expeditions visited the coast during the next 200 years, there was no lasting attempt at establishing a permanent settlement until December 1826. An expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government, led by Major Edmund Lockyer, landed at King George Sound, and founded what became the port city of Albany. On 21 January 1827 Lockyer formally took possession for the British Crown the portion of New Holland not yet claimed by the crown; that is, the portion west of 129th meridian east. This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, which ultimately became the present-day capital, Perth. The harsh conditions faced by the settlers resulted in population growth being minimal until the discovery of gold in the 1880s. Since the gold rush, the population of the state has risen steadily, with substantial growth in the period since World War II.

Western Australia gained the right of self-government in 1890, and joined with the five other states to form the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The desire of Western Australians to revert to complete self-governance, separate from the Commonwealth, culminated in 1933 with a successful referendum for secession supported by 68% of electors. In 1935 the British parliament declined to act since secession would require the assent of the Australian parliament, and the movement lapsed with an improving economy and generous federal grants.

==Aboriginal settlement==
When Australia&#x27;s first inhabitants arrived on the northwest coast 50,000 to 70,000 years ago the sea levels were much lower. The Kimberley coast at one time was only about from Timor, which itself was the last in a line of closely spaced islands for humans to travel across. Therefore, this was a possible (even probable) location for which Australia&#x27;s first peoples could arrive via boat. Other possible immigration routes were via islands further north and then through New Guinea.

In 1999 Charles Dortch identified chert and calcrete flake stone tools, found at Rottnest Island, as possibly dating to at least 50,000 years ago. A 2018 study using archaeobotany dated evidence of continuous human habitation at Karnatukul (Serpent&#x27;s Glen) in the Carnarvon Range in the Little Sandy Desert from around 50,000 years ago.
Over the next tens of thousands of years various groups of Indigenous Australians slowly moved southward and eastward across the landmass. Aboriginal people were well established throughout Western Australia by the time European ships started accidentally arriving en route to Batavia (now Jakarta) in the early 17th century.

==Early visits by Europeans==

The first European to sight Western Australia was the Dutch explorer, Dirk Hartog, the first European to suggest to have found a continent there, who on 26 October 1616 landed at what is now known as Cape Inscription, Dirk Hartog Island. Before departing, Hartog left behind an inscribed pewter plate affixed to a post. In 1696 the plate was discovered and replaced by Willem de Vlamingh and repatriated to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. A multitude of Dutch visits followed during that century, charting virtually the whole of the west coast, the Western Australian south coast and Australia&#x27;s northern coast.

The first English vessel to visit, when attempting to sail the Dutch-established Brouwer Route to the Indies, was &quot;Tryall&quot;, an East India Company-owned East Indiaman under the command of John Brookes who in 1622 sighted Point Cloates before later on 25 May wrecking on Tryal Rocks, off the northwest coast of Australia. Some of the 143 crew remained on the Monte Bello Islands for 7 days, during that time sighting Barrow Island, before sailing to Batavia in a longboat. A second boat brought some more crew to Batavia, so just over 40 people survived, including Brookes. Almost one hundred crew apparently perished in the wreck. &quot;Tryall&quot; became Australia&#x27;s oldest known shipwreck.

A later English visitor was William Dampier, who in 1699 sailed down some of the western coast of Australia. He noted the lack of water and in his description of Shark Bay in his account &quot;A Voyage to New Holland&quot;, he expressed his frustration:
A number of sections of the Western Australian coastline were given names which did not last past the exploratory era in names of features – such as &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;. However some names, such as &quot;&#x27;t Landt van de Leeuwin&quot; (Leeuwin&#x27;s Land), materialised at a later date as Cape Leeuwin.

===Timeline of European discovery and exploration===

Below is a timeline of significant events from the 1616 landfall of Dirk Hartog until the eventual settlement of the Swan River Colony in 1829:
*1616 – Dirk Hartog in &quot;Eendracht&quot; arrived at Cape Inscription and left a pewter plate. Coastal region in the vicinity is shown on Hartog&#x27;s maps as &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;. Believed to be first landfall on Western Australian soil by Europeans. (An earlier 1606 encounter on the northern coast of Australia near Papua New Guinea by Willem Janszoon on &quot;Duyfken&quot; is credited as being the first Australian visit by European explorers.)
*1618 – Dutch East India Company supercargo Willem Janszoon on &quot;Mauritius&quot; landed on North West Cape – although sighting footprints, they did not meet the natives.
*1618 – &quot;Zeewulf&quot; made landfall north of Eendrachtsland.
*1619 – Frederick de Houtman in two ships bound for Batavia encountered dangerous shoals which were subsequently named Houtman Abrolhos. Following successful navigation of the Abrolhos, Houtman made landfall in the region Hartog had encountered.
*1622 – &quot;Leeuwin&quot; landed south of Abrolhos.
*1622 – English ship &quot;Tryall&quot; was wrecked on Tryal Rocks off the northwest coast; survivors spent a week on Monte Bello Islands before sailing to Batavia in a longboat.
*1626 to 1627 – &quot;Gulden Zeepaert&quot; skippered by François Thijssen sailed along south coast towards Great Australian Bight.
*1629 – &quot;Batavia&quot; struck a reef of the Abrolhos. Skipper Francisco Pelsaert sailed the ship&#x27;s small boat to Batavia for rescue. After returning 3 months later, he found evidence of mutiny and many previous survivors murdered.
*1656 – &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot; (Gilt Dragon) en route to Batavia was shipwrecked north of the Swan River near Ledge Point
*1658 – Three Dutch ships visited south coast searching for &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot;: &quot;Waekende Boey&quot; under Captain S. Volckertszoon, &quot;Elburg&quot; under Captain J. Peereboom and &quot;Emeloort&quot; under Captain A. Joncke.
*1681 – English navigator John Daniel on &quot;New London&quot; charted part of the west coast of Australia, including Rottnest Island and the Wallabi Group of Houtman Abrolhos.
*1688 and 1699 – William Dampier in &quot;Cygnet&quot; explored the northwest coastline and sailed down the coast.
*1697 – Willem de Vlamingh found Hartog&#x27;s plate and replaced it with his own. He also explored the Swan River area.
*1712 – &quot;Zuytdorp&quot; with 286 on board was shipwrecked near Kalbarri. The Dutch did not send a search party, probably because no survivors were able to report the disaster. The crew were never heard from again, though it is probable that many initially survived because a campsite was found near the wreck.
*1714 – Jean-Pierre Pury proposed a Dutch East India Company settlement of Nuyts, Leeuwin and Edels Lands.
*1772 – On 30 March, Frenchman Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn landed at Turtle Bay at the northern end of Dirk Hartog Island and claimed the island for France.
*1786 – King Gustav III of Sweden makes a contract with William Bolts to establish a colony at the Swan River.
*1791 – George Vancouver made formal claim at Possession Point, King George Sound, Albany.
*1792 – Frenchman Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux in charge of &quot;Recherche&quot; and &quot;Esperance&quot; reached Cape Leeuwin on 5 December and explored eastward along the southern coast.
*1801 – The French ships &quot;Géographe&quot; and &quot;Naturaliste&quot; under Nicolas Baudin and Emmanuel Hamelin, explored much of the coast north from Cape Leeuwin, including the Swan River. They discovered de Vlamingh&#x27;s plate.
*1801 – Matthew Flinders on HMS &quot;Investigator&quot; sighted Cape Leeuwin en route to charting of southern Australian coastline.
*1803 – Matthew Flinders completed the first circumnavigation of Australia
*1803 – &quot;Géographe&quot; and another French ship followed much of the same coastline again on the way back to France.
*1818 – Louis de Freycinet found de Vlamingh&#x27;s plate and removed it to France.
*1826 – On 26 October, Frenchman Dumont d&#x27;Urville in another ship named &quot;Astrolabe&quot; visited King George Sound before sailing along the south coast to Port Jackson.
*1826 – On 26 December, a military garrison was established on behalf of New South Wales at King George Sound with the arrival of Major Edmund Lockyer on &quot;Amity&quot;. 
*1827 – On 21 January, Lockyer formally annexed the western portion of Australia, now Western Australia, in a ceremony at King George Sound. 
*1829 – James Stirling explored the Swan River area. Captain Charles Fremantle again took possession of the western side of New Holland for the British crown on 2 May.

== Colonial era ==
===King George Sound===

The first formal claim of possession for Great Britain was made on 29 September 1791 by Commander (later Captain) George Vancouver RN, on a spot he named &quot;Possession Point&quot;, at the tip of the peninsula between the waters he also named &quot;Princess Royal Harbour&quot; and &quot;King George the Third&#x27;s Sound&quot; at Albany (&quot;the Third&quot; was dropped from the name in 1826).

In the early 19th century, the British became concerned about the possibility of a French colony being established on the west coast of Australia. In 1826, the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, ordered the establishment of a settlement at King George&#x27;s Sound. An army detachment was sent from Sydney headed by Major Edmund Lockyer with eighteen soldiers, one captain, one doctor, one storekeeper and twenty-three convicts.

On 21 January 1827, the whole of Australia was claimed as British territory for the first time when Major Lockyer formally annexed the western portion of the continent in a ceremony on King George Sound.

In March 1831, the penal settlement was withdrawn, and the control of King George&#x27;s Sound was transferred from New South Wales to the Swan River Colony. Captain James Stirling decreed that the settlement would be named &quot;Albany&quot; from 1 January 1832.

===The Swan River Colony===
The first documented European settlements were established at the Swan River by James Stirling in 1829. The colonists first sighted land on 1 June, arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 June, an official proclamation was made on 18 June and the foundation of the colony took place on 12 August. As Lieutenant Governor, Stirling had sole authority to draft laws and decide day-to-day affairs. On 6 February 1832, the colony was renamed Western Australia.

Major towns of the colony developed slowly into the port city of Fremantle, the main settlement of Perth upriver, and Guildford.

===Expansion 1829–1850===
Much of the land around the Swan River Colony was unsuitable for agriculture and it was inevitable that the colony would have to expand beyond the Swan River area after the most fertile locations were quickly settled.

Sheep farming was the most successful early agricultural activity, and the basis of all expansion until the 1850s.


*1829: A military outpost was founded at Bunbury.
*1829: The British Parliament passes the (10 Geo. 4. c. 22) on 14 May. It allowed the Crown to appoint three or more people, by Order in Council, to jointly make laws for the colony. All laws were to be laid before Parliament as soon as practically possible after their passing. It was only valid initially for five years.
*1830: Area around Augusta settled.
*1830: The first exploration over the Darling Range to search for suitable farming land occurred with the settlement of the Avon Valley and the foundation of the town of York in 1831. 
*1832
** The main settlement is officially named &quot;Perth&quot;, after Sir George Murray&#x27;s seat in Perthshire, Scotland.
** First sitting of the Western Australian Legislative Council, consisting of four officials appointed by Stirling to assist him in decision-making.
*1833: On 5 January, the first newspaper, the &quot;Perth Gazette&quot; was launched.
*1833: Relations between the Europeans and Aboriginal people were not always amicable with many intercultural skirmishes. Yagan, a senior warrior of the local Aboriginal tribe near the Swan River was killed on 11 July of this year after a bounty was issued for his capture following the murder of a couple of settlers.
*1834: Pinjarra Massacre (sometimes still called &quot;Battle of Pinjarra&quot;): This was the worst intercultural conflict, happening on 28 October. Depending on the source, the death toll ranged from 10 to 150 adults and children.
*1836: settlement in the Toodyay region. 
*1837–39: George Grey explored the coasts of:
** the North West (1837)
** Gascoyne and Murchison (1839)
* 1839: another four members, drawn from the ranks of private settlers, were added to the official members of the Legislative Council.
*1841: Explorer Edward John Eyre arrives in Albany walking across the Nullarbor Plain from the eastern states. In Wonnerup near Busselton, settler George Layman Sr of Wonnerup House was speared to death by a Wardandi elder.
*1843: Census recorded the population of Western Australia as 3,842.
*1844: 15-year-old John Gavina childwas the first European legally hanged in the colony, for the murder of 18-year-old George Pollard.
*1849: First discovery of gold occurred in the Jimperding-Toodyay area.

=== Convict era ===

While Western Australia was initially a &quot;free settlement&quot;, economic problems for settler capitalists led them to seek the transportation of British convicts. Western Australia became a penal colony in 1850.

The Gregory brothers led major exploration expeditions to many parts of the colony, including:
*1851: Augustus Gregory surveys the Greenough region near Geraldton and that area opens up to farming.
*1861: Francis Gregory explores the interior of the Nickol Bay region (known later as the Pilbara).

By 1859, all the other Australian colonies had their own parliaments and colonists in Western Australia began pushing for the right to govern themselves. The British Colonial Office opposed this because of the slow rate of growth and the presence of convicts. Petitions asking for some of the positions in the Legislative Council to be filled by elected members were presented to London twice during the 1860s.

By 1868, over 9,000 convicts had been transported to Western Australia on 43 convict ship voyages, outnumbering the 7300 settlers in the colony at the time.

===Expansion 1861–1885===
Wool production, usually on large stations, was also the basis of expansion further east and northward.

The first permanent European settlements in the North West (later divided into the Pilbara and Kimberley regions) took place in the mid-1860s, initially at the Harding River, De Grey River and Roebourne (gazetted in 1867). Pearling also came to dominate the North West, initially in Nickol Bay, with a fleet at Tien Tsin Harbor (later renamed Cossack). In the North West, unlike southern Western Australia, the labour force was dominated by Indigenous Australians, often under harsh forms of unfree labour.

In 1870, some members of the Legislative Council were elected for the first time, although only male settlers with significant property could vote and the Governor could still veto the council&#x27;s decisions.

John Forrest led two major expeditions:
*1870 – retracing Edward John Eyre&#x27;s land route from Perth to Adelaide, as the route of a telegraph line;
*1874 – leading a party to the watershed of the Murchison River and then eastward into the Central Desert.

In 1872, controversial explorer Peter Egerton Warburton made a journey from Alice Springs to the Western Australian coast.

Ernest Giles twice traversed the Gibson Desert between 1872 and 1876.

During the 1870s, the Murchison and Gascoyne regions were also settled by Europeans.

;Other notable events
*1877: The telegraph from Adelaide to Perth was completed, considerably improving intracontinental communication
*1883: Durack family settle around the Ord River in the East Kimberley.

=== Gold discoveries, 1885–1900 ===
Until the 1880s the economy of the state was based largely on wool and wheat. A major change in the colony&#x27;s fortunes occurred in 1885 when gold was discovered and prospectors by the tens of thousands swarmed across the land in a desperate attempt to discover new goldfields.

In 1887 a new constitution, including proposals for responsible government, was drafted and sent to London by Governor Broome for approval. It was argued that due to the increasing wealth being generated by gold rushes, Western Australia should become a self-governing colony. An Act granting self-government was passed by the British Parliament in 1890, giving the Colony independence from the UK in matters other than foreign policy, defence and &quot;native affairs&quot;. Section 70 of the self-government act established an Aborigines Protection Board, under the control of the British Parliament, not the Western Australian one. Governor Broome had earlier warned the British Colonial Office that Western Australians could not to be trusted in matters relating to Aboriginal persons. A further clause to the constitution stated that 5,000 pounds or one percent of state revenues, whichever was the greater, was to be allocated to Aboriginal persons for their welfare and advancement. Many settlers resented these clauses, and Western Australia has never honoured this clause to its own constitution. A previous Governor, Sir William Robinson, was re-appointed to supervise the change. He travelled by train from Albany to Perth and towns en route lit bonfires and people gathered at railway sidings to celebrate his arrival and the new constitution. His arrival in Perth on 21 October 1890 saw the city decorated with elaborate floral arches spanning the city&#x27;s main streets and buildings were decked with banners and flags.

In 1891 the rush to the Murchison goldfields began when Tom Cue discovered gold at the town which now bears his name. In the years that followed dozens of gold towns – Day Dawn, Nannine, Peak Hill, Garden Gully, Dead Finish, Pinnicles, Austin Island and Austin Mainland – flourished only to be abandoned when the seams were exhausted and the gold fever moved on.

The influx of miners from the eastern colonies and from overseas increased the presence of trade unions in Western Australia. The Trades and Labor Council, Perth was established in 1891 and Perth Trades Hall opened (1912). The first edition of the &quot;Westralian Worker&quot; appeared on 7 September 1900 and was followed shortly afterwards by the opening of the Kalgoorlie Trades Hall, the first such hall in Western Australia. A Trades Hall was opened in Fremantle in 1904.

An influx of people from Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania led to Australian rules football becoming the dominant football code when several local rugby football clubs switched codes.

John Forrest – the first Premier of Western Australia and its only premier as a colony – clashed with Robinson over section 70. While Forrest had argued that Western Australians should accept section 70 to obtain self-government, by 1892 he was attempting to have it changed. William Traylen argued that
Discoveries at Coolgardie (1892) and Paddy Hannan&#x27;s discovery at Kalgoorlie (1893) sparked true gold fever. Coolgardie prospered particularly well, becoming the third largest town in the colony after Perth and Fremantle.

Gold inspired a new wave of exploration, including David Carnegie who, in 1896, led an epic expedition that travelled through the deserts north of Coolgardie, through the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts to Halls Creek in the Kimberley, before returning to Coolgardie.

In the late 19th century there was talk of the gold-rich region around Kalgoorlie seceding from Western Australia, as a colony or state called &quot;Auralia&quot;. This campaign coincided with the reluctance in Perth regarding Western Australia taking part in Australian Federation. Talk of miners&#x27; separation and them taking their wealth elsewhere was seen as a threat to the stability of the colony.

In 1899, Forrest succeeded unilaterally passing the Constitution Amendment Act, taking control of Aboriginal Affairs without approval of the British House of Commons. Many Aboriginal people argue that the 1899 amendment was an illegal usurpation of British government power and one percent of accumulated Government revenues should be set aside for Aboriginal welfare, as intended.

; Other notable events
*1887: On 22 April, a cyclone struck the pearling fleet at Eighty Mile Beach near Broome claiming 140 lives. The storm was unexpected, being so late in the season.
*1889: The Great Southern Railway was opened with subsequent economic growth to the regions along the line. The wheat industry did not really get going until the construction of railways. A railway line had reached Coolgardie (from Perth) by 1896.
*1895: Kings Park was officially opened on 10 August.
*1897: As part of the Western Australian Government&#x27;s attempt to gain control of Aboriginal affairs, the &quot;Aborigines Act 1897&quot; abolished the Aborigines Protection Board and established the Aborigines Department.
*1897: Fremantle Inner Harbour was officially opened after dredging and construction under the supervision of O&#x27;Connor.

==Federation of Australia==

On 1 January 1901, following a proclamation by Queen Victoria, Western Australia, along with the other five British colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria, formed the federation of the Commonwealth of Australia, of which they each became component states. However, Western Australia was reluctant to join the union, doing so only after they were offered a five-year transitional period on inter-state tariffs and a transcontinental railway line.

==Development during the early twentieth century==
The wealth generated from gold soon disappeared and by the early years of the 20th century, the economy was once again dependent on wool and wheat. This dependency meant that a dramatic fall in wool and wheat prices in the late 1920s – early 1930s saw the state&#x27;s economic collapse. It was not to recover until after World War II when the Federal Government&#x27;s postwar immigration policy saw a huge influx of migrants, nearly all of them from Europe, in the period 1947 to 1970.

Important events in Western Australia included the following:
*1902: The Premier, George Leake, died suddenly on 24 June aged 45. Frederick Illingworth became the caretaker Premier for a week before Walter James formed a new ministry on 1 July. George Leake is the only Western Australian Premier to die in office.
*1903: A pipeline from Mundaring Weir to Kalgoorlie is opened. This was a major achievement for its time by the state&#x27;s first engineer-in-chief C. Y. O&#x27;Connor, who committed suicide before the project was complete.
*1904: John Drayton is imprisoned under parliamentary privilege provisions in Western Australia for refusing to pay a fine. This is the first and, until 1955, only, time that an Australian parliament punished somebody under parliamentary privilege provisions.
*1911: The University of Western Australia becomes Western Australia&#x27;s second tertiary institution and first university. No teaching happens until 1913 though. It wasn&#x27;t until 1975 that Western Australia&#x27;s second university, Murdoch University opened.
*1912: A cyclone crossed the coast just west of Balla Balla near Port Hedland and claimed well over 150 lives. This was almost certainly Australia&#x27;s worst weather-related maritime disaster of the 20th century with the loss of the coastal steamer &quot;Koombana&quot;.
*1916: First of two referendums on overseas conscription in World War I. Western Australia is an outlier in the vote, with 69.7% of voters voting in favour, in contrast to only 48.4% nationwide.
*1917: Second referendum on overseas conscription in World War I. 64.4% of Western Australian voters vote in favour, while only 46.2% of Australian voters overall do so.
*1917: The transcontinental railway is complete, fulfilling a promise by the Federal Government when the Colony of Western Australia voted to become a state of Australia at Federation in 1901. Construction of this last leg between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta had begun in 1912.
*1920: Edward, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) was involved in a train derailment, in which his carriage overturned in the state&#x27;s south west. The train was moving at a low speed and he did not sustain any injuries.
*1921: State premier James Mitchell launches the Group Settlement Scheme in the aim of establishing a viable dairy industry in the state&#x27;s south-west. A 1923 Migration Agreement between the state, the Commonwealth and the British Government committed to settling 6,000 men on 6,000 farms within a five-year period.
*1920: Western Australia passed legislation allowing women to stand for parliament, Edith Cowan was elected to the Legislative Assembly becoming the first woman elected to any Australian parliament.
*1928: The Aboriginal deputation to the state premier by brothers William and Edward Harris to protest over injustices experienced by Aboriginal Western Australians.
*1929: Western Australia Centenary.
*1930: Perth is connected to Adelaide (and subsequently the rest of the eastern states) by a telephone line.

*In a referendum in 1933, 68% of voters favoured secession. The Premier, Philip Collier, argued in London for secession but the British decided they could not grant it.
*1935: The Lacepede Islands near Broome were struck by a cyclone, which sank 21 pearling luggers with 141 lives lost. This was Australia&#x27;s second deadliest cyclone in the 20th century.

==World War II==
*1941: Battle between HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; and the German raiding ship &quot;Kormoran&quot; off the coast near Carnarvon. Both ships sank, and the entire crew of 645 onboard &quot;Sydney&quot; was lost.
*1942: Japanese planes attack Broome. The official death toll was 88. The settlements of Wyndham, Derby, Port Hedland and the Drysdale River Mission (Kalumburu) also experienced casualties.
*1942–1945: Japanese occupation of Christmas Island, now one of two Australian Indian Ocean Territories.

==Postwar era (1946–1970s)==
*1946: Over 800 Aboriginal workers took part in the 1946 Pilbara strike, the first such kind of action taken by Indigenous Australians.
*1947: Western Australia enters the country&#x27;s domestic cricket competition, the &quot;Sheffield Shield&quot;. Though Western Australia only entered on a probationary basis, it managed to win the shield in its first season.
*1949: Douglas DC-3 &quot;Fitzroy&quot; crashed after take-off from Guildford aerodrome, killing all 18 people on board.
*1950: The worst civil aircraft accident in Australian history occurred when all 29 people on board the Douglas DC-4 &quot;Amana&quot; died after it crashed near York on a flight from Perth to Adelaide.
*1952: On 3 October the first nuclear bomb was exploded on Australian soil at the Montebello Islands. It was part of Operation Hurricane, Britain&#x27;s first-ever nuclear weapon test.
*February–March 1961: In arguably Western Australia&#x27;s worst bushfires, many small communities were destroyed including 132 houses in Dwellingup. There were no fatalities, but 800 people were left homeless.
*1961: Minerals boom begins with the removal of iron ore export ban. The economy is bolstered over the next two decades by nickel mines around Kalgoorlie and iron ore mines in the north-west.
*1962: Aboriginal people granted full rights to vote.
*1962: John Glenn passes over Rockingham as part of a NASA manned spaceflight mission Mercury-Atlas 6. Residents of the Perth area had turned on lights in households and businesses in an attempt to illuminate the city as much as possible. They succeeded, and Glenn referred to Perth as the &quot;City of Light&quot;, a nickname he reiterated again when he passed over the city a second time as part of STS-95 in 1998.
*1964: Serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke was the last person hanged in Western Australia.
*1964: On 31 December, Donald Campbell broke the world water speed record in the &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; on Lake Dumbleyung. He reached . Campbell died in the same vehicle in 1967 in a later record attempt in England.

<text>Alexander Martin Lippisch (2 November 1894 – 11 February 1976) was a German aeronautical engineer, a pioneer of aerodynamics who made important contributions to the understanding of tailless aircraft, delta wings and the ground effect, and also worked in the U.S. Within the Opel-RAK program, he was the designer of the world&#x27;s first rocket-powered glider.

He developed and conceptualized delta wing designs which functioned practically in supersonic delta wing fighter aircraft as well as in hang gliders. People he worked with continued the development of the delta wing and supersonic flight concepts over the 20th century. His most famous designs are the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered interceptor and the Dornier Aerodyne.

==Early life==
Lippisch was born in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. He later recalled that his interest in aviation began with a demonstration conducted by Orville Wright over Tempelhof Field in Berlin in September 1909. Nonetheless, he planned to follow his father&#x27;s footsteps into art school, until the outbreak of World War I intervened. During his service with the German Army, between 1915 and 1918, Lippisch had the chance to fly being an aerial photographer and mapper.

==Early aircraft designs==
Following the war, Lippisch worked with the Zeppelin Company, and it was at this time that he first became interested in tailless aircraft. In 1921, his first design to be built, by his friend Gottlob Espenlaub, was the Espenlaub E-2 glider. This was the beginning of a research programme that would result in some fifty designs throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Lippisch&#x27;s growing reputation saw him appointed in 1925 to director of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG), a glider organisation including research groups and construction facilities.

Lippisch also designed conventional gliders at this time, including the Wien of 1927 and its successor the Fafnir of 1930. In 1928, partaking in the Opel-RAK program by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, Lippisch&#x27;s tail-first Ente (&quot;Duck&quot;) was equipped with powder rockets by Friedrich Wilhelm Sander&#x27;s company and became the first aircraft to fly under rocket power. From 1927, he resumed his tailless work, leading to a series of designs named Storch I – Storch IX (Stork I-IX), mostly gliders. These designs attracted little interest from the government and private industry.

==Delta wing designs==
Experience with the Storch series led Lippisch to develop what he called his Delta designs. Like the Storch series, these were mostly tailless aircraft. They included the earliest successful delta wing designs. In 1931 the Delta I glider became the first to fly. It was followed by the Delta II and III.

The Delta IV design was powered, and built in two variants as the Fieseler F3 Wespe. Lippisch subsequently designated these the Delta IVa and b, with the c being built as the DFS 39. The development of this led directly to the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet (see next section), which Lippisch has also referred to as the Delta IVd.

The Delta V, built as the DFS 40 was a blended wing body design for comparison with the DFS 39. 

In 1933, the RGG was reorganised into the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (German Institute for Sailplane Flight, &quot;DFS&quot;) and the Delta IVd and Delta V were designated as the DFS 39 and DFS 40 respectively. Lippisch thus saw five designs built, numbered Delta I to V, between 1931 and 1939.

Subsequently, while at Messerschmitt, he began work on a Delta VI design. It became attached to various Messerschmitt projects, and a prototype was under construction when it was destroyed in a bombing raid.

==World War II projects==
In early 1939, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtsministerium&quot; (RLM, Reich Aviation Ministry) transferred Lippisch and his team to work at the Messerschmitt factory in Augsburg, in order to design a high-speed fighter aircraft around the rocket engines then under development by Hellmuth Walter. The team quickly adapted their most recent design, the DFS 194, to rocket power, the first example successfully flying in early 1940. This successfully demonstrated the technology for what would become the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet.

Although technically novel, the Komet did not prove to be a successful weapon and friction between Lippisch and Messerschmitt was frequent. In 1943, Lippisch transferred to Vienna&#x27;s Aeronautical Research Institute (&quot;Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt Wien&quot;, &quot;LFW&quot;) in Wiener Neustadt, in an own design bureau to concentrate on the problems of high-speed flight. That same year, he was awarded a doctoral degree in engineering by the University of Heidelberg. With him came the mathematician Hermann Behrbohm on half time (and continued half time for Messerschmitt in Oberammergau to where the development activities were moved into the underground facility after the 25 February 1944 air raids on Augsburg).

Wind tunnel research in 1939 had suggested that the delta wing was a good choice for supersonic flight, and Lippisch set to work designing a supersonic, ramjet-powered fighter, the Lippisch P.13a. By the time the war ended, however, the project had only advanced as far as a development glider, the DM-1.

===Importance for the delta wing and supersonic flight concepts===
Even though the Lippisch P.13a never flew, it and Lippisch&#x27;s research and development had a significant importance for the development of the delta wing and supersonic flight concepts and supersonic delta wing fighter aircraft. Lippisch&#x27;s delta wing concept proved to be very steady and efficient in very high speed supersonic flight.

This 1950s government-funded development (like that enabled by the Swedish Defence Act of 1958) was intended for swift attack of strategic nuclear weapons bombers such as the Tupolev Tu-16 before they reached their targets.

The research of the Messerschmitt and Lippisch offices were continued by:
* Hermann Behrbohm worked for the BEE (French Aerodynamic Research and Development Institute) from 1946 on with operations in Emmendingen and Weil am Rhein in the French occupation zone in Germany. His research was used in the later French developedment of the Dassault Mirage. 
* Hermann Behrbohm worked for Saab, Linköping, Sweden from 1951 on, where he made significant contributions to the Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen supersonic-delta wing-fighter aircraft, developing the delta wing and supersonic flight concepts. Bertil Dillner worked on the concepts with Behrbohm at Saab. 
* Bertil Dillner immigrated to the US in 1967 and started working for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle at the supersonic Boeing 2707 SST passenger jet in 1967-1972 and the aerodynamics of hypersonic aviation at the re-entry of the Space Shuttle. Dillner was chief aerodynamic engineer at Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1972 to 1981. Dillner became aerodynamic chief engineer 1981-1985 for Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security in Seattle and chief engineer 1985-1988 until his retirement.

==Postwar work in the United States==
Like many German scientists, Lippisch was taken to the United States after the war under Operation Paperclip. He worked at the White Sands Missile Range.

===Ground effect aircraft===
From 1950 to 1964, Lippisch worked for the Collins Radio Company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which had an aeronautical division. It was during this time that his interest shifted toward ground effect craft. The result was an aerofoil boat research seaplane X-112, flown in 1963. However, Lippisch contracted cancer, and resigned from Collins.

When he recovered in 1966, he formed his own research company, Lippisch Research Corporation, and attracted the interest of the West German government. Prototypes for both the aerodyne and the ground-effect craft RFB X-113 (1970) then RFB X-114 (1977) were built, but no further development was undertaken. The Kiekhaefer Mercury company was also interested in his ground-effect craft and successfully tested one of his designs as the Aeroskimmer, but also eventually lost interest.

===Aerodyne===
Lippisch conceived of a VTOL craft which he called an &quot;aerodyne&quot;. Its fuselage comprised a large ducted rotor, and the thrust could be varied between downwards for vertical takeoff and landing, and backwards for forward flight. He worked principally with two companies in its development.

The Collins Aerodyne, developed while he was there, had a horizontal-axis rotor with the efflux directed via large flaps located immediately behind it. The craft was stabilised by a long, high tail running back from above the flaps.

The Dornier Aerodyne was a smaller drone which sat vertically for takeoff and landing, and the whole craft rotated horizontally for forward flight.

Neither type got beyond the prototype stage.

==Death and legacy==
Lippisch died in Cedar Rapids on 11 February 1976. In 1985, he was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<doc id="362209" wikidata="Q3085185" url="?curid=362209" title="Contact breaker">
<text>A contact breaker (or &quot;points&quot;) is a type of electrical switch, found in the ignition systems of spark-ignition internal combustion engines. The switch is automatically operated by a cam driven by the engine. The timing of operation of the switch is set so that a spark is produced at the right time to ignite the compressed air/fuel mixture in the cylinder of the engine. A mechanism may be provided to slightly adjust timing to allow for varying load on the engine. Since these contacts operate frequently, they are subject to wear, causing erratic ignition of the engine. More recent engines use electronic means to trigger the spark, which eliminated contact wear and allows computer control of ignition timing.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the contact breaker is to interrupt the current flowing in the primary winding of the ignition coil. When the current stops flowing, the resulting collapse of the magnetic field in the primary winding induces a high voltage in the secondary winding. This causes a very high voltage to appear at the coil output for a short period—enough to arc across the electrodes of a spark plug.

==Operation==
The contact breaker is operated by an engine-driven cam. On an engine with a distributor, the contact breaker can be found beneath the distributor cap. The position of the contact breaker is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the optimum moment to ignite the fuel/air mixture. This point is generally just before the piston reaches the top of its compression stroke. The contact breaker is often mounted on a plate that is able to rotate relative to the camshaft operating it. The plate is most typically rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus advancing the ignition timing (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions. This gives the fuel ignition process time to proceed so that the resulting combustion reaches its maximum pressure at the proper point in the crankshaft&#x27;s rotation.

Many engines are also fitted with a manifold vacuum-operated servomechanism to provide additional rotation of the plate&#x27;s position (within limits), in order to advance the timing when the engine is required to speed up on demand. Advancing the ignition timing helps to prevent pre-ignition (or pinging).

==Disadvantages of contact breakers==
Since they open and close so often (several times with every turn of the engine on distributor-equipped engines), contact breaker points and cam followers can suffer from wear—both mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breaker—this is often referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the coil output by creating a resonant LC circuit with the coil windings.

A drawback of using a mechanical switch as part of the ignition timing is that it is not very precise, needs regular adjustment of the dwell (contact) angle, and at higher revolutions, its mass becomes significant, leading to poor operation at higher engine speeds. These effects can largely be overcome using electronic ignition systems, where the contact breakers are retrofitted by a magnetic (Hall effect) or optical sensor device. However, because of their simplicity, and since contact breaker points gradually degrade instead of catastrophically failing, they are still used on aircraft engines.

<text>29 (twenty-nine) is the natural number following 28 and preceding 30. It is a prime number.

29 is the number of days February has on a leap year.

==Mathematics==
29 is the tenth prime number. 

=== Integer properties ===

29 is the fifth primorial prime, like its twin prime 31.

29 is the smallest positive whole number that cannot be made from the numbers formula_1, using each digit exactly once and using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. None of the first twenty-nine natural numbers have more than two different prime factors (in other words, this is the longest such consecutive sequence; the first sphenic number or triprime, 30 is the product of the first three primes 2, 3, and 5). 29 is also,

* the sum of three consecutive squares, 22 + 32 + 42.
* the sixth Sophie Germain prime.
* a Lucas prime, a Pell prime, and a tetranacci number.
* an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form 3n − 1.
* a Markov number, appearing in the solutions to &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot; = 3&quot;xyz&quot;: {2, 5, 29}, {2, 29, 169}, {5, 29, 433}, {29, 169, 14701}, etc.
* a Perrin number, preceded in the sequence by 12, 17, 22.
* the number of pentacubes if reflections are considered distinct.
* the tenth supersingular prime.

On the other hand, 29 represents the sum of the first cluster of consecutive semiprimes with distinct prime factors (14, 15). These two numbers are the only numbers whose arithmetic mean of divisors is the first perfect number and unitary perfect number, 6 (that is also the smallest semiprime with distinct factors). The pair (14, 15) is also the first floor and ceiling values of imaginary parts of non-trivial zeroes in the Riemann zeta function, formula_2

29 is the largest prime factor of the smallest number with an abundancy index of 3, 

:1018976683725 = 33 × 52 × 72 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 

It is also the largest prime factor of the smallest abundant number not divisible by the first even (of only one) and odd primes, 5391411025 = 52 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29. Both of these numbers are divisible by consecutive prime numbers ending in 29.

==== 15 and 290 theorems ====

The 15 and 290 theorems describes integer-quadratic matrices that describe all positive integers, by the set of the first fifteen integers, or equivalently, the first two-hundred and ninety integers. Alternatively, a more precise version states that an integer quadratic matrix represents all positive integers when it contains the set of &quot;twenty-nine&quot; integers between 1 and 290:

:formula_3

The largest member 290 is the product between 29 and its index in the sequence of prime numbers, 10. The largest member in this sequence is also the twenty-fifth even, square-free sphenic number with three distinct prime numbers formula_4 as factors, and the fifteenth such that formula_5 is prime (where in its case, 2 + 5 + 29 + 1 = 37).

=== Dimensional spaces ===

The 29th dimension is the highest dimension for compact hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes that are bounded by a fundamental polyhedron, and the highest dimension that holds arithmetic discrete groups of reflections with &quot;noncompact&quot; unbounded fundamental polyhedra.

<text>28 (twenty-eight) is the natural number following 27 and preceding 29.

==In mathematics==

Twenty-eight is a composite number and the second perfect number as it is the sum of its proper divisors: formula_1. As a perfect number, it is related to the Mersenne prime 7, since formula_2. The next perfect number is 496, the previous being 6.

Though perfect, 28 is not the aliquot sum of any other number other than itself; thus, it is not part of a multi-number aliquot sequence. The next perfect number is 496.

Twenty-eight is the sum of the totient function for the first nine integers.

Since the greatest prime factor of formula_3 is 157, which is more than 28 twice, 28 is a Størmer number.

Twenty-eight is a harmonic divisor number, a happy number, the 7th triangular number, a hexagonal number, a Leyland number of the second kind (formula_4), and a centered nonagonal number.

It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 12, 16, 21 (it is the sum of the first two of these).

It is also a Keith number, because it recurs in a Fibonacci-like sequence started from its decimal digits: 2, 8, 10, 18, 28...

There are 28 convex uniform honeycombs.

Twenty-eight is the only positive integer that has a unique Kayles nim-value.

Twenty-eight is the only known number that can be expressed as a sum of the first positive integers (formula_5), a sum of the first primes (formula_6), and a sum of the first nonprimes (formula_7), and it is unlikely that any other number has this property.

There are twenty-eight oriented diffeomorphism classes of manifolds homeomorphic to the 7-sphere.

There are 28 non-equivalent ways of expressing 1000 as the sum of two prime numbers.

Twenty-eight is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of four nonzero squares in (at least) three ways: formula_8, formula_9 or formula_10 (see image).

==In science==
* The fourth magic number in physics.

==In other fields==
Twenty-eight is:
* Deriving from the 29.46 year period of Saturn&#x27;s revolution around the Sun, the 28-year cycle as well as its subdivisions by 14 and 7 are supposed in astrology to mark significant turning points or sections in the course of a person&#x27;s development in life. Thus, the number 28 has special significance in the culture of religious sects such as the Kadiri and the Mevlevi dervishes. The 28-beat metric pattern often used in the music compositions accompanying the main part of the Mevlevi sema ritual is called the &quot;Devri kebir&quot;, meaning the &quot;Big Circle&quot; and is a reference to above astronomical facts about the year and the Saturn year.
* In Quebec, François Pérusse, in one of his best-selling Album du peuple made a parody of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in which all of the letters picked by the contestant were present 28 times. As a result, 28 became an almost mythical number used by many Quebec youths, the phrase &quot;Y&#x27;en a 28&quot; (There are 28 [Letters]) became a running gag still used and recognized more than 15 years later.
* Approximately the number of grams in an ounce, and used as such in the illegal drug trade.

<text>Dallas McCord &quot;Mack&quot; Reynolds (November 11, 1917 – January 30, 1983) was an American science fiction writer. His pen names included Dallas Ross, Mark Mallory, Clark Collins, Dallas Rose, Guy McCord, Maxine Reynolds, Bob Belmont, and Todd Harding. His work focused on socioeconomic speculation, usually expressed in thought-provoking explorations of utopian societies from a radical, sometime satiric perspective. He was a popular author from the 1950s to the 1970s, especially with readers of science fiction and fantasy magazines.

Reynolds was the first author to write an original novel based upon the 1966–1969 NBC television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The book, &quot;Mission to Horatius&quot; (1968), was aimed at young readers.

==Biography==
Reynolds was born in Corcoran, California, the second of four children of Verne La Rue Reynolds and Pauline McCord. When the family moved to Baltimore in 1918, his father joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) so that from an early age Reynolds was raised to accept the tenets of Marxism and socialism. (&quot;I was born into a Marxian Socialist family. I am the child who, at the age of five or six, said to his parent, &#x27;Mother, who is Comrade Jesus Christ?&#x27; —for I had never met anyone in that household who wasn&#x27;t called Comrade.&quot;) In 1935, while still in high school in Kingston, New York, Reynolds joined the SLP and became an active advocate of the party&#x27;s goals. The following year, he toured the country with his father giving lectures and speeches, and became recognized as a significant force in advocating the SLP.

After graduating from high school, Reynolds worked as a reporter for the &quot;Catskill Morning Star&quot; from 1937–38 and as editor of the weekly &quot;Oneonta News&quot; from 1939–40. In 1937, he married his first wife, Evelyn Sandell, with whom he had three children, Emil, La Verne, and Dallas Mack Jr. From 1940 to 1943 Reynolds worked for IBM at the San Pedro, California Shipyards. He also worked actively as an organizer for the SLP, campaigning with SLP presidential candidate John W. Aiken in 1940. After attending the U.S. Army Marine Officer&#x27;s Cadet School and the U.S. Marine Officer&#x27;s School, he joined the U.S. Army Transportation Corps in 1944 and was stationed in the Philippines as a ship&#x27;s navigator until 1945. Upon returning home from the Corps, Reynolds learned that Evelyn had become involved with another man. They divorced and she took their children with her.

From 1946–49, Reynolds worked as a national organizer for the SLP. In 1946, he made his first fiction sale, &quot;What is Courage?&quot;, to &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. A year later, he met a woman who shared his radical politics, Helen Jeanette Wooley. They were married in September 1947, and Jeanette agreed to support Reynolds for two years while he pursued a career as a writer for the detective pulps. After searching for a place with a low cost of living, they moved to Taos, New Mexico, where Reynolds met science fiction writers Walt Sheldon and Fredric Brown. Brown, later one of Reynolds&#x27; frequent collaborators, convinced Reynolds to shift from writing detective stories to writing science fiction. Reynolds&#x27; first sale of a science fiction story, &quot;Last Warning&quot; (also known as &quot;The Galactic Ghost&quot;), sold to &quot;Planet Stories&quot; in June 1949 but was not printed until 1954. His first published science fiction story, &quot;Isolationist&quot; appeared in &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot; in June 1950. His career soon took off, resulting in a sale of 18 stories in 1950 alone. In 1951, he published his first novel, &quot;The Case of the Little Green Men&quot;, a mix of the murder-mystery and science fiction genres that became &quot;an instant classic of science-fiction-fan related fiction.&quot;

In 1953, the Reynoldses moved to San Miguel de Allende, in Guanajuato, Mexico, where they lived for only eighteen months before embarking on a journey through Europe and the East that lasted almost ten years and included stays in Greece, Yugoslavia, Algeria, Morocco, Spain, Eastern Europe, Finland, India, Japan, and Hong Kong. In 1955, Reynolds became a correspondent for &quot;Rogue&quot; magazine and began making money writing about his travels as well as from his science fiction stories, whose socioeconomic speculations now reflected the insights gained from his encounters with other cultures. In 1958, he became a choice writer for John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, remaining its &quot;most prolific contributor&quot; for the next ten years. The same year, the publication of &quot;How to Retire without Money&quot;, to which Reynolds contributed under the byline Bob Belmont, led the National Executive Committee of the SLP to charge Reynolds with &quot;supporting the fraudulent claims of capitalist apologists, viz, that capitalism offers countless opportunities to those who are &#x27;alert&#x27;&quot; and caused Reynolds to resign his membership from the SLP.

The 1960s saw some of Reynolds&#x27; best work, including the short stories &quot;Revolution,&quot; &quot;Combat,&quot; &quot;Freedom,&quot; &quot;Subversive,&quot; and &quot;Mercenary&quot; (which became the first installment of the Joe Mauser series), the Homer Crawford serials &quot;Black Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; and &quot;Border, Breed nor Birth,&quot; and the novellas &quot;Adaptation,&quot; &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; (both part of the United Planet series), and &quot;Status Quo&quot; (a Hugo nominee). In 1963, he published &quot;The Expatriates&quot;, a mix of travel memories and autobiographical material emphasizing the benefits of living outside the United States. From 1961–64, Reynolds, at the request of his agent, wrote five sex novels: &quot;Episode on the Riviera&quot;, &quot;A Kiss before Loving&quot;, &quot;This Time We Love&quot;, &quot;The Kept Woman&quot;, and &quot;The Jet Set&quot;.

In 1965, the Reynolds returned to San Miguel de Allende to live. Their house on Nuñez 32 soon became a familiar haunt of the artistic community, often frequented by renowned authors. While Reynolds continued to write and sell science fiction stories, by 1969 his sales began to decline and several of his novels were held back during a takeover of Ace Books in 1970 and not published until 1975. During this difficult period of his life, Reynolds wrote two romance novels, &quot;The House in the Kasbah&quot; and &quot;The Home of the Inquisitor&quot;, under the byline Maxine Reynolds. He also began his most ambitious undertaking, a series of stories envisioning life in the year 2000. &quot;Looking Backward from the Year 2000&quot; and &quot;Equality: In the Year 2000&quot; updated and critiqued the socialist utopias created by Edward Bellamy in &quot;Looking Backward: 2000-1887&quot; and &quot;Equality&quot;, which had helped shape Reynolds&#x27; radical worldview at an early age. &quot;Commune 2000 A.D.&quot;, &quot;The Towers of Utopia&quot;, and &quot;Rolltown&quot; and the Lagrangia series explored marginal utopian colonies on earth and in space, respectively. In 1976, the short story collection &quot;The Best of Mack Reynolds&quot; was published.

By the end of the 1970s, Reynolds was having trouble getting his manuscripts published. One month before his death in 1983, as he was recuperating from cancer surgery, his new agent negotiated a contract with Tor Books. By 1986, eleven of his books had been published posthumously, five of them revised and co-authored by Dean Ing, and two more by Michael A. Banks. The New England Science Fiction Association, which had invited Reynolds to be its Guest of Honor at Boskone XX (February 1983), published the collection &quot;Compounded Interests&quot; to be released as part of his appearance, but Reynolds died three weeks before the convention. In it, Reynolds identifies his &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;Mission to Horatius&quot; as his &quot;bestseller.&quot;

==Major themes==
While Reynolds&#x27; fiction spans an array of science fiction elements including time travel, alien visitation, world computers, Amazonian cultures, and intergalactic spy adventures, his radical interrogation of socioeconomic systems sets him apart from other science fiction writers. Accordingly, many of Reynolds&#x27; original contributions to science fiction exist in the form of sociological predictions, some of which have come to pass: the credit-card economy, a worldwide computer network with information available at one&#x27;s fingertips, a &quot;Common Europe,&quot; a basic guaranteed income for every citizen, mobile cities, or global societies with a universal religion and an Esperanto-based common language.

===Alternative socio-economic systems===
Reynolds sought to shake his readers&#x27; complacent acceptance of Cold War capitalism by depicting a variety of post-capitalist near futures, many of which he envisioned could occur around the year 2000. His stories, therefore, cover an assortment of social systems including anarchy, communism, technocracy, syndicalism, meritocracy, various forms of socialism, and an extrapolation of free-enterprise economics, People&#x27;s Capitalism. In addition, some of his stories set up a rivalry between a collective and a competitive economy in order to assess their respective merits, sometimes coming to the conclusion that they cannot be compared except for their imperialistic aims, as in the novella &quot;Adaptation&quot;, while at other times both systems are revealed to be equally decadent and stagnant, as in the Joe Mauser story &quot;Frigid Fracas&quot;. Reynolds&#x27; novella &quot;Radical Center&quot; (1967) – portraying radical centrism as a conspiracy of the powerful to render ordinary citizens non-judgmental and apathetic – became the lead story in a university textbook, &quot;American Government Through Science Fiction&quot;.

===Trouble in Utopia===
Reynolds has been called a &quot;cautious,&quot; &quot;critical,&quot; or &quot;ambiguous&quot; Utopian writer because his many explorations of ideal societies, such as his updates of Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward: 2000-1887&quot; and &quot;Equality&quot;, focus as much on Utopia&#x27;s dilemmas as on its benefits. Typically, Reynolds&#x27; Utopias are worlds of almost complete industrial automation so that no one needs to work, everyone lives in security thanks to a guaranteed basic income, and those who volunteer for the few jobs left are chosen via a quantitative ability test. At the same time, the population&#x27;s very life of leisure has led to species stasis by discouraging the continual striving that gives humanity its purpose as in the story &quot;Utopian,&quot; or the Utopian welfare state has metamorphosed into a caste society where those in power aim to keep it, blocking for its other members the opportunity to exert themselves to the full extent of their abilities, as in the Joe Mauser series.

===The continuous revolution===
Reynolds&#x27; heroes usually seek to improve their societies by direct revolutionary action. Sometimes their revolution is meant to advance a people&#x27;s level of civilization, as in the case of the North Africa series; sometimes it aims to upset a Utopian society where, while there is no want, inequality, or conflict, there is also no sense of purpose, as in the novel &quot;After Utopia&quot;, or possibility of social mobility, as in the Joe Mauser series. Usually, once a revolution has succeeded in subverting the status quo, another revolution follows and subverts it, as in the story &quot;Black Sheep Astray,&quot; giving the impression that social change is as endless as it is progressive.

<text>A distributor is an electric and mechanical device used in the ignition system of older spark ignition engines. The distributor&#x27;s main function is to route electricity from the ignition coil to each spark plug at the correct time.

== Design ==

A distributor consists of a rotating arm (&#x27;rotor&#x27;) that is attached to the top of a rotating &#x27;distributor shaft&#x27;. The rotor constantly receives high-voltage electricity from an ignition coil via brushes at the centre of the rotor. As the rotor spins, its tip passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts for each cylinder. As the electrified tip passes each output contact, the high-voltage electricity is able to &#x27;jump&#x27; across the small gap. This burst of electricity then travels to the spark plug (via high tension leads), where it ignites the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.

On most overhead valve engines, the distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft, often shared with the oil pump; on most overhead camshaft engines, the distributor shaft is attached directly to a camshaft.

Older distributor designs used a cam on the distributor shaft that operates the contact breaker (also called &quot;points&quot;). Opening the points causes a high induction voltage in the ignition coil. This design was superseded by an electronically controlled ignition coil with a sensor (usually Hall effect or optical) to control the timing of the ignition coil charging.

=== Ignition advance ===
In older distributors, adjusting the ignition timing is usually achieved through both &quot;mechanical advance&quot; and &quot;vacuum advance&quot;. Mechanical advance adjusts the timing based on the engine speed (rpm), using a set of hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft. These weights cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate, thereby advancing the ignition timing. Vacuum advance typically uses manifold vacuum to adjust the ignition timing, for example to improve fuel economy and driveability when minimal power is required from the engine.

Most distributors used on electronic fuel injection engines use electronics to adjust the ignition timing, instead of vacuum and centrifugal systems. This allows the ignition timing to be optimised based on factors other than engine speed and manifold vacuum.
==Direct ignition== 
Since the early 2000s, many cars have used a &#x27;coil-on-plug&#x27; direct ignition system, whereby a small ignition coil is located directly above the spark plug for each cylinder. This design means that high-voltage electricity is only present in the small distance between each coil and the spark plug. See Saab Direct Ignition.

== Gallery ==



== History ==
The first mass-produced electric ignition was the Delco ignition system, which was introduced in the 1910 Cadillac Model 30. In 1921, Arthur Atwater Kent Sr invented the competing &quot;Unisparker&quot; ignition system.

By the 1980s and 1990s, distributors had been largely replaced by electronic ignition systems.

<text>James Brendan Bolger ( ; born 31 May 1935), is a New Zealand retired politician of the National Party who was the 35th prime minister of New Zealand, serving from 1990 to 1997.

Bolger was born in Ōpunake, Taranaki, to Irish immigrants. Before entering politics, he farmed in Waikato, and was involved in Federated Farmers – a nationwide agricultural association. Bolger won election to Parliament in 1972, and subsequently served in several portfolios in the Third National Government. Following one unsuccessful bid for the party leadership in 1984, Bolger was elected as National Party leader in 1986. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 1986 to 1990.

Bolger led the National Party to a landslide victory—the largest in its history—in the , allowing him to become prime minister on 2 November 1990. The Fourth National Government was elected on the promise of delivering a &quot;Decent Society&quot; following the previous Labour government&#x27;s economic reforms, known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;, which Bolger criticised. However, shortly after taking office, his government was forced to bail out the Bank of New Zealand and as a result reneged on a number of promises made during the election campaign. Bolger&#x27;s government essentially advanced the free-market reforms of the previous government, while implementing drastic cuts in public spending. National retained power in the 1993 election, albeit with a much-reduced majority.

Bolger&#x27;s second term in office saw the introduction of the MMP electoral system. In the subsequent 1996 election National emerged as the largest party but it was forced to enter into a coalition with New Zealand First. Bolger continued as prime minister, however his critics argued that he gave the inexperienced NZ First too much influence in his Cabinet. On 8 December 1997, Bolger was effectively ousted as leader by his party caucus, and was replaced as prime minister by Jenny Shipley.

After resigning as a Member of Parliament in 1998, Bolger became Ambassador to the United States and remained in this post until 2002.

==Early life==
Bolger was born in 1935 at Ōpunake in Taranaki. He was born into an Irish Catholic family; Bolger was one of five children born to Daniel and Cecilia (née Doyle) Bolger who emigrated together from Gorey, County Wexford, in 1930. He said that his early childhood was dominated by the effects of World War II. He left Opunake High School at age 15 to work on the family dairy farm. In 1962 he purchased his own farm near Rahotu. He joined became active in Federated Farmers becoming a branch chairman in 1962, sub-provincial chairman in 1970 and Waikato provincial vice-president in 1971. He was a member of the Waikato and King Country agricultural advisory committees.

In 1963, Bolger married Joan Riddell, and they moved to their own sheep and beef farm in Te Kūiti two years later. During this time Bolger became involved in local farmer politics. He joined the Egmont branch of the National Party and was later an officeholder in the Te Kūiti branch. In the late 1960s he was asked to accompany the then Minister of Finance Robert Muldoon to see for himself the difficulties faced by farmers in the area. As Bolger travelled around the district, he became experienced with Muldoon&#x27;s adversarial style.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===




Bolger entered politics in 1972 as the New Zealand National Party Member of Parliament for King Country, a newly created electorate in the rural western portion of North Island. This electorate is traditional National territory, and Bolger won easily. He represented this electorate, renamed Taranaki-King Country in 1996, until his retirement in 1998. In 1974 he was appointed National&#x27;s spokesperson for Rural Affairs by incoming leader Robert Muldoon.

At the formation of the Third National Government in 1975 Bolger was designated as Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and to Minister of Maori Affairs. In 1977, Muldoon promoted him to Cabinet, first as Minister of Fisheries and Associate Minister of Agriculture. Following the 1978 election, he became Minister of Labour and Minister of Immigration.

In late 1980 Bolger was a leading member of &#x27;the Colonels&#x27; (alongside Derek Quigley, Jim McLay and George Gair) who attempted to dump Muldoon as leader and put the party back into line with traditional National Party policies after feeling they were being abandoned. In what became known as the Colonels&#x27; Coup. The agitators intended to replace Muldoon with his deputy, Brian Talboys, who was more economically liberal and in tune with traditional National Party philosophy than Muldoon. The Colonels waited until Muldoon was out of the country before moving against him. However, Talboys was reluctant to openly challenge and the scheme failed with Muldoon reaffirming control after he returned to remain leader.

After the defeat of National at the 1984 general elections Bolger remained on the frontbench as Shadow Minister of Labour and Employment. Both he and deputy leader Jim McLay challenged Muldoon for the leadership of the party. McLay succeeded but Bolger was elected as deputy leader (and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition). McLay also designated Bolger Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry before switching him to Shadow Minister of Agriculture. In December 1985 he attempted an abortive leadership coup against McLay.

===Leader of the Opposition===

In 1986, Bolger organised a second challenge to McLay&#x27;s leadership. This one was successful, and he defeated McLay in a 26 March 1986 ballot for the leadership of the National Party. Initially Bolger pursued a pro law and order approach, with a focus on critiquing Labour&#x27;s perceived reluctance to combat &quot;lawlessness&quot; and offering a referendum on the reintroduction of capital punishment. Jim Bolger went head to head against the popular David Lange in the 1987 general election, but failed to match the latter&#x27;s popularity; Lange described Bolger as &quot;an itinerant masseur, massaging the politically erogenous zones.&quot; National under Bolger capitalised on public anger at the Labour government&#x27;s highly unpopular economic policies to win National&#x27;s biggest ever majority (and by extension the largest in New Zealand history) at the 1990 general election. Bolger became Prime Minister at age 55.

===Prime Minister (1990–1997)===

====First term====
Three days after being sworn in as prime minister, Bolger&#x27;s government needed to bail out the Bank of New Zealand, then the largest bank in the country. The cost of the bail out was $380 million, but after rewriting its budget, the government needed to borrow $740 million. This had an immediate impact on Bolger&#x27;s direction in government, with the first budget of his premiership being dubbed the &quot;Mother of All Budgets&quot;. Bolger&#x27;s Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, implemented drastic cuts in public spending, particularly in health and welfare. The unemployment benefit was cut by $14.00 a week, sickness benefit by $27.04, families benefit by $25.00 to $27.00 and universal payments for family benefits were completely abolished. Richardson also introduced many user pays requirements in hospitals and schools, services previously free to the populace and paid for by the government. The first budget specifically reversed National&#x27;s election promise to remove the tax surcharge on superannuation and the retention of promises to abolish tertiary fees.

Another major controversial piece of legislation was the 1991 Employment Contracts Act which effectively dismantled the industrial relations settlement that had persisted since 1894. Immediate effects of this law change saw union membership fall dramatically in the decade following its passage. His government also introduced the Building Act 1991, which is seen by some as a crucial factor leading to New Zealand&#x27;s later leaky homes crisis.

Bolger opposed electoral reform, but despite his party&#x27;s opposition held a referendum on whether or not New Zealand should change from the British-style electoral system of &#x27;first past the post&#x27; to one of proportional representation. In 1992, New Zealanders voted to change to the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system. This was confirmed in a binding referendum held alongside the 1993 general election, which National won. Bolger had originally proposed a return to a bicameral system, with a Senate elected by Single Transferable Vote, but retreated from this in the face of support for electoral reform. For his pragmatism and his sense of authority, he was jovially nicknamed &quot;The Great Helmsman&quot;.

====Second term====
At the 1993 election, National narrowly retain government, owing partly to a slight economic recovery and his opposition being split between three competing parties; Bolger himself expected a comfortable election win, exclaiming &quot;bugger the pollsters&quot; upon the election result. National&#x27;s unprecedented eighteen-seat majority had virtually disappeared and the country faced an election night hung parliament for the first time since 1931, with National one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. Final special votes counted over the following days revealed National had retained which it had lost on election night together with holding Wellington Central the only electorate National had won from Labour. This allowed it to form a government with the majority of one seat but required the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches (Peter Tapsell of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House.

Following this election result Bolger expressed the need to work with other political parties and decided to demote Richardson from her post, appointing Bill Birch who was seen as more moderate. During Birch&#x27;s tenure, spending on core areas such as health and education increased. His government passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. During the 1994 Address-in-Reply debate, Bolger argued in favour of a New Zealand republic, but denied that his views related to his Irish heritage.

In April 1995 the Cave Creek disaster gained public attention after a scenic viewing platform collapsed, killing fourteen people. The platform had been erected by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in 1994 and later inquiries found that many of those who constructed it did not have prerequisite qualifications for building the platform. Despite DOC taking responsibility for its collapse, there would be no prosecutions (as the Crown is unable to prosecute itself) but $2.6 million worth of compensation was paid to the victims&#x27; families. Bolger initially attacked the report produced by the Commission of Inquiry, arguing that the platform failed &quot;essentially because it lacked about $20 worth of bolts to hold it together&quot;. The Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall, was criticised in the media for his management of the department. Many people blamed Marshall, although there was also wide criticism of the whole government&#x27;s policies on management of the conservation estate. Marshall eventually resigned in May 1996, just over a year after the accident occurred. A new Minister, Nick Smith, was appointed, and a full review of the department was conducted by the State Services Commission.

Bolger&#x27;s second term would also see France resume nuclear testing on Moruroa, prompting swift condemnation from New Zealand and other Pacific nations. Bolger vocally supported anti-nuclear protests by New Zealand yachters. His government dispatched HMNZS Tui to provide support for the flotilla.

Proposals to end the status of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the country&#x27;s highest court of appeal failed to gain parliamentary sanction during Bolger&#x27;s premiership (however Helen Clark&#x27;s Fifth Labour Government would replace the right of appeal in 2003 when it set up the Supreme Court of New Zealand). Bolger&#x27;s government ended the awarding of British honours in 1996, introducing a New Zealand Honours System. At a conference on the &quot;Bolger years&quot; in 2007, Bolger recalled speaking to the Queen about the issue of New Zealand becoming a republic: &quot;I have more than once spoken with Her Majesty about my view that New Zealand would at some point elect its own Head of State, we discussed the matter in a most sensible way and she was in no way surprised or alarmed and neither did she cut my head off.&quot; With the new MMP environment some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, United New Zealand in mid-1995, whilst other splinter parties emerged.

====Third term====
The 1996 election saw New Zealand First, led by former National minister Winston Peters, holding the balance of power after the 1996 election. Bolger&#x27;s government stayed in office in a caretaker role while negotiations began for a coalition government. Although National remained the largest single party, neither Bolger nor Labour leader Helen Clark could form a government on their own. Neither party could govern without the support of New Zealand First, leaving Peters in a position where he could effectively choose the next prime minister.

Ultimately, in December 1996, Peters decided to go into coalition with National. Bolger had to pay a very high price in order to stay in power, however. As part of a detailed coalition agreement Peters became deputy prime minister and Treasurer. The latter post was created specifically for Peters, and was senior to the existing post of Minister of Finance, which was retained by Birch. Bolger also made significant policy concessions as well. He also allowed Peters full latitude to select ministers from New Zealand First, unusual for a junior coalition partner in a Westminster system. There were concerns about whether Bolger and Peters could work together, since Bolger had sacked Peters from his cabinet in 1991 over Peters&#x27; objections to Ruthanasia. However. no major issues surfaced between them.

Bolger&#x27;s administration made progress in settling historical grievances with Māori under the Treaty of Waitangi. These settlements aimed to address longstanding issues related to land and resource rights, contributing to the reconciliation process between the government and Māori communities.

====Resignation====
Growing opposition to Bolger&#x27;s slow pace and perceived exaggerated influence of New Zealand First led Transport Minister Jenny Shipley to plan a caucus room coup while Bolger was attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. When Bolger returned to New Zealand, he found that Shipley was not only preparing a leadership challenge, but had marshaled enough support to oust him as party leader and prime minister. Rather than face being voted out, he resigned on 8 December, and Shipley became New Zealand&#x27;s first woman prime minister. As a concession, Bolger was made a junior minister in Shipley&#x27;s government.

Bolger remains the National Party&#x27;s third-longest-serving leader. Retiring political journalist Peter Luke said that Bolger was &quot;[t]he most under-estimated prime minister I have come across. He made up for his lack of education by having an innate ability to relate to the aspirations of ordinary Kiwis. And, as many civil servants discovered to their cost, his image of being a simple King Country farmer did not mean that he would not understand their reports and unfailingly point to the flaws in them.&quot;

==Life after politics==
Bolger retired as MP for Taranaki-King Country in 1998, prompting the and subsequently became New Zealand&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States. On his return to New Zealand in 2001, he was appointed Chairman of the state-owned New Zealand Post and of its subsidiary Kiwibank. He also chairs Express Couriers Ltd, Trustees Executors Ltd, the Gas Industry Company Ltd, the advisory board of the World Agricultural Forum, St. Louis, USA, the New Zealand United States Council, and the Board of Directors of the Ian Axford Fellowships in Public Policy.

Bolger was elected Chancellor of the University of Waikato on 14 February 2007, succeeding John Jackman.

On 1 July 2008, almost 15 years after his National government sold New Zealand Rail Ltd, the Labour-led government repurchased its successor Toll NZ Ltd (less its Tranz Link trucking and distribution arm), having repurchased the track network in 2004. Bolger became chair of the company, renamed KiwiRail, a position he held until 1 July 2010. A number of commentators, including Winston Peters, view this as ironic. In response, Bolger acknowledged his involvement in privatising New Zealand Rail, remarking that &quot;my life is full of ironies,&quot; and added that &quot;the world has changed.&quot;

Bolger expressed concern about poverty and inequality in an interview with Radio New Zealand&#x27;s Guyon Espiner. He also believes that trade unions may not have enough power. Some see this as disavowing his previous adherence to free market reforms. In 2021 he stated that the modern National Party should reimagine capitalism because social inequality was causing division, saying free market capitalism is &quot;on the verge of destroying the planet and destabilising society&quot;.

On 5 June 2018, Bolger was appointed to head the Labour government&#x27;s fair pay agreement working group, tasked with reporting back on the design of industry-wide Fair Pay Agreements by the end of that year.

As of 2022, Bolger is a member of the Board of Te Urewera, a protected area in the North Island.

==Honours and awards==
In 1977, Bolger was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. Both Jim and Joan Bolger received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and, in 1993, the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In the 1998 New Year Honours, Jim Bolger was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand, and Joan Bolger was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the community. 
Bolger received the Order of New Zealand without the customary knighthood bestowed on former prime ministers, as he supports eliminating honorary titles.

==Personal life==
Bolger and his wife Joan are Roman Catholics, with Bolger describing himself as religious but not &quot;deeply so.&quot; The couple has nine children. Bolger voted against abortion whenever the issue came up in a parliamentary conscience vote. He is a member of Collegium International. Since 2013 Bolger has live in Waikanae.

Some have made reference to Jim Bolger, ironically or affectionately, as the &quot;Great Helmsman&quot;.

<text>Masherbrum (; formerly known as K1) is a mountain located in the Ghanche District in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. With an elevation of 7,821 metres (25,659 feet), it ranks as the 22nd highest mountain globally and the 9th highest in Pakistan. It holds the distinction of being the first mapped peak in the Karakoram mountain range during the Great Trigonometrical Survey, leading to its K-number designation as &quot;K1&quot;.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Masherbrum&quot; is indeed a subject of some debate and uncertainty. The exact origin of the name may still be open to interpretation and further research. While &quot;brum&quot; is understood to mean &quot;mountain&quot; in Balti, the origin of &quot;masher&quot; remains less clear. One suggestion is that it may come from &quot;mashadar,&quot; which means a muzzle-loader, possibly alluding to the distinctive curvature or shape of its summit as observed from the Baltoro Glacier (and in Persian, &quot;masheh&quot; means both matchlock and trigger, and &quot;dar&quot; is a suffix meaning &quot;having&quot;). Others have noted that &quot;masha&quot; means lady, and thus &quot;Masherbrum&quot; is the &quot;queen of peaks&quot;.

In India, this mountain peak is known as &quot;Mahasherbaram&quot;, which comes from Sanskrit word referring to &quot;The White Tiger&quot;.

==Geography==
Masherbrum is the highest peak of the Masherbrum Mountains, a subrange of the Karakoram range. It is a large and striking peak, which is somewhat overshadowed by the nearby peaks of the main range of the Karakoram which includes four of the fourteen Eight-thousanders, namely K2, Gasherbrum I, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum II. 
The Masherbrum Mountains lie to the south of the Baltoro Glacier and the main range of the Karakoram lies to the north of the Baltoro (which is the route most commonly used to access the 8000m peaks of the Karakoram). However, the &quot;normal route&quot; to Masherbrum is along the Hushe Valley which flows south from the summit.

== Climbing history ==
In 1856, Thomas Montgomerie, a British Royal Engineers lieutenant, noticed a tall mountain in the Karakorams and called it K1 (denoting peak 1 of the Karakorams; K2 was the name he gave to the nearby peak behind K1 when viewed from Harmukh). To the local people of the area, it is known as Masherbrum.

Masherbrum was reconnoitered in 1911 by Fanny Bullock Workman and her husband, Dr. William H. Workman. It was first attempted in 1938 from the south, by a group led by James Waller which included Dawa Thondup and J. O. M. Roberts. The attempt failed just short of the summit, when J.B. Harrison and R.A. Hodgkin, severely frostbitten, had to return due to bad weather.

Two more unsuccessful expeditions took place, in 1955 by a team from New Zealand and in 1957 by a UK team which included Don Whillans (on his first visit to the greater ranges). In 1955 the team reached c. 7000m. During the 1957 attempt Bob Downes died on the mountain and the highest point reached by the team was c. 200m below the summit.

Masherbrum was first climbed in 1960 by George Irving Bell and Willi Unsoeld, led by the former, in an American-Pakistani expedition including Nick Clinch. They succeeded in climbing the southeast face route that had stymied the earlier parties. Two days later team members Nick Clinch and Pakistani Jawed Akhter reached the summit. Masherbrum is the highest peak in Pakistan where a Pakistani man reached the summit on the first ascent expedition.

The Himalayan Index lists three additional ascents and six additional failed attempts on Masherbrum. The ascents include two by additional routes, the NW Face and the NW Ridge/N Face.

In her book, &quot;Voyage au Bout du Vide: Une Cordėe Alpine au Masherbrum&quot;, the French mountaineer provides a dramatic account of her 1980 attempt, with David Belden, to ascend Masherbrum in alpine style. Their three-month expedition, bedeviled by bad weather, ended in failure when avalanches swept their camp and injured de Colombel, leading to a desperate three-day retreat in whiteout conditions.

<doc id="362233" wikidata="Q840291" url="?curid=362233" title="Magneto (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Magneto (; birth name: Max Eisenhardt; alias: Erik Lehnsherr and Magnus; Auschwitz tattoo: 214782) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #1 (cover-dated September 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.

Magneto is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as &quot;Homo superior&quot;, to replace humans as the dominant species, and occasionally advocated for human genocide. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his &quot;Never again&quot; determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate to the European Jews at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes them. He was once a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies sometimes cause a rift in their friendship. Magneto&#x27;s role in comics has progressed from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional ally and member of the X-Men, even leading the New Mutants for a time as headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters.

Writer Chris Claremont, who originated Magneto&#x27;s backstory, modeled the character on then-Israeli opposition leader Menachem Begin, with later commentators comparing the character with the American civil rights leader Malcolm X and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane.

Ian McKellen has portrayed Magneto in various films since X-Men in 2000, while Michael Fassbender has portrayed a younger version of the character in the prequel films since X-Men: First Class in 2011. Both actors portrayed their respective incarnations in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Magneto appears in X-Men: The Animated Series (1992) voiced by David Hemblen and its sequel X-Men &#x27;97 (2024) voiced by Matthew Waterson.

==Publication history==
Magneto first appeared in the debut issue of &quot;The X-Men&quot; in 1963. Since the 1960s, Magneto has appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;Cable&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, various X-Men miniseries, and many other Marvel titles. His first solo title was a one-shot special, &quot;Magneto: The Twisting of a Soul&quot; #0 (Sept. 1993), published when the character returned from a brief absence; it reprinted Magneto-based stories from &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #12 and 19 (Aug. 1987 and March 1988), by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Bolton.

When asked about his approach to Magneto, Jack Kirby stated, &quot;I saw my villains not as villains. I knew villains had to come from somewhere and they came from people. My villains were people that developed problems.&quot; In a 2008 interview, Stan Lee said he &quot;did not think of Magneto as a bad guy. He just wanted to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist...he was trying to defend the mutants, and because society was not treating them fairly he was going to teach society a lesson. He was a danger of course...but I never thought of him as a villain.&quot; In the same interview, he also revealed that he originally planned for Magneto to be the brother of his nemesis Professor X.

Writer Chris Claremont stated that Menachem Begin was an inspiration for Magneto&#x27;s development, as David Ben-Gurion was for Professor X. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of talk online now that Magneto stands in for Malcolm X and Xavier stands in for Martin Luther King, which is totally valid but for me, being an immigrant white, to make that analogy felt incredibly presumptuous. An equivalent analogy could be made to [Israeli prime minister] Menachem Begin as Magneto, evolving through his life from a terrorist in 1947 to a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 30 years later.&quot;

Asked about the Malcolm X/Martin Luther King Jr. parallels, Claremont also said &quot;It was too close [in the 1970s]. It had only been a few years since the assassinations. In a way, it seemed like that would be too raw. My resonance to Magneto and Xavier was borne more out of the Holocaust. It was coming face to face with evil, and how do you respond to it? In Magneto&#x27;s case it was violence begets violence. In Xavier&#x27;s it was the constant attempt to find a better way... As we got distance from the &#x27;60s, the Malcolm X-Martin Luther King-Mandela resonance came into things. It just fit.&quot;

Magneto&#x27;s first original title was the four-issue miniseries &quot;Magneto&quot; (Nov. 1996-Feb. 1997), by writers Peter Milligan and Jorge Gonzalez, and penciller Kelley Jones. In the miniseries, Magneto had been de-aged and suffered from amnesia, calling himself Joseph; it was later revealed that Joseph was a younger clone of Magneto. Later, Magneto became ruler of the nation Genosha and then appeared in two miniseries; &quot;Magneto Rex&quot; (written by Joe Pruett and drawn by Brandon Peterson) and &quot;Magneto: Dark Seduction&quot; (written by Fabian Nicieza and drawn by Roger Cruz).

A trade paperback novel detailing Magneto&#x27;s childhood, &quot;X-Men: Magneto Testament&quot; was written by Greg Pak and released in September 2008. Pak based &quot;Magneto Testament&quot; on accounts from Holocaust survivors. Before the publication of &quot;X-Men: Magneto Testament&quot;, Magneto&#x27;s personal background and history were invented in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #150 (Aug. 1981). He was portrayed as a Jewish Holocaust survivor; while searching for his wife Magda, a Sintesa, Magneto maintained a cover identity as a Sinto. This created confusion among some readers as to Magneto&#x27;s heritage, until his Jewish background was confirmed in &quot;Magneto: Testament&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Max Eisenhardt was born in the late 1920s to a middle-class German Jewish family. Max&#x27;s father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated World War I veteran. Surviving discrimination and hardship during the Nazi rise to power, the passing of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and Kristallnacht, Max and his family fled to Poland, where they were captured during the German invasion of Poland and sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again and sent to Auschwitz, where he eventually became a &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;. While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a Romani girl named Magda, with whom he had fallen in love when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the October 7, 1944 revolt.

Following the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, and Max adopted the name &quot;Magnus&quot;. Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus&#x27;s powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus&#x27;s power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins Pietro and Wanda before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of &quot;Erik Lehnsherr, the Sinte gypsy&quot;. &quot;Erik&quot; moved to Israel, where he met and befriended Charles Xavier while working at a psychiatric hospital near Haifa, where Gabrielle Haller lived. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing Baron Strucker and Hydra. After the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier&#x27;s views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden Nazi gold, which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.

===Rise of Magneto===

Magneto&#x27;s experiences during the Holocaust (Nazi Germany, Auschwitz, and Vinnytsia) shaped his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the Marvel Universe. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He believes that mutants (&quot;Homo superior&quot;) will become the dominant life form on the planet and he sets about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants can live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.

Magneto&#x27;s first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier&#x27;s mutant students, the X-Men, in their first mission. He creates Asteroid M, an orbital base of operations in a hollowed-out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, and formed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men. He tries to make the Toad infiltrate the X-Men. When that fails, he captures the Angel and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.

Magneto is captured by the Stranger, a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger&#x27;s laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him. Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger&#x27;s planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel&#x27;s parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger. Magneto remains on the Stranger&#x27;s world for a time, but escapes again thanks to the unwitting assistance of scientist Dane Whitman, makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant Mastermind. He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the Avengers and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.

Magneto then creates the Savage Land Mutates. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and Ka-Zar. Along with Namor, Magneto later attacks New York City. He later fights the Inhumans Royal Family, and battles the Avengers once more.

Magneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the Defenders. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid &quot;Alpha the Ultimate Mutant&quot;. Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy. Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier&#x27;s former love interest, Professor Moira MacTaggert at Muir Island. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto&#x27;s powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them. In an attempt to cure him of this flaw, she manipulates the infant Magneto&#x27;s genetic code, so that when he grows older, he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, to prevent him from becoming &quot;evil&quot; in adulthood. However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers since the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and &quot;reset&quot; to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien Shi&#x27;ar agent Erik the Red.

Magneto later gathers a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and with them battles Captain America. He then successfully opposes Doctor Doom&#x27;s conquest of Earth.

===Reformation===
Magneto&#x27;s first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills Kitty Pryde, stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child — precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for. Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.

Magneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the Vision and Crystal. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father. He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver&#x27;s human child Luna Maximoff. Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.

Magneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the Beyonder, a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the Battleworld to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the Secret Wars. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally. Captain America even speaks in his defense on some occasions, and the Wasp develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.

After the Secret Wars, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M. The alien Warlock, traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces. Magneto falls towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries. He is rescued by Lee Forrester, the captain of a fishing trawler. Lee takes him to the same island in the Bermuda Triangle where he had once held her captive; there she helps him recuperate from his injuries, and the two become lovers.

After recuperating from his injuries, Magneto is asked to aid the X-Men in battling the returned Beyonder. Magneto stays with the X-Men even after the Beyonder is defeated. His association with the team softens his views on humanity, and Magneto surrenders himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes. A special tribunal dismisses all charges against Magneto from prior to his &quot;rebirth&quot;, deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from Fenris, the twin children of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Professor X, brought to near death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries, asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead, he takes over Xavier&#x27;s school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier&#x27;s cousin. Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.

Though Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster of the New Mutants and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous. His responsibilities to the school force him to separate from Lee, who he felt would have been a strong guiding hand and emotional support. The Beyonder plagues him yet again, slaying Xavier&#x27;s current students, the New Mutants, and bringing them back to life soon after. This deeply traumatizes the entire group. Magneto is then manipulated by Emma Frost into battling sanctioned heroes the Avengers and the Supreme Soviets. Magneto submits to a trial once again, but uses mind-control circuitry he salvaged from the wreckage of Asteroid M to alter the opinions of the head justice in charge of the trial. As a result, Magneto is finally absolved of his past crimes but finds that this only fuels hostility towards mutants. Feeling that desperate measures need to be taken after the genocidal massacre in the Morlock tunnels, Magneto and Storm join the Hellfire Club jointly as the White King. He is unable to prevent his students Roberto da Costa and Warlock from running away from the school, or to prevent the death of the young mutant student Douglas Ramsey after the students sneak away yet again to save a friend, and witnesses the apparent death of all of the senior X-Men on national television.

His relationship with the New Mutants deteriorates even further when they see him and the Hellfire Club negotiating with the demons of the &quot;Inferno&quot; incident. Magneto later ousts longtime Hellfire Club co-chair Sebastian Shaw to establish himself as the head of the Hellfire Club. To win the support of the other Club members against Shaw, he claims that his reformation was all a pretense to use the X-Men and New Mutants as pawns in a long-term scheme to take over the world. In response, the New Mutants, who had already decided to leave Magneto&#x27;s tutelage, declare themselves his enemies.

Seeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto begins seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; alongside such established villains as Doctor Doom, the Wizard, the Mandarin, and the Red Skull. His temporary alliance with the Red Skull — an unrepentant Nazi war criminal — is a highly uneasy one. After confirming that the Skull was the original one who had worked with Hitler, Magneto takes revenge upon him by entombing him alive. When Zaladane is able to appropriate the magnetic powers of Polaris, Magneto works alongside Rogue, Ka-Zar, and the American intelligence agent Nick Fury as well as a number of Russian operatives to reestablish peace in the Savage Land. This leads to an altercation with Zaladane, who appropriated Magneto&#x27;s magnetic powers in addition to those of Polaris. The conflict ends with Magneto reclaiming his powers and executing Zaladane himself. With her death, Magneto renounces his previous efforts to act as a mentor to the New Mutants and to follow Xavier&#x27;s beliefs in peaceful co-existence between mutants and normal humans.

===Avalon and Genosha===
Tired of the constant strife, Magneto rebuilds his orbital base and retires to a life of quiet seclusion. At this point, he is a figurehead for the cause of mutantkind and is sought out by a group of mutants calling themselves the Acolytes, who pledge their service and allegiance to him. Under the influence of one of them, Fabian Cortez, he declares Asteroid M a homeland for mutantkind, obtaining nuclear missiles from a Soviet submarine he had previously destroyed and placing them around the asteroid pointed towards Earth.

Magneto discovers how Moira MacTaggert altered his genetic structure when he was de-aged. Enraged, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture, later forcing her to use the same procedure that was used on him to alter the minds of some of the X-Men. However, when the remaining X-Men attack Asteroid M to rescue Moira and stop Magneto&#x27;s plans, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite that destroys Asteroid M and the procedure wears off; Moira had learned long ago that her procedure did not work because a mutant&#x27;s natural physiology relies on their bodies operating in a precise manner, with use of their powers restoring them to normal, and so Magneto had genuinely reformed. Betrayed and abandoned by Cortez, who had revealed Moira&#x27;s actions to him to try and provoke Magneto into bringing mutants together to serve as a martyr for Cortez&#x27;s own cause. Magneto refuses Xavier&#x27;s pleas to escape with the X-Men back to Earth. Instead, the Acolyte Chrome encases him in a protective shell, saving him from the subsequent explosion. However, Chrome and the other Acolytes die.

The United Nations Security Council, in response to a resurgent Magneto, votes to activate the &quot;Magneto Protocols&quot; — a satellite network, in a slightly lower orbit than Avalon, that skews the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within, preventing him from returning to the planet&#x27;s surface. In response, Magneto generates an electromagnetic pulse not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes. The X-Men respond by hacking into Avalon&#x27;s own computer systems to teleport a small team to the station with the aid of Colossus (who joined Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes moments after his younger sister Illyana&#x27;s funeral). Magneto, during the battle with the X-Men, rips the adamantium from Wolverine&#x27;s bones, which enrages Xavier to the point that he wipes his former friend&#x27;s mind, leaving him in a coma. This action later leads to the creation of Onslaught, an omnipotent being formed from the combination of Xavier and Magneto&#x27;s own dark sides, the darkness in Magneto&#x27;s soul latching on to its counterpart in Xavier when he launched such a devastating assault. Magneto remains comatose on Avalon, worshiped by his Acolytes under the leadership of the ancient mutant Exodus, until Avalon itself is destroyed by the arrival of Holocaust from the Age of Apocalypse Earth. During the destruction, Colossus places Magneto in an escape pod sending him back to Earth. This pod is intercepted by Astra, a former ally who now desires his death.

After cloning Magneto, Astra restores Magneto&#x27;s memories and powers before attempting to kill him. Instead, Magneto, now fully revived, battles both Astra and his clone. Magneto triumphs over the clone, sending him crashing into a South American barn. However, too weak to continue the battle, the real Magneto goes into hiding, while the now-amnesiac clone becomes known as Joseph (christened as such by the nun who discovered him) and eventually joins the X-Men. Since the world believes Joseph to be the real Magneto, Magneto takes his time to plan. He engages in a pair of brief diversions, first posing as &quot;Erik the Red&quot; and revealing Gambit&#x27;s past crimes to the X-Men, resulting in Gambit&#x27;s expulsion from the group. Then he kills George Odekirk, the forger that created his &quot;Erik Lehnsherr&quot; alias, to prevent his true identity from being discovered by Sabra and Gabrielle Haller.

Following this, Magneto constructs a machine to amplify his powers and blackmail the world into creating a mutant nation. The X-Men and Joseph, who had fallen under Astra&#x27;s control again, oppose him. Magneto&#x27;s powers are severely depleted from battling Joseph, who sacrifices his life to restore the Earth to normal. However, the United Nations, manipulated by its mutant affairs officer Alda Huxley, cedes to Magneto the island nation of Genosha, which had no recognized government. He rules Genosha for some time with the aid of many who had previously opposed him, including Quicksilver, Polaris, and Fabian Cortez, and engages in a brutal civil war with the island&#x27;s former human rulers.

Despite the UN&#x27;s hopes that Genosha&#x27;s civil war between humans and mutants would destroy or at least occupy him, Magneto crushes all opposition to his rule and rebuilds the nation by forming an army of mutants dedicated to his cause, including mutants coming from all over the world seeking sanctuary. Eventually, Magneto uses the Genegineer&#x27;s equipment to fully restore his power. Intending to declare war on humanity, he captures Professor X to use as a symbol with which to rally his troops. Jean Grey recruits a new group of X-Men to help Cyclops and Wolverine rescue Xavier; they defeat Magneto when Xavier psychically cuts off his access to his powers. Taking the opportunity for revenge, Wolverine attacks the depowered Magneto, crippling him with serious injuries.

====The destruction of Genosha====
While Magneto recovers from his injuries, Genosha is attacked by an army of Sentinels sent by Xavier&#x27;s long lost twin sister Cassandra Nova Xavier. Over 16 million mutants and humans die. The attack comes just after Polaris (one of the survivors) discovered the truth about her biological relationship as Magneto&#x27;s daughter. Magneto&#x27;s supposedly last moments are spent revealing to Genosha Polaris&#x27; status as his daughter.

Charles Xavier is met on Genosha by Magneto, who apparently survived Cassandra Nova&#x27;s attack and lived unnoticed within the ruins. Xavier and Magneto put aside their differences to rebuild the island nation, rekindling their friendship in the process.

====House of M====

During the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Magneto&#x27;s daughter Wanda suffers a mental breakdown over the loss of her children and starts to warp reality to recreate them, until Doctor Strange put her into a coma to stop her. In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda&#x27;s psychic cry for help and creates a wormhole, whisking her away before the Avengers are able to stop her. Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done. When some of the members suggest killing Wanda, Quicksilver informs Magneto of this development, before convincing Wanda to warp reality into the House of M. In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda&#x27;s family all received their &#x27;heart&#x27;s desires&#x27;, Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving Richard Nixon. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world&#x27;s much larger and much faster growing mutant population. Magneto then turned Genosha into the most powerful, technologically advanced country on Earth, which he used as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity.

A group of heroes is brought together by Wolverine — who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his &#x27;heart&#x27;s desire&#x27; was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program — and have their own memories of the &quot;real world&quot; restored by Layla Miller. They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto&#x27;s memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him. Sensing her brother&#x27;s death, Wanda resurrects him and retaliates with the phrase &quot;No more mutants&quot;, changing the world back to its original form and causing ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers, including Magneto. Magneto is left a broken man.

====Son of M====
In the 2006 miniseries &quot;Son of M&quot;, which follows up &quot;House of M&quot;, when Quicksilver comes to Genosha to restore the mutants&#x27; powers with the Inhumans&#x27; Terrigen Mists, Magneto condemns his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists have on non-Inhumans. Quicksilver attacks Magneto with his new powers from the Mists and savagely beats him until his daughter Luna stops him.

====The Collective====
Marvel&#x27;s editor in chief at that time, Joe Quesada, elaborated on the issue of Xorn and Magneto, stating that &quot;Kuan-Yin Xorn came under the influence of as-yet-to-be-revealed entity that forced him to assume the identity of Magneto.&quot; However, the issue of Xorn and Magneto was ultimately resolved during &quot;The Collective&quot; arc in New Avengers. A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy-absorbing mutant named Michael Pointer and free-floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto&#x27;s former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson. Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, and the Sentry combine their powers and send Xorn into the Sun. Michael Pointer and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter. The helicopter, however, explodes upon take-off through unknown means as Magneto uses what was left of the energy provided to him by Xorn to escape.

===Divided We Stand===
In the 2008 storyline &quot;X-Men: Divided We Stand&quot;, Magneto appears, apparently at the behest of Exodus and claiming to be powerless, to help restore Professor Xavier&#x27;s broken psyche. Together they revive Xavier before being attacked by Frenzy. Magneto wounds Frenzy by firing a medical laser into one of her eyes. Seeing the injury of a mutant as a crime, Exodus attacks Magneto. Xavier challenges Exodus on the astral plane. After Xavier defeats Exodus, he leaves Magneto and Omega Sentinel to try and rebuild his lost memories.

===Manifest Destiny===
Magneto, his powers artificially simulated by a suit designed by the High Evolutionary, reactivates Sentinels to attack the X-Men, who had recently relocated to San Francisco. Though he is defeated, Magneto&#x27;s attack serves its purpose as a distraction so the High Evolutionary can gain an unknown object from the Dreaming Celestial. After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial, the High Evolutionary subjects Magneto to a dangerous technological procedure, restoring his powers.

===&quot;Nation X&quot;===
In the &quot;Nation X&quot; storyline, impressed with the X-Men&#x27;s efforts in defending and helping mutantkind, Magneto offers to work with them on Utopia, the new mutant homeland created by the X-Men using the remnants of Asteroid M. He aids the X-Men in defending Utopia Island from an attack of Predator X monsters. Now considered a member of the X-Men, Magneto assists them in stabilizing the asteroid from sinking into the Pacific. To that end, he works with Namor and the Atlanteans by constructing a pillar supporting Utopia on the surface that would provide a home for the Atlanteans, which Magneto would later refer to as New Atlantis. However, Cyclops reprimands Magneto for acting on his own authority. Despite Xavier being apologetic and appreciative for what he&#x27;d done, Magneto leaves Utopia for nearby Mount Tamalpais in Marin County. In a final bid to gain their trust, Magneto enters a deep meditative catatonic state to focus his powers at an interstellar distance and reverse the path of Breakworld&#x27;s &quot;Earth-destroyer&quot; Metal Bullet in which Kitty Pryde is trapped. Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while working to regain his powers with the High Evolutionary and surmised that Kitty was inside. He had chosen to focus on ways to restore the powers of mutants but memorized the metals of the bullet, allowing him to keep a trace on it. Magneto brings the bullet back to Earth, drawing Kitty out of it and levitating her safely to the ground. However, the strain of using his power at such intensity and duration leaves him comatose.

===Second Coming===
In the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Magneto comes out of his coma right after Hope is teleported into Utopia by a dying Nightcrawler. With the Nimrods laying siege to Utopia, Magneto stops Hank McCoy from leaving his patients as he prepares to enter battle himself. Magneto holds off a squad of Nimrods, dismembering the robots by pulling shards of iron from the core of Utopia through them.

===The Children&#x27;s Crusade===
Magneto learns that the Young Avengers are going to search for the still-missing Scarlet Witch, and that the heroes Wiccan and Speed are the reincarnations of Wanda&#x27;s children. Magneto meets them, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather, and helps them find Wanda. The Avengers attempt to stop Magneto, before Wiccan teleports Magneto and the Young Avengers to Wundagore Mountain. There they encounter Quicksilver, who attempts to kill his father. They discover that this Scarlet Witch is actually a Doombot in disguise.

===Magneto goes public===
With his reputation around the world as a well-known mutant revolutionary/terrorist, Magneto is talked into finding a solution to the problem by Cyclops before it goes public that he is established in Utopia. With an earthquake inbound for San Francisco, Magneto uses his powers to stabilize the city&#x27;s buildings, structures, and metal vehicles and to smooth the earth movements themselves, thus preventing any major damage and saving many lives. As a result, some of the city favors him, while others are reminded of how potentially dangerous he can be and has been.

===Avengers vs. X-Men and aftermath===
In the 2012 storyline &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Magneto fights Iron Man when the X-Men will not give Hope Summers to the Avengers. During the fight, Magneto senses the destructive force of the coming Phoenix. Iron Man stops the fight in favor of helping in the search for Hope. As he is leaving, Magneto tells him to find his daughter Scarlet Witch. After the battles around the world, Magneto and Psylocke meet Storm and an unconscious Doctor Nemesis at one of their hideouts. Magneto, Storm and Psylocke prepare to go to the Moon to help Cyclops. Magneto later informs Cyclops of Namor&#x27;s assault on Wakanda. Magneto asks Professor X for his help as the Phoenix Force-powered Emma Frost&#x27;s rule becomes more tyrannical. Magneto later joins the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Hulk in confronting the Phoenix Force-powered Cyclops. Scarlet Witch uses her abilities to keep Magneto from being harmed. Following the defeat of Cyclops, Magneto and the other former members are reported to have gone on the run.

After finding out that his control of his powers has been lost due to contact with the Phoenix Force, Magneto nonetheless teams up with Cyclops, Emma Frost, and Magik to start a new school for mutants since new mutants have started appearing again, in the old Weapon X facility. Magneto also pretended to serve as a disgruntled informer for SHIELD but it turned out to be an attempt by him to infiltrate the organization.

===Ongoing &quot;Magneto&quot; series===
In 2014, Magneto starred in his first ongoing series, which was written by Cullen Bunn. Feeling disenfranchised by the state of mutant affairs, Magneto decides to venture off on his own to fight for mutantkind&#x27;s survival on his own terms. The series has been cancelled, with issue #21 being its last issue, which sees Magneto fail to stop the Ultimate Marvel Earth from colliding with the 616 Earth, thus resulting in his death and his daughter Polaris&#x27;s loss of powers.

===AXIS===
During the 2014 &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Magneto enters the island of Genosha to find that it has turned into a concentration camp for mutants. He frees two mutant girls who tell him that Red Skull is responsible and possesses Professor X&#x27;s brain. Magneto attacks Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by his S-Men. Magneto is captured and mind-tortured by Red Skull. He is given visions of those closest to him suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by the Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and Havok, he bites down on a vial of Mutant Growth Hormone beneath his skin, giving himself enough power to fight. When Havok, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and X-Men of what Red Skull is doing, Magneto says he&#x27;s going to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, Red Skull appears. Red Skull now has the group mind-controlled. He plans on using the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s power to shape reality in his image. He tells Magneto to bow if he wants his daughter to remain alive, but Magneto performs a sneak attack enough to break Red Skull&#x27;s control over the others. In a fit of rage over finding mutants being used for freak medical experiments, Magneto kills the entire S-Men team. Magneto then attacks Red Skull, all while Red Skull tells Magneto that Professor X&#x27;s greatest fear was him leading the X-Men. Magneto kills Red Skull while the others look on in horror. Magneto believes everything is over only for Red Skull to reappear as a giant called Red Onslaught.

To combat Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form, Magneto forms an unnamed group consisting of Absorbing Man, Carnage, Deadpool, Doctor Doom, Enchantress, Hobgoblin, Jack O&#x27;Lantern V, Mystique, and Sabretooth. After the villains were inverted by the spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom, the group was soon named the Astonishing Avengers.

When Quicksilver and Magneto try to talk the inverted Wanda down, Wanda attacks them with a curse designed to punish her blood relatives, but when only Quicksilver reacts, Wanda realizes that Magneto is not their biological father. After Daniel Drumm&#x27;s ghost possesses Scarlet Witch and works with Doctor Doom to reverse the inversion spell, Magneto was affected by it and stopped being a threat to mankind.

When Magneto arrives on Genosha and is confronted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Magneto surrenders to them.

===Secret Wars===
During the &quot;Last Days&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Magneto had to make a choice during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. To save the mutant race, he must attempt to destroy the world colliding with his own. To save the mutant race, he must also protect the humans, who are currently celebrating him as a hero and look on with fascination at what he attempts to do when Earth-1610 throws Sentinels against him. As the energies of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 inched closer to impact cascade and send chaos through the streets, Magneto (aided by his daughter Polaris) are taking the fight to this &quot;other&quot; Earth, battling the parallel Sentinels sent after them. Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels. Magneto clearly has one goal in mind, as he rips a building to pieces to use against the killer robots, not caring much for the collateral damage, or the human lives at risk, as people in the building fall to the ground below. Polaris chides him for so reckless an action as she goes to the rescue while Magneto reminisces about the reason he is currently exhibiting this level of power. Magneto and his current right hand, Briar, work with a chemist under Magneto&#x27;s employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needs further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, Doctor Nemesis, and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive. In the present time, Magneto continues to use the very magnetic forces of the planet to aid him, yet that is more power than he could ever channel and very quickly begins taking a deadly toll on him. As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he does not believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man&#x27;s power amplifiers and his powers go into hyperdrive and he starts having brain aneurysms. In the present day, Magneto sees S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that her help will not be needed for much longer, and she says she does not understand but quickly figures out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he could not let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto&#x27;s powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth&#x27;s north and south magnetic poles and all the bioelectric energies of the Earth are channeled through him and he reflects on his life role.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, Magneto has been returned to life with no memories of his apparent demise. In the wake of the massive anti-mutant uprising, combined with the discovery that the Terrigen Mists that were spread in the atmosphere are harmful to mutants, Magneto has gathered together a team of mutants (consisting of Archangel, M, Psylocke, and Sabretooth) as his own X-Men to defend mutants at any cost.

===&quot;Civil War II&quot;===
During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline an Inhuman named Ulysses emerges who can &quot;foresee the future&quot;. This divides the superhero community, including the X-Men, with one faction led by Carol Danvers believing that the perpetrators of future crimes indicated by Ulysses&#x27; visions should be arrested to prevent said crimes, while an opposing faction led by Iron Man believes this would violate individual civil liberties. Magneto and some of the X-Men side with Iron Man, while Storm and the other X-Men side with Danvers. After reaching Ulysses, Magneto asks him why he should not kill or capture him, and Ulysses shows him visions that lead to Magneto leaving Ulysses and New Attilan. It is later shown to be a ploy by Medusa to avoid conflict.

===Inhumans vs. X-Men===
Following the 2016 &quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Magneto is killed by Psylocke per their agreement that she does this if he was to ever regress to his previous megalomaniacal approach to protecting mutantkind. Upon being left for dead in the Savage Land, his body was found by Exodus and healed by Elixir. Following the conclusion of the war between Inhumans and X-Men, with Medusa unleashing the device to destroy the Terrigen Cloud permanently, he was temporarily beaten by a maddened Emma, who lied to the rest of the mutants about the true death of Cyclops to trigger the war. He is later saved by Medusa and about to best Emma for her traitorous act, but Havok prevents him and Medusa from executing Emma for the sake of his late older brother.

===&quot;Secret Empire&quot;===
In the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Magneto wants to help the time-displaced original X-Men back to their home timeline. Magneto is approached by Captain America-Steve Rogers, whose memories have been altered by Red Skull&#x27;s clone using the powers of Kobik to cause Rogers to think that he is a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America-Rogers pitched an idea to Magneto that involved a piece of land in the western United States be granted to the mutants that would be their independent nation with the condition being that no inhabitant there would set foot on US soil. When Hydra takes over the United States, Magneto gives in to a deal from Captain America-Rogers, now a Hydra Supreme. As a result, New Tian is formed somewhere in California and Magneto fakes his death so that he can hide out in Madripoor. At the time when Emma Frost meets with Hydra Supreme Rogers the same time the resistances are fighting back Hydra, Magneto flies outside the Hydra Helicarrier and uses giant shards of metal to attack it, at the same time Emma and other mutants finally begins their moves on joining the resistance against Hydra to return the Captain America-Steve Rogers they once knew, who was revealed to be sealed inside by Kobik, and replaced and impersonated by his alternate Hydra Supreme counterpart (now goes the name &quot;Grant Rogers&quot; in the present) as a result of Red Skull&#x27;s manipulation on her all along.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Kitty Pryde leads Domino, Jubilee, Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm to Madripoor when they suspect that Magneto has excavated Wolverine&#x27;s body. When they meet with Magneto at the King&#x27;s Impresario Restaurant in Hightown, they discover that Magneto is actually Mindblast in disguise as it was part of an ambush by Viper and the Femme Fatales. Magneto is shown to be a prisoner of Viper and the Femme Fatales where Mindblast and Sapphire Styx put Magneto in a weakened state. When Kitty Pryde destroyed the psychic-enhancement equipment on Mindblast&#x27;s back, Magneto recovers and starts to take revenge on Mindblast until Kitty suggests he leaves her and helps to stop the rocket that will be sent to Soteira. Due to Magneto still recovering from what Mindblast put him through, Kitty Pryde was able to evacuate Rogue and Storm from the rocket. Then Kitty and Domino persuaded Magneto not to take revenge on Mindblast. Magneto spares Mindblast&#x27;s life and leaves her as a gift for helping him to escape. While Magneto denied any knowledge of taking Wolverine&#x27;s body, he works to destroy the launch site and purge Madripoor of Viper&#x27;s criminal empire while also pursuing Viper.

===House of X===
Working with Charles Xavier and Moira X, Magneto helps establish the new sovereign mutant nation known as Krakoa. He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they &quot;have new gods now.&quot;

===Judgment Day===
During the &quot;Judgment Day&quot; storyline, Magneto was on Arrako when Nightcrawler appeared to inform them about Destiny&#x27;s vision of a war with the Eternals. Arrako was later attacked by Uranos the Undying where Magneto was one of his victims. It turns out that he was non-lethally impaled by Uranos&#x27; fists after briefly using the metal emitted from Lodus Lugos. After Uranos left, Magneto was still alive as he states that the &quot;seat of loss takes command&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Magneto is a powerful mutant with the ability to manipulate magnetic fields to achieve a wide range of effects. He is classified as an Omega-level mutant.

The primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both ferrous and indirectly nonferrous metal via metal ores they may contain. Magneto is also capable of creating powerful electromagnetic fields capable of moving and manipulating non-metallic objects, as well as levitating them (he can also do this via force fields). He can even perceive tachyons and a variety of antiparticles. While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton nuclear submarine filled with sea water from the depths of the ocean. His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent. He can also generate electromagnetic pulses of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He even uses the electromagnetic energy that surrounds earth to fly. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body. Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a unified field which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a wormhole and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.

Magneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks. A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. &quot;X-Men&quot; #2). The most commonly used iteration of Magneto&#x27;s resistance to telepathy is his helmet which he had specially built to prevent Charles Xavier or any other high level telepath of reading, influencing or controlling his thoughts. The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the Secret Wars limited series. In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in astral projection. He has used Cerebro to locate mutants at great distances while leading the New Mutants. He has also, on rare occasions, been shown reading others&#x27; dreams, issuing telepathic commands, and probing the minds of others. He has demonstrated the ability to shield his mind, while in intense meditation, so completely that even Emma Frost was not able to read his thoughts, despite being directly in front of him and actively attempting to do so.

In addition to his powers, Magneto has many other skills. He is a genius with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially in genetic manipulation, particle physics, engineering, and other fields of technology. He has built advanced weaponry, space stations, superpowered humanoid lifeforms, and devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, block telepathy, and nullify all mutant powers across a few miles except for his own. He has promptly reconstructed such computerized devices from memory. He has bio-engineered new species including the Savage Land Mutates, and, using Deviant technology, Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. He is fluent in many human languages and once single-handedly deciphered the unknown language of a lost civilization. He possesses extraordinary skill in &quot;reading&quot; the microexpressions on others&#x27; faces and sensing what they are thinking and feeling, whether they are lying, fearful, etc. a skill which he refers to as &quot;taking your enemy&#x27;s measure&quot;. He also is a master strategist and tactician with extensive combat experience, and has often been successful in single-handed combat against entire groups of superhuman adversaries. He also has some military training in hand-to-hand combat and has been shown to be effective with his fists, but he prefers to use his powers when in combat situations.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
David Harth of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called Magneto the &quot;X-Men&#x27;s most iconic villain&quot;, writing: &quot;Tragedy molded Magneto into one of the most well-developed Marvel villains of all time. He&#x27;s also one of the most popular, which is why he&#x27;s reformed multiple times in the past. Few villains have had the same effect on the Marvel Universe as Magneto, and he&#x27;s changed the way fans perceive antagonists.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; asserted: &quot;Magneto has become bigger than his peers and virtually all of his enemies. It&#x27;s the sign of a great character when his presence dominates a story and his absence creates a vacuum that cannot be filled by any other. Through his legendary role in Marvel Comics over the years as well as fantastic portrayals in film and animation, it&#x27;s hard to argue that there has ever been a villain more complex, nuanced, sympathetic and yet irrevocably evil.&quot;

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Magneto&quot; - 2014 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Magneto&quot; #1 was the 19th best selling comic book in March 2014.

Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist&quot; called &quot;Magneto&quot; #1 &quot;tight, disturbing and even managed to be funny at times,&quot; asserting, &quot;Of all the classic super villains in the Marvel and DC universes, Magneto is the easiest sell as an ongoing series, simply because on some level we all sympathize with him. You couldn&#x27;t really do a Dr. Doom series, or a Joker series (both have been tried, both didn&#x27;t really work), and have it connect with an audience in the same way, but Magneto is an entirely different animal. So far, Marvel seems to be off a great start with this one, and this is definitely a book worth checking out.&quot; Mat Elfring of &quot;ComicVine&quot; gave &quot;Magneto&quot; #1 a grade of 5 out of 5 stars, saying, &quot; The majority of the time, when a member of the X-Men gets their own solo book, it lacks purpose and direction. It feels like a cash grab, waiting to fizzle out into cancellation. &quot;Magneto&quot; is a book with a purpose and it feels right. This first issue really sticks with the reader because of the tone and it blew me away. This book has a very talented writing and art team behind it. This first issue really grabs you, and while there are a few small problems, like what&#x27;s going on with Magneto&#x27;s powers and it being tough to swallow that Magneto is a bit of a Punisher archetype, the overall book is still fantastic.&quot;

==== &quot;X-Men Black: Magneto&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-Men Black: Magneto&quot; #1 was the 31st best selling comic book in October 2018.

Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;X-Men Black: Magneto&quot; #1 a grade of 3 out of 5, writing, &quot;Chris Claremont has a talent for filling in every corner of a character&#x27;s personality, and that talent is on display in X-Men Black: Magneto, where we learn about Magneto&#x27;s appreciation for speculative fiction, but his actual characterization of Magneto feels all over the place. The current metaplot of the X-Men line has sent Magneto on a fresh villain turn which Claremont seems forced to adhere to. But he seems to be resisting it as well, piling on justifications for every thought and action Magneto takes, painting a picture of Magneto that feels both incomplete and contradictory. The story also has at least one child who talks like a post-graduate thesis too many. Lonnie Nadler and Zac Thompson&#x27;s backup story centering on Apocalypse is more interesting. As the opening chapter in a story that will continue throughout X-Men Black, it&#x27;s just enough to whet your appetite, but Nadler and Thompson&#x27;s take on classic archvillain Apocalypse, Geraldo Borges&#x27; artwork, and the hook that reveals itself at the twist at the chapter&#x27;s end will have readers intrigued.&quot; Matt Lune of &quot;CBR.com&quot; said, &quot;&quot;X-Men Black: Magneto&quot; #1 gives us two stories, and each have their merits. In the main story, Claremont and Talajic provide an interesting character focus that, while not necessarily breaking any new ground, reinforces Magneto&#x27;s situation and pushes him forward with a new objective and a potential new character or two. Meanwhile, Thompson, Nadler and Borges&#x27; Apocalypse backup puts the villain back on the table in a fresh way that will be interesting to watch moving forward. We may be in a brief limbo with regards to the &quot;X-Men&quot; line, but &quot;X-Men Black&quot; has started in a strong way that shouldn&#x27;t be readily dismissed.&quot;

Magneto was ranked by IGN as the Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

In 2019, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Magneto 3rd in their &quot;X-Men: The 5 Deadliest Members Of The Hellfire Club (&amp; The 5 Weakest)&quot; list.

David Harth of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called Magneto the &quot;X-Men&#x27;s most iconic villain,&quot; writing, &quot;Tragedy molded Magneto into one of the most well-developed Marvel villains of all time.

==Other versions==
===1602===
In the alternative history of 1602, Magneto is known as Enrique, or the Grand Inquisitor, his true agenda a mystery. Born a Jew in the Venice Ghetto, he was taken in by a Christian priest and baptized. The Christians later refused to let him return to his Jewish family, saying that giving him back to the &#x27;Christ-killers&#x27; would damn his soul to Hell.

Being unable to reunite with his family left him psychologically scarred. When he grew up, he became the leader of the Spanish Inquisition and oversaw the Inquisition from Domdaniel. He was ordered to execute the witchbreed, but hid those who could pass off as normal. Enrique&#x27;s only known followers are his children Petros and Sister Wanda (Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, who are unaware of their parentage. Enrique is, and chooses not to tell them), and his spy in the Vatican, Toad. Enrique uses his position to further his needs and curry favor with influential figures, including King James of Scotland; towards this end, he has all &#x27;witchbreed&#x27; killed.

While Enrique is attempting to have Angel killed, the witchbreed is rescued by Iceman and Cyclops. This does not deter Enrique, who continues on his path until Toad is discovered to be a witchbreed by the Pope&#x27;s men, and to save his own life he sells out Enrique, Petros and Wanda. The trio are set to be sacrificed, but Enrique escapes and pursues many of the other heroes to America. However, the New World is under the threat of impending doom, and Richard Reed determines that to restore balance, Enrique has to co-operate.

With the help of Nick Fury and Thor, Enrique participates in the restoring of the world. He then tells his enemy, Carlos Javier, to train Petros and Wanda.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the reality of the Age of Apocalypse, Magneto founded Earth-295&#x27;s X-Men after the death of his friend Charles Xavier, at the hands of Xavier&#x27;s own son David who traveled back in time to kill Magneto hoping to fulfill his &quot;father&#x27;s greatest wish&quot;.

He and the X-Men fight against the forces of this world&#x27;s Apocalypse who, having been wakened early by the battle between David and Magneto, was able to take over North America in the absence of Xavier&#x27;s interference. Holocaust, Sinister, Mikhail Rasputin and Abyss are Apocalypse&#x27;s horsemen, and while Magneto&#x27;s team is composed not only of X-Men but also of standard &quot;evil&quot; mutants from traditional timelines, including mutants such as Sabretooth, other individuals who are &quot;heroes&quot; in Earth-616 serve Apocalypse in this timeline.

In this timeline, Magneto is married to his former protégé Rogue, and being able to touch due to his magnetic mastery over his own bio-aura, are able to have a son together who they name Charles, in honor of Xavier. Magneto and Charles are later personally captured by Apocalypse himself, though they are rescued by Rogue and the other X-Men, including Nate Grey, who raid Apocalypse&#x27;s citadel in a desperate final attempt to save all of reality from M&#x27;Kraan crystallization.

As the X-Men use the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal to send Bishop back in time to return the timeline to its proper course, Magneto and Nate Grey square off in one last fight against Apocalypse and Holocaust. Nate Grey jams the original fragment of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal into Holocaust, crystallizing them both, while the battle between Magneto and Apocalypse ends with Magneto using his control of magnetism to rip the techno-organic Apocalypse in half. Following this, Manhattan Island and most of North America are enveloped in nuclear bombs.

It is later revealed that the day was saved by Jean Grey, who manifested the Phoenix Force at the point of near-death.

However, nobody realizes this, and everyone assumes it is Magneto, who immediately becomes a reluctant hero to a grateful humanity. The X-Men then help rebuild America in record time, and Magneto is made Federal Director of Mutant Affairs of the government of the newly restored United States of America, with the X-Men deputized as a mutant police force sanctioned to bring to justice the remaining survivors of Apocalypse&#x27;s regime. Just as the burden of maintaining the deception eventually begins to take its toll on an extremely stressed Magneto, he is secretly visited by Mister Sinister (who everyone has assumed to have been killed by X-Man), who reveals to him just what really happened when the bombs fell. Sinister offers his silence in exchange for Magneto&#x27;s promises not to go looking for him and to let him have the body of Jean Grey, who is actually still alive. Magneto is forced to accept for the sake of preserving the current fragile peace of global mutant-human relations, which had improved primarily due to the general public&#x27;s mistaken assumption that he had personally saved the world by singlehandedly stopping nuclear armageddon. A subsequent scheme of revenge orchestrated by an embittered former X-Man later forces Magneto to confess the truth to the rest of the shocked team of X-Men. He is nearly killed by an enraged Weapon X, but is saved by the intervention of his wife. The X-Men then proceed to stop Sinister from conquering the world using his own version of the Sinister Six (which consisted of brainwashed mutants, including this world&#x27;s version of Dark Phoenix) in a violent confrontation filled with many deaths, including those of both Gambit and Quicksilver. Grief-stricken and guilt-ridden, Magneto then voluntarily goes into U.S. government custody as penance for his deception. While in jail awaiting trial, Magneto appoints a restored Jean Grey as the new leader of the X-Men in his absence.

===Amalgam===
In the Amalgam Comics universe, Erik Magnus is a heroic defender of Metamutants, leading his Brotherhood to save and protect them. After Sentinels created by Magneto&#x27;s villainous brother Will slaughter his Brotherhood, the heartbroken Erik uses Will&#x27;s own technology (combined with his power over magnetism) to create a team of &quot;Magnetic Men&quot;, each one formed from a different metal, and imbued with the personalities of his fallen comrades.

===Days of Future Past===

In this possible future, when Sentinels rule North America, Magneto is in a wheelchair and, like the rest of the surviving X-Men save Wolverine, held in a mutant concentration camp, his powers suppressed by an inhibitor collar. It is implied but never stated that he devised the X-Men&#x27;s plan to escape from the camp and send Kate Pryde&#x27;s spirit back through time. When Franklin Richards is able to disable the inhibitors and the other X-Men flee the camp, Magneto stays behind to cover their escape and is presumably killed by the Sentinels.

===Earth-110===
Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants allied with Doctor Doom, Hulk, Namor, Red Skull, and Ultron in a plot to take over Manhattan. Magneto was defeated by Mockingbird.

===Earth X===
In Earth X, Magneto resides in Sentinel City, a city he constructed after drawing all the Sentinels to the Savage Land and using the extra forces there, destroying all the sentinels and turning them into a city. He rules there with Toad.

After the Celestial is removed from the Earth, the resulting shifts due to the removal of the vibranium within the Earth shifts the magnetic poles such that Magneto is depowered and Toad is given all of Magneto&#x27;s powers. Toad forces Magneto to constantly dance and humiliates him at every opportunity by forcing him to become a Jester. When the vibranium is restored, Magneto&#x27;s powers are restored as well. Magneto then joins the other heroes in the fight against Creel.

===Exiles/Magnus===
In the &quot;Exiles&quot; comics, an alternative good version of Magneto living on Earth-27 falls in love with Rogue. Magneto uses his powers to alter Rogue&#x27;s DNA so they can touch and kiss. They have a child together, a son whom they name Magnus, who has both his magnetic powers and a white streak in his auburn hair. Magnus quickly shows the potential to be an even more powerful master of magnetism than his father. Unfortunately, during his teens, Magnus develops his second mutation, which turns anyone touched by his skin into immobile steel, never dying. Like his mother he cannot touch anyone. Magnus lives a lonely life, and is eventually forced to join the Exiles, a group of alternative reality mutants forced to repair broken realities. The Exiles first mission involves a reality where all superpowered individuals have been either exterminated or imprisoned. They are instructed to save the one individual who can save this broken reality. They mistakenly release a totally evil and depraved version of Professor Xavier who uses his mental powers without remorse or mercy. Magnus dies on the team&#x27;s mission after giving his life to stop a bomb set by the leader of high security prison. Later the Exiles learn that Magnus&#x27; corpse is trapped inside the Crystal Palace. They free it and return it to his homeworld, where Magnus is buried by his parents.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the reality of Marvel Zombies, Magneto and his Acolytes were a few of the survivors following a plague that caused an undead-like effect in &quot;super-powered beings&quot;. It is revealed in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days that he and Fabian Cortez made a deal with an unknown entity from another universe to damage the Earth to let mutants become the dominant force. Though they believe it is the zombie Sentry, the zombified Reed Richards later hypothesizes that it was with an entirely different universe unrelated to the zombie plague and that Sentry&#x27;s arrival was a coincidence misleading Magneto into believing he had led to the Earth&#x27;s ruin. Regretful that he has doomed the entire planet and his Acolytes either dead or having retreated to Asteroid M, Magneto returns to earth to help any non-infected beings left. He eventually hides out with a small group of human survivors, a female cop, a lone father and his daughter. He saves Reed Richards of the Ultimate Universe from the Zombies and brings him to their hideout, a subway station. Magneto acknowledges the irony of working with normal humans, but believing that &quot;Beggars can&#x27;t be choosers when you&#x27;re down to the last few people alive&quot;. Magneto learns the zombified Fantastic Four of his reality had tricked Reed, in a plan to allow the zombies to cross to Reed&#x27;s universe for more victims. Reed and Magneto work together, first getting diabetic medicine for the young girl, then taking the civilians back to the dimensional teleporter that Reed had emerged from, although they require the aid of the rest of the Fantastic Four to do so (Magneto is the first person outside of the team to explicitly refer to the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s Fantastic Four as &#x27;superheroes&#x27;). After Richards escapes with all three of the civilian survivors and his teammates, Magneto stays behind, not wanting to die but acknowledging that he is the only one capable of destroying Richards&#x27; dimensional transporter so that the zombies won&#x27;t infect Earth-1610.

Magneto destroys the device and flees from the zombies. He is contacted by the Acolytes in Asteroid M, who offer to send a shuttle down; Magneto, however, refuses to let them risk infection, and says that he will find a way up to them somehow. As the battle with the zombies takes place, Magneto decapitates the zombie Hawkeye with Colonel America&#x27;s shield. He attempts to decapitate the Colonel as well but only succeeds in slicing off the top half of Colonel America&#x27;s brain. The latter becomes very annoyed at this, demanding double rations when Magneto is caught. Magneto is soon confronted by more zombie hordes, whom he only destroys but with little success as result of them being undead, and prepares for a final showdown. He drops many of them with a rain of metallic debris, but is swiftly bitten by the zombie Wasp. Magneto is pounced upon and devoured before turning, his last words being &quot;&quot;I hope you choke on me&quot;!&quot; just as Thor and Hulk tear him in two as the rest of the group descends upon him.

In Marvel Zombies 2, a group known as the &quot;Acolytes&quot; established a cult to Magneto in New Wakanda. In Marvel Zombies vs. Age of Ultron Magneto is revealed to have become a zombie. Magneto is transformed into a robot zombie hybrid.

===MC2===
Several characters inspired by Magneto appear in &quot;MC2&quot;:

* Magneta- Also known as the Mistress of Magnetism. She first appeared in the comic J2, where she attempts to start her own superhero team. She later takes up crime as a new member of the Revengers in Last Planet Standing.
* Charlie Philip- He first appeared in Spider-Girl #44, where he wanted to become a crime fighter with magnetic power (With a device he created to wear). He wanted to become Magneto, but without the bad attitude. He came across Spider-Girl when he tried to steal a superhero costume as he had no money. His second appearance was in Spider-Girl #92 where he tried to secure/steal funds to become a superhero, this time posing as Magneto. He is stopped by Spider-Girl and X-People member Push.

===Mutant X===
In the Mutant X universe, Magneto is leader of the X-Men, just as he was for a time in the mainstream Earth-616 universe. Several of the X-Men, however, feel that he has strayed from Professor X&#x27;s dream and split off to form a separate mutant team, the Six.

===Old Man Logan===
On Earth-807128 during the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline, Magneto was among the villains that united to take down each of the superheroes. Hawkeye later mentioned to Old Man Logan that he and Absorbing Man killed Thor. He ruled a section of the Western United States until was weakened by old age enough to be killed by the new Kingpin. A flashback revealed that he took down Hawkeye&#x27;s group of Avengers with help from the Thunderbolts who were coerced by Baron Helmut Zemo. After reluctantly killing Scarlet Witch, Magneto covered this up to Baron Zemo by stating that he did not kill Scarlet Witch.

On Earth-21923, Magneto&#x27;s history remains the same.

===&quot;Powerless&quot;===
In &quot;Powerless&quot; (which takes place in a world without superpowers), Magneto appears as a middle-aged American senator named Eric Magnus. He is involved with a shadowy government conspiracy involving mentally conditioned assassins, and is ultimately killed by Logan after arranging the death of Charles Xavier.

===&quot;Ruins&quot;===
Warren Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Ruins&quot; is a two-part parody of &quot;Marvels&quot; where the circumstances that gave the normal Marvel Universe&#x27;s heroes their powers instead led to more realistic effects causing horrific deformities and deaths. The version of Magneto seen in &quot;Ruins&quot; is shown as a demonstrator protesting the corrupt regime of President Charles Xavier. His powers are uncontrollable, causing him to wear a magnetic-dampening harness around his chest. When a government agent pushes him aside and breaks the device, Magneto unwillingly brings destruction to an airport and kills the agent with a massive neural hemorrhage brought on by intense electromagnets. He meets his end when a plane gets magnetised towards him, killing many in the process.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel comics, Magneto, a.k.a. Erik Lehnsherr&#x27;s background differs greatly from his mainstream history. He has given contradictory accounts of his past; he once told Cyclops how his entire family had died in a large scale genocide (this could indicate a similar origin as the main continuity Magneto, only that he was a descendant of Shoah survivors, not a Shoah survivor himself), but he also claimed to come from a rich family with whom he no longer spoke; although it is possible the family he mentioned at that point was an adopted family, rather than his true family. In &quot;Ultimate Origins&quot; #3, it is revealed that his parents were Weapon X agents, and that he was responsible for their deaths. His wife&#x27;s name was Isabelle (whom he still possibly loves), and is aware from the beginning of his familial relationship with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. It is also noted that he verbally mistreats them, hinting that he regards them as a living reminder of having an inter-species relationship. An arrogant fantasist who gradually sank deeper and deeper into his self-proclaimed role as Mutant Messiah, Erik Lehnsherr eventually reinvented himself as Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants and a ruthless terrorist who is willing to kill hundreds in the name of mutant supremacy. Additionally, he was the one to cripple Professor X.

In addition, Magneto helped Xavier to create the Savage Land, using his knowledge of technology and genetics. He created an artificial language called Epsilon-Omega, based on Esperanto and featuring its own script, for mutants to use in the Savage Land, as a rejection of human languages. They even have plays, poetry and songs in this language.

This version of Magneto is significantly darker and more cynical than the mainstream version, regarding all humans with utter and unwavering disdain and likening them to &quot;insects&quot;. On several occasions, he has attempted to implement unflinchingly genocidal plans for humanity. More than once, dialogue refers to him actually consuming the flesh of human beings as he literally considers them to be animals. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream counterpart and has displayed enough power to defeat the Ultimates (even Thor, a literal god, on two occasions by taking his hammer). However, Magneto does believe that humanity has done some good things as is shown in his appreciation for art, especially that of René Magritte. Magneto was imprisoned in a special plastic cell in the Triskelion following the events of &quot;Return of the King&quot;, the sixth arc in the series. Aside from a brief mention in the &quot;Ultimate Six&quot; arc of Ultimate Spider-Man, he was then unseen until &quot;Magnetic North&quot;, the 12th arc and the final run for writer Brian K. Vaughan. Magneto was found to have hatched a scheme to escape, utilizing the willing cooperation of Forge and Mystique as well as the unknowing but amicable aid of Longshot&#x27;s mutation for luck.

Magneto escapes by the end of the arc, leaving Mystique in his cell to impersonate him. He and Longshot then exit the Triskelion unharassed and Magneto makes it clear to Longshot that he has something different planned than any of his more typical world-domination schemes.

Most recently, Magneto has shown up in the &quot;Aftermath&quot;, following the death of Charles Xavier. Magneto has apparently freed Forge from prison and there are signs that he is building something. Exactly where he is hiding is still unknown, but with Charles Xavier&#x27;s death he now believes it&#x27;s time to speed up his plan. He takes pleasure knowing his former friend is dead (unaware that he is in fact alive and was simply transported into the future). He has a close relationship with Mystique, and arranged for her to be freed from the Triskelion by having Mastermind take her place. He has also apparently established a mutant commune. He appears in Ultimates 3 along with the Brotherhood members Mystique, Blob, Sabretooth, Lorelei, and Multiple Man). They attack the Ultimates Mansion so he can talk to Quicksilver about re-joining the Brotherhood and retrieve Wanda&#x27;s body. Magneto appeared in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; and revealed that the Blob is Liz Allan&#x27;s father. He tried to recruit her into the Brotherhood.

In the crossover event &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Magneto uses Thor&#x27;s hammer with his magnetic powers to cause worldwide devastation, flooding New York, freezing Doctor Doom&#x27;s country and a portion of Europe, causing eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes in other locations. He also uses an army of suicide bombers composed of Jamie Madrox duplicates, mind-controlled by Lorelei. His army blows up the Academy of Tomorrow, including everyone inside, and the European Defense League. The suicide bombers also try to blow the Triskelion. Thanks to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Carol Danvers, and Iron Man, as well as timely assistance by Clint Barton and Hank Pym&#x27;s sacrifice, they fail to blow up the SH.I.E.L.D. base.

Because of Magneto&#x27;s actions the surviving Ultimates (Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Valkyrie, and Hulk) and some of the X-Men (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Wolverine, and Colossus) travel to Magneto&#x27;s floating home and after a fight. Angel is killed by Sabretooth and Wolverine is killed when Magneto removed the adamantium from his body after controlling Cyclops&#x27; visors and Iron Man&#x27;s lasers to shoot him. Then soon after, Nick Fury arrives. Due to Jean Grey&#x27;s abilities to connect minds together, Magneto learns the truth about mutants: they were created accidentally by some scientific experiments and not by God&#x27;s wish. Upon learning of this truth, Magneto pleads mercy from Cyclops, stating that Xavier would have done so, but Cyclops disintegrates Magneto&#x27;s head with an optic blast. Following the worldwide devastation caused by Magneto, the American government brings in new anti-mutant laws.

Recently, Magneto has resurfaced in Egypt alive where he is being worshipped as a God. Whilst doing this, he is instructing Wanda how best to ensure the protection of mutants. However, they are revealed to be illusions by Mister Sinister and Apocalypse.

===&quot;What if?&quot;===
There were various &quot;What If&quot; issues that had Magneto as a key character:

* What if? ... &quot;What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?&quot; - Following the death of Professor X, Cyclops, and Jean Grey at the hand of Cable, Magneto becomes dictator of the United States uniting the Freedom Force, the Morlocks, the Externals, Shadow King, the Nasty Boys, Fenris, the Savage Land Mutates, the Hellfire Club, and the Mutant Liberation Front. When he took over the White House, the president unleashed Sentinels which killed every mutant and non-mutant. Psylocke tried to warn Magneto about one Sentinel that carried a nuclear warhead, but it was too late. When Magneto destroyed the Sentinel, the nuclear warhead exploded killing him, Storm, Psylocke and every other mutant that was in the White House at the time. This was the Master of Magnetism&#x27;s first starring role in the series, spinning out of Uncanny X-Men #269.
* What if? ... &quot;What if Legion killed Magneto?&quot; - Magneto is the focus of this issue, through his mere absence is a departure from the Legion Quest and Age of Apocalypse storylines.
*What if? ... &quot;What if the Age of Apocalypse had not ended?&quot; - Prominently features Magneto continuing his role as leader of the X-Men, continuing after the events shown in Age of Apocalypse.
*What if? ... &quot;What if Magneto ruled all mutants?&quot; - Magneto leads the remains of mutantkind, as they float through space on Asteroid M. He manipulates his followers into believing a baby born among them is the next stage in human evolution beyond mutants, leading to the death of the baby. Realizing that the baby was actually just normal and Magneto did this to keep his followers together, Colossus leaves in disgust.
*What if? ... &quot;What if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together?&quot; - In an alternative reality, Magneto and Xavier&#x27;s confrontation with Baron Von Strucker did not end with Magneto leaving with Von Strucker&#x27;s gold. Instead, he was convinced by Gabrielle Haller to let go of his hatred. Together, Magnus and Xavier formed the X-Men and were responsible for advancing the mutant cause and aiding world peace.

===X-Men: Fairy Tales===
In the second issue of the &quot;X-Men: Fairy Tales&quot; limited series, based on the African story The Friendship of the Tortoise and the Eagle, Magneto appears as the eagle, alongside Professor X as the tortoise. Magneto/eagle has witnessed his family&#x27;s slaughter when he was young, and had to teach himself to fly and survive. He has many &#x27;demons&#x27; of his past that continue to haunt him, although while he is with his friend, Professor X/tortoise, they fade. When they come back to haunt him, he no longer believes in the friendship, thinking himself a danger to those around him.

He also appears in the Japanese story of The little peach boy in which he and his children are demons who have taken over a town. They are defeated by the peach boy (Cyclops) and animals that resemble other X-Men: Beast, Angel, and Iceman.

===X-Men: Noir===
In &quot;Marvel Noir&quot;, Eric Magnus is a Chief of Detectives in the New York City Homicide Department, a firm believer in eugenics, and leader of the secret society that rules over most organized crime in the city, the Brotherhood. His son, Peter, a former track star, has just joined Homicide, and his daughter, Wanda, is a local socialite who started a relationship with reporter Tom Calloway. Magnus appears to owe most of his success to Sebastian Shaw, the latter stating that the months of practice it took Magnus to lose his eastern European accent is the only thing that Magnus did not get from him. Magnus&#x27;s last name is revealed to be Magnisky, which the Ellis Island agent misheard as Magnus. He is currently seeking out Anna-Marie Rankin on behalf of Shaw so that they may use her against &quot;Unus the Untouchable&quot;, a crime boss and enemy of Shaw and Magnus.

<text>Magneto was a popular Mexican boy band of the 1980s and 1990s. The band formed on February 14, 1983. In 1986, Magneto was featured in &quot;Siempre en Domingo,&quot; a Mexican entertainment show viewed across Latin America and parts of Europe. Mexican teen pop group Magneto emerged in 1983. Their first record, Dejalo Que Gire came in 1984, followed by Super 6 Magneto. The Latin pop outfit suffered several lineup changes before achieving their first gold record in 1986. Mostly playing dance-pop songs, the five-member ensemble started touring Central America after climbing charts with &quot;Todo Esta Muy Bien,&quot; and &quot;Soy Un Soñador.&quot; However, their breakthrough came after issuing a Spanish-language version of Desireless&#x27; &quot;Voyage, voyage,&quot; a French pop hit from the &#x27;80s. In 1992 the boy band played the lead in their own movie, &quot;Cambiando el Destino&quot;. Magneto won the Lo Nuestro Award for Pop New Artist of the Year, and received two nominations for the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993: Pop Album (&quot;Magneto&quot;) and Pop Group of the Year. Nevertheless, the original Magneto disbanded in 1996 after a sold-out show at Mexico City&#x27;s Auditorio Nacional. 

A number of former Magneto members (the group&#x27;s 1993-1996 lineup of Alan Ibarra, Mauri Stern, Elias Cervantes, Toño Beltraneña, and Hugo de la Barreda, better known as Alex) reunited in 2009. 

In 2016, Magneto toured with Mercurio, a 1990s Mexican boy band. In 2017, they toured with Sentidos Opuestos, Mercurio and Kabah as part of the Únete a la fiesta concert series of 1990s pop music nostalgia.
Another original member of the group was Xavier Fux, he became a famous DJ

<doc id="362238" wikidata="Q929273" url="?curid=362238" title="Quicksilver (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Quicksilver (Pietro Django Maximoff) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in the comic book &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The character has since starred in two self-titled limited series and has historically been depicted as a regular team member in the superhero title &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

Quicksilver has the superhuman ability to move at great speeds. In most depictions, he is a mutant, a human born with innate superhuman powers. In comic book stories beginning in 2015, he is the product of genetic experimentation by the High Evolutionary. Quicksilver most commonly appears in fiction associated with the X-Men, having been introduced as an adversary for the superhero team. In later stories, he became a superhero himself. He is the twin brother of the Scarlet Witch and, in most depictions, the son of Magneto and a Sinti woman Magda, and the older half-brother of Polaris.

Debuting in the Silver Age of comic books, Quicksilver has featured in several decades of Marvel continuity, starring in the self-titled series &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and as a regular team member in superhero title the &quot;Avengers&quot;.

The character has also appeared in a range of movie, television, and video game adaptations. Two separate live-action versions of Quicksilver have been adapted by two different film studios: Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise, appearing in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014) as a cameo and &quot;&quot; (2015) while Evan Peters portrayed him in the 20th Century Fox films &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019), as well as a cameo in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018). Peters later appeared as an imposter Pietro in the MCU television series &quot;WandaVision&quot; (2021), as a nod to his past role.

==Publication history==

Quicksilver first appears in &quot;X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964) and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby. The character initially appears as an antagonist to the X-Men, although before long he becomes a member of the Avengers and appears as a regular character in that title beginning with &quot;The Avengers&quot; #16 in May 1965. He has made numerous other appearances in that title, and other related titles, sometimes as a member of the team, sometimes as an ally, and sometimes as an antagonist.

From 1991 to 1993 Quicksilver was a regular character in the first volume of &quot;X-Factor&quot;. The series emphasized the character&#x27;s irritability and arrogance, which writer Peter David felt were a natural consequence of his powers, explaining: 
Quicksilver also starred in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, a regular ongoing eponymous series that began in November 1997 and ran for 13 issues.

The character also played a pivotal role in the &quot;House of M&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Quicksilver appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #39 (January 2013). He appears as one of the members of &quot;All-New X-Factor&quot;, which was launched in 2014 as part of the second Marvel NOW! wave. Writer Peter David&#x27;s handling of the character in that book earned the character a 2014 @ssie award from Ain&#x27;t It Cool News. 
AICN&#x27;s Matt Adler commented that David writes the character best and that the &quot;arrogant, impatient speedster&quot; made the title worth following.

==Fictional character biography==
Pietro and his twin sister, Wanda, were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a Romani couple. As adolescents, Pietro Django Maximoff and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the Roma camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The traumatic separation from their family erased almost all of Wanda and Pietro&#x27;s childhood memories, with only vague recollections resurfacing in adulthood. Over the next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered Central Europe, living off the land.

The character first appears with Wanda, now called the Scarlet Witch, as a part of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. The siblings were presented as mutants, with Pietro possessing superhuman speed and Wanda able to control probability. The pair are recruited by Magneto after he saves Wanda from a mob after she accidentally causes a house to burst into flame. Quicksilver stays with her to protect her. After several confrontations with the X-Men, they depart when Magneto and his lackey the Toad are abducted by the cosmic entity the Stranger. They then travel back to Europe. Pietro and his sister reform and are recruited by Iron Man to the superhero team the Avengers, after they discover they are advertising for new members and want to get support for themselves.

Together with the leader Captain America and former villain Hawkeye, the four become the second generation of Avengers, and are later dubbed &quot;Cap&#x27;s Kooky Quartet&quot;. Quicksilver first thinks he should be the leader and would sometimes quarrel with the other members. The Scarlet Witch becomes close friends with Hawkeye and both become loyal members of the team until Wanda is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister. The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base, where he captures the X-Men and Pietro skirmishes with the X-Man Cyclops. The twins finally realize that Magneto is the true villain. Pietro and Wanda reappear in the title &quot;X-Men&quot; and are then kidnapped along with several other mutants by the robot Sentinels, and are subsequently freed by the X-Men.

The character reappears in the title &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and advises the team that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord Arkon. After Wanda is rescued, Pietro and his sister rejoin the team. During one mission Quicksilver is wounded by a Sentinel and is found by Crystal, a member of the Inhumans. Crystal nurses Pietro back to health, and the pair are eventually married. Pietro and Wanda also meet Robert Frank—formerly World War II hero, the Whizzer—who was present at Mount Wundagore (the birthplace of the siblings) with his wife at the time of their birth. Frank briefly joins the Avengers, believing Pietro and Wanda to be his children. The Scarlet Witch also becomes romantically involved with her Avengers teammate, the Android Vision. Although Pietro initially disapproves, he eventually gives his blessing to their marriage.

Quicksilver features with the Inhumans and Fantastic Four against the villain Sphinx, and the siblings&#x27; origin is explored in the title &quot;Avengers&quot; when a Romani man by the name Django Maximoff, (who is soon revealed to be their biological father), kidnaps Pietro and Wanda and returns to Mount Wundagore in the country of Transia, where they were born. After a battle with the Avengers against the Elder God Chthon, the siblings learn from Bova, one of the &quot;New Men&quot; created by the High Evolutionary, that they are the children of Maximoff, and not Robert Frank. Quicksilver then returns to Attilan (city of the Inhumans) and is revealed to have had a daughter (Luna) with Crystal.

During the limited series &quot;Vision and the Scarlet Witch&quot;, Magneto forces Bova to reveal the truth about his missing children, who are revealed to be Pietro and Wanda. After their mother Magda dies in childbirth, the children are given by the High Evolutionary to Django Maximoff to raise as his own. Pietro and Wanda reject Magneto when told. His marriage to Crystal is also strained when she has an affair. Maximus the Mad uses technology to cause Quicksilver to become psychotic. This drove him to frame the Avengers for treason as his perceptions are twisted to perceive them as having &#x27;betrayed&#x27; him, forcing them to escape the government-sponsored Freedom Force, and then deal with Quicksilver&#x27;s new &#x27;team&#x27; of LMD-based duplicates of the Zodiac, until the Vision convinces Pietro to stand down by showing him images of his newborn nephews.

Quicksilver battles the West Coast Avengers and is captured by the Inhumans and cured of his condition. In an effort to repent for his actions, Pietro aids the Avengers West Coast against Magneto and the villain Immortus, who has captured Wanda. Although successful, Pietro refuses to return to Crystal and joins the U.S. government-sponsored superhero team X-Factor. The character and Crystal are reunited during the storyline &quot;Bloodties&quot; when the Avengers, X-Factor and X-Men team to stop a group of mutant terrorists who kidnap their daughter Luna, and are responsible for a civil war on the island nation of Genosha. After dealing with the threat, Quicksilver learns of Crystal&#x27;s relationship with Avenger the Black Knight and leaves, also resigning from X-Factor.

Quicksilver takes his daughter Luna and travels to Mt. Wundergore, aiding the High Evolutionary and his Knights of Wundagore against Exodus and the Man Beast. Quicksilver uses the experimental &quot;Isotope E&quot; to augment his powers, allowing him to move at greater supersonic speeds. A future version of Pietro called &quot;Nestor&quot; appears and reveals that his powers are not speed but rather temporal based. Quicksilver also rejoins a reformed Avengers.

With half-sister Polaris, Quicksilver spies on their father Magneto, who is now the ruler of Genosha. Quicksilver is banished when he rallies the Avengers against Magneto.

===House of M===
Quicksilver plays a pivotal role in the limited series &quot;House of M&quot;, convincing his now mentally unstable sister Wanda to use her abilities to warp reality and create a world where mutants are in a majority and humans are the minority. Thanks to Wolverine retaining his memories, along with the mysterious Layla Miller, many of Earth&#x27;s heroes regain their memories and battle Magneto, who also remembers and realizes that Pietro is to blame for this mistake. Magneto kills Quicksilver (crushing his body with a robot Sentinel) in a rage at this perceived &#x27;abuse&#x27; of his dream, although the character is resurrected and the normal reality restored when the Scarlet Witch witnesses this, telling Magneto he cares more for mutants than his own children. In retaliation the Scarlet Witch has also depowered 98% of the mutant population, which by accident includes Quicksilver.

===Son of M===
The story continues in the limited series &quot;Son of M&quot;, with Quicksilver, desperate to regain his powers, exposing himself to the Terrigen Mist (the source of the Inhumans&#x27; mutations and abilities) and inserts Terrigen crystals into his body—all without permission from Black Bolt. Courtesy of the Terrigen crystals, Quicksilver gains new &quot;time jumping&quot; powers and kidnaps his daughter Luna. Quicksilver discovers the crystals can restore mutant abilities but have an extreme effect on non-Inhuman physiology, causing several deaths. Quicksilver and Crystal meet again in the direct sequel, limited series &quot;Silent War&quot; when Black Bolt demands the return of the crystals. When Crystal sees how he has mutated, she declares their marriage annulled according to Inhuman law.

In the title &quot;X-Factor&quot;, the crystals are removed from Quicksilver&#x27;s body by Rictor, leaving him powerless once again. Destitute and jailed for vagrancy in the one-shot &quot;X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead&quot;, Quicksilver has a series of hallucinations and inexplicably regains his super speed. Escaping jail, Quicksilver rescues an innocent and rediscovers his desire to be a hero.

===Mighty Avengers===
Quicksilver appears in the title &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; and is used as a pawn by Elder God Chthon, with the character&#x27;s spirit trapped in the arcane called the Darkhold. The Avengers defeat Chthon, and Quicksilver&#x27;s consciousness is &quot;downloaded&quot; into the body of Vision, before being restored to his own body. Quicksilver joins the team after learning that it is Wanda (Asgardian god Loki in disguise) who brought the team together. After the events of the Secret Invasion storyline the character is publicly exonerated of former crimes, with an unknown Skrull being blamed (although Hank Pym, Maximoff&#x27;s daughter Luna, and Avengers butler Edwin Jarvis are aware of the lie). Quicksilver also resumes wearing his original green costume. Quicksilver loses the respect of his daughter Luna when he lies to the Inhumans and claims that many of his past actions were actually perpetrated by a Skrull impostor, although Pym tolerates the lie as he feels that Quicksilver deserves a chance to redeem himself.

Quicksilver finally learns that the person he thought was his sister is actually Loki in disguise. Enraged, he and the rest of the team travel to the Isle of Silence to set a trap for the god of mischief. After imprisoning Loki in a device designed by Hank Pym, he begins torturing the god for information about Wanda&#x27;s whereabouts. Loki offers no information about her and manages to contact Thor to beg for his help. Thor arrives and attacks Quicksilver for the way he is treating Loki. He is able to outrun the thunder god&#x27;s lightning but is eventually overpowered. He is one of the Avengers who joins Hercules, Amadeus Cho and their allies in an assault on Olympus Group Headquarters. He battles Amazon warrior women alongside Zeus and helps a wounded Wolverine defeat the Huntsman, stabbing him through the chest with his own weapon.

Quicksilver is later summoned by the Ghost using Amadeus Cho&#x27;s technology, to defend Asgard against the Thunderbolts. He single-handedly defeats Mister X who is in possession of the Spear of Odin. Mr. X is not able to react quickly enough despite his abilities and Quicksilver viciously beats him down with a piece of debris. He is seen alongside the other Avengers against the Void-possessed Sentry in the events of Siege.

===Avengers: The Children&#x27;s Crusade===
Quicksilver is searching for his sister in Wundagore when Magneto and the Young Avengers go to find the Scarlet Witch. After trying to abduct his nephew Wiccan so he can assist him in finding his sister, he is stopped by his father and his other nephew, Speed. After Wiccan suggests that maybe Magneto actually did want to make up for his past, he became angry and said, &quot;Nephew the last time I allowed myself to believe that... My father tried to kill me&quot;. Quicksilver prepares to fight his father but when debris from his rampage strikes his sister it is found that the Scarlet Witch there is actually a Doombot in disguise. The journey takes Quicksilver and his comrades all the way to Latveria so they rescue the Scarlet Witch. After the Scarlet Witch turns herself into the X-Men and the Avengers a fight breaks out between the two groups. After being knocked out along with all the other Avengers and X-Men by his sister, he is finally reunited with his sister.

===Heroic Age===
Quicksilver joins the teaching staff of Avengers Academy to teach young students how to become heroes. He does so in order to distance himself from the legacy of his father Magneto. One of the new students, Finesse, figures out that his story about being abducted by Skrulls is a lie. She blackmails him into giving her &quot;private lessons&quot; on everything he learned during his time with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Finesse convinces Quicksilver to help her search for the Taskmaster, who might be her biological father. After arriving at what they thought was an abandoned training camp, they found it still in use and quickly captured the criminals they found there. Quicksilver returned to the mansion and encountered Tigra, who was upset because some of the students assaulted the Hood on her behalf. During a heated exchange Quicksilver managed to convince her that kicking them out of Avengers Academy for trying to help would only turn them against becoming heroes. At the new campus for the Avengers Academy (where the Faculty are offering to train other superpowered youths), Quicksilver is revealed to be mentoring Lightspeed as a teacher&#x27;s assistant.

In the miniseries &quot;Magneto: Not a Hero&quot;, Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Toad are clones created by Joseph.

Quicksilver has joined the privately owned superhero team X-Factor. When confronted during a press conference by Fatale over his actions meant to repower mutants and his lying about a Skrull having been responsible, Pietro finally admitted in public that he had been responsible and had tried to avoid facing the consequences; by doing this, he earned his daughter&#x27;s love and respect back, and the two reconciled.

Wanda and other heroes and villains experienced a moral inversion during a clash with the Red Onslaught. Quicksilver and Magneto try to talk the inverted Wanda down, but when Wanda attacks them with a curse designed to punish her blood relatives that only affects Quicksilver, Wanda realizes that Magneto is not their biological father.

Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch later take a trip to Counter-Earth. After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous (a female who was created by the genetic material of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver), Pietro and Wanda were brought to the High Evolutionary himself. He revealed to them that they are actually the long thought deceased children of Django and Marya Maximoff, Anna and Mateo. He also told them the truth where they were not mutants at all, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. After escaping from the High Evolutionary&#x27;s experimentations, Pietro and Wanda located the Avengers Unity Division (who had traveled to the Counter-Earth looking for the twins) and helped the inhabitants of Lowtown (a refuge for the High Evolutionary&#x27;s rejects) from their creator&#x27;s assault. After the High Evolutionary is defeated and he escapes into a portal with Luminous, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch return to Earth with the Avengers Unity Division.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
When the second superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right - Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. Wanda reveals to him that she is seeking answers about their true biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (who gave the twins to her relatives Marya and Django to spare them from a difficult life) and asks him to join her. He refuses and the two fight, although Wanda bests Quicksilver and tells him she never wants to see him again. Natalya&#x27;s spirit later summons Pietro during their final battle against a physical manifestation of Chaos. The twins reconcile after destroying the monster and Pietro is briefly able to meet his mother before she sacrifices herself to save witchcraft. He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a &#x27;sleeper agent&#x27; in the Avengers as part of the Skull&#x27;s current campaign.

In &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, Quicksilver joins the Underground, a resistance movement against Hydra, following their takeover of the United States. Quicksilver and Hercules lead a strike force to find the Cosmic Cube fragments and restore Captain America and the country to normal.

===Marvel Legacy===
During the &quot;Avengers: No Surrender&quot; storyline, Quicksilver is one of the heroes remaining in the cosmic game between Grandmaster and Challenger. He is frozen because of Scarlet Witch’s attempt at reviving the frozen Vision, but the process was later reversed. He later uses his extreme agility and Scarlet Witch&#x27;s powers to catch the beacon trapping his fellow Avengers, but in doing so he had pushed himself to the limit and apparently died. But in the following mini-storyline of &quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot;, it is revealed that he became stuck in an alternate dimension, ultimately getting himself free and returning to the Avengers.

In &quot;Empyre&quot;, Quicksilver, Mockingbird, and Wonder Man deal with the Kree and the Skrull&#x27;s fight with the Cotati near Navojoa. When Quicksilver is hit by special spheres fired by the Cotati magicians, Mockingbird and Wonder Man come to his aid and help the Kree and the Skrull turn the tide against the Cotati. Quicksilver recovers his stamina and uses his super-speed to break up the fight and dispose of the Kree and Skrull weapons in the Gulf of California.

In &quot;Blood Hunt&quot;, Quicksilver assists Captain America&#x27;s branch of the Avengers in battling the vampires&#x27; invasion of Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Quicksilver was presented as a mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. At times Quicksilver has even been capable of running past the speed of light, exposure to the High Evolutionary&#x27;s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. His speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro&#x27;s mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, &quot;Have you ever stood in line at a banking machine behind a person who didn&#x27;t know how to use it?... Now, imagine, Doctor, that everyone you work with, everywhere you go, your entire world is filled with people who can&#x27;t work cash machines&quot;.

Quicksilver lost his powers of speed when his sister removed most of his powers, but he gains new powers courtesy of the inhumans&#x27; Terrigen Mist. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and &quot;jump&quot; into the future. He can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by &quot;jumping&quot; into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, he could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. However, the effect was usually fatal. The crystals were subsequently forced from his body by the mutant Rictor, leaving him without these abilities. After having a series of hallucinations, Quicksilver saw a woman in mortal danger and felt a desire to be a hero which made him regain his original powers in order to save the woman&#x27;s life. Later on, Quicksilver regained these enhanced powers of time &quot;jumping&quot; and temporal duplication for a while by physically imbedding the crystals into his flesh.

It was later revealed that Quicksilver actually was a normal child that was put through several experiments by the High Evolutionary which granted his powers in the first place.

Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; said, &quot;Origin stories make superheroes. They tell us about a character&#x27;s motivations, dreams, and memories. They&#x27;re the perfect insight into why a character becomes a hero (or a villain). As readers, we need origin stories to understand the heroes we love. For a long time, Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver had a half-formulated backstory. At first, they were just members of Magneto&#x27;s brotherhood. But, eventually, they realized that they were also Magneto&#x27;s children. The older comics don&#x27;t give us an up-close look at Wanda&#x27;s childhood, so in 2011 writer Sean McKeever tackled retelling Wanda and Pietro&#x27;s story in a modern climate. The result was &quot;Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver&quot;, which finally gave readers the origin story they wanted. If you want to read about Scarlet Witch, but have no idea where to start, this is the issue for you.&quot; George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked &quot;Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver&quot; 6th in their &quot;The best Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch stories of all time&quot; list, asserting, &quot;In comic books, Wanda and Pietro&#x27;s time as villains was short-lived, and their prior history wasn&#x27;t largely explored until years later, through glimpses and scattered stories. But 2011&#x27;s &quot;Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch &amp; Quicksilver&quot; takes a deeper dive into the histories of the titular heroes, showing their past and the lead-up to their time with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in a way that wasn&#x27;t previously told on the page. Wanda and Pietro&#x27;s history is one of the most unlikely backbones of the Marvel Universe, with their simple origins growing from a throughline between the X-Men and Avengers to the saga of a family tree that has branches throughout Marvel Comics, and &quot;Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch &amp; Quicksilver&quot; presents a concise and engaging take on their earliest days.&quot;

==== &quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot; #1 was the 119th best selling comic book in May 2018.

Joe Grunenwald of &quot;ComicsBeat&quot; asserted, &quot;&quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot; #1 is an entertaining first issue about a complicated protagonist. This series spins out of the events of &quot;Avengers: No Surrender&quot;, but is still perfectly accessible for new readers (like me), and only briefly mentions previous events before getting into its own story. It&#x27;s a solid beginning for the series.&quot; Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; called &quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot; #1 a &quot;brilliant character-focused comic,&quot; saying, &quot;&quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender #1&quot; starts off on the right foot with a ponderous and self-reflective issue for Pietro Maximoff. Ahmed, Nguyen, and Renzi provide a compelling conflict for our hero with brilliant artwork and stunning color. This one gets a strong recommendation. Give it a read.&quot; Aaron Berkowitz of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;Quicksilver: No Surrender&quot; #1 a score of 90%, writing, &quot;has amazing characterization. Ahmed writes Pietro near-flawlessly. The plot is also incredibly intriguing. I want to know how Pietro gets out of this mess. However, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the art. Flip through the issue at your local comic shop and decide for yourself. For me, the writing was well worth the read, and may be well worth your $3.99.&quot;

==Other versions==

===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
Quicksilver appears in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;. When he and the other Avengers go to the DC Universe, he becomes fascinated with the Speed Force and becomes a rival of the Flash, seeking to steal his powers.

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified alternate universe variant of Quicksilver from Earth-2149 appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;.

===Marvel 1602===
An alternate universe variant of Quicksilver from Earth-311 appears in &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;. This version is Petros, Enrique&#x27;s assistant in the Spanish Catholic Church.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Marvel features Quicksilver as Pietro Lensherr as the son of Magneto and a woman named Isabelle. As a teenager, he was capable of reaching speeds of Mach 10 and spent most of his life in the Savage Land.

After he and his sister Wanda/Scarlet Witch, defected from their abusive father&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, they joined the Ultimates for amnesty. During the Ultimate X-Men&#x27;s Magnetic North story arc, he watched over his father while he was imprisoned in the Triskelion, and threatened to kill him. In &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot;, he and his sister are apparently killed by Ultron; however, Quicksilver later resurfaced at the end of the Absolute Power story arc, and killed Moira MacTaggert.

In &quot;Ultimatum&quot; #5, Quicksilver assassinated Cyclops as he is giving a speech at Washington, D.C., using the same bullet that was used to murder the Scarlet Witch.

Following the deaths of major characters of the X-Men and the Brotherhood, Pietro began to search for new Brotherhood team members. Mystique, Sabretooth and Teddy (the son of Blob) joined him in Wundagore, along with an apparently reborn Wanda.

Following his sister&#x27;s orders, Quicksilver tried to help the White House, only resulting in the death of many mutants at the hands of Nimrod Model Sentinels, which were controlled by the Reverend Stryker before his death. When Pietro arrived in Egypt, he met his father, Erik, completely alive. However, this was revealed to be an illusion from Sinister. He attempts to manipulate his younger half-brother, Jimmy Hudson, but is defeated.

Later, he helps Reed Richards assemble some of the Infinity Gems and joins his team of Dark Ultimates. Quicksilver is fatally wounded after he turns against Richards and Kang, and chooses to die by Wanda&#x27;s graveside.

Pietro later appeared to have been somehow brought back to life. He witnessed an instance of the cosmic phenomenon known as an &quot;incursion&quot;, the one which caused a collision between the planet Earth of his universe and that of an alternate reality, Earth-616, that resulted in the destruction of both universes.

When the Multiverse is restored after the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Quicksilver and the other foreign mutants, namely Jimmy, Nomi Blume aka Mach Two, Derek Morgan and Hisako Ichiki/Armor, were abducted by super-villain geneticist Miss Sinister, who brainwashed and turned them into her personal enforcers, the New Marauders. When Jimmy&#x27;s natural resistance to telepathy allowed him to break free from Miss Sinister&#x27;s control and he went rogue, the New Marauders were deployed to retrieve him. In the process, they confronted the Time-Displaced Original X-Men, who had tracked down Jimmy after he was detected by Cerebro. Following a brief confrontation against the X-Men and Jimmy during which Marvel Girl learned of Miss Sinister&#x27;s involvement, the New Marauders were ordered by their superior to leave. Quicksilver later died due to the Mothervine experiments that was conducted on him where the other displaced mutants survived these experiments. The X-Men later found his body in one of Miss Sinister&#x27;s abandoned laboratories.

===What If?===
Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch appear in the &quot;What If?&quot; story &quot;What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?&quot; as allies of Beast following the demise of the X-Men and upon the menace by Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men.

===Film===
Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to 20th Century Fox, who created a film series based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which focused on characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers (see below). As a result, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch became part of a claims dispute between the two studios, with Fox citing the pair being mutants and children of Magneto and Marvel citing the pair&#x27;s editorial history making them more closely associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. In time, the two studios came to an agreement, allowing each other to use the characters so long as Fox did not reference them as members of the Avengers and Marvel did not mention them as mutants or children of Magneto. The arrangement became moot following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney - the parent company of Marvel Studios, and the confirmation that future X-Men films will take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

====Fox Films====
A version of Quicksilver renamed as Peter Maximoff appears in the Fox films &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016), &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018), and &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019) portrayed by Evan Peters. This version is an American teenager and an acquaintance of Logan&#x27;s in the future. To demonstrate his super-speed, &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; director Bryan Singer shot all of Quicksilver&#x27;s scenes in 3,600 frames per second. Over the course of his appearances, Peter helps the X-Men fight Apocalypse before joining them and learns Magneto is his father, but chooses not to tell him.

====Marvel Cinematic Universe====
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Pietro Maximoff is portrayed by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. He first appeared alongside his twin sister Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) in a mid-credits scene for &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), with the two subsequently appearing in leading roles in &quot;&quot; (2015). Pietro and Wanda seek revenge on Tony Stark, whose weapons killed their parents, by joining Hydra, who use the Mind Stone to grant them superhuman powers after they volunteer to be experimented on. After Stark and the Avengers defeat the Hydra cell they were working with, the Maximoffs join forces with Ultron, only to learn he intends to kill all of humanity and defect to the Avengers to stop him. While thwarting his plot, Pietro dies while saving Hawkeye and a small child. Despite Taylor-Johnson signing a multi-picture deal, producer Kevin Feige has stated that there are no plans for Pietro to appear in future films. Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Fox&#x27;s film division, Taylor-Johnson was asked if he might return to the role, with the implication being that Evan Peters&#x27; competing version played a part in Feige&#x27;s prior statement. While he expressed belief both parties were open to the possibility in the future, Taylor-Johnson reiterated that there were no immediate plans for him to reprise his role - specifically addressing speculation he would appear in the Disney+ series &quot;WandaVision&quot;. Although Taylor-Johnson did not reprise his role in the series, the character would be referenced, with Gabriel Gurevich portraying him as a child in flashbacks to Wanda&#x27;s childhood, while Peters portrays Ralph Bohner, a resident of Westview who is brainwashed by Agatha Harkness and forced to impersonate Pietro to get close to Wanda until he is freed by Monica Rambeau.

===Literature===
In &quot;What If... Wanda Maximoff and Peter Parker were siblings?&quot; by Seanan McGuire, Wanda is taken in by Richard and Mary Parker when she is discovered in a facility as an infant, apparently alone. Pietro later comes to America and attempts to convince Wanda to accompany him back to Latveria, where he was taken in by Doctor Doom. However, it is revealed that Doom arranged for the Maximoffs to be augmented with their powers but was put out when he only received Pietro rather than Wanda, as her powers were of more interest to him. When Wanda chooses her life in America with her adopted family, including Peter and May Parker, Pietro ultimately attempts to force Wanda to come back with him by framing her for Captain America&#x27;s murder, but Wanda, Peter and Doctor Strange discover the truth and force Pietro to flee.

<text>Zabul (Pashto/Dari: ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the south of the country. It has a population of 249,000. Zabul became an independent province from neighbouring Kandahar in 1963. Historically, it was part of the Zabulistan region. Qalat serves as the capital of the province. The major ethnic group are Pashtuns. Primary occupations within Zabul are agriculture and animal husbandry.

==Geography==
Zabul borders Oruzgan in the north, Kandahar in the west and in the south, Ghazni and Paktika in the east. It borders Pakistan in the east.

The province covers an area of 17293 km2. Two-fifths of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain (41%) while more than one quarter of the area is made up of flat land (28%).

The primary ecoregion of the province is the central Afghan mountains xeric woodlands. Common vegetation is listed as dry shrub-land and pistachio. The high mountains of the northern portion of the province are in the Ghor-Hazarajat alpine meadow ecoregion, which is characterized by meadows, willows, and sea buckthorn.

== Transportation ==

In 2006, the province&#x27;s first airstrip was opened near Qalat, to be operated by the Afghan National Army, but also for use by commercial aviation. Twice weekly service was scheduled by PRT Air between Qalat and Kabul. The airstrip is not paved. The ANA Chief in Zabul is Major General Jamaluddin Sayed

Zabul Province is bisected by Highway 1 and travelers going between Kandahar and Kabul via road typically pass through the province.

On 4 September 2016, at least 38 people were killed and 28 were injured during the September 2016 Afghanistan road crash.

==Healthcare==


The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 0% in 2005 to 32% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 1% in 2005 to 5% in 2011.

==Education==
The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 1% in 2005 to 19% in 2011. 
The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 31.3% in 2005 to 5% in 2011.

== Demographics ==


As of 2021, the total population of the province is about 391,150, which is mostly a rural tribal society. According to the Naval Postgraduate School, the population is primarily Pashtuns, sprinkled throughout around 2,500 remote villages. Major tribal groups include the Tokhi, Hotak, Nasar, Kharoti, Taraki, Ghilji and the Noorzai and Panjpai Durrani.

Pashto is the dominant language in the area. The people of Zabul are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Primary occupations within Zabul are agriculture and animal husbandry.

60.8% of the population lived below the national poverty line, one of the highest figures of all of Afghanistan&#x27;s provinces.

Zabul is by many indications one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most religious conservative provinces.

<text>Zabol () is a city in the Central District of Zabol County, Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. Zabol is near the border with Afghanistan.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
The people of Zabol are a mix of Persians who speak a variant of the Persian language and known as &quot;Sistani&quot; or Seistani which is very similar to Dari, also known as Afghan Persian, and a small minority of Baloch who speak Balochi, a Northwestern Iranian language.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 130,642 in 27,867 households. The 2011 census counted 137,722 people in 33,957 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 134,950 people in 35,401 households.

==Geography==
===Location===
Zabol is located near Lake Hamun, in the endorheic Sīstān Basin, and the region is irrigated by the Helmand River. Lake Hamun is a seasonal lake that is often dry.

Zabol is connected by road to Milak and Zaranj (across the border in Afghanistan). The Delaram-Zaranj Highway provides road connectivity to the rest of Afghanistan. Zabol thus provides Afghanistan access to the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf via the Port of Chabahar. Zabol has a regional airport.

===Air pollution===
The Zabol area is well known for its &quot;120-day wind&quot; (&quot;bād-e sad-o-bist-roz&quot;), a highly persistent dust storm in the summer which blows from north to south. The disappearance in the 2000s of the nearby Hamoun wetlands has exacerbated the dusty conditions in Zabol, leading the World Health Organization to name Zabol the most polluted city in the world in 2016. A 2017 study in the journal &quot;Preventive Medicine&quot; suggested that the harm from 30 minutes of cycling outdoors in Zabol&#x27;s polluted air would outweigh the benefits of the exercise.

===Climate===
Zabol has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;).
== Colleges and universities ==

The city is home to Zabol University, the largest university in the city, as well as the Zabol Medical Science University and the Sistan Museum of Anthropology.

* Islamic Azad university, Zabol Branch
* Payame-noor university of Zabol

<doc id="362245" wikidata="Q3380246" url="?curid=362245" title="Taylor Field (Regina, Saskatchewan)">
<text>Taylor Field, known in its latter years as Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field for sponsorship reasons, was an open-air stadium located in Regina, Saskatchewan. It was the home field of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Saskatchewan Roughriders from 1936 until 2016, although a playing field existed at the site as early as 1910 and the team began playing there as early as 1921. Originally designed primarily to house baseball (with football being a secondary consideration) the stadium was converted to a football-only facility in 1966.

Taylor Field was also the home field for the University of Regina Rams, who play in U Sports&#x27; Canada West conference, the Regina Thunder, who play in the Canadian Junior Football League; and the Regina Riot of the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League. The field was also used to play high school football. It was owned and managed by the city of Regina. The field featured artificial turf and, as of 2012, a seating capacity of 32,848.

The stadium closed after the 2016 season, being succeeded by the new Mosaic Stadium at Evraz Place, which was completed in 2016 and became the Roughriders&#x27; home field beginning in the 2017 CFL season. Demolition of the stadium commenced in September 2017 and was completed on October 27, 2017. The site will be converted into a mixed use development.

==History==
The stadium was located in the North Central portion of Regina. The first facility on the site, a rugby (Canadian football) field known as Park Hughes, was built in 1910.

In the same year that Park Hughes was built, the Regina Rugby Club was founded. For much of its first decade, the club played at venues such as Dominion Park (1910-1916) and the municipal exhibition grounds (1919-1921), the team played its first game at Park Hughes on October 15, 1921. The field had recently been enclosed with an eight-foot fence and configured to accommodate soccer as well as Canadian football. Nonetheless, it remained rudimentary even by the standards of the time. The playing surface was little more than plain dirt. When heavy rain turned the field to mud, the team was compelled to relocate games to other venues in the city, including the RCMP barracks. At the time, the barracks housed a unit informally called the &quot;Roughriders&quot; who were tasked with breaking in wild broncos for the force. In 1924, the Regina Rugby Club would adopt the &quot;Roughriders&quot; nickname as their own.

In 1928, the fence between Park Hughes and Park de Young, a neighbouring baseball field built in 1918, was removed, and the site was reconfigured into a larger venue under the Park de Young name to accommodate the growing number of fans. A football gridiron was laid out at the site. However, for a time between 1929 and 1936, the Roughriders moved their games back to the exhibition grounds, which could accommodate more spectators.

In 1936, a permanent 5,000-seat concrete grandstand was built at Park de Young. The team moved into the facility full-time and remained there for the next eight decades. Lights were added in 1937. However, for a decade after the first permanent seating was built, the playing surface remained dirt, with a new layer of topsoil added every year. Late-season games were frequently played in dust bowl conditions, and heavy rain turned it into a mud bath. Finally, in 1946, the city recreation board agreed to plant a more stable grass surface.

In 1947 the facility was renamed Taylor Field after recently deceased Neil J. &quot;Piffles&quot; Taylor, a First World War fighter pilot and postwar lawyer who played and coached rugby union and football in the city, and subsequently served as president of the Regina Roughriders, the Canadian Rugby Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. A man of legendary toughness, Taylor lost an eye in action during the First World War, and spent more than a year in a German prisoner of war camp, but persisted in playing football in the 1920s. His artificial glass eye was once jolted out of its socket when he was tackled. All play stopped while players from both teams hunted for the missing eye. When found, Taylor cleaned it, then popped it back into its socket and resumed play.

When the stadium was first built, minor league baseball was a relatively popular spectator sport in much of North America, including Western Canada. However, as Major League Baseball gained more exposure on the then-new medium of television, baseball attendances dropped to the point where venues like Taylor Field ceased to be economically viable ballparks. In 1966, a second permanent grandstand was constructed, significantly expanding capacity for Roughriders games while also effectively converting Taylor Field to a football-only stadium.

Former Rider receiver Hugh Campbell said in the documentary &quot;CFL Traditions&quot; in 2003. &quot;When I first saw the stadium in Regina (in 1963), it looked like a farmer had built it, you know, like they&#x27;d just added on a few pieces here and there and half of the dressing room was dirt floor, where us rookies got to be. But we had a hook for everybody to hang their clothes on so that was a pretty good deal.&quot;

Renovations during 1978 and 1979 increased the seating capacity by about 7,000 seats with the addition of an upper-level grandstand on the west side of the stadium, in addition, the stadium gained an artificial turf surface (3M Tartan Turf) which replaced the natural grass surface previously used. This was, in turn, replaced with an OmniTurf system (a rudimentary forerunner of today&#x27;s infilled artificial turfs that used sand as a support material) in 1988, which would be replaced by AstroTurf in 2000. In 2005, a new scoreboard was installed, which included the stadium&#x27;s first permanent giant replay screen.

In 2005, Mosaic Stadium gained refurbished washrooms, concessions and refurbished seats on the east side, a new sound system, and the new &quot;SaskTel MaxTron&quot; video board. In 2006, a VIP deck and stands were put in place in the south endzone, allowing the football club to host its corporate game day sponsors. In 2007, the field was switched to the next-generation FieldTurfMosaic was the last stadium in the CFL to still use the old-style AstroTurf. In fact, it was the last in any major North American sport as it was last used in both Major League Baseball and the National Football League in 2004.

On June 23, 2006, the Roughriders and The Mosaic Company announced a 10-year, $3.75 million naming rights deal. Unlike other similar deals, which have seen original names of facilities disappear, it was decided to retain the Taylor Field name, thus the facility was renamed Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field.

On July 31, 2008, the Roughriders announced that temporary seats would be added to the stadium due to high demand for ticketsthe team had sold out every home game for the 2008 season. With tickets in high demand coming off their Grey Cup season, an extra 2,145 seats were added, bringing the capacity to 30,945. The seating was first put to use during the Labour Day Classic against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Following the 2008 West Semi-Final game on November 8, 2008 against the BC Lions, the temporary seats were taken down, putting the capacity back to the original number of 28,800. 2,145 temporary extra seats were put in place for 2009 season. Temporary seating was again put in place for the 2010 season; however, the additional seating only raised capacity to 30,048.

On February 24, 2012, the Roughriders announced a $14 million renovation plan known as the &quot;Legacy Project&quot; to prepare the stadium for hosting the 101st Grey Cup. Riders chairman Roger Brandvold was quoted as saying &quot;Replacing Mosaic Stadium still remains our top priority, but certain upgrades needed to be made to get us through the next few years and especially the 2013 Grey Cup&quot;. The first stage of the renovations were finished in time for the start of the 2012 season, with the addition of 7,000 extra seats and 27 new corporate suites (arranged to give the stadium a more &quot;bowl&quot;-like feel), additional bathrooms and concessions, the &quot;SaskTel MaxTron&quot; video screen and scoreboard upgraded to a 60-foot LED screen (with a second display directly alongside, shaped like the province of Saskatchewan), a new 55-foot video screen attached to the west grandstand, and ribbon screens along the bottom of the grandstands. For the 2013 season, its capacity was expanded to 45,000 with temporary seating, which were removed for the following season.

==Notable events==

===Football and other sports===
* Taylor Field was the venue for the 83rd, 91st and 101st Grey Cup games. A temporary grandstand seating for an additional 20,000-25,000 spectators was added for each of these games.
* It has also played host to the field hockey competition at the 2005 Canada Games among other notable sporting events over the decades.
* The stadium was the site of the four longest field goals in CFL history (note that Taylor Field was one of the most windy venues in the CFL due to the windy Saskatchewan climate and the structure of the stadium itself). Dave Cutler kicked a then-league-record 59-yard field goal on October 28, 1970 (and narrowly missed a 71-yard attempt at the stadium in 1977). Paul Watson tied that record with a 59-yarder against Winnipeg July 12, 1981. Dave Ridgway hit a 60-yarder against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers September 6, 1987 (it was the first time in CFL history that a field goal was made from that distance). That record was broken by Paul McCallum, who kicked a 62-yard field goal against the Edmonton Eskimos on October 27, 2001 in a 12–3 victory. Ridgway and Mark McLoughlin of the Calgary Stampeders have also kicked 58-yard field goals at Taylor Field.

===Concerts===


It was announced on May 4, 2009 that Aerosmith would be performing at Mosaic Stadium on August 9 as part of the Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour. This concert, however, was cancelled due to the injuries that Steven Tyler sustained after falling off the stage in Sturgis, South Dakota.

==Replacement==

On July 12, 2012 during a pre-game ceremony, Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall and Regina mayor Pat Fiacco announced that a new stadium would be constructed for the Roughriders at Regina&#x27;s exhibition grounds.

Taylor Field hosted its final Roughriders game on October 29, 2016. The following week, it hosted its final football game, a Canada West conference semi-final with the Regina Rams. The Roughriders moved to the new Mosaic Stadium in the 2017 season.

In 2017, items from the former stadium were auctioned off in advance of its decommissioning and eventual demolition. Demolition began in September 2017; the tallest portion, and the last standing section of the structure, the west grandstand, was toppled on October 27, 2017.

<doc id="362251" wikidata="Q677741" url="?curid=362251" title="Cittaslow">
<text>Cittaslow is an organisation founded in Italy and inspired by the slow food movement. Cittaslow&#x27;s goals include improving the quality of life in towns by slowing down its overall pace, especially in a city&#x27;s use of spaces and the flow of life and traffic through them.

==History==
Cittaslow was founded in Italy in October 1999, following a meeting organised by the mayor of Greve in Chianti, Tuscany. A 54-point charter was developed, encouraging high quality local food and drink, general conviviality and the opposition to cultural standardisation. In 2001, 28 Italian towns were signed up to the pledge, certified by trained operatives of Cittaslow. The first Slow City in the English-speaking world was Ludlow, England, in 2003. The movement expanded broadly beyond Italy and, by 2006, national Cittaslow networks existed in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom. By mid-2009, fourteen countries had at least one officially accredited Cittaslow community. In July 2009, the small seaside village of Cowichan Bay in Canada became the North American continent&#x27;s first Cittaslow town. In June 2011, Gökçeada in Turkey became the first and only Cittaslow island. Nearly a decade later in October 2020, Izmir, Turkey&#x27;s 3rd metropolitan municipality, has become The First Cittaslow Metropolis of the World.

== Membership ==
There are three categories of membership: Cittaslow town (population less than 50,000); Cittaslow Supporter (population more than 50,000); and Cittaslow Friend (individual or family).

Like Slow Food, Cittaslow is a membership organisation. Full membership of Cittaslow is only open to towns with a population under 50,000. To become eligible for membership, a town must normally score at least 50 percent in a self-assessment process against the set of Cittaslow goals, and then apply for admission to the appropriate Cittaslow national network. An annual membership fee is payable by towns.

The first town in England to become a Cittaslow city (and the first in the English-speaking world) was Ludlow in November 2003; the first in Wales was Mold. There are currently three towns in the UK that are members.

By 2007, several slow cities had been introduced across South Korea.

Pijao, a small town in Colombia, is to become the first Cittaslow city in Latin America.

==Members==
== The goals and aims ==
There are 50 goals and principles that each Cittaslow town commits to work to achieve. They serve as benchmarks to improve the quality of life in each city.

The main aims of the movement are:
*making life better for everyone living in an urban environment
*improving the quality of life in the cities
*resisting the homogenization and globalization of towns around the globe
*protecting the environment
*promoting cultural diversity and uniqueness of individual cities
*providing inspiration for a healthier lifestyle

<doc id="362253" wikidata="Q94162" url="?curid=362253" title="New Zealand Order of Merit">
<text>The New Zealand Order of Merit is an order of merit in the New Zealand royal honours system. It was established by royal warrant on 30 May 1996 by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, &quot;for those persons who in any field of endeavour, have rendered meritorious service to the Crown and nation or who have become distinguished by their eminence, talents, contributions or other merits&quot;, to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity.

In the order of precedence, the New Zealand Order of Merit ranks immediately after the Order of New Zealand.

==Creation==
Prior to 1996, New Zealanders received appointments to various British orders, such as the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Order of the British Empire, and the Order of the Companions of Honour, as well as the distinction of Knight Bachelor. The change came about after the Prime Minister&#x27;s Honours Advisory Committee (1995) was created &quot;to consider and present options and suggestions on the structure of a New Zealand Royal Honours System in New Zealand, which is designed to recognise meritorious service, gallantry and bravery and long service&quot;.

==Composition==
The monarch of New Zealand is the Sovereign of the order and the governor-general is its Chancellor. Appointments are made at five levels: 
*Knight or Dame Grand Companion (GNZM)
*Knight or Dame Companion (KNZM or DNZM)
*Companion (CNZM)
*Officer (ONZM)
*Member (MNZM).

From 2000 to 2009, the two highest levels of the Order were Principal Companion (PCNZM) and Distinguished Companion (DCNZM), without the appellation of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;.

The number of Knights and Dames Grand Companion (and Principal Companions) is limited to 30 living people. Additionally, new appointments are limited to 15 Knights or Dames Companion, 40 Companions, 80 Officers and 140 Members per year.

As well as the five levels, there are three different types of membership. Ordinary membership is limited to citizens of New Zealand or a Commonwealth realm. &quot;Additional&quot; members, appointed on special occasions, are not counted in the numerical limits. People who are not citizens of a Commonwealth realm are given &quot;Honorary&quot; membership; if they subsequently adopt citizenship of a Commonwealth realm they are eligible for Additional membership.

There is also a Secretary and Registrar (the Clerk of the Executive Council) and a Herald (the New Zealand Herald of Arms) of the Order.

==Insignia and other distinctions==

*The &quot;Collar&quot;, worn only by the Sovereign and Chancellor, comprises &quot;links of the central medallion of the badge&quot; and S-shaped Koru, with the coat of arms of New Zealand in centre. Hanging from the coat of arms is the badge of the Order.
* The &quot;Star&quot; is an eight-pointed star with each arm bearing a representation of a fern frond, with the Order&#x27;s badge superimposed in the centre. Grand Companions wear a gold star and Knight Companions wear a silver star.
* The &quot;Badge&quot; for the three highest classes is a gold and white enamel cross with curved edges bearing at its centre the coat of arms of New Zealand within a green enamel ring bearing the motto &quot;For Merit Tohu Hiranga&quot;, topped by a royal crown. The badge for Officers and Members is similar, but in silver-gilt and silver respectively. Grand Companions wear the badge on a sash over the right shoulder (though the Governor-General usually wears it as a neck decoration in lieu of the Collar); Knight Companions and Companions wear the badge on a neck ribbon (men) or a bow on the left shoulder (women). Officers and Members wear the badge from a ribbon on the left lapel (men) or a bow on the left shoulder (women).
* The &quot;ribbon&quot; and &quot;sash&quot; are plain red ochre.

There also exist miniatures and lapel badges of the five levels of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

Knight/Dames Grand Companion and Knight/Dames Companion are entitled to use the style &quot;Sir&quot; for males and &quot;Dame&quot; for females.

The order&#x27;s statutes grant heraldic privileges to members of the first and second level, who are entitled to have the Order&#x27;s circlet (&quot;a green circle, edged gold, and inscribed with the Motto of the Order in gold&quot;) surrounding their shield. Grand Companions are also entitled to heraldic supporters. The Chancellor is entitled to supporters and a representation of the Collar of the Order around his/her shield.

==Office holders==
* Sovereign: Charles III
* Chancellor and Principal Dame Grand Companion: The Governor-General, Dame Cindy Kiro (21 October 2021)
* Secretary and Registrar: Rachel Hayward (28 November 2022)
* Herald: Phillip O&#x27;Shea (23 September 1996)

==Living grand and principal companions==
==Living distinguished companions==
The following contains the names of the small number of living Distinguished Companions (DCNZM) who chose not to convert their appointment to a Knight or Dame Companion, and thus not to accept the respective appellation of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;. The majority of those affected chose the aforereferenced appellations. After initially declining redesignation in 2009, Vincent O&#x27;Sullivan and Sam Neill accepted the change in December 2021 and June 2022, respectively.

==Controversy==
A change to non-titular honours was a recommendation contained within the original report of the 1995 honours committee (&quot;The New Zealand Royal Honours System: The Report of the Prime Minister’s Honours Advisory Committee&quot;) which prompted the creation of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Titular honours were incorporated into the new system before its implementation in 1996 after the National Party caucus and public debate were split as to whether titles should be retained.

There has long been debate in New Zealand regarding the appropriateness of titles. Some feel it is no longer appropriate as New Zealand has not been a colony since 1907, and to these people titles are out of step with present-day New Zealand. Others feel that titles carry both domestic and international recognition, and that awarded on the basis of merit they remain an appropriate recognition of excellence.

In April 2000 the then new Labour Prime Minister, Helen Clark, announced that knighthoods and damehoods had been abolished and the order&#x27;s statutes amended. From 2000 to 2009, the two highest levels of the Order were Principal Companion (PCNZM) and Distinguished Companion (DCNZM), without the appellation of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;; appointment to all levels of the Order were recognised solely by the use of post-nominal letters.

A &quot;National Business Review&quot; poll in February 2000 revealed that 54% of New Zealanders thought the titles should be scrapped. The Labour Government&#x27;s April 2000 changes were criticised by opposition parties, with Richard Prebble of the ACT New Zealand party deriding the PCNZM&#x27;s initials as standing for &quot;a Politically Correct New Zealand that used to be a Monarchy&quot;.

The issue of titular honours would appear whenever honours were mentioned. In the lead up to the 2005 general election, Leader of the Opposition Don Brash suggested that should a National-led government be elected, he would reverse Labour&#x27;s changes and re-introduce knighthoods.

In 2009, Prime Minister John Key (later to become a Knight Grand Companion himself) restored the honours to their pre-April 2000 state. Principal Companions and Distinguished Companions (85 people in total) were given the option to convert their awards into Knighthoods or Damehoods. The restoration was welcomed by Monarchy New Zealand. The option has been taken up by 72 of those affected, including rugby great Colin Meads. Former Labour MP Margaret Shields was one of those who accepted a Damehood, despite receiving a letter from former Prime Minister Helen Clark &quot;setting out why Labour had abolished the titles and saying she hoped she would not accept one&quot;. Clark&#x27;s senior deputy, Michael Cullen, also accepted a knighthood.

Appointments continued when Labour returned to government in 2017 as the Sixth Labour Government. The 2018 New Year Honours included seven knights and dames. The government did not comment on its position regarding knighthoods and damehoods, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern did specifically congratulate two women on becoming Dames Companion. On leaving office in 2023, Ardern accepted appointment as a Dame Grand Companion, formally receiving investiture in 2024 from Prince William.

<doc id="362254" wikidata="Q276304" url="?curid=362254" title="Judith Merril">
<text>Judith Josephine Grossman (January 21, 1923 – September 12, 1997), who took the pen-name Judith Merril around 1945, was an American and then Canadian science fiction writer, editor and political activist, and one of the first women to be widely influential in those roles.

Although Judith Merril&#x27;s first paid writing was in other genres, in her first few years of writing published science fiction she wrote her three novels (all but the first in collaboration with C. M. Kornbluth) and some stories. Her roughly four decades in that genre also included writing 26 published short stories, and editing a similar number of anthologies.

==Early years==
Merril was born in Boston in 1923 to Ethel and Samuel (Shlomo) Grossman, who were Jewish. Her father died by suicide in 1929 soon after she began to attend school. In 1936, her mother found a job at the Bronx House community center and moved the family to the New York City borough of the Bronx. In her mid-teens, Merril pursued Zionism and Marxism. 

According to Virginia Kidd&#x27;s introduction to &quot;The Best of Judith Merril&quot;, Ethel Grossman had been a suffragette, was a founder of the women&#x27;s Zionist organization Hadassah, and was &quot;a liberated female frustrated at every turn by the world in which she found herself&quot;.

In 1939, Judith graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx at 16 and rethought her politics under the influence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (August 23), shifting to a Trotskyist outlook. She married Dan Zissman the next year, less than four months into a relationship that started when they met at a Trotskyist Fourth of July picnic in Central Park. Their daughter Merril Zissman was born in December 1942. In this period, she also became one of the few female members of the New York City-based group of science fiction writers, editors, artists and fans, the Futurians, which included Kornbluth. The Zissmans separated about 1945; in 1946 Frederik Pohl, another Futurian, began living with her. After her divorce from Zissman became final in 1948, she married Pohl on November 25; they divorced in 1952.

==American science fiction writing and editing==

Using her daughter&#x27;s given name as a surname, Merril edited a five-page SF fanzine dated May 1945, including a letter &quot;On Ezra Pound&quot; by Don [sic] Zissman. She edited, and published with Larry Shaw and Dan Zissman, a 20-page fanzine dated January 1946, &quot;Science*Fiction No. 1&quot;, including an editorial by her entitled &quot;The Hills and the Heights&quot;. ISFDB notes, &quot;A single issue fanzine from Judy Zissman (aka Judith Merril). It was clearly intended to continue, and many of the contents of the next issue are described, but a 2nd issue was never released—likely as a result of the collapse of her marriage to Don Zissman.&quot;

Judith Merril began writing professionally, especially short stories about sports, starting in 1945, before publishing her first science fiction story in 1948. A number, but by no means all, of her contributions were to magazines edited by fellow ex-Futurians. She was a co-founder of the Hydra Club in this period. 

Her story &quot;Dead Center&#x27;&quot; (&quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, November 1954) is one of only two stories taken from any science fiction or fantasy magazine for the &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; volumes edited by Martha Foley in the 1950s. Groff Conklin described her first novel, &quot;Shadow on the Hearth&quot;, as &quot;a masterly example of sensitive and perceptive story-telling&quot;. Boucher and McComas praised it as &quot;a sensitively human novel, terrifying in its small-scale reflection of grand-scale catastrophe&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller found it a &quot;warm, human novel&quot; comparable to &quot;Earth Abides&quot;.

Her second child, Ann Pohl, was born in 1950; she and Pohl separated in 1952 and their divorce was finalized the next year, during which she also lived with Walter M. Miller for six months. Her third marriage came in 1960, devolved into separation in 1963, but never reached a final divorce. Ann Pohl&#x27;s daughter, Merril&#x27;s granddaughter Emily Pohl-Weary, writes young adult fiction including science fiction and is a professor of creative writing at the University of British Columbia. She also co-authored Merril&#x27;s biography after the latter&#x27;s death, using access to her drafts, notes and letters.

Merril began editing science fiction short story anthologies in 1950 - including a &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; story-anthology series that ran from 1956 to 1967 - and published her last in 1985. In her editorial introductions, talks and other writings, she actively argued that science fiction should no longer be isolated but become part of the literary mainstream. Early in her editing career, Anthony Boucher described her as &quot;a practically flawless anthologist&quot;. She had a role as Books Editor for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (F&amp;SF) from 1965 until 1969.

According to science fiction scholar Rob Latham, &quot;throughout the 1950s, Merril, along with fellow SF authors James Blish and Damon Knight had taken the lead in promoting higher literary standards and a greater sense of professionalism within the field. They established the annual Milford Writers&#x27; Conference in Milford, Pennsylvania, where Merril then lived [as did Knight and his wife Kate Wilhelm]. Manuscripts were workshopped at these avid gatherings, thus encouraging more care in the planning of stories, and a sense of solidarity was promoted, eventually leading to the formation of the Science Fiction Writers Association.&quot; However, &quot;disaffected authors began griping about a &#x27;Milford Mafia&#x27; that was endangering SF&#x27;s unique virtues by imposing literary standards essentially alien to the field.&quot;

One anthology project Merril began in the early 1960s under contract to Lion Books in Chicago was aborted, but inspired her publisher&#x27;s editor Harlan Ellison to go forward with his own version of the project, which yielded &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; (Doubleday, 1967). As an initiator of the New Wave movement, she edited the 1968 anthology &quot;England Swings SF&quot;, whose stories she collected while living in England for a year.

In 1966 Ellison wrote an episode entitled &quot;The Pieces of Fate Affair&quot; for &quot;The Man from UNCLE&quot; using the names of friends as characters. One of these was a THRUSH agent who was also a literary critic named &quot;Judith Merle&quot; played by Grayson Hall. Merrill&#x27;s daughter saw the episode and brought a lawsuit against the series for defamation of character. The audio track was later adjusted renaming Hall&#x27;s character &quot;Jody Moore&quot; and the episode was kept out of syndication for many years.

==Canadian years==
Merril was among those who in 1968 signed an anti-Vietnam War advertisement in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. In the late 1960s, Merril moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, citing what she called undemocratic suppression of anti-Vietnam War activities by the U.S. government. She was a founding resident of Rochdale College, an experiment in student-run education and cooperative living, very much part of the zeitgeist of the era. At Rochdale, she was the &quot;Resource Person on Writing and Publishing&quot; with her extensive personal collection of books and unpublished manuscripts.

In 1970 she began an endowment at the Toronto Public Library for the collection of all science fiction published in the English language. She donated all of the books and magazines in her possession to the library, which established the &quot;Spaced Out Library&quot; (her term) with Merril in a non-administrative role as curator. The library has had its own physical space from the onset. During her last decade it was renamed the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation, and Fantasy. She received a small annual stipend as curator and, when short of money, she lived in her office at the library, sleeping on a cot.

From 1978 to 1981 Merril introduced Canadian broadcasts of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. As the &quot;Undoctor&quot;, Merril presented short (3-7 minute) philosophical commentaries on the show&#x27;s themes.

Merril was an active organizer and promoter of science fiction in Canada. For example, she founded the Hydra North network of writers. In 1985 she launched and edited the first &quot;Tesseract&quot;, an occasional anthology of Canadian science fiction from Press Porcépic (Toronto).

In the early 1980s, Merril donated to the National Archives of Canada her voluminous collection of correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, and Japanese science fiction material – eventually the Judith Merril Fonds.

Merril became a Canadian citizen in 1976 and became active in its Writers&#x27; Union. 

From the mid-1970s until her death, Merril spent much time in the Canadian peace movement, including traveling to Ottawa dressed as a witch in order to hex Parliament for allowing American cruise missile testing over Canada. She also remained active in the SF world as a commentator and mentor. Her lifetime of work was honoured by the International Authors Festival at the Harbourfront Centre, Toronto. She spent much time working on her memoirs.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA renamed) made Merril its Author Emeritus for 1997 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted her in 2013.

<text>It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show is an American television sitcom that originally aired on Showtime from September 10, 1986, to May 25, 1990. The series, created by Garry Shandling and Alan Zweibel, is notable for breaking the fourth wall.

In the series, Garry Shandling plays a stand-up comedian who is aware that he is a television character. The series features Shandling interacting with the studio audience and manipulating storylines for better outcomes. The series was critically acclaimed and ran for 4 seasons and 72 episodes. Initially aired on Showtime, it was later picked up by Fox for reruns. The show received multiple awards and nominations, including five CableACE Awards and four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

==Synopsis==
The series stars Garry Shandling as himself: A neurotic, sardonic stand-up comedian who just happens to be aware he is a television sitcom character. Garry spends just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he does the regular cast members, performing monologues and show-closing summations of the episode&#x27;s events (much like George Burns on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;). However, on Garry&#x27;s show, all the supporting characters know they are on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience (itself a character) is often in the storyline.

At the time of the series&#x27; production, Shandling actually lived in Sherman Oaks, California, just like the character on the series. His condominium on the series was styled to be just like his real-life condo, down to the room layout and the furnishings.

Storylines were often manipulated by Shandling to create more favorable outcomes or simply to speed the story along. One episode ended years later, for example. Another allowed Shandling to tell the audience that time had passed in order to console an angry neighbor whose wall he had damaged; by the time the scene transitioned, the workmen had already fixed the wall. On America&#x27;s presidential election night in 1988, Showtime presented a live episode wherein Shandling brought in &quot;Soul Train&quot; host Don Cornelius to incorrectly announce that Michael Dukakis had soundly defeated George H. W. Bush.

The series&#x27; theme song is &quot;This Is the Theme to Garry&#x27;s Show&quot;, sung by Los Angeles musician Bill Lynch. The song&#x27;s lyrics are self-referential, explaining how the song came to be (&quot;Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song&quot;) and asking what the listener thinks of it.

Considered a critical and niche success, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; ran 72 episodes and was on the air for four seasons (1986–1990). The show was later picked up by the broadcast Fox network from 1988 to 1990 as part of its Sunday night lineup with minor cuts for language and advertising breaks; Fox began airing the show from the beginning, but due to longer seasons for network shows versus cable, had caught up by the time the show left Fox in March 1990. New episodes continued for a few months thereafter on Showtime. The series put Shandling on the A-list and prompted the success for his run as Larry Sanders on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;.

==Cast and characters==
Throughout the series, the cast was divided into the &quot;Starring&quot; cast, whose names were featured in the opening credits; the &quot;Co-Starring&quot; cast and the &quot;Guest Starring&quot; cast, both of which had the actors&#x27; names featured in the end credits.

While fighting ovarian cancer, Gilda Radner guest-starred as herself in the series in 1988 in what would be her final television appearance. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen on television for a while, Radner replied, &quot;Oh, I had cancer. What did &quot;you&quot; have?&quot;

The reruns aired Sundays on Fox at 9:00–9:30 from March 1988 to July 1989, at 9:30–10:00 in July 1989, at 10:00–10:30 from July to August 1989, and at 10:30–11:00 from August 1989 to March 1990.

The first season of the series was released as a standalone title in America in April 2010.

<text>The Macau Peninsula is the historical and most populous part of Macau. It has an area of () and is geographically connected to Guangdong Province at the northeast through an isthmus wide. The peninsula, together with downtown Zhuhai, sits on an island separated from the continent by distributaries of the Pearl River. The Border Gate (; ) was built on the northern isthmus. At the south, the peninsula is connected to Taipa Island by three bridges, the Friendship Bridge (&quot;Ponte da Amizade&quot;); the Macau-Taipa Bridge (&quot;Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho&quot;); and the Sai Van Bridge (&quot;Ponte de Sai Van&quot;). The longest axis extends from the Border Gate to the southwestern edge, Barra (媽閣嘴). There is a western &quot;Inner Harbor&quot; (內港) paralleled by an &quot;Outer Harbor&quot; (外港) to the east. The Guia Hill (松山) is the highest point on the peninsula, which has an average elevation of . Many coastal places are reclaimed from the sea. The Historic Centre of Macau, which is entirely on the Macau Peninsula, became a World Heritage Site in 2005.

==Early history==
In 1513, Portuguese explorer Jorge Álvares arrived in the Pearl River Delta, in the Shenzhen area, which he called Tamão. A Portuguese settlement was started there and by 1535 the traders were allowed to anchor their ships in the Macau harbour. In 1887, the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking was signed, allowing &quot;the perpetual occupation and government of Macau by Portugal&quot;. 
According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Macau may never have existed if not for Tamão&quot; where the Portuguese learned &quot;how China, the Pearl River Delta, and the South China Sea worked&quot;. The settlement and Jorge Álvares &quot;kickstarted a chain of events that ultimately spawned Macau&quot;. A large stone sculpture of Álvares still stands in downtown Macau. 

==Freguesias==
The peninsula corresponds to the historical Municipality of Macau, one of Macau&#x27;s two municipalities that were abolished on 31 December 2001 by Law No. 17/2001, following the 1999 transfer of sovereignty over Macau from Portugal to China. 

This municipality was divided into five parishes (freguesia), and while their administrative functions have since been voided, these parishes are still retained nominally.

<text>Terry Gene Carr (February 19, 1937 – April 7, 1987) was an American science fiction fan, author, editor, and writing instructor.

== Background and discovery of fandom ==
Carr was born in Grants Pass, Oregon. He attended the City College of San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley from 1954 to 1959.

Carr discovered science fiction fandom in 1949, where he became an enthusiastic publisher of fanzines, which later helped open his way into the commercial publishing world. (He was one of the two fans responsible for the hoax fan &#x27;Carl Brandon&#x27; after whom the Carl Brandon Society takes its name.) Despite a long career as a science fiction professional, he continued to participate as a fan until his death. He was nominated five times for Hugos for Best Fanzine (1959–1961, 1967–1968), winning in 1959, was nominated three times for Best Fan Writer (1971–1973), winning in 1973, and was Fan Guest of Honor at ConFederation in 1986.

== Professional work ==
Though he published some fiction in the early 1960s, Carr concentrated on editing. He first worked at Ace Books, establishing the &quot;Ace Science Fiction Specials&quot; series which published, among other novels, &quot;Behold the Man&quot; and &quot;The Warlord of the Air&quot; by Michael Moorcock, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; by Ursula K. Le Guin and &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; by Alexei Panshin.

After conflicts with Ace head Donald A. Wollheim, he worked as a freelancer. He edited an original story anthology series called &quot;Universe&quot;, and a popular series of &quot;The Best Science Fiction of the Year&quot; anthologies that ran from 1972 until his death in 1987. He also edited numerous one-off anthologies over the same time span. He was nominated for the Hugo for Best Editor thirteen times (1973–1975, 1977–1979, 1981–1987), winning twice (1985 and 1987). His win in 1985 was the first time a freelance editor had won.

Terry Carr commissioned a first novel from William Gibson for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, shortly after the Denver WorldCon, 1981. The purpose of the series was to give attention to first-time novelists. Gibson&#x27;s fellow Ace Specials first-timers were Kim Stanley Robinson, Michael Swanwick, Lucius Shepard, Carter Scholz, and Howard Waldrop. William Gibson mentions Carr in the introduction to the 20th Anniversary Edition of the book: &quot;Having been talked into signing a contract (by the late Terry Carr, without whom there would certainly be no Neuromancer) . . .&quot;

Carr taught at the Clarion Workshop at Michigan State University in 1978, where his students included Richard Kadrey and Pat Murphy.

== Personal life ==
Carr married a fellow science fiction fan, Miriam Dyches, in 1959. They were divorced in 1961. Later that year, Carr married Carol Stuart. He remained married to her until his death. Under her married name of Carol Carr, his widow has also sold science fiction: &quot;You Think You&#x27;ve Got Troubles&quot; (1969), &quot;Inside&quot; (1970), &quot;Some Are Born Cats&quot; (1973, with Terry Carr), &quot;Wally a Deux&quot; (1973), and &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; (1984).

==Death==
On April 7, 1987, Carr died of congestive heart failure. A memorial gathering of the science fiction community was held in Tilden Park in Berkeley, California, on May 30. An original anthology of science fiction, &quot;Terry&#x27;s Universe&quot;, was published the following year; all proceeds went to his widow. His papers and his large collection of fanzines (71 linear feet and almost 2000 titles) have become part of the Eaton collection of Science Fiction at the University of California, Riverside.

<doc id="362282" wikidata="Q3095431" url="?curid=362282" title="Garden Island (Western Australia)">
<text>Garden Island ( or ) is a narrow island about long and wide, lying about off the Western Australian coast, to which it is linked by an artificial causeway and bridge.

Like Rottnest Island and Carnac Island, it is a limestone outcrop covered by a thin layer of sand accumulated during an era of lowered sea levels. The Noongar peoples tell of walking to these islands in their Dreamtime.

At the end of the last glacial period, the sea level rose, cutting the island off from the mainland. For the last seven thousand years, the island has existed in relative isolation.

The Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s largest fleet base, Fleet Base West, also called HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;, is on the shores of Careening Bay, on the southeastern section of Garden Island, facing Cockburn Sound. people lived on the Garden Island base.

The entirety of Garden Island is included on the Commonwealth Heritage List for its natural values. Garden Island is home to a tammar wallaby population.

==History==

The island was marked but not named on Dutch maps in 1658, even though there were three Dutch ships in the area that year: &quot;Waekende Boey&quot; under Captain S. Volckertszoon, &quot;Elburg&quot; under Captain J. Peereboom and &quot;Emeloort&quot; under Captain A. Joncke. However, it was outlined on the charts of the &quot;Southland&quot;, which were published after Willem de Vlamingh visited the region in 1697.

Jacques Felix Emmanuel, Baron Hamelin was the Captain of &quot;Naturaliste&quot;, one of three French ships that visited in 1801 to 1803. He named the island , after a marine cartographer in Paris. The island was renamed &quot;Garden Island&quot; in 1827 by Captain James Stirling, who &quot;prepared a garden and released a cow, two ewes and three goats in an area of good pasture with good water supply&quot;. It has been widely believed that Stirling chose the name &quot;Garden Island&quot; because he planted a garden there, but he used the name well before anything was planted there, possibly because the shelter that it provides to Cockburn Sound was reminiscent of the way that the Isle of Wight, then known locally as the &quot;Garden Isle&quot;, shelters the waters off Portsmouth.

Stirling returned to the area in 1829, claiming Garden Island as part of his grant of , plus any livestock remaining from the previous visit. The first settlement of 450 people was named &quot;Sulphur Town&quot;. Sulphur Bay and Careening Bay were important anchorage and cargo disembarkation points for ships until 1897 when Fremantle&#x27;s inner harbour was completed.

In 1907 Peet &amp; Co (now Peet Limited) subdivided at Careening Bay. After World War I it became a holiday resort with wooden cottages erected at the bay. During World War II, gun batteries were located on Garden Island. These were part of an integrated coastal defence system for Fremantle Harbour facilities.

The Challenger Battery was the first gun battery constructed on Garden Island in 1942. Two US-supplied mobile Canon de 155 mm guns on Panama mount were installed to protect Garden Island, Cockburn Sound and the Challenger Passage. The battery was installed in early 1943 and operational by April. In the meantime, more permanent batteries were constructed on the island, which were completed in October 1943. The battery was withdrawn again in December 1944.

The biggest battery on Garden Island was the Scriven Battery, fitted with two breech-loading 9.2-inch MkX guns, similar to the Oliver Hill Battery on Rottnest Island. In 1943 building began on a complex of tunnels and rooms, included shell stores, magazines, pump chamber and powerhouse, plotting room and command post, and battery observation posts. However, the threat of attack receded as the battery was completed. Resources were allocated elsewhere, and the battery and its guns were placed in reserve. The battery was decommissioned in 1963 and the guns scrapped.

During World War II, Careening Bay Camp became a major training base for the secretive Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD), also commonly referred to as &quot;Z Special Unit&quot;. The base was officially known as the Special Boat Section and was used to train operatives in the advanced use of folding kayaks as well as top secret British midget submarines such as the Motorised Submersible Canoe (also known as &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;), Welman and Welfreighter submarines. SRD parties staging out of Careening Bay Camp were sent on clandestine missions into Japanese-occupied territory.

Following the war, Garden Island became home of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve Fleet and a holiday resort again with a brief ferry service from Palm Beachone of these converted ferries, &quot;Trixen&quot;, is now preserved in the Western Australian Maritime Museum.

==Naval base==
In 1966, a feasibility study began into establishment of a naval support facility on the island, which was endorsed by the Australian Government in 1969. Construction of the Garden Island causeway began in 1971 and was completed in 1973. The facility was completed in 1978, and HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot; was formally commissioned as a unit of the Royal Australian Navy in the same year. &quot;Stirling&quot;, also referred to as Fleet Base West, was developed further under the Two-Ocean Policy to become the main naval base on the west coast of Australia.

A designated access road to the base, the Garden Island Highway, was also proposed and a small section constructed but never completed and eventually cancelled in 1984. With the proposed expansion of the base for AUKUS, completing this highway has been proposed again and a feasibility study .

, &quot;Stirling&quot; is home to five frigates and all submarines of the Australian Submarine Service, which is headquartered at the base. A Clearance Diving Team is also based at &quot;Stirling&quot;.

Since completion of the facility, public access to the island has been restricted to daylight hours. However, public access is not granted to the public in general via the causeway unless entry is sponsored by the military. Access by sea is restricted to private boats using moorings, also under daylight curfew conditions. The Navy has undertaken various successful programmes for the removal of introduced animals; all native animals on the island are protected.

<doc id="362288" wikidata="Q321293" url="?curid=362288" title="Roseate tern">
<text>The roseate tern (Sterna dougallii) is a species of tern in the family Laridae. The genus name &quot;Sterna&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;stearn&quot;, &quot;tern&quot;, and the specific &quot;dougallii&quot; refers to Scottish physician and collector Dr Peter McDougall (1777–1814). &quot;Roseate&quot; refers to the bird&#x27;s pink breast in breeding plumage.

==Taxonomy==
English naturalist George Montagu described the roseate tern in 1813. Genetically, it is most closely related to the white-fronted tern (&quot;S. striata&quot;), with their common ancestor a sister lineage to the black-naped tern (&quot;S. sumatrana&quot;).

This species has a number of geographical subspecies, differing mainly in bill colour and minor plumage details.

&quot;S. d. dougallii &quot; breeds on the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America, and winters south to the Caribbean and west Africa. Both the European and North American populations have been in long-term decline, though active conservation measures have reversed the decline in the last few years at some colonies, most notably at Rockabill Island off the coast of Dublin, Ireland, which now holds most of the European population (about 1200 pairs).
The tropical forms &quot;S. d. korustes&quot; and &quot;S. d. bangsi&quot; are resident breeders from east Africa across the Indian Ocean to Japan. They have more red on the bill. The long-billed and short-winged &quot;S. d. gracilis&quot; breeds in Australia and New Caledonia. The north-western Indian Ocean holds populations of &quot;S. d. arideensis&quot;. Some authors suggest that only three subspecies, nominate &quot;S. d. dougallii&quot;, &quot;S. d. arideensis&quot;, and &quot;S. d. gracilis&quot;, should be retained.

==Description==
This is a small-medium tern, long with a wingspan, which can be confused with the common tern, Arctic tern, and the larger, but similarly plumaged, Sandwich tern. The thin sharp bill is black, with a red base which develops through the breeding season, and is more extensive (to fully red) in the tropical and southern hemisphere subspecies. It is shorter-winged and has faster wing beats than common or Arctic tern. The upper wings are pale grey and its under parts white, and this tern looks very pale in flight, like a small Sandwich tern, although the outermost primary flight feathers darken during the summer. The adults have very long, flexible tail streamers and orange-red legs. In summer, the underparts of adults take on the pinkish tinge which gives this bird its name.

In winter, the forehead becomes white and the bill black. Juvenile roseate terns have a scaly appearance like juvenile Sandwich Terns, but a fuller black cap than that species.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Food and feeding===
As with other &quot;Sterna&quot; terns, roseate tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea; it is much more marine than allied terns, only rarely visiting freshwater lagoons on the coast to bathe and not fishing in fresh water. It usually dives directly, and not from the &quot;stepped-hover&quot; favoured by Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

Unusual for a tern, the roseate tern shows some kleptoparasitic behaviour, stealing fish from other seabirds, at British colonies most often from puffins. This habit greatly increases their food-collecting ability during bad weather when fish swim deeper, out of reach of plunge-diving terns, but still within reach of the deeper-diving Puffins.

===Breeding===
This species breeds in colonies on coasts and islands, at times with other seabirds. In Australian colonies, it has been recorded nesting alongside the black-naped tern (&quot;S. sumatrana&quot;), lesser crested tern (&quot;Thalasseus bengalensis&quot;), greater crested tern (&quot;T. bergii&quot;), fairy tern (&quot;Sternula nereis&quot;), bridled tern (&quot;Onychoprion anaethetus&quot;) and silver gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae&quot;). It nests in a ground scrape, often in a hollow or under dense vegetation, and lays one or two (rarely three) eggs. It is less defensive of its nest and young than other white terns, often relying on Arctic and common terns in the surrounding colony to defend them. In smaller colonies, they may rarely mate with these other tern species.

The white-bellied sea-eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;) and silver gull are known to prey on eggs and chicks, while the turnstone (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;), black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) and King&#x27;s skink (&quot;Egernia kingii&quot;) are suspected predators.

===Vocalisations===

The call of the roseate tern is a very characteristic &quot;chuwit&quot;, similar to that of the spotted redshank, quite distinct from other terns.

==Conservation status==
In the late 19th century, these birds were hunted for their plumes which were used to decorate hats. More recently, their numbers have decreased in some regions due to increased competition and predation by large gulls, whose numbers have increased in recent times. This species, as of 2019, is one of the UK&#x27;s rarest breeding seabird.

The largest European colony, accounting for more than 75% of the European population, is in Ireland, at Rockabill Island, County Dublin. In 2013, 1213 pairs nested at Rockabill. The colony at Lady&#x27;s Island Lake, County Wexford, is also of crucial importance, with 155 pairs nesting there in 2013.

With their favouring partly hidden nest sites, the provision of nestboxes has proven a dramatic conservation success, with the birds taking to them very readily. This results in greatly increased breeding productivity with the protection given to the young from predatory birds like herring gulls. At the UK&#x27;s most important colony, on Coquet Island, Northumberland, the population rose from 25 pairs 1997 to 154 pairs in 2022 after nestboxes were provided. Similar measures have been undertaken at the Anglesey tern colonies along with clearance of vegetation, in particular Tree Mallow. In 2018, for the first time in more than a decade, a pair fledged two chicks on the Skerries, off Anglesey after a RSPB project over previous years involving wardening, newly designed nest boxes being placed strategically around the islands along with lures playing roseate tern calls and hand-made decoys.

In the UK the roseate tern has been designated for protection under the official government&#x27;s national Biodiversity Action Plan. One of the main reasons given in the UK plan for threat to the species is global warming, creating an alteration of vertical profile distribution for its food source fishes. The roseate tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

The Canadian Wildlife Service lists the roseate tern as Threatened. The U.S. Department of Interior lists the northeastern population as Endangered and the Caribbean population as Threatened.

<text>The Order of New Zealand is the highest honour in the New Zealand royal honours system, created &quot;to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity&quot;. It was instituted by royal warrant on 6 February 1987. The order is modelled on the Order of Merit and the Order of the Companions of Honour.

==Composition==
The order comprises the Sovereign and ordinary, additional and honorary members. The ordinary membership is limited to 20 living members, and at any time there may be fewer than 20. Additional members may be appointed to commemorate important royal, state or national occasions, and such appointments were made in 1990 for the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of Waitangi, in 2002 for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, in 2007 for the 20th anniversary of the institution of the Order, in 2012 for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, in 2022 for the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee, and in 2023 to mark the coronation of King Charles III. Additional members have the same status as ordinary members. Honorary membership is for citizens of nations of which the Sovereign is not head of state. Members are entitled to the post-nominal letters &quot;ONZ&quot;. 

Appointments to the order are made by royal warrant under the monarch&#x27;s sign manual on the prime minister&#x27;s advice. The order is administered by a Secretary and Registrar (the Clerk of the Executive Council).

Richie McCaw represented the Order at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023, and took part in the procession of the King and Queen at the beginning of the ceremony.

==Insignia==

The insignia is made up of an oval medallion of the coat of arms of New Zealand in gold and coloured enamel, worn on a white and ochre ribbon around the neck for men or a bow for women on their left shoulder.

==Current members==
* Sovereign: The King of New Zealand

* Officers:

<doc id="362302" wikidata="Q844828" url="?curid=362302" title="Walks plus hits per inning pitched">
<text>In baseball statistics, walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) is a sabermetric measurement of the number of baserunners a pitcher has allowed per inning pitched. WHIP is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits allowed and dividing this sum by the number of innings pitched.

WHIP reflects a pitcher&#x27;s propensity for allowing batters to reach base, therefore a lower WHIP indicates better performance. 

While earned run average (ERA) measures the runs a pitcher gives up, WHIP more directly measures a pitcher&#x27;s effectiveness against batters. Like ERA, WHIP accounts for pitcher performance regardless of errors and unearned runs. 

==History==

The stat was invented in 1979 by writer Daniel Okrent, who called the metric &quot;innings pitched ratio&quot; at the time. Okrent excluded hit batsmen from the numerator of baserunners allowed since Sunday newspapers did not include hit batsmen in their agate box scores. 

WHIP is one of the few sabermetric statistics to enter mainstream baseball usage. In addition to its use in live games, the WHIP is one of the most commonly used statistics in fantasy baseball, and is standard in fantasy leagues that employ 4×4, 5×5, and 6×6 formats.

==Leaders==
WHIP near 1.000 or lower over the course of a season will often rank among the league leaders in Major League Baseball (MLB).

The lowest single-season WHIP in MLB history through 2024 is held by George Walker of the 1940 Kansas City Monarchs, with a WHIP of 0.7347 which broke the previous record of 0.7692 of Guy Hecker of the 1882 Louisville Eclipse. The second-lowest single-season WHIP is held by Pedro Martínez of the 2000 Boston Red Sox with a WHIP of 0.7373; third-lowest single-season WHIP is held by Kenta Maeda of the 2020 Minnesota Twins, with a WHIP of 0.7500; the fourth-lowest single-season WHIP is held by the previously mentioned Guy Hecker; the fifth-lowest single-season WHIP is held by Walter Johnson of the 1913 Washington Senators, with a WHIP of 0.7803.

Cleveland Bronchos/Naps (currently the Guardians) right-handed pitcher Addie Joss holds the MLB record for the lowest career WHIP as of 2024, with a 0.9678 WHIP in 2,327 innings. Active pitcher Jacob deGrom of the Texas Rangers currently holds a career 0.9941 WHIP in 1367 innings and holds second. Chicago White Sox spitballer Ed Walsh is third, with a 0.9996 WHIP in 2,964 innings, the lowest career WHIP for a qualified pitcher with 10 or more seasons pitched. Reliever Mariano Rivera ranks fourth among qualified pitchers with a career WHIP of 1.0003 in 1,283 innings. Los Angeles Dodgers left-handed pitcher Clayton Kershaw ranks fifth with a WHIP of 1.0096 in 2,742 innings.

<doc id="362304" wikidata="Q1264545" url="?curid=362304" title="Duke of Grafton">
<text>Duke of Grafton is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1675 by Charles II of England for Henry FitzRoy, his second illegitimate son by the Duchess of Cleveland. The most notable duke of Grafton was Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, who served as Prime Minister from 1768–1770.

The Duke of Grafton holds three subsidiary titles, all created in 1675 in the peerage of England: Earl of Euston, Viscount Ipswich, and Baron Sudbury. Between 1723 and 1936 the dukes, being descended from the 1st Duke&#x27;s wife Isabella FitzRoy, 2nd Countess of Arlington, also held the titles Earl of Arlington, Viscount Thetford and Baron Arlington. Those titles fell into abeyance between the 9th Duke&#x27;s sisters, with the abeyance of the barony of Arlington being ended in 1999.

The Dukes &quot;created&quot; and owned the London district of Fitzrovia, so named for their family name.

The title of the dukedom refers to the Honour of Grafton in the southeast of Northamptonshire, the titular village now being called Grafton Regis.

The family seat is Euston Hall in Suffolk, an 11,000-acre estate straddling the Norfolk-Suffolk border. The main burial places of the senior branch of the family are in and beside the parish church of Saint Genevieve at Euston, Suffolk.

The Duke of Grafton is fourth in the order of precedence after the dukes of Norfolk, Somerset, and Richmond.

<doc id="362310" wikidata="Q1264590" url="?curid=362310" title="Duke of Northumberland">
<text>Duke of Northumberland is a noble title that has been created three times in English and British history, twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of Great Britain. The current holder of this title is Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland.

==1551 creation==
The title was first created in the Peerage of England in 1551 for John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick. He had already been created Viscount Lisle in 1543 and Earl of Warwick in 1547, also in the Peerage of England. In 1553, Dudley advanced the claim of his daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, to the English throne, but when she was deposed by Queen Mary I, Dudley was convicted of high treason and executed. An illegitimate son of one of his younger sons, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Sir Robert Dudley, claimed the dukedom when in exile in Italy. On 9 March 1620 the Emperor Ferdinand II officially recognised the title, an act which infuriated James I of England.

==1683 creation==
George FitzRoy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, an illegitimate son of king Charles II, was created Duke of Northumberland in the Peerage of England in 1683. He had already been created Baron of Pontefract, Viscount Falmouth and Earl of Northumberland in 1674, also in the Peerage of England. However, all the titles became extinct on his death in 1716 as he left no heirs.

==Jacobite creation==
In 1716 Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton, was created Duke of Northumberland, Marquess of Woburn, Earl of Malmesbury and Viscount Winchendon in the Jacobite Peerage, by the Old Pretender. The title had no legal validity in the Kingdom of Great Britain.

== 1766 creation ==
&lt;section begin=1766 /&gt; 

The title was created for the third time in 1766 for Hugh Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (formerly Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet), who had assumed by Act of Parliament in 1750 for himself and his descendants the surname Percy, due to his having married in 1740 the daughter of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684–1750), whose mother
Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722) was the last of the senior blood line of the ancient House of Percy, being the only surviving child of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670). In 1749 King George II created Algernon (who had inherited the Dukedom of Somerset in 1748) Earl of Northumberland and Baron Warkworth, of Warkworth Castle in the County of Northumberland, with special remainder to his son-in-law Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet.

The above steps formed a deliberate move to allow ancient names and titles of the Percys to be revived in the male-heir exhausted senior branch of the Dukedom of Somerset, which at that time was about to see its largest removal – to another noble but very cadet branch (a fourth cousin) on Algernon&#x27;s death. Algernon was also created Earl of Egremont at the same time, with a different remainder.

In 1784 the 1st Duke was also granted the substantive title Lord Lovaine, Baron of Alnwick in the County of Northumberland, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to his second son Lord Algernon Percy, who succeeded and who was created Earl of Beverley in 1790, and thus it too became a courtesy title.

The 1st Duke was succeeded in the dukedom and associated titles by his eldest son, Hugh, the 2nd Duke, a lieutenant-general in the British Army. The 2nd Duke was in his turn succeeded by his eldest son, Hugh, the 3rd Duke, who in 1812, five years before he succeeded in the dukedom, had been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Percy. The 3rd Duke later held office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1829 to 1830. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Algernon, 1st Baron Prudhoe, the 4th Duke, who in 1814 had been created Baron Prudhoe, of Prudhoe Castle in the County of Northumberland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The 4th Duke was an admiral in the Royal Navy and notably served as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1852. He was also childless and on his death in 1865 the barony of Prudhoe became extinct while the barony of Percy (which could be passed on through the female line) was inherited by his great-nephew, John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl. The Admiral was succeeded in the dukedom and remaining titles by his first cousin, George, the 2nd Earl of Beverley, eldest son of the second son of the 1st Duke. The barony of Lovaine and earldom of Beverley have since been merged in the dukedom as courtesy titles.

The 5th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son, Algernon, the 6th Duke, who notably served as Lord Privy Seal between 1879 and 1880 under Lord Beaconsfield. The 6th Duke&#x27;s eldest son, Henry, the 7th Duke, was summoned to the House of lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Lord Lovaine in 1887. The 7th Duke&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Percy, Earl Percy, predeceased him. He was succeeded by his fourth but eldest surviving son, Alan, the 8th Duke, whose eldest son, Henry, the 9th Duke, was killed during the retreat to Dunkirk during the Second World War. Henry was succeeded by his younger brother, Hugh, the 10th Duke. In 1957, on the death of his fourth cousin once removed, James Stewart-Murray, 9th Duke of Atholl, Hugh succeeded as 9th Baron Percy, the title thus re-merging with the Dukedom. As of 2012 the titles are held by his second son, Ralph, the 12th Duke, who succeeded on the death of his elder brother in 1995. &lt;section end=1766 /&gt; &lt;section begin=members/&gt;

Northumberland Estates manages : directly managing of forestry and of farmland, with approximately 100 tenant farmers managing the remaining bulk of the land.

==Other members of the Percy family==
Several other members of the Percy family have also gained distinction. Charlotte Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, wife of the third Duke, was governess of the future Queen Victoria. Lord Josceline Percy, second son of the fifth Duke, was a politician. Lord Henry Percy, third son of the fifth Duke, was a soldier. Lord Algernon Percy, second son of the sixth Duke, was a politician. Lord Eustace Percy, seventh son of the seventh Duke, was a politician who was raised to the peerage as Baron Percy of Newcastle in 1953. Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, wife of the twelfth Duke, is Lord-Lieutenant of Northumberland since 2009. See also Earl of Beverley for younger sons of the first Earl of Beverley. &lt;section end=members/&gt; &lt;section begin=residences/&gt;

==Family residences==
The seat of the Dukes of Northumberland is Alnwick Castle, which is located in Alnwick, Northumberland. The family&#x27;s London residence is Syon House in Brentford, which replaced, as their London residence, the demolished Northumberland House in the Strand. Warkworth and Prudhoe castles were the residences of the Earls of Northumberland in the Middle Ages, and ownership was retained by the later Dukes. Both are now in the custody of English Heritage. Albury Park is a former residence which has been converted into apartments, while the surrounding estate is still directly owned by the Duke. The traditional burial place of the Dukes is the Northumberland Vault in Westminster Abbey in London, the Percys thus being the last family to maintain such a privilege. Their family vault is however nearly full, and a new private graveyard has been created in Hulne Park near Alnwick. &lt;section end=residences/&gt;

==Coat of arms==
== Ducal pipers==
Since at least the mid 18th century, the family has maintained a Northumbrian piper; the earliest known of these was Joseph Turnbull, who was painted in 1756 playing his pipes; the portrait, entitled &quot;Joseph Turnbull, Piper to the Duchess of Northumberland&quot; is at Alnwick Castle. At this time, before the Third Creation of the Dukedom, he would actually have been piper to the Countess. A later piper, William Green stated that &quot;Joe Turnbull was the first Piper at Alnwick Castle – that was ever!&quot; A list of the Ducal Pipers is at. The Ducal Piper from 1982-2022 was Richard Butler and the position is currently held by Andrew Davison. The piper&#x27;s main duty is to play at the Shrove Tuesday football match in Alnwick, but they are invited to a variety of other functions.

Other pipers have been associated less formally with the family – the notorious piper James Allan (1729–1810) was a favourite of the Countess; in the last century Tom Clough and Richard Mowat are known to have played together with the Duke&#x27;s then piper, James Hall, for the Duke and his guests at Alnwick; one such guest was Edward VII, in 1905.

== Named in their honour ==

* Northumberland Islands, off Queensland, Australia
** Northumberland Islands National Park, a protected area in Queensland
* Percy Isles, off Queensland, Australia

==In popular culture==
*Sir Henry Percy, popularly known as &quot;Harry Hotspur&quot;, is portrayed as a dashing hero by William Shakespeare in his historical play &quot;Henry IV, Part One&quot;. Sir Henry was the eldest son and heir apparent of the 1st Earl of Northumberland and would have succeeded his father if not for his untimely death at the Battle of Shrewsbury.
*Lord Percy Percy, played by Tim McInnerny, is a major character in the first two series of the British sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;. In the first series, he is the Duke of Northumberland, while the Lord Percy in the second series is presumably his descendant and is heir to the dukedom. The first series was partly filmed at Alnwick Castle, the residence and seat of the real Dukes of Northumberland.

<text>The Executive Council of New Zealand () is the full group of &quot;responsible advisers&quot; to the governor-general, who advise on state and constitutional affairs. All government ministers must be appointed as executive councillors before they are appointed as ministers; therefore all members of Cabinet are also executive councillors. The governor-general signs a warrant of appointment for each member of the Executive Council, and separate warrants for each ministerial portfolio.

To be an executive councillor, one must normally be a member of Parliament (this was codified in the Constitution Act of 1986). However, one may serve up to thirty days without being in Parliament; this is to allow for the transition of members not yet sworn in and members who have retired or been defeated. Each executive councillor must take the relevant oaths or affirmations set out in legislation.

==Origin==

The Executive Council of New Zealand was first constituted in 1840 by proclamation of Governor William Hobson, who designated it as the principal advisory body in the administration of the government.

==Function==
The Executive Council&#x27;s primary function is to issue Orders in Council, which operate under the authority of the &quot;Governor-General-in-Council&quot;. The authority for its existence is provided by the Letters Patent 1983. The Executive Council has &quot;de jure&quot; executive power. This power is used to legally enact the decisions of Cabinet (the &quot;de facto&quot; body of executive power), which under conventions of the Westminster system has no &quot;de jure&quot; authority.

According to the &quot;Cabinet Manual&quot;: 
:The Executive Council, which is constituted by the Letters Patent, is the highest formal instrument of government. It is the institution through which the government collectively and formally advises the Governor-General.

:Action by the Governor-General in Council requires two elements:

::a. a recommendation by a Minister or Ministers (that is, a member or members of the Executive Council); and
::b. the advice and consent of the Executive Council that the Governor-General in Council act in accordance with the Minister&#x27;s recommendation.

:Orders in Council are the main method, apart from Acts of Parliament, by which the government implements decisions that require the force of law. Meetings of the Executive Council are called for the purpose of making such Orders and carrying out other formal acts of state.

:The submission of almost all items for consideration by the Executive Council must be authorised by Cabinet.

=== Meetings ===

The Executive Council meets every Monday to sign Orders in Council (regarding regulations and appointments, for example), and may also informally brief the governor-general on political developments and constitutional issues that have arisen. Any three members of the Executive Council constitute a quorum.

The clerk of the Executive Council (who is also the Cabinet secretary) is appointed by the governor-general on advice of the prime minister, and is responsible for attending all meetings of the Council and keeping records of its meetings, as well as for co-coordinating any official support or advice to the governor-general. The clerk also countersigns any Order in Council, proclamation, or other legal instrument issued by the governor-general.

== Governor-General-in-Council ==

The Executive Council was created to advise the governor-general (who represents the monarch); it was the counterpart to the Legislative Council, the now-defunct upper house of the New Zealand Parliament. The governor-general presides over, but is not a member of, the Executive Council. Most of the powers vested in the governor-general (prerogative powers), such as appointments of political officials, are exercisable only under advice from the Executive Council. The governor-general is bound by convention to follow the advice.

== Distinction from Cabinet ==

Members of the Executive Council are referred to as ministers of the Crown, which is not equivalent to being a Cabinet minister; their appointment as members of the Council gives them the authority to exercise executive power. Most members of the Executive Council are Cabinet ministers, but some are appointed as so-called &quot;minister outside Cabinet&quot;; they are still members of the Executive Council but not of Cabinet. By constitutional convention, only members of Cabinet advise the governor-general through the Executive Council. Ministers outside Cabinet traditionally hold minor portfolios, or serve as associate ministers, with carefully specified powers and responsibilities delegated to them by relevant portfolio ministers.

One of the first instances in which a minister of the Crown did not hold a seat in Cabinet occurred when David Lange served as Attorney-General from 1989 to 1990, after resigning as Prime Minister. The appointment of Winston Peters as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Peter Dunne as Minister of Revenue subsequent to the 2005 general election saw the status of ministers outside Cabinet develop significantly, given that they were appointed to important ministerial positions outside Cabinet in exchange for their parties supporting the Government on matters of confidence and supply while being required to defend Government policies only within their spheres of ministerial responsibility.

There have also been ministers without portfolio, e.g., Mark Fagan from 1935 to 1939, who was briefly acting Minister of Customs in 1939. He was followed by David Wilson from 1939 to 1949, who was Minister of Immigration 1940–44. They were members of the Legislative Council, not the House of Representatives.

<text>Duke of Montrose (named for Montrose, Angus) is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Scotland. The title was created anew in 1707, for James Graham, 4th Marquess of Montrose, great-grandson of famed James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Montrose was elevated as a reward for his important support of the Act of Union. It has remained since then in the Graham family, tied to the chieftainship of Clan Graham.

The Duke&#x27;s subsidiary titles are: Marquess of Montrose (created 1644), Marquess of Graham and Buchanan (1707), Earl of Montrose (1503), Earl of Kincardine (1644), Earl Graham (1722), Viscount Dundaff (1707), Lord Graham (1445), Lord Graham and Mugdock (1644), Lord Aberruthven, Mugdock and Fintrie (1707) and Baron Graham, of Belford (1722). The titles of Earl Graham and Baron Graham are in the Peerage of Great Britain; the rest are in the Peerage of Scotland. The eldest son of the Duke uses the courtesy title of Marquess of Graham and Buchanan.

The family seat is Auchmar House, near Loch Lomond, Stirlingshire. It was previously Buchanan Castle, near Drymen, Stirlingshire.

<doc id="362321" wikidata="Q6198" url="?curid=362321" title="Pepi II Neferkare">
<text>Pepi II Neferkare ( 2284 BC – 2214 BC) was a king of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt&#x27;s Old Kingdom. His second name, Neferkare (&quot;Nefer-ka-Re&quot;), means &quot;Beautiful is the Ka of Re&quot;. He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Nemtyemsaf I.

Pepi II&#x27;s reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the king declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other&#x27;s territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within a couple of years after the end of Pepi II&#x27;s reign. This led to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt which lasted from the Seventh Dynasty of Egypt to the Tenth Dynasty of Egypt.

==Early reign==
He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II, but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th Dynasty royal seals and stone blocks – the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II – were discovered in the 1999–2000 excavation season at Saqqara, which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I&#x27;s death and became this king&#x27;s chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: &quot;King&#x27;s Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King&#x27;s Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King&#x27;s Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II&quot;. Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre&#x27;s own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I&#x27;s grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II&#x27;s father since he is known to have married Pepi II&#x27;s known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II.

His mother Ankhesenpepi II (Ankhesenmeryre II) most likely ruled as regent in the early years of his reign. She may have been helped in turn by her brother Djau, who was a vizier under the previous pharaoh. An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. Despite his long reign, this piece is one of only three known sculptural representations in existence of this particular king. Some scholars have taken the relative paucity of royal statuary to suggest that the royal court was losing the ability to retain skilled artisans.

A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Sent to trade and collect ivory, ebony, and other precious items, he captured a pygmy. News of this reached the royal court, and an excited young king sent word back to Harkhuf that he would be greatly rewarded if the pygmy were brought back alive, where he would have likely served as an entertainer for the court. This letter was preserved as a lengthy inscription on Harkhuf&#x27;s tomb, and has been called the first travelogue.

==Family==

Over his long life, Pepi II had several wives, including:
*Neith – She was the mother of Pepi&#x27;s successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II. She may be a daughter of Ankhesenpepi I and hence also Pepi II&#x27;s cousin and half-sister.
*Iput II – A half-sister of Pepi II.
*Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.
*Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. It is not known which Neferkare as there are several kings with that name during the First Intermediate Period. His name may be Neferkare Nebi.
*Udjebten She was also a daughter of Pepi I.
*Meritites IV - Originally thought to be a wife of Pepi I, she is now known to have been one of Pepi II&#x27;s consorts, and a daughter of Pepi I.

Of these queens, Neith, Iput, and Udjebten each had their own minor pyramids and mortuary temples as part of the king&#x27;s own pyramid complex in Saqqara. Queen Ankhesenpepi III and Meritites IV were buried in pyramids near the pyramid of Pepi I Meryre, and Ankhesenpepi IV was buried in a chapel in the complex of Queen Udjebten.

Two more sons of Pepi II are known: Nebkauhor-Idu and Ptahshepses (D).

==Foreign policy==
Pepi II seems to have carried on foreign policy in ways similar to that of his predecessors. Copper and turquoise were mined at Wadi Maghareh in the Sinai Peninsula, and alabaster was quarried from Hatnub. He is mentioned in inscriptions found in the Phoenician city of Byblos.

In the south, the trade relations consist of caravans trading with the Nubians. Harkhuf was a governor of Upper Egypt, who led several expeditions under Merenre and Pepi II. His last expedition was a trip to a place called Iam. Harkhuf brought back with him what his correspondence with the young pharaoh referred to as a dwarf, apparently a pygmy. Egypt received goods such as incense, ebony, animal skins, and ivory from Nubia.
The Western desert was known to have extensive caravan routes. Some of these routes allowed for trade with the Kharga Oasis, the Selima Oasis, and the Dakhla Oasis.

==King Neferkare and General Sasenet==
Only a small number of pharaohs were immortalized in ancient fiction, Pepi II may be among them. In the tale of &quot;King Neferkare and General Sasenet&quot;, three fragments of a papyrus dating from the late New Kingdom (although the story may have been composed earlier), report clandestine nocturnal meetings with a military commander – a General Sasenet or Sisene. Some have suggested this reflects a homosexual relationship although it is disputed that the text relates to Pepi II at all. Some, like R. S. Bianchi, think that it is a work of archaizing literature and dates to the 25th Dynasty referring to Shabaka Neferkare, a Kushite pharaoh.

==Decline of the Old Kingdom==
The decline of the Old Kingdom arguably began before the time of Pepi II, with nomarchs (regional representatives of the king) becoming more and more powerful and exerting greater influence. Pepi I, for example, married two sisters who were the daughters of a nomarch and later made their brother a vizier. Their influence was extensive, both sisters bearing sons who were chosen as part of the royal succession: Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and Pepi II himself.

Increasing wealth and power appears to have been handed over to high officials during Pepi II&#x27;s reign. Large and expensive tombs appear at many of the major nomes of Egypt, built for the reigning nomarchs, the priestly class and other administrators. Nomarchs were traditionally free from taxation and their positions became hereditary. Their increasing wealth and independence led to a corresponding shift in power away from the central royal court to the regional nomarchs.

Later in his reign, it is known that Pepi divided the role of vizier so that there were two viziers: one for Upper Egypt and one for Lower, a further decentralization of power away from the royal capital of Memphis. Further, the seat of vizier of Lower Egypt was moved several times. The southern vizier was based at Thebes.

==Reign length==

Pepi II is often mentioned as the longest reigning monarch in history, due to a 3rd-century BC account of Ancient Egypt by Manetho, which accords the king a reign of 94 years; this has, however, been disputed by some Egyptologists such as Hans Goedicke and Michel Baud due to the absence of attested dates known for Pepi II after his 31st count (Year 62 if biennial). Ancient sources upon which Manetho&#x27;s estimate is based are long lost, and could have resulted from a misreading on Manetho&#x27;s behalf (see von Beckerath). The Turin canon attributes 90+ [X] years of reign to Pepi II, but this document dates to the time of Ramesses II, 1,000 years after Pepi II&#x27;s death.

At the present time, the latest written source contemporary with Pepi II dates from the &quot;Year after the 31st Count, 1st Month of Shemu, day 20&quot; from Hatnub graffito No.7 (Spalinger, 1994), which implies, assuming a biennial cattle count system, that this king had a reign of at least 62 complete or partial years. Therefore, some Egyptologists suggest instead that Pepi II reigned no more than 64 years. This is based on the complete absence of higher attested dates for Pepi beyond his Year after the 31st Count (Year 62 on a biannual cattle count). A previous suggestion by Hans Goedicke that the Year of the 33rd Count appears for Pepi II in a royal decree for the mortuary cult of Queen Udjebten was withdrawn by Goedicke himself in 1988 in favour of a reading of &quot;the Year of the 24th Count&quot; instead. Goedicke writes that Pepi II is attested by numerous year dates until the Year of his 31st count which strongly implies that this king died shortly after a reign of about 64 years. Other scholars note that the lack of contemporary sources dated after his 62nd year on the throne does not preclude a much longer reign, in particular since the end of Pepi II&#x27;s reign was marked by a sharp decline in the fortunes of the Old Kingdom pharaohs who succeeded him.

The Egyptologist David Henige states while there have been examples of kinglists where rulers were ascribed reigns as long as that assigned to Pepi II, &quot;often exceeding 100 years, but these are invariably rejected as mythical&quot;, the problems inherent in dating Pepi II&#x27;s reign are many since:...a hyperextended duration [for Pepi II&#x27;s reign] is not really necessary to bring Old Kingdom chronology into some equilibrium with other chronologies. For Mesopotamia from at least this early until virtually the Persian conquest, numerous localized synchronisms play vital roles in absolute dating, but seldom affect the duration of individual dynasties. Not only is Old Kingdom Egypt well outside any &quot;synchronism zone&quot; but, as it happens, since Pepy [II] was the last substantive ruler of Egypt before a period of political and chronological chaos...there are no awkward ramifying effects by reducing his reign by twenty or thirty years, a period that can simply be added on to the First Intermediate Period.Henige himself is somewhat skeptical of the 94 year figure assigned to Pepi II and follows Naguib Kanawati&#x27;s 2003 suggestion that this king&#x27;s reign was most probably much shorter than 94 years.

This situation could have produced a succession crisis and led to a stagnation of the administration, centered on an absolute yet aging ruler who was not replaced because of his perceived divine status. A later, yet better documented, example of this type of problem is the case of the long reigning Nineteenth Dynasty pharaoh Ramesses II and his successors.

It has been proposed that the 4.2 kiloyear event be linked to the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, though current resolution of evidence is not sufficient to make an assertion.

==The Ipuwer Papyrus==
In the past it had been suggested that Ipuwer the sage served as a treasury official during the last years of Pepi II Neferkare&#x27;s reign. The Ipuwer Papyrus was thought by some to describe the collapse of the Old Kingdom and the beginning of the Dark Age, known to historians as the First Intermediate Period. It had been claimed that archaeological evidence from Syrian button seals supported this interpretation. The admonitions may not be a discussion with a king at all however. Eberhard Otto was the first to suggest that the discussion was not between Ipuwer and his king, but that this was a discussion between Ipuwer and a deity. showed through philological interpretation and revision of the relevant passages that this is indeed a discussion with a deity. Modern research suggests that the papyrus dates to the much later 13th Dynasty, with part of the papyrus now thought to date to the time of Pharaoh Khety I, and the admonitions of Ipuwer actually being addressed to the god Atum, not a mortal king. The admonitions are thought to harken back to the First Intermediate Period and record a decline in international relations and a general impoverishment in Egypt.

==Pyramid complex==
The pyramid complex was called 
The complex consists of Pepi&#x27;s pyramid with its adjacent mortuary temple. The pyramid contained a core made of limestone and clay mortar. The pyramid was encased in white limestone. An interesting feature is that after the north chapel and the wall was completed, the builders tore down these structures and enlarged the base of the pyramid. A band of brickwork reaching to the height of the perimeter wall was then added to the pyramid. The purpose of this band is not known. It has been suggested that the builders wanted the structure to resemble the hieroglyph for pyramid, or that possibly the builders wanted to fortify the base of the structure due to an earthquake.

The burial chamber had a gabled ceiling covered by painted stars. Two of the walls consisted of large granite slabs. The sarcophagus was made of black granite and inscribed with the king&#x27;s name and titles. A canopic chest was sunk in the floor.

To the northwest of the pyramid of Pepi II, the pyramids of his consorts Neith and Iput were built. The pyramid of Udjebten is located to the south of Pepi&#x27;s pyramid. The Queen&#x27;s pyramids each had their own chapel, temple and a satellite pyramid. Neith&#x27;s pyramid was the largest and may have been the first to be built. The pyramids of the Queens contained Pyramid Texts.

The mortuary temple adjacent to the pyramid was decorated with scenes showing the king spearing a hippopotamus and thus triumphing over chaos. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. The scene with the Libyan chief is a copy from Sahure&#x27;s temple. A courtyard was surrounded by 18 pillars which were decorated with scenes of the king in the presence of gods.

Despite the longevity of Pepi II, his pyramid was no larger than those of his predecessors at 150 cubits () per side at the base and 100 cubits () high and followed what had become the &#x27;standard format&#x27;. The pyramid was made from small, local stones and infill, covered with a veneer of limestone. The limestone was removed and the core has slumped. The causeway was approximately long and the valley temple was on the shores of a lake, long since gone.

The site is located at .

===Excavation===
The complex was first investigated by John Shae Perring, but it was Gaston Maspero who first entered the pyramid in 1881. Gustave Jéquier was the first to investigate the complex in detail between 1926 and 1936. Jéquier was the first excavator to start actually finding any remains from the tomb reliefs, and he was the first to publish a thorough excavation report on the complex.

==Portraiture==

A statue which is now in the Brooklyn Museum depicts Queen Ankhenesmerire II with her son Pepi II on her lap. Pepi II wears the royal nemes headdress and a kilt. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. This difference in size is atypical because the king is usually shown larger than others. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. Alternatively the statue may depict Ankhenesmerire II as the divine mother.

Another statue of Pepi II is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (JE 50616). The king is shown as a naked child. The depiction of the king at such a young age may refer to the age he came to the throne. A statue head of Pepi II, currently resides at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

==Successors==
There are few official contemporary records or inscriptions of Pepi&#x27;s immediate successors. According to Manetho and the Turin King List, he was succeeded by his son Merenre Nemtyemsaf II, who reigned for just over a year. It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.

This was the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, a prelude to the roughly 200-year span of Egyptian history known as the First Intermediate Period.

<text>Hard Rock Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in the southeastern United States, located in Miami Gardens, Florida. The stadium is the home field for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) and the Miami Hurricanes, the University of Miami&#x27;s NCAA Division I college football team.

The stadium has hosted six Super Bowls (XXIII, XXIX, XXXIII, XLI, XLIV, LIV) the 2010 Pro Bowl, two World Series (, ), four BCS National Championship Games (2001, 2005, 2009, 2013), one CFP National Championship (2021), one Copa América final (2024), the second round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic, and WrestleMania XXVIII.

In addition, the stadium hosts the Orange Bowl, an annual college football bowl game, and the Miami Open tennis tournament. Since 2022, the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium has also hosted the Miami International Autodrome, a temporary racing circuit used for Formula 1&#x27;s Miami Grand Prix. The stadium will host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It also hosted matches for the 2024 Copa América (including the final) and the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. From 1993 until 2011, the stadium also was the home field of the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB) until their move to LoanDepot Park in 2012.

The facility opened in 1987 as Joe Robbie Stadium and has been known by a number of names since: Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Land Shark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium. In August 2016, the team sold the naming rights to Hard Rock Cafe Inc. for $250 million over 18 years; they will retain the naming rights until 2034.

==History==
===Conception and construction===

For their first 21 seasons, the Miami Dolphins played at the Orange Bowl. Team founder Joe Robbie explained what led to the decision to build a new stadium: &quot;In 1976, the city of Miami wanted to quadruple our rent. That did it. I began thinking in earnest about building a stadium.&quot; What made the construction of the stadium unique was that it was the first multipurpose stadium ever built in the United States that was entirely privately financed.

Robbie also believed it was only a matter of time before a Major League Baseball (MLB) team came to South Florida. At his request, the stadium was built in a rectangular configuration, with a field that was somewhat wider than was normally the case for an NFL stadium. The wide field also made it fairly easy to convert the stadium for soccer. Because of this design decision, the first row of seats was from the sideline in a football configuration, considerably more distant than the first row of seats in most football stadiums (the closest seats at the new Soldier Field, for instance, are from the sideline at the 50-yard line). This resulted in a less-intimate venue for football compared to other football facilities built around this time, as well as to the Orange Bowl.

At the time it opened in 1987, Joe Robbie Stadium was located in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, and had a Miami address. Specifically it was in the Scott Lake census-designated place. Today, it is located in the city of Miami Gardens, which was incorporated on May 13, 2003.

Widespread damage to the stadium was reported to have occurred during the 2024 Copa América final international soccer match which was held at Hard Rock Stadium on July 14, 2024.

===Miami Dolphins===

The first preseason game for the Dolphins was played on August 16, 1987, against the Chicago Bears. The first regular season game was scheduled for September 27, a week 3 game against the New York Giants; this game was canceled and not made up due to the 1987 players strike. The first regular season NFL game played there was a 42–0 Dolphins victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on October 11, 1987. The game was in the middle of the 1987 NFL strike, and was played with replacement players. The first game with union players was on October 25 of that year, a 34–31 overtime loss to the Buffalo Bills. The stadium hosted its first &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on December 7 of that year, a 37–28 Dolphins victory over the New York Jets.

The Dolphins have played eight playoff games at the stadium, including the 1992 AFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Buffalo Bills 29–10. The Dolphins are 5–3 in playoff games held there, losing the most recent one in January 2009 against the Baltimore Ravens. Also of note, the stadium was host of the 2018 Miracle in Miami game against the New England Patriots, where the Dolphins scored on the last play of the game. The Dolphins have beaten every NFL team there at least once. The team is unbeaten there against the Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams (4–0).

===Miami Hurricanes football===
Since 2008, the stadium has served as the home field for the Miami Hurricanes college football team, a premier college football program that has won five national championships since 1983. The university signed a 25-year contract to play at Hard Rock Stadium through 2033.

Prior to their move to Hard Rock Stadium, from 1937 until 2008, the Miami Hurricanes played their home games at the Miami Orange Bowl.

===Florida Marlins===

From 1993 until 2011, the stadium served as the home field to the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball.

While Joe Robbie Stadium was built primarily for football, it was also designed to easily accommodate baseball and soccer. Dolphins founder Joe Robbie believed it was a foregone conclusion that MLB would come to South Florida, so he wanted the stadium designed to make any necessary renovations for baseball as seamless as possible. In 1990, Wayne Huizenga purchased 50% of Joe Robbie Stadium and became the point man in the drive to bring Major League Baseball to South Florida. That effort was rewarded in July 1991, when the Miami area was awarded an MLB expansion franchise. The new team was named the Florida Marlins, and placed in the National League to begin play in 1993. Proposed 1994 FIFA World Cup matches could not be held at the stadium, as this June–July tournament conflicted directly with Marlins home games; Orlando&#x27;s Citrus Bowl was used instead. The first Marlins game at Joe Robbie Stadium was played on April 5, 1993, a 6–3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Marlins drew over three million people in their inaugural season, and went on to win two World Series titles in 1997 and 2003.

Despite such preparation and pockets of success, the stadium was less than adequate as a baseball venue. Although designed from the ground up to accommodate baseball, it was not a true multi-purpose stadium. Rather, it was a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. There were plenty of reminders of this at Marlins games. The stadium&#x27;s color scheme matched that of the Dolphins. When the football season overlapped, cleat marks, as well as silhouettes of hashmarks and logos of the Dolphins or Hurricanes, were visible on the baseball diamond. During football games, the infield dirt was visible on the gridiron. The Marlins reduced capacity to 47,662 (later to 35,521), mainly to create a more intimate atmosphere for baseball. However, capacity would have likely been reduced in any event, since many of the seats in the upper deck were too far from the field to be of any use during the regular season. Even with the reduced capacity, the sight lines were less than optimal for baseball. Most seats were pointed toward the 50-yard line—where center field was located in the baseball configuration. Lights were not angled for optimum baseball visibility. Players had to walk through football tunnels to get to dugouts that were designed with low ceiling joists. Some of these issues were showcased on national television during the two World Series held there, when capacity was expanded to over 67,000. Most notably, some areas of left and center field were not part of the football playing field, and fans sitting in the left-field upper deck could not see any game action in those areas except on the replay boards. These issues became even more pronounced over the years, as, by 2004, a wave of baseball-only parks left what had by then been renamed Pro Player Stadium as the only National League park that played host to both an MLB and an NFL team.

Additionally, the stadium was built for games held during the fall/winter football season, not for games in the tropical summers of South Florida, which feature oppressive heat, humidity, frequent rain, and occasional tropical storms. For most of the stadium&#x27;s run as a baseball venue, it was the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures for day games frequently reaching well above . The Marlins played most of their summer home games at night as a result. The lack of refuge from the uncomfortable climate and disruptive rain delays were considered a cause of chronically low attendance after that inaugural season. When the Marlins were not contending, they struggled to attract crowds larger than 5,000, a figure that looked even smaller than that due to the cavernous environment. Some Marlins players later admitted that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t wait to go on the road&quot; because Sun Life Stadium (as their home had been renamed in 2010) had the &quot;worst [playing] conditions&quot; and least fan energy in the majors during years when the team was not a contender.

====Baseball renovations and configurations====

After Huizenga bought part of the stadium, it was extensively renovated to accommodate a baseball team at the cost of several million dollars, as part of his successful bid to bring baseball to South Florida. Purists initially feared the result would be similar to Exhibition Stadium in Toronto; when the Toronto Blue Jays played there from 1977 to 1989, they were burdened with seats that were so far from the field (over 800 feet in some cases) that they were not even sold during the regular season. However, Robbie had foreseen Miami would be a likely location for a new or relocated MLB team, and the stadium was designed to make any necessary renovations for baseball as seamless as possible. On January 24, 1994, soon after buying the Dolphins, Huizenga acquired the remaining 50% of the stadium to give him 100% ownership.

Aside from baseball renovations, the stadium underwent some permanent renovations. In April 2006, the stadium unveiled two Daktronics large video boards, the largest in professional sports at the time. The east display measured high by wide, and the west end zone display measured high by wide. A new -long LED ribbon board, again the largest in the world at the time, was also installed. These have since been surpassed in size.

In addition, the upgrades included vastly widened concourses on the stadium&#x27;s north and south sides. Bars, lounges and other amenities were also added. The renovation had three phases, with the second and third phases of renovation taking place after the Marlins left the stadium. These remaining phases included adding a canopy to shield fans from the rain, which caused the relocation of the video boards to the corners of the upper deck, as well as narrowing the sidelines by bringing the seats closer to the field, ending its convertibility to baseball. The orange colored seats were also replaced with aqua colored ones.

===2015 renovation===
The Marlins left for their own stadium, Marlins Park (now LoanDepot Park), which was completed for the 2012 MLB season.

A privately funded $350 million stadium renovation project began in January 2015, after the 2014 Orange Bowl. The project plan allowed the stadium to be used for football games during the 2015 NFL season, and was completed for the 2016 season. Stadium upgrades included video boards in each corner of the stadium, additional suites, and an open-air canopy over the main seating areas. As part of the renovation, the stadium&#x27;s seating capacity was reduced from 75,000 to 65,000 seats. Personal seat licenses were not used, and a preview center opened at the stadium in February 2015 to help current and prospective season ticket holders select their ticket packages. Luxury packages were used in place of PSL revenue to help finance the stadium. Thirty-two four-seat pods were installed located in the lower bowl at the south 30-yard lines, with an additional 16 pods at the south end zone. The pods feature a living room arrangement, including premium furniture and television screens that show the NFL RedZone channel and NFL programming.

===Tennis===
In November 2017, the Miami Open tennis tournament announced that it would move from Crandon Park in Key Biscayne to Hard Rock Stadium in 2019. Its organizers had pursued a $50 million refurbishment of the aging facility, including the addition of three permanent stadium courts. However, the family who originally owned the land filed a lawsuit that blocked their construction, as their agreement to donate the site to Miami-Dade County in 1992 contained a stipulation that only one stadium may be built on the site.

To host the tournament, 29 permanent courts (including 11 tournament courts, with one being a 4,993-seat grandstand court) were built on Hard Rock Stadium&#x27;s south parking lots. The stadium proper serves as center court, using a modified, 13,800-seat configuration with temporary grandstands constructed on the playing surface, placing the court roughly between the two 30-yard lines. The move to Hard Rock Stadium was praised by players and fans because of the ample space the complex provides.

In January 2020, the stadium opened the SkyView gondola, which runs at the south side of the stadium complex and provides views of the grounds and the Miami skyline.

===Seating capacity===


===Permanent seating===
The 65,326 permanent seats for football and soccer configurations break down as follows: for the general seats with chair back and armrests, there are 27,397 in the lower deck and 34,736 in the upper deck. There are 10,209 of the bigger club seats with chair back and armrests. In the 193 executive suites with 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 seats, there are a total of 3,198. There are also 300 accessible seating locations for spectators with disabilities, 150 seats for working press, and 10 radio/TV booths.

The stadium contains 10,209 club seats and 216 suites. When the Marlins played at the stadium, 2,400 of the club seats and 216 suites were available.

The parking around the stadium takes up 140 acres, featuring parking for 24,137 cars, 171 buses, 90 RVs, 85 limousines, and one helipad on site.

==Events==
===NFL===


The stadium has played host to six Super Bowls (XXIII, XXIX, XXXIII, XLI, XLIV, and LIV). and also hosted the 2010 Pro Bowl.

Super Bowl XLI in 2007 at Dolphin Stadium, when the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29–17, was marred by heavy rains. An estimated 30% of the lower-level seating was empty during the second half.

In 2010, the NFL threatened to take the stadium out of further consideration for a Super Bowl or Pro Bowl unless significant renovations were made. One of the upgrades desired was a roof to protect fans from the elements. In 2012, the Dolphins scrapped plans for pitching a $200 million hotel tax proposal that would have included a partial stadium roof.

In 2016, an open-air canopy was constructed that protects the seating bowl from the elements. The canopy, however, does have a football-field-sized hole in the middle, and thus does not protect the playing field itself from rain. The renovations were completed by the first Miami Dolphins pre-season home game in September 2016.

Previously, since the field runs east–west (rather than north–south, as is the case in most other stadiums), the north stands were exposed to the full force of South Florida&#x27;s oppressive heat early in the season. The issue became so problematic that Stephen Ross, who owned the Dolphins and the stadium, successfully petitioned the NFL to have all September home games start at or after 4 pm. Ross knew that for much of September, the Dolphins had a substantial home-field advantage against opponents unaccustomed to the sweltering heat. However, he was willing to give that up in order to ensure a more comfortable environment for fans, as well as allow the stadium to host another Super Bowl.

In 2021, the team opened the Baptist Health Training Complex at the west side of the Stadium complex. The Dolphins permanently moved to the state-of-the art facility that hosts the team headquarters, and is also a World Cup practice facility site.

===College football===

Since 2008, the stadium has served as the home field for the Miami Hurricanes, one of college football&#x27;s most storied football programs. It also served briefly as the home field for the Florida Atlantic Owls from 2001 to 2002.

The stadium has hosted both the 2009 BCS National Championship Game and the 2013 BCS National Championship Game. The 2013 game between Alabama and Notre Dame set a new attendance record for the facility, with 80,120 on hand to witness Alabama&#x27;s third BCS Championship in four seasons.

Between 1990 and 2000, the stadium hosted a bowl game variously known as the Blockbuster Bowl, CarQuest Bowl and MicronPC Bowl. After 2000, that bowl was moved to Orlando, where it eventually became known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.

The stadium has been the site of the Orange Bowl game since 1996, except for the January 1999 contest between Florida and Syracuse, which had to be moved due to a conflict with a Dolphins playoff game.

Until 2008, the stadium was host (in even numbered years) to the annual Shula Bowl, a game played between the Florida Atlantic University Owls and the Florida International University Panthers, when the game was hosted by FAU as the home team (FIU hosts the game at its own stadium, Riccardo Silva Stadium, every other year). In 2010, the game was moved to Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s Lockhart Stadium, and in 2011 the Owls opened FAU Stadium on its Boca Raton campus, and started hosting the Shula Bowl there biennially in 2012.

The stadium hosted the 2021 College Football Playoff National Championship game and (as the Orange Bowl) the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship semi-final game. The stadium will host the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship on January 19, 2026 and the 2030 College Football Playoff National Championship on January 21, 2030.

===WrestleMania XXVIII===

On April 1, 2012, the stadium hosted WrestleMania XXVIII, WWE&#x27;s flagship professional wrestling event. This was the second edition of WrestleMania to be held in Florida, and the third to be held entirely outdoors. The event was headlined by the &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; match where The Rock defeated John Cena. The other most prominent match on the card was the &quot;End of an Era&quot; Hell in a Cell match, in which The Undertaker defeated Triple H to extend his WrestleMania winning streak to 20–0. Shawn Michaels served as special guest referee for the match. With an attendance of 78,363, the event grossed $67 million, and was estimated to have generated $103 million in revenue for Miami. The event is still the most purchased WWE PPV/PLE ever, garnering 1.217 Million buys.

===Baseball===
Two National League Division Series have been played at Hard Rock Stadium:

* 1997 against the San Francisco Giants: Marlins win 3 games to 0
* 2003 against the San Francisco Giants: Marlins win 3 games to 1

Two National League Championship Series have been played at Hard Rock Stadium:
* 1997 against the Atlanta Braves: Marlins win 4 games to 2
* 2003 against the Chicago Cubs: Marlins win 4 games to 3

Two World Series have been played at Hard Rock Stadium:
* 1997 against the Cleveland Indians: Marlins win 4 games to 3
* 2003 against the New York Yankees: Marlins win 4 games to 2

All those series have been played when the stadium went by the name Pro Player Stadium.

When the Marlins began play in 1993, the stadium&#x27;s baseball capacity was initially reduced to 47,662, with most of the upper level covered with a tarp. In addition to Huizenga&#x27;s desire to create a more intimate atmosphere for baseball, most of the seats in the upper level would have been too far from the field to be of any use during the regular season. The stadium&#x27;s baseball capacity was further reduced over the years, and finally settled at 38,560 seats. However, the Marlins would usually open the entire upper level for the postseason. In the 1997 World Series, the Marlins played before crowds of over 67,000 fans, some of the highest postseason attendance figures in MLB history, only exceeded by Cleveland Stadium during the 1948 and 1954 World Series, old Yankee Stadium prior to its mid-1970s renovation, and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in the 1959 World Series.

Although it was designed from the ground up to accommodate baseball, it was never a true multipurpose stadium. Rather, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. Most of the seats in the baseball configuration were pointed toward center field – where the 50-yard line would have been in the football configuration. As a result, even with the reduced capacity, the sight lines for baseball left much to be desired. This was particularly evident during the Marlins&#x27; World Series appearances in 1997 and 2003. Some portions of left and center field were not part of the football playing field, and fans sitting in the left field upper-deck seats were unable to see these areas except on the replay boards. Even with the reduced capacity, during years the Marlins were not contending, they often drew crowds of 5,000 or fewer—a total that looked even smaller due to the spacious environment.

The stadium was notorious for its poor playing conditions. The lights were not located in optimal positions for baseball visibility. During August and September, when the Dolphins (and later the Hurricanes) shared the stadium, the field conditions were among the worst in the majors, according to both Marlins players and visiting players. Indeed, several Marlins players said that at times, they &quot;couldn&#x27;t wait to go on the road.&quot; Visiting teams hated coming to the stadium as well. For instance, when the Atlanta Braves came to the stadium for the last time in 2011, Dan Uggla, who played for the Marlins from 2006 to 2010, said that he was probably the only Braves player that would miss it. The stadium&#x27;s problems as a baseball venue became even more stark as time wore on, as the Marlins&#x27; tenure in the stadium coincided with a wave of new, baseball-only parks. When the Marlins began play in 1993, the stadium was one of 14 that hosted both an MLB team and a professional football team. By the time the Marlins left the stadium, however, it was one of only three in the majors (and the only National League stadium) that played host to both a baseball team and an NFL or CFL team, the other two being the Oakland Coliseum and Toronto&#x27;s Rogers Centre.

For most of the Marlins&#x27; tenure at the stadium, it was the hottest stadium in the major leagues. The Marlins played nearly all of their home games from late May through mid-September at night due to South Florida&#x27;s often oppressive heat and humidity. They also got waivers from MLB and ESPN to play on Sunday nights.

The stadium was the venue where Mark McGwire hit his NL-record 57th home run to best Hack Wilson&#x27;s 68-year-old record of 56 in 1998. Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 600th career home run off Mark Hendrickson of the Marlins on June 9, 2008; and where Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched the 20th perfect game in Major League Baseball history on May 29, 2010, against the Marlins.

===Concerts===
===Soccer===

A number of soccer matches have been held at the stadium, including a number of international friendlies featuring Central or South American sides. This is due to South Florida being home to one of the largest populations of Central and South Americans in the United States.

The stadium hosted a match between FC Barcelona and C.D. Guadalajara on August 3, 2011, as part of the 2011 World Football Challenge. Guadalajara won the match 4–1 in front of 70,080 attendees.

Colombia beat Mexico 2–0 in a friendly international in front of 51,615 spectators at the stadium on February 29, 2012. A year later, they beat Guatemala 4–1.

South Korea played against Ghana on June 9, 2014.

On September 5, 2014, two months after a heavy defeat to Germany in the World Cup, Brazil beat Colombia 1–0 in front of an announced attendance of 73,429 fans, a new attendance record for a soccer match at the stadium.

The 2014 International Champions Cup preseason final was held at New Miami Stadium on August 4, 2014, with Manchester United defeating rival Liverpool 3–1 to claim the tournament&#x27;s second title.

Two 2017 International Champions Cup preseason matches were played at the stadium, one of them being the El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona won 3–2 in the second El Clásico to take place outside of Spain. 66,014 people, above current capacity, attended the match.

On March 23, 2018, the international friendly Peru–Croatia was played at the stadium, which Peru won 2–0.

The stadium will host seven matches: four group stage matches, one Round of 32 match, one quarterfinal match, and the third place match.

===Monster Jam===
The monster truck touring series Monster Jam used to take place at the stadium every year. The last show performed there was in 2015, and the shows moved to Marlins Park (now LoanDepot Park) in 2018.

=== Boxing ===
On February 27, 2021, four-division boxing world champion Canelo Álvarez beat Avni Yildirim at Hard Rock Stadium to defend his WBA (Super), WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; super-middleweight titles.

On June 6, 2021, the stadium hosted the boxing event Bragging Rights between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and YouTube personality Logan Paul.

On June 12, 2021, the stadium hosted the Social Gloves boxing event YouTubers vs. TikTokers, with Austin McBroom and Bryce Hall headlining the event.

===Other events===
Other events held at the stadium have included international soccer games, Hoop-It-Up Basketball, RV and boat shows, the UniverSoul Circus, numerous trade shows, and religious gatherings. The stadium has also hosted Australian rules football exhibition matches (including two Victorian Football League (VFL) post-season exhibitions). For the 1988 exhibition between Collingwood and Geelong, the game was played on the diagonal to compensate for the stadium not being an oval.

In 2006, it hosted the High School State Football Championships, sanctioned by the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA).

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the stadium began temporarily hosting an outdoor movie theater at the tennis campus and a drive-in theater in the stadium itself. Additionally, the East Lot of the venue has been used as a COVID-19 testing site, drawing hundreds of cars every day at the peak of the pandemic.

On April 18, 2021, Formula 1 announced a 10-year deal to host races in the area around the stadium.

Since 2018, the stadium has hosted the large hip-hop music festival Rolling Loud. The festival was held for its fourth consecutive year at the stadium from July 22 to July 24, 2022, and featured headliners including Ye, Future, and Kendrick Lamar.

===In film===
Three films have been shot at the stadium:

*1994: &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, which starred Jim Carrey and featured former Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino as himself
*1999: &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, starring Al Pacino and directed by Oliver Stone
*2008: &quot;Marley and Me&quot;, starring Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston

==Naming rights==

The stadium has gone through many name changes, bringing up a question of the value of corporate naming rights.

During the planning and building phase of the stadium, the stadium was referred to as Dolphin Stadium. Joe Robbie, the original and then-owner of the Miami Dolphins and the new stadium, did not want the stadium named after himself, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want them to name it after me. But they insisted, and I guess I&#x27;m only human.&quot; The stadium opened on August 16, 1987, as Joe Robbie Stadium.

In the early 1990s, Wayne Huizenga gained control of the stadium. Huizenga first sold the naming rights to Pro Player, the sports apparel division of Fruit of the Loom, and the stadium became Pro Player Park on August 26, 1996. After the Dolphins opened the 1996 season there, the stadium was renamed Pro Player Stadium before the team returned home in week 3. The Marlins&#x27; 1996 season was played when the stadium was known under three different names, having started the year under the Joe Robbie name.

Fruit of the Loom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999, and the Pro Player brand was ultimately liquidated in 2001, but the stadium name held for several more years. In January 2005, the stadium was renamed Dolphins Stadium, coinciding with a renovation of the stadium. In April 2006, it was renamed Dolphin Stadium in an update of graphics and logos.

From February 2008 to January 2009, Stephen M. Ross gradually acquired 95% of the stadium and surrounding land. He then partnered with Jimmy Buffett to change the name once more, this time to Land Shark Stadium after a beer brewed for Buffett&#x27;s Margaritaville restaurant chain. The renaming was announced on May 8, 2009, but would last less than a year as the deal did not include rights for the upcoming 2010 Pro Bowl and Super Bowl XLIV.

On January 20, 2010, Canadian financial services company Sun Life Financial announced that it had acquired the naming rights. Sun Life Financial announced in 2012, that it will be exiting the U.S. annuity business and focusing on its employee benefits business in the U.S. On August 14, 2015, the Dolphins told the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; that Sun Life&#x27;s deal would expire in January 2016, and that the team had no plans to renew, wanting to position its renovated stadium as a brand new entity. The team also stated that it would remove Sun Life&#x27;s signage upon expiration of the deal, regardless of its ability to find a replacement sponsor before then. During renovations, the stadium was known as New Miami Stadium.

On August 17, 2016, the Dolphins announced that the naming rights had been sold to Hard Rock Cafe International, and that the stadium would be renamed Hard Rock Stadium. The new name was notably ridiculed by fans of the Florida State Seminoles, as the Seminole Tribe of Florida are the owners of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, but the stadium is the host of their rivals, the University of Miami Hurricanes.
