<text>The Mfecane, also known by the Sesotho names Difaqane or Lifaqane (all meaning &quot;crushing,&quot; &quot;scattering,&quot; &quot;forced dispersal,&quot; or &quot;forced migration&quot;), was a historical period of heightened military conflict and migration associated with state formation and expansion in Southern Africa. The exact range of dates that comprise the Mfecane varies between sources. At its broadest, the period lasted from the late eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, but scholars often focus on an intensive period from the 1810s to the 1840s.

Traditional estimates for the death toll range from 1 million to 2 million; however, these numbers are controversial, and some recent scholars revise the mortality figure significantly downwards and attribute the root causes to complex political, economic, and environmental developments. The Mfecane is significant in that it saw the formation of new states, institutions, and ethnic identities in southeastern Africa. 

The Mfecane&#x27;s historiography itself is also historically significant, with different versions having been employed to serve a range of political purposes since its inception as a historical concept. The label first emerged in the 1830s and blamed the disruption on the actions of King Shaka, who was alleged to have waged near-genocidal wars that depopulated the land and sparked a chain reaction of violence as fleeing groups sought to conquer new lands. Since the latter half of the 20th century, this interpretation has fallen out of favour among scholars due to a lack of historical evidence.

==Causes==
The Mfecane resulted from the complex interplay of pre-existing trends of political centralization with the effects of international trade, environmental instability, and European colonization. State formation and expansion had already been intensifying in Southeastern African as of at least the late 1700s, but these processes were greatly accelerated after the international ivory trade opened. The trade allowed leaders to amass unprecedented amounts of wealth, which they could then use to cultivate greater political power. Wealth and power became mutually reinforcing, as wealth enabled leaders to develop state instruments of control and expropriation, which they used to extract further wealth through taxation and military action. The consequence of this cycle was an increasing political and wealth disparity within and between polities, particularly in concern to productive land and food stores. 

Political centralization became problematic in the early 1800s when deep drought (aggravated by the atmospheric effects of volcanic eruptions in 1809 and 1815) struck Southeastern Africa. Whereas previous droughts hadn&#x27;t caused serious famine, the unequal distribution of land and food stores lessened the ability of average people to meet their needs. Though far less susceptible to famine, leaders faced threats to their power as (taxable) agricultural production dropped and ivory became scarcer due to overhunting. Faced with the challenges of fighting famine and maintaining wealth flows, leaders were incentivized to turn to raiding and conquest. Conquest protected conquering peoples against famine by providing immediate access to the conquered peoples&#x27; livestock and grain stores and, in the long term, by securing arable land and the people (particularly women) to farm it at greater intensities than before. Here another self-reinforcing cycle set in as famine and warfare promoted insecurity and militarism, which promoted political centralization and more warfare as strong leaders expanded their authority by offering a desperately-needed escape from famine to loyal followers.

A second stage of turmoil from the 1820s to the 1830s was driven in large part by slave and cattle raiding by Griqua, Basters, and other Khoekhoe-European groups armed and mounted by European settlers, who benefitted from trading their plunder. The increasing economic pull of the international slave trade also incentivized greater warfare and disruption between polities close to international ports such as Delagoa Bay.

== The Mfecane in the East ==
The Mfecane began in eastern Southern Africa with increasing competition and political consolidation as chiefdoms vied for control over trade routes and grazing land. 

Delagoa Bay and its international port saw increasing regional conflict in the mid-to-late 1700s. The local Tembe and Mabhudu-Tembe competed for control, absorbing or expelling some of their neighbouring polities. The abakwaDlamini, who would later form the Swazi Kingdom, were one such group put to flight by the conflict.

The mid-to-late 1700s also saw the rise of the Nxumalo and Nyambose chiefdoms between the Phongolo and Thukela rivers, which would eventually become the Ndwandwe Paramountcy and Mthethwa Paramountcy respectively. On the borders of their spheres of influence were the amaHlubi of the upper Mzinyathi, the abakwaDlamini north of the Phongolo, and the abakwaQwabe of the lower Thukela. The latter&#x27;s rise displaced elements of the abakwaCele and amaThuli further south. The amaThuli managed to secure a sizable chiefdom between the lower Mngeni and Mkhomazi Rivers, which displaced local groups across the Mzimkhulu River. This in turn contributed to the rise of the Mpondo Kingdom.

The 1810s saw the continued expansion of the Ndwandwe and Mthethwa Paramountcies, as well as the Portuguese Delagoa Bay slave trade. The Ndwandwe Paramountcy came to blows with the Mthethwa in the late 1810s, ultimately defeating and slaying their leader Dingiswayo kaJobe. The Mthethwa promptly collapsed as its subjects reasserted independence. The Ndwandwe king Zwide kaLanga went to war with one of these breakaway polities, the amaZulu of Shaka kaSenzangakhona. Their raids and counterraids proved costly and indecisive, contributing to the breakup of the Ndandwe Paramountcy. Groups broke away under Soshangane and Zwangendaba who settled their followers in the Delagoa Bay region, while Msane did the same in what is now eastern Eswatini. King Zwide, now in a position of weakness, withdrew to his territories north of the Phongolo to rebuild. Shaka took advantage of the power vacuum to expand the Zulu state to the Mkhuze River. The 1810s also saw the expansion of British colonial rule in southeastern southern Africa, with Xhosa polities displaced northwards by the Fourth and Fifth Xhosa Wars.

Meanwhile, between the Mzimkhulu and Mzimvubu Rivers, some groups fleeing the upheavals further north joined Faku kaNgqungqushe&#x27;s Mpondo Kingdom, while most others instead vied for dominance just outside of its reach.

By the 1820s, Shoshangane&#x27;s Gaza Kingdom and Shaka&#x27;s Zulu kingdom had established themselves (alongside the remains of the Ndwandwe Paramountcy) as the major players in the Northeast of Southern Africa. After relocating once again to the Nkomati River region, Zwide&#x27; Ndwandwe successfully raided and recruited their way back to prominence. By the time of his death in 1825 the Ndwandwe had muscled into the interior, possibly sundering the Pedi Kingdom and certainly dominating the region between the Olifants and Phongolo Rivers. Msane, Zwangendaba, and the followers of Nxaba, for their part, were displaced farther north. The Gaza Kingdom expanded to the northeast, heavily raiding small Tsonga polities. Slave trading expanded at Delagoa Bay, and the Portuguese worked to expand their regional sphere of influence.

In 1826, the expansion of the Ndwandwe Paramountcy under Sikhunyana began to threaten the Zulu Kingdom&#x27;s borders. In response, Shaka marched his army (and allied British traders) to the Izindololwane Hills and put Sikhunyana to flight. Their victory was so total that the Ndwandwe state collapsed shortly thereafter, with some constituent polities fleeing south or joining the Zulu, the Gaza Kingdom, or Mzilikazi&#x27;s Matabele/Ndebele Kingdom. The collapse of the Ndwandwe allowed Sekwati to rebuild the sundered Pedi Kingdom around a fortified hilltop base near the Steelpoort River. From this stronghold, he soon gathered a large following by offering protection to refugees.

In 1827, Shoshangane relocated the Gaza Kingdom from the lower Nkomati to the lower Limpopo River area. The Gaza defeated a Zulu army in 1828 and developed economic and political ties with the Portuguese.

In May of 1828, Shaka launched a successful cattle raid against the Bomvana and the Mpondo Kingdom, following up with another raid north of Delagoa Bay before the first expeditionary force had returned home. Sensing political weakness, his brothers Dingane and Mhlangana assassinated him in September. Dingane subsequently purged Mhlangana and other political rivals, establishing himself as the new Zulu king. These chaotic events prompted the secession of a segment of the subject abakwaQwabe nation, though they were dispersed in late 1829 by a Mpondo attack south of the Mzimkhulu.

By the late 1820s the power struggles between the Mzimkhulu and Mzimvubu Rivers had produced two victors: the Mpondo Kingdom and the Bhaca Chiefdom. Several weaker polities again relocated, with some moving north, others moving south, and yet others to the Zulu Kingdom. 1828 saw a further advance of colonial power as a combined British-Boer force marched far beyond the colonial borders and destroyed Matiwane&#x27;s amaNgwane at Mbholompo.

Benefitting from the fall of the Ndwandwe and Shaka, Sobhuza&#x27;s Swazi Kingdom expanded from the core of modern Eswatini to the Sabie River by the early 1830s. In an 1833 trade dispute, Zulu forces briefly captured Delagoa Bay and executed the Portuguese governor. In an attempt to solidify their control over inland trade, the Portuguese launched a failed attack on the Gaza Kingdom in 1834, leaving Gaza dominant over Delagoa Bay and the territories to its north. By the late 1830s, the Kingdom&#x27;s sphere of influence reached as far as the Zambezi River.

In 1836, the Swazi Kingdom weathered a joint attack by Zulu forces and British adventurers. Sometime in the late 1830s the Swazi launched a raid against the Pedi Kingdom, which repelled them.

== The Mfecane in the Interior ==
The Mfecane began in the interior regions of Central Southern Africa in the late 18th century with the displacement of Khoekhoe and San peoples by slave and cattle raiders from the expanding Dutch Cape Colony. Arriving in the middle and lower Orange River regions, they competed with local Batwsana, beginning a period of social breakdown and recombination. Bolstered in number by escaped slaves, bandits, and people of all ethnicities from the Cape Colony, some of these peoples would eventually become the Korana. Their power increased as trade with and raids upon colonists provided guns and horses, and by the 1780s they began raiding northwards against Tswana polities.

From the 1780s to the turn of the century, the southern Tswana chiefdoms underwent fragmentations and consolidations as raids and counter-raids proliferated. The powerful Bahurutshe Chiefdom of the upper Marico River region had their control of the lucrative trade with the Cape Colony eroded by the Bangwaketse to the northwest, the Batlhaping to the southwest, and the emerging Pedi Kingdom to the east. The latter, helmed by the Maroteng clan, also came into conflict with the amaNdzundza Ndebele, Masemola, Magakala, Bamphahlele, and Balobedu polities. Meanwhile, the region of the modern north and central Free State was increasingly coming under the control of the Bataung.

In the late 1790s, expansion by the Cape Colony to the lower Orange River region displaced the mixed-race Griqua peoples to the confluence of the Vaal and Orange River. There, they absorbed some of their San and Korana neighbors as clients. The Griqua, like other ethnic groups, were not politically unified and differed in their livelihood strategies, which ranged from raiding to agriculture to controlling trade between Batswana and the Cape Colony.

By the turn of the century amaXhosa groups also began arriving in the middle Orange River region, fleeing instability along the eastern Cape Colony frontier. There they absorbed Korana, San, and others and engaged in extensive raiding along the Orange and lower Vaal rivers. This proved particularly damaging to the trade activities of their Batlhaping victims.

By the 1810s, Boer expansion brought increasing destabilization to the middle Orange River region, not least in that it increased the flow of firearms. The Caledon Valley was now sustaining raids by Boer, Griqua, and Korana parties. By the early 1820s the instability spread north of the Orange River.

In 1822 AmaHlubi under the command of Mpangazita crossed the Drakensberg mountains and attacked Queen MmaNthatisi&#x27;s Batlôkwa people. Put to flight, MmaNthatisi&#x27;s followers survived off of pillage before resettling west of the Caledon River in 1824. The Sotho polities of this area sometimes held conflictual relations with these Batlôkwa newcomers, and they began coalescing in 1824 under the leadership of Moshoeshoe.

Separately, facing violence and starvation, Sebetwane&#x27;s BaFokeng, Tsooane&#x27;s MaPhuting, and Nkarahanye&#x27;s BaHlakoana fled their homes. The three joined forces in 1823 to take the BaThlaping town of Dithakong, whose access to water kept it rich in grain and cattle despite the overall drought. The BaThlaping repelled the invasion on 24 June with the aid of a mounted force of Griqua, inflicting heavy casualties and killing Tsooane and Nkarahanye.

In 1825, Mpangazita&#x27;s followers dispersed after he was killed in a war against Matiwane&#x27;s amaNgwane. The amaNgwane proceeded to control much of the Caledon River environs, raiding and displacing Sotho and Tswana neighbors.

The mid-1820s saw Sebetwane dominate the upper Molopo region and Moletsane&#x27;s Bataung people heavily raid the Vaal River. The eastern interior, however, was coming under the domination of Mzilikazi&#x27;s Ndebele Kingdom. His forces raided the Venda Kingdom to the north, the Maroteng, amaNdzundza, and Balodebu to the northeast, the Bangwaketse to the far west, and Matiwane&#x27;s nation in the Caledon Valley. Sebetwane and Moletsane&#x27;s nations, for their part, were outright put to flight. 

Between 1827 and 1828 Matiwane&#x27;s amaNgwane launched a failed attack on Moshoeshoe and, after suffering a major raid (likely perpetrated by the Ndebele), relocated to abaThembu territory in 1828, where they were destroyed by British, Boer, amaGcaleka, amaMpondo, and abaThembu forces. Though Matiwane was repelled, Moshoeshoe&#x27;s forces successfully raided the abaThembu in 1829, greatly enriching his kingdom and allowing it to recruit large numbers of followers from returning refugees. To the south of Moshoeshoe&#x27;s territory, small San polities eked out independent livelihoods, while others joined Morosi&#x27;s Phuthi polity to raid abaThembu, Cape Colonists, and others. Notably, San groups developed new styles of rock art during this period of change.

Also between 1827 and 1828, Mzilikazi&#x27;s Ndebele relocated to the Magaliesberg mountains, where he subjugated the Bahurutshe, Bakwena, and Bakgatla and regularly raided the Bangwaketse and southern Batswana peoples. A multi-ethnic force under the Kora leader Jan Bloem sought to profit from the Ndebele&#x27;s wealth with a mid-1828 raid, which proved only a partial success as his Kora and Griqua parties were destroyed before they could escape. By 1830, the Ndebele had extended their political influence over the western Tswana polities. Mzilikazi suffered another major raid from the Griqua leader Berend Berends in 1831, but again managed to decimate the loot-laden attackers. In 1832 it was the Zulu Kingdom&#x27;s turn to raid the Ndebele, but for the most part they were successfully repelled. Mzilikazi relocated after the Zulu attack, settling in the Bahurutshe&#x27;s upper Marico territory. The Bahurutshe response was divided, with some submitting to Ndebele rule and others relocating to Bathlaping and Griqua territory. In 1834 Jan Bloem launched a second raid against the Ndebele, which ended similarly to his first attack. Mzilikazi responded by maintaining the southern reaches of his domain as an unpopulated buffer zone.

==Consequences for Nguni societies==
Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan defied Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies: not only the Zulu king, but also the Boers, and the Griqua and Tswana. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the Vaal and the Limpopo rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matebele in English) established a Ndebele state northwest of the city of Pretoria.

During this period, the Matebele left a trail of destruction in their wake. From 1837 to 1838, the arrival of Boer settlers and the subsequent battles of Vegtkop and Mosega, drove the Matebele north of the Limpopo. They settled in the area now known as Matabeleland, in present-day southern Zimbabwe. Mzilikazi set up his new capital in Bulawayo. The AmaNdebele drove the MaShona of the region northward and forced them to pay tribute. This caused resentment that has continued to the current day in modern Zimbabwe.

At the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1818, the Ndwandwe were defeated by a Zulu force under the direct command of Shaka. Soshangane, one of Zwide&#x27;s generals, fled to Mozambique with the remainder of the Ndwandwe. There, they established the Gaza kingdom. They oppressed the Tsonga people living there, some of whom fled over the Lebombo Mountains into the Northern Transvaal. In 1833, Soshangane invaded various Portuguese settlements, and was initially successful. But a combination of internal disputes and war against the Swazi caused the downfall of the Gaza kingdom.

The Ngwane people lived in present-day Eswatini (Swaziland), where they had settled in the southwest. They warred periodically with the Ndwandwe.

Zwangendaba, a commander of the Ndwandwe army, fled north with Soshangane after his defeat in 1819. Zwangendaba&#x27;s followers were henceforth called Ngoni. Continuing north of the Zambezi River, they formed a state in the region between lakes Malawi and Tanganyika. Maseko, who led another part of the Ngoni people, founded another state to the east of Zwangendaba&#x27;s kingdom.

To the east, refugee clans and tribes from the Mfecane fled to the lands of the Xhosa people. Some of them such as the amaNgwane were driven back by force and defeated. Those who were accepted were obliged to be tributary to the Xhosas and lived under their protection. They were assimilated into the Xhosa cultural way of life, becoming part of the Xhosa people. After years of oppression by the Xhosas, they later formed an alliance with the Cape Colony.

==Consequences for the Sotho-Tswana peoples==
Southern Tswana populations had experienced an increase in conflict as early as the 1780s. There was significant population growth in the region which lead to more competition for resources. There was an increasing amount of trade with the Cape colony and the Portuguese; this had the consequence of separate chiefdoms becoming more eager to conquer land for themselves in order to control trade routes. Dutch settlers from the Cape Colony encroaching upon the Khoikhoi and San into regions where Tswana people live resulted in the formation of the Korana who started to launch raids on other communities by the 1780s. The fact that many of them had access to firearms and horses likely exacerbated the devastation caused by their raiders. Xhosa who were escaping the already violent region of the Eastern Cape often launched their own raids as well. All of these events led to making the region progressively more unstable. Missionary interference, internal politics, and raids by Dutch settlers also impacted the region. By the start of the 19th century, the most powerful Tswana chiefdom, the Bahurutse, were increasingly being challenged by the Bangwaketse.

Moshoeshoe I gathered the mountain clans together in an alliance against the Zulus. Fortifying the easily defended hills and expanding his reach with cavalry raids, he fought against his enemies with some success, despite not adopting the Zulu tactics, as many clans had done. The territory of Moshoeshoe I became the kingdom of Lesotho.

The Tswana were pillaged by two large invading forces set on the move by the Mfecane. Sebitwane gathered the Kololo ethnic groups near modern Lesotho and wandered north across what is now Botswana, plundering and killing many of the Tswana people in the way. They also took large numbers of captives north with them, finally settling north of the Zambezi River in Barotseland, where they conquered the Lozi people. The next force was the Mzilikazi and the Matebele who moved across Tswana territory in 1837. Both of these invading forces continued to travel north across Tswana territory without establishing any sort of state. In addition to these major kingdoms, a number of smaller groups also moved north into Tswana territory, where they met with defeat and ultimately vanished from history. Among those involved in these invasions were European adventurers such as Nathaniel Isaacs (who was later accused of slave trading).

==Controversy==
In 1988, Rhodes University professor Julian Cobbing advanced a different hypothesis on the rise of the Zulu state; he contended the accounts of the Mfecane were a self-serving, constructed product of apartheid-era politicians and historians. According to Cobbing, apartheid-era historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced Black-on-Black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts lay in the labour needs of Portuguese slave traders operating out of Delagoa Bay, Mozambique and European settlers in the Cape Colony. The resulting pressures led to forced displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing waves of Afrikaner settlers to colonise large swaths of the region. Cobbing&#x27;s views were echoed by historian Dan Wylie, who argued that colonial-era white writers such as Isaacs had exaggerated the brutality of the Mfecane to justify European colonialism.

Cobbing&#x27;s hypothesis generated an immense volume of polemics among historians; the discussions were termed the &quot;Cobbing Controversy&quot;. While historians had already embarked upon new approaches to the study of the Mfecane in the 1970s and 1980s, Cobbing&#x27;s paper was the first major source that overtly defied the hegemonic &quot;Zulu-centric&quot; explanation at the time. This was followed by fierce discourse in the early 1990s prompted by Cobbing&#x27;s hypothesis. Many agree that Cobbing&#x27;s analysis offered several key breakthroughs and insights into the nature of early Zulu society. 

The historian Elizabeth Eldredge challenged Cobbing&#x27;s thesis on the grounds that there is scant evidence of the resumption of the Portuguese slave trade out of Delagoa Bay before 1823, a finding that undermines Cobbing&#x27;s thesis that Shaka&#x27;s early military activities were a response to slave raids. Moreover, Eldredge argues that the Griqua and other groups (rather than European missionaries as asserted by Cobbing) were primarily responsible for the slave raids coming from the Cape. Eldredge also asserts that Cobbing downplays the importance of the ivory trade in Delagoa Bay, and the extent to which African groups and leaders sought to establish more centralised and complex state formations to control ivory routes and the wealth associated with the trade. She suggests these pressures created internal movements, as well as reactions against European activity, that drove the state formations and concomitant violence and displacement. She still agreed with Cobbing&#x27;s overall sentiment in that the Zulu-centric explanation for the Mfecane is not reliable. By the early 2000s, a new historical consensus had emerged, recognizing the Mfecane to be not simply a series of events resulting from the founding of the Zulu Kingdom but rather a multitude of factors caused before and after Shaka Zulu came into power.

The debate and controversy within Southern African historiography over the Mfecane has been compared to similar debates about the Beaver Wars of the seventeenth century in northeastern North America, due to the alleged similarity of the narratives of indigenous &quot;self-vanishing&quot; that were propagated by apologists for European colonialism about the Mfecane and the Beaver Wars.

<text>Northern Virginia FC (formerly Northern Virginia Royals and Evergreen FC, and commonly known as NoVa FC) is an American soccer club from Leesburg, Virginia competing in USL League Two, USL W League, Eastern Premier Soccer League and Major Arena Soccer League 3.

The club&#x27;s women&#x27;s team was known as the Northern Virginia Majestics, who played in the women&#x27;s USL W-League, and fielded a team in the USL&#x27;s Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella. Throughout their recent history, NVFC previously enjoyed minor league affiliation with D.C. United, the nearby Major League Soccer franchise.

== History ==
=== Professional ===
Northern Virginia FC was founded in 1998 and joined the USISL D-3 Pro League as an expansion franchise in 1998, entering the team under the name Northern Virginia Royals. They ended their first season in 7th place in the Atlantic Division with a 5–12–1 record. In their second season, they improved, winning 10 of their 18 regular season games, finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division and also qualified for their first US Open Cup campaign in 1999, where they were upset in the first round by Florida PDL side Cocoa Expos 5–3. In the playoffs they beat divisional rivals South Carolina Shamrocks 2–1 in the first round before falling 4–0 to Charlotte in the conference semi-final. The 1998 season and the Royals were featured in the book &quot;Unlucky: A Season of Struggle in Minor League Professional Soccer&quot; by Dave Ungrady, who trained and played briefly for the Royals as well

The D-3 Pro League became the USL Pro Select League in 2003, and the Royals finished bottom of the 3-team Southern Division, with just 6 wins for the year. 
The USL Pro Select League became the USL Second Division in 2005, and dispensed with divisions in favor of a single-table format; for the Royals, this proved to be yet another disastrous season.

=== Move to PDL ===
After finishing bottom of the league in the USL Second Division, the Royals management took the decision to self-relegate themselves to the USL Premier Development League for the 2006 season. The Royals won their first match in the amateur PDL 3–1 over West Virginia Chaos, ultimately finishing fourth in the Mid Atlantic Division in their debut 2006 season.

The Northern Virginia Royals were inducted into the USL Soccer Hall of Fame in 2007.

===Partnership with D.C. United===
In 2015, the Royals rebranded as Evergreen FC and partnered with Major League Soccer club D.C. United and formed a joint PDL team called D.C. United U-23, who combined their NPSL side with the Royals, to play in the PDL, finishing fifth in the Mid-Atlantic Division.

===Evergreen Hammers===

After the 2015 season, the Royals transferred their operations and relocated to Loudon County, Virginia in 2016 playing under the Evergreen FC banner as the Evergreen Hammers.

===Northern Virginia FC===
For the 2021 season, Evergreen which was already part of the Northern Virginia FC club, renamed the USL League Two club to sit under the NoVa FC banner. NoVa FC had already operated teams under that name in the lower level United Premier Soccer League and Eastern Premier Soccer League.

On 27 August 2021, NoVa FC announced they would be reviving the women&#x27;s program with a new side in the USL W League beginning in 2022.

<text>Northern Virginia Majestics was an American women&#x27;s soccer team, founded in 1998 that played in the United Soccer Leagues W-League, the second tier of women&#x27;s soccer in the United States and Canada in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team is the women&#x27;s team of Northern Virginia FC, which plays in the USL League Two. They also operated teams in the Super Y League for youth. The team played home games at Hellwig Memorial Field Stadium in the city of Manassas, Virginia. The team&#x27;s colors are gold, blue and white.

==History==
Part of Northern Virginia FC, the Majestics were formed in 1998 as the women&#x27;s senior team. They joined the USL W-League in 1999, joining the W-2 division, playing in the South Division. They played their home opener on May 8 against the Indiana Blaze. They had a difficult debut season, going winless, finishing with an 0–11 record. Like most teams in the division, their roster was made up of primarily high school and college players.

Over their thirteen seasons, the Majestics reached the W-League playoffs four times (2002, 2003, 2006 and 2007). On the youth side, Northern Virginia Majestics and male equivalent Northern Virginia Royals were named the fifth best Super Y-League club program in North America. In 2008, the Majestics were inducted into the USL Soccer Hall of Fame, as a 10+ Club, earning the honor for the longevity of their programs in North America.

The team ended its operations following the 2012 season, although they continued to operate their Super Y U20 program.

Several players earned All W-League First and Second Team selections and Players of the Week honors. In addition, player Elizabeth Baidu won W-League Rookie of the Year and coach Hank Leung won Coach of the Year (Hank Leung) in 2002. The Majestics also won Executive of the Year honors in 2000 and in 2011, with owner/general Tim Schweitzer. Schweitzer was also USL Soccer Hall of Fame under the Builder category in 2011 for his work with the Majestics.

<doc id="356834" wikidata="Q5309045" url="?curid=356834" title="Drum Barracks">
<text>Drum Barracks was the Union Army&#x27;s headquarters for Southern California and New Mexico during the Civil War. It consisted of 19 buildings on 60 acres (240,000 m2) in what is now Wilmington, with another 37 acres (150,000 m2) near the waterfront. Its junior officers&#x27; quarters has been preserved as the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum. Its powder magazine stands on private property three blocks away, protected by a chain-link fence.
== History ==
In August, 1861, Confederate Colonel John R. Baylor proclaimed the Confederate Territory of Arizona and sent a detachment to occupy Tucson.
Union officials in Southern California responded by organizing the available troops into the California Column, which marched east and confronted the Confederates at Picacho Pass, Arizona.

The withdrawal of regular troops presented Los Angeles with a threefold crisis:
* The majority of the population favored the Confederacy, and pro-Confederate demonstrations were made in Los Angeles and El Monte. There was fear that they might seize Southern California, gain control over the gold being mined near San Bernardino and use San Pedro Bay as a base for privateers that would raid the gold ships leaving San Francisco for Cape Horn.
* The Indians in California and what is now Arizona saw the war as the chance of a lifetime to seize cattle, drive off settlers and reclaim their lands.
* The ongoing turmoil in Mexico (the Reform War) and the impending French invasion could allow the Confederates to stir up border trouble or even invade by way of Mexico.
The response was to build a major installation, adjacent to San Pedro Bay and 25 miles south of Los Angeles, to be garrisoned by troops moved from Fort Tejon and later by recruits from Northern California and from among the loyal minority in the area.
While the land was donated by Union sympathizers, the construction cost eventually reached $1 million.
== Naming the new post ==
The Drum Barracks is named for Richard Coulter Drum, Assistant Adjutant General of the Army&#x27;s Department of the Pacific in San Francisco. He supervised construction from his office, visiting the post only after its completion in 1863.

In 1863, Major Bennett, the post commander, wrote to the Adjutant-General in Washington asking that the name be changed to Fort Drum, comparing it to Fort Snelling, Minnesota and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. No response to the letter has been found.
== Arrest of Confederate sympathizers ==
At least three of the leading citizens of Los Angeles were arrested and taken to the Drum Barracks.

Newspaper publisher Henry Hamilton was arrested In Los Angeles on October 17, 1862 and taken to the Drum Barracks. From there he was placed aboard a steamer to be taken to San Francisco and confinement at Fort Alcatraz. He took an oath of allegiance to the United States and was back in Los Angeles within two weeks.

The immediate cause of his arrest is not known, but one of his many editorials had said that the Northern mobilization was an abolition war, &quot;instigated, carried on, and to be consummated, by the degradation of the white race, and the elevation of the African family over them&quot; and that &quot;Black Republican&quot; rule &quot;has degenerated into worse than an Oriental despotism.&quot;

The photo shown here has inscriptions stating that Hamilton is on the left. A copy of the photo, taken decades later, has a description indicating that Hamilton is on the right.

Undersheriff A.J. King was arrested at the request of the newly appointed US Marshal, Henry D. Barrows, for saying &quot;that he owed no allegiance to the United States Government; that Jeff Davis&#x27; was the only constitutional government we had, and that he remained here because he could do more harm to the enemies of that Government by staying here than going there&quot; and for publicly displaying &quot;a large lithograph gilt-framed portrait of Beauregard, the rebel general, which he flaunted before a large crowd at the hotel.&quot; He took an oath of allegiance to the United States and was released.
In October, 1862, a month after he had been elected to the state Assembly, former California Attorney General and later Los Angeles District Attorney E.J.C. Kewen was arrested for ‘treasonable utterance’ and sent to Fort Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay. After two weeks, he took an oath of allegiance, posted a $5,000 bond and was released.

The report of the arrest does not say what the utterance was, but one of his speeches was published later:

== Preventing civil unrest ==
Drum Barracks troops were stationed at San Bernardino for most of the war and made intermittent encampments at El Monte.
When the news of the Union victory at Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksburg was received in Los Angeles, battles between Union and Confederate factions broke out. A detachment of troops, on their way to the Owens Valley as an escort to a supply train, intervened. Continuing demonstrations by secessionists required the dispatch of 25 additional men to take up a post near Los Angeles in a position to command the town.
== Indian battles ==
A new wave of Indian raids began as soon as troops were withdrawn to the Eastern theater of war. Troops sent east from Los Angeles to confront Confederates first &quot;had to fight the Apaches, hereditary enemies of the Pumas and Maricopas; and the Navajos were also war-like. From Tucson into New Mexico, in fact, the column had to fight its way through hostile Indians, who lurked in every mountain pass, and guarded every water hole.&quot;

Named battles and campaigns fought by Los Angeles troops against Indians included the Battle of Apache Pass and the Owens Valley Indian War.
== Incursions into Mexico ==
Drum Barracks troops, including the Spanish-speaking Native California Cavalry, made incursions into the Mexican state of Sonora at Hermosillo, Altar and Magdalena. One incursion led to a shooting incident with troops loyal to Emperor Maximilian and his French allies.

A letter from General Grant, written late in the war, passed on a rumor that former California Senator William M. Gwin had been appointed governor of Sonora by the Imperial government in Mexico and was organizing a Confederate invasion of California. Grant authorized the Army to pursue the invading force back into Mexico and to keep troops there indefinitely. The rumor proved to be false.
== Postwar years ==
After the Civil War, Camp Drum remained active for several years in the Indian Wars. By 1870, it had been deactivated and fallen into disrepair. In October 1871, the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot; reported that all remaining troops at Drum Barracks had been ordered to Fort Yuma. In 1873, the government returned the land to its original donors, Phineas Banning and Benjamin Davis Wilson, after auctioning off the buildings. Not surprisingly, there were no winning bids from buyers who would have to move the buildings or dismantle them for building materials. Banning bought five buildings for $2,917 and Wilson bought one for $200.
== Ghost sightings ==
The museum&#x27;s resident ghosts were profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 1992, including a description of a ghost who &quot;doesn&#x27;t know he&#x27;s dead.&quot; The same article says that the building was saved from demolition following &quot;a drawn-out battle more fierce than any of the soldiers stationed here had ever fought.&quot; Another profile, &quot;Ghost stories from LA&#x27;s old Civil War barracks&quot;, was published in 2018.

The Drum Barracks was profiled on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; in the early 1990s, in a segment narrated by Robert Stack, called &#x27;Civil War Ghosts&#x27;. People interviewed in that segment claimed to have seen apparitions of Civil War soldiers. In 2005 the Barracks was featured in an episode of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

== Historical designations ==
Drum Barracks has been designated as a California Historic Landmark, a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1987, it has been operated as a Civil War museum that is open to the public.

<text>The University of Jena, officially the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (, abbreviated FSU, shortened form &quot;Uni Jena&quot;), is a public research university located in Jena, Thuringia, Germany.

The university was established in 1558 and is counted among the ten oldest universities in Germany. It is affiliated with six Nobel Prize winners, most recently in 2000 when Jena graduate Herbert Kroemer won the Nobel Prize for physics. It was renamed after the poet Friedrich Schiller who was teaching as professor of philosophy when Jena attracted some of the most influential minds at the turn of the 19th century. With Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel, F. W. J. Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel on its teaching staff, the university was at the centre of the emergence of German idealism and early Romanticism.

, the university has around 19,000 students enrolled and 375 professors. Its current president, Walter Rosenthal, has held the role since 2014.

==History==
===Early history===
Elector John Frederick of Saxony first thought of a plan to establish a university at Jena upon Saale in 1547 while he was being held captive by emperor Charles V. The plan was put into motion by his three sons and, after having obtained a charter from the Emperor Ferdinand I, the university was established on 2 February 1558. The university, jointly maintained by the Saxon Duchies derived from the partitioning of John Frederick&#x27;s duchy, was thus named Ducal Pan-Saxon University () or Salana (after the river Saale).

Prior to the 20th century, university enrollment peaked in the 18th century. The university&#x27;s reputation reached its zenith under the auspices of Duke Charles Augustus, Goethe&#x27;s patron (1787–1806), when Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel, Friedrich Schelling, Friedrich von Schlegel and Friedrich Schiller were on its teaching staff.

Founded as a home for the new religious opinions of the sixteenth century, it has since been one of the most politically radical universities in Germany. Jena was noted among other German universities at the time for allowing students to duel and to have a passion for &quot;Freiheit&quot;, which were popularly regarded as the necessary characteristics of German student life. The University of Jena has preserved a historical detention room or Karzer with famous caricatures by Swiss painter Martin Disteli.

In the latter 19th century, the department of zoology taught evolutionary theory, with Carl Gegenbaur, Ernst Haeckel and others publishing detailed theories at the time of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; (1858). The later fame of Ernst Haeckel eclipsed Darwin in some European countries, as the term &quot;Haeckelism&quot; was more common than Darwinism. 

In 1905, Jena had 1,100 students enrolled and its teaching staff (including &quot;Privatdozenten&quot;) numbered 112. Amongst its numerous auxiliaries then were the library, with 200,000 volumes; the observatory; the meteorological institute; the botanical garden; the seminaries of theology, philology, and education; and the well-equipped clinical, anatomical, and physical institutes.

After the end of the Saxon duchies in 1918, and their merger with further principalities into the Free State of Thuringia in 1920, the university was renamed as the Thuringian State University (Thüringische Landesuniversität) in 1921. In 1934 the university was renamed again, receiving its present name of Friedrich Schiller University. During the 20th century, the cooperation between Zeiss corporation and the university brought new prosperity and attention to Jena, resulting in a dramatic increase in funding and enrollment.

===Nazi period===
During the Third Reich, staunch Nazis moved into leading positions at the university. The racial researcher and SS-Hauptscharführer Karl Astel was appointed professor in 1933, bypassing traditional qualifications and process; he later became rector of the university in 1939. Also in 1933, many professors had to leave the university as a consequence of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Student fraternities – in particular the Burschenschaften – were dissolved and incorporated into the Nazi student federation. The Nazi student federation enjoyed before the transfer of power and won great support among the student body elections in January 1933, achieving 49.3% of the vote, which represents the second best result. Between the Jena connections and the NS students wide-ranging human and ideological connections were recorded.

When the Allied air raids to Jena in February and March struck in 1945, the University Library, the university main building and several clinics in the Bachstraße received total or significant physical damage. Completely destroyed were the Botanical Garden, the psychological and the physiological institute and three chemical Institutes. An important event for the National Socialist period was the investigation of the pediatrician Yusuf Ibrahim. A Senate Commission noted the participation of the physician to the &quot;euthanasia&quot; murders of physically or mentally disabled children.

===Present===

In the 20th century the university was promoted through cooperation with Carl Zeiss (company) and thereby enabling it to increase the student population as a mass university. In 1905 the university had 1,100 students and 112 university teachers, so this figure has since been almost twenty-fold. The Friedrich-Schiller University is the only comprehensive university in Thuringia.

Since 1995, there is a university association with the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and the University of Leipzig. The aim is firstly to give the students the opportunity to visit with relatively few problems at the partner universities and events in order to broaden the range of subjects and topics. Currently e. g. has joined a cooperation in teaching in the field of bioinformatics. In addition, the cooperation provides the university management the opportunity to share experiences with their regular meetings and initiate common projects. So z. B. went from the successful bid to the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) from the university network. The co-operation continues at other levels: for example in a joint mentoring program for female postdocs or in the central German archives network. And last but not least, there are common sports activities.

Since October 2014, the pharmacologist Walter Rosenthal is the president of the university; Chancellor is since 2007 the mathematician Klaus Bartholmé.

<text>Estelle Morris, Baroness Morris of Yardley, (born 17 June 1952), is a British politician and life peer who served as Secretary of State for Education and Skills from 2001 to 2002. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Yardley from 1992 to 2005.

As Education Secretary, she is known for removing compulsory modern languages from secondary schools in England in 2002.

==Early life==
Morris was born in Manchester into a political family. Her uncle, Alf Morris, was Labour MP for Manchester Wythenshawe (1964–1997) and her father, Charles, was Labour MP for Manchester Openshaw (1963–1983) and a Post Office union official who married Pauline Dunn. She attended Rack House primary school in Wythenshawe and Whalley Range High School in Whalley Range where she failed her English and French A-levels.

She is a graduate of the Coventry College of Education, where she gained a BEd degree in 1974. Morris remembered the long-serving principal, Joan Dillon Browne (1912–2009), as &quot;a pioneer in showing what women could achieve, long before it was fashionable to do so.&quot; Morris was a PE and humanities teacher at the inner-city Sidney Stringer School in Coventry from 1974 to 1992, becoming head of sixth form studies, and was a member of Warwick District Council from 1979 to 1991.

==Parliamentary career==
Morris was elected to Parliament in 1992 for Birmingham Yardley, gaining the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of only 162. She became a minister in the Department for Education and Employment in 1997 and was promoted to Secretary of State for Education and Skills in 2001. She was the first former comprehensive school teacher to have the position. She suddenly resigned her post in October 2002, explaining that she did not feel up to the job. She had made a commitment to the then Conservative Shadow Education Secretary, David Willetts to resign if the literacy and numeracy targets were not met. In interviews following her resignation she stated that she had felt happier and more effective as a junior education minister.

She rejoined the government in 2003 as Minister for the Arts in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and caused further comment when she admitted that she did not know much about contemporary art. She stepped down from the government and as a Member of Parliament at the 2005 general election. Her constituency was gained by the Liberal Democrats at that election.

On 13 May 2005 it was announced that she would be created a life peer, and she was conferred as Baroness Morris of Yardley, &quot;of Yardley in the County of West Midlands&quot;, on 14 June 2005.

==Career outside Parliament==
Between 2005 and 2009 she was pro vice-chancellor of the University of Sunderland. In May 2005, she was appointed chair of the Children&#x27;s Workforce Development Council. In September 2005, it was announced that she would succeed Lady Kennedy of The Shaws as president of the National Children&#x27;s Bureau. Also, since September 2005 she has been a member of the council of Goldsmiths, University of London and she was chair of council until 2018.
Since 2007 she has been chair of the executive group of the Institute for Effective Education at the University of York.

Morris is the chair of the medical charity, APS Support UK, for antiphospholipid syndrome and was patron of Hanover Foundations.

<doc id="356859" wikidata="Q6732400" url="?curid=356859" title="Magpie (TV series)">
<text>Magpie was a British children&#x27;s television programme shown on ITV from 30 July 1968 to 6 June 1980. It was a magazine format show, intended to compete with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, but it attempted to be more &quot;hip&quot;, focusing more on popular culture. The show&#x27;s creators, Lewis Rudd and Sue Turner, named the programme &quot;Magpie&quot;, as a reference to the magpie&#x27;s habit of collecting small items and also because of &quot;mag&quot; being evocative of &quot;magazine&quot; and &quot;pie&quot; being evocative of a collection of ingredients.

==Broadcast history==
The programme, made by Thames Television, was first transmitted on 30 July 1968, Thames Television&#x27;s first day of broadcasting. It was shown weekly until 1969, after which, until it ended on 6 June 1980, it went out twice a week. It was not fully networked to all other ITV companies until the autumn of 1969. Approximately 1,000 episodes were made, each 25 minutes in duration.

The first presenters were the former BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Pete Brady, Susan Stranks and Tony Bastable. Brady left the show in 1971 to be replaced by Douglas Rae, and Bastable left his presenting role to become the show&#x27;s producer in 1972, being replaced by Mick Robertson. Jenny Hanley replaced Stranks in 1974. This lineup remained until 1977, when Tommy Boyd replaced Rae.

Like &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Magpie&quot; featured appeals for various causes and charities. Unlike its rival programme, however, it asked for cash donations rather than stamps or secondhand goods, familiar on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. The cash totaliser was a long strip of paper which ran out of the studio and along the adjacent corridor walls. Unlike the BBC programme, &quot;Magpie&quot; was unscripted and the presenters were free to improvise the presentation of the show.

The show&#x27;s mascot was a magpie called Murgatroyd.

==Theme song==
The theme tune was played by the Spencer Davis Group under the alias of The Murgatroyd Band, and composed by Eddie Hardin (lead voc., keyb.), Ray Fenwick (harm. voc., guit.) and Spencer Davis (harm. voc.guit.). The main lyric is an old children&#x27;s nursery rhyme One for Sorrow:

:One for sorrow
:Two for joy
:Three for a girl and
:Four for a boy
:Five for silver
:Six for gold
:Seven for a secret never to be told
:Eight&#x27;s a wish and 
:Nine a kiss
:Ten is a bird you must not miss.

The rhyme refers to an old English superstition concerning the portent of the number of magpies seen together in a flock, and an older version of the ending runs:

:Eight for Heaven
:Nine for Hell
:Ten for the Devil himself

The show awarded badges to viewers who wrote in. They were based on the lines of the theme song.

==Steam engine and boat==
In 1973, &quot;Magpie&quot; adopted a steam railway locomotive, &quot;Black 5&quot; 44806, which was given the name &quot;Magpie&quot; (&quot;Blue Peter&quot; already had a locomotive with the same name as that show). After an eventful history, it is still being used today on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, although now with a different name.

&quot;Magpie&quot; also adopted a boat, originally called &quot;Mankadu&quot; and renamed &quot;Thames Magpie&quot;. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

<text>Gillian Patricia Shephard, Baroness Shephard of Northwold, (&quot;née&quot; Watts; born 22 January 1940), is a British Conservative politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South West Norfolk from 1987 to 2005. Shephard served as a Cabinet Minister, and is now Chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers.

Shephard is currently the chair of the Alumni Association of Oxford University. She was the chair of the Council of the Institute of Education until 2015 and deputy commissioner of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission until 2017.

==Early life and career==
The daughter of Reginald and Bertha Watts, she was born in Cromer, Norfolk, and spent her early years in Mundesley on Sea, her father being a haulier with a small garage. She was educated at North Walsham Girls&#x27; High School and St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she graduated with an MA in Modern Languages.

She became a schoolteacher and then worked as an Education Inspector for Norfolk County Council from 1963 to 1975. From 1975 to 1977 she worked for Anglia Television. She was elected to Parliament in 1987, and became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Peter Lilley in 1988. She was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Social Security in 1989, and then in 1990, Minister of State at HM Treasury. In 1990, she was given the additional role of Deputy Chairman of the Party.

==Family==
She married Thomas Shephard on 27 December 1975. She has two stepsons, including econometrician Neil Shephard FBA, Professor of Economics and Statistics at Harvard University.

==Ministerial career==

After the 1992 general election, she was appointed Secretary of State for Employment, then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1993. She moved to Secretary of State for Education in 1994, and stayed at the department when the Department for Employment merged into it in 1996. She remained in this position until the 1997 general election.

Shephard was one of two women promoted to John Major&#x27;s Cabinet in 1992; the other was Virginia Bottomley. The two believed the media was looking for stories of Ministerial &quot;catfights&quot; and made a pact to work together, despite differences in backgrounds and working styles. In an interview, Shephard said, &quot;We said that we would never give anybody the chance to say that we were criticising the other. We would be supportive; end of. And we were.&quot;

Shephard provided considerable information regarding her role as Secretary of State for Education in interviews conducted by Brian Sherratt in October 1994 and March 1996 for his book on the agenda for educational reform which the Conservative Party had developed since 1979.

==In opposition==
After the defeat of the Conservatives, William Hague made her Shadow Leader of the House of Commons and later Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. She returned to the backbenches in 1999 and stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election. Her memoirs &quot;Shephard&#x27;s Watch: Illusions of Power in British Politics&quot; were published in 2000.

In 2013 following the death of Margaret Thatcher, Shephard published a memoir, &quot;The Real Iron Lady&quot;, of her time working with the former prime minister.

==Life peerage==
On 13 May 2005 it was announced that she would be created a life peer, and on 21 June 2005 the peerage was created as Baroness Shephard of Northwold, of Northwold in the County of Norfolk.

She is currently Chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers. She was Deputy Chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission until 2017, when she resigned in frustration with Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s lack of action.

<text>William Dawes Jr. (April 6, 1745 – February 25, 1799) was an American soldier, and was one of several men who, in April 1775, alerted minutemen in Massachusetts of the approach of British regulars prior to the battles of Lexington and Concord at the outset of the American Revolution. For some years, Paul Revere had the most renown for his ride of warning of this event.

==Childhood==
Dawes was born in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay, on April 6, 1745, to William and Lydia Dawes (née Boone), and baptized at Boston&#x27;s Old South Church. He became a tanner and was active in Boston&#x27;s militia. On May 3, 1768, Dawes married Mehitable May, the daughter of Samuel and Catherine May (née Mears). The &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; noted that for his wedding, he wore a suit entirely made in North America. At the time, Whigs were trying to organize a boycott of British-made products in order to pressure the Parliament of Great Britain into repealing the Townshend Acts.

==Role in Boston&#x27;s militia==

On April 8, 1768, Dawes was elected as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. He was appointed as the company&#x27;s second sergeant in 1770. When the company was revived in 1786, after becoming dormant during the American Revolution, he was appointed as the Company clerk. His father, William Dawes Sr., was also a member of the company. It is likely that in September 1774, Dawes was instrumental in helping Boston&#x27;s militia artillery company secure its four small cannons from being confiscated by the British. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress certainly sent word to him in February 1775 that it was time to move two of those weapons out of Boston.

On another occasion, Dawes and some others stole two cannons which were in a building that was under guard by a British grenadier at the time. They sneaked the cannons out through a window in the back of the building then hid them in a woodbox in a schoolhouse next door for retrieval later. Upon discovery of the loss, the British authorities closely questioned the schoolmaster, who coolly denied any knowledge of the affair, while keeping his feet casually propped up on the woodbox. Dawes hurt his wrist in the escapade, and some days later, went to a fellow member of the Sons of Liberty, Dr. Joseph Warren, for treatment. Warren asked Dawes how he hurt himself. Dawes demurred, and Warren (who probably knew about the cannon incident) wisely responded by saying that it was best that he did not know.

===Midnight ride===
Dawes, who was known and trusted by Sons of Liberty leader Dr. Joseph Warren, was assigned by Warren to ride from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts, on the night of April 18, 1775, when it became clear that a British column was going to march into the countryside. Dawes&#x27; mission was to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that they were in danger of arrest. Dawes took the land route out of Boston through the Boston Neck, leaving just before the British sealed off the town.

Also acting under Dr. Warren, Paul Revere arranged for another rider waiting across the Charles River in Charlestown to be told of the army&#x27;s route with lanterns hung in Old North Church. To be certain the message would get through, Revere rowed across the river and started riding westward himself. Later, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s historically inaccurate poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot; would focus entirely on Revere, making him a composite of the many alarm riders that night.

Dawes and Revere arrived at the Hancock–Clarke House in Lexington about the same time, shortly after midnight. Revere arrived slightly earlier, despite having stopped to speak to militia officers in towns along the way, as his route was shorter and his horse faster. After warning Adams and Hancock to leave, Revere and Dawes proceeded to Concord in case that was the British column&#x27;s goal. Revere no doubt knew that the Provincial Congress had stored munitions there, including the cannons which Dawes had helped to secure. Along the way, the two men met Samuel Prescott, a local young physician, who joined them.

A squad of mounted British officers awaited on the road between Lexington and Concord. They had already arrested some riders heading west with news of the troops, and they called for Dawes, Revere, and Prescott to halt. The three men rode in different directions, hoping one would escape. Dawes, according to the story he told his children, rode into the yard of a house shouting that he had lured two officers there. Fearing an ambush, the officers stopped chasing him. Dawes&#x27;s horse bucked him off, however, and he had to walk back to Lexington. He later said that in the morning, he returned to the same yard and found the watch that had fallen from his pocket. Otherwise, Dawes&#x27;s activity during the Battle of Lexington and Concord remains unknown.

Dawes and his companions&#x27; warnings allowed the town militias to muster a sufficient force for the first open battle of the American Revolutionary War and the first colonial victory. The British column did not find most of the weapons they had marched to destroy and sustained serious losses during their retreat to Boston while under attack by the minutemen.

===Service in the American Revolution===

On September 9, 1776, Dawes was commissioned second major of the Boston militia regiment. During the war, Dawes worked as a quartermaster in central Massachusetts. British prisoners of war from the Battles of Saratoga complained to Parliament that he gave them short supplies; his family countered that Dawes believed that they were stealing from farmers while being marched to Boston – as most armies on the march were prone to do.

==Later life and death==

Dawes refused to join a punitive expedition against Indians ordered by Governor Phillip in December 1790.

Mehitable died on May 19, 1794 but he remarried (to Lydia) two years later.

Dawes died in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on February 25, 1799. He was believed to have been buried in the King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground, but modern research points to his resting place now being in his first wife&#x27;s family plot in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain.

==Legacy==
The poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;, has been criticized by modern historians for overstating the role of Revere in the night&#x27;s events. Revere&#x27;s may have been a better story, but Dawes and Prescott were more successful in achieving their missions. In 1896 Helen F. Moore, dismayed that William Dawes had been forgotten, penned a parody of Longfellow&#x27;s poem.
The difference in Revere&#x27;s and Dawes&#x27;s achievement and legacy is examined by Malcolm Gladwell in his book &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, where he concludes that Revere would be classified as a connector whereas Dawes was an &quot;ordinary man.&quot;

Dawes&#x27;s ride is commemorated on a traffic island in Cambridge, Massachusetts, heavily travelled by pedestrians, at the intersection of Garden Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Harvard Square, and known as &quot;Dawes Island&quot;. Dawes&#x27;s passage through the area is represented by bronze horseshoes embedded in the sidewalk, as hoofprints, accompanied by an inscription giving his name and the date (inaccurately stated as April 19, 1775), and by historical displays.

In the film &quot;Knowing&quot;, the early events take place in Lexington, Massachusetts, at William Dawes Elementary School.

===Descendants===
William Dawes&#x27; great-grandson, Rufus Dawes, was a Civil War military officer and congressman; Rufus Dawes&#x27; children included Charles G. Dawes, who served as Vice President of the United States under Calvin Coolidge, Rufus C. Dawes, a businessman, Beman Gates Dawes, a businessman and congressman, and Henry M. Dawes, a businessman and banker. A brother of Congressman Rufus Dawes was Major Ephraim C. Dawes. Television personality Bill Schulz (William Dawes Schulz) is another descendant of Dawes, as the grandson of Henry M. Dawes&#x27; daughter Mary.

William Dawes was also a first cousin of Thomas Dawes, who was a Revolutionary War colonel, a noted architect/builder, and held numerous government positions; another cousin twice removed was Congressman Henry L. Dawes (1812–1903).

<doc id="356864" wikidata="Q684358" url="?curid=356864" title="Junius Brutus Booth">
<text>Junius Brutus Booth (1 May 1796 – 30 November 1852) was an English-born American actor. He was the father of actor John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. His other children included Edwin Booth, one of the foremost tragedians of the mid-to-late 19th century, Junius Brutus Booth Jr., an actor and theatre manager, and Asia Booth Clarke, a poet and writer.

==Early life and education==

Booth was born in St Pancras, London, the son of Richard Booth, a lawyer who was a strong supporter of the Patriot cause, and Jane Elizabeth Game. His paternal grandfather was John Booth, a silversmith, and his paternal grandmother Elizabeth Wilkes was a relative of the radical politician and journalist John Wilkes. While he was growing up, Booth&#x27;s father tried to settle his son in a lengthy succession of professions. Booth recalls of his childhood, &quot;I was destined by my Controllers first for the Printing office, then to be an architect, then to be a sculptor and modeler, then a lawyer, then a sailor, of all of these I preferred those of sculptor and modeler.&quot;

On 26 September 1811, Sarah Blackbeard, a woman from Shoreditch, gave birth to a son, William. Called before a magistrate in March 1812, she stated that &quot;one Junius Brutus Booth who resides at his Father&#x27;s No. 1 Dove Row in the said Parish of St Leonard Shoreditch Gentleman... is the true and only Father of such Child.&quot; She repeated this as sworn evidence in 1813, when the child became chargeable on the parish under the English Poor Laws, giving Booth&#x27;s address then as Queen Street, Bloomsbury.

In August 1814, Junius met Marie Christine Adelaide Delannoy while boarding at her mother&#x27;s home in Brussels. She followed him to London where they eventually married on 17 May 1815, soon after his 19th birthday. Their first child, Amelia Portia Adelaide Booth, was born later, on 5 October 1815, but died 7 July 1816. Their only child to survive infancy was Richard Junius Booth (1819–1868).

==Career==

Booth&#x27;s interests in theatre came after he attended a production of &quot;Othello&quot; at the Covent Garden Theatre. The prospects of fame, fortune and freedom were very appealing to young Booth. He displayed a talent for acting from an early age, deciding on a career on stage by the age of 17. He performed roles in several small theatres throughout England, and joined a tour of the Low Countries in 1814, returning the following year to make his London debut.

Booth gained national renown in England with his performance in the title role of &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1817 at the Covent Garden Theatre. Critics compared his performances favorably with those of Edmund Kean, who was at the time the foremost tragedian in Britain. Partisans of the two actors, called Boothites and Keanites, would occasionally start rows at venues where the two were playing together. This did not stop the two from performing in the same plays; Kean and Booth acted in several Shakespearean productions at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane from 1817 to 1821. Kean then saw Booth as a threat and orchestrated a way for the two of them to perform those roles yet again, planning to outperform his opponent. Kean&#x27;s long-standing presence contributed to Booth&#x27;s neverending comparisons to his rival.

===Move to the United States===
In 1821, Booth emigrated to the United States with Mary Ann Holmes, a flower girl, abandoning his wife and their young son. Booth and Holmes claimed to be married that year and settled in 1822 near Bel Air, Maryland. For years they lived in a log cabin Booth bought, moved to his 150 acres, and whitewashed. Just before his death, he began building a much grander house which he named Tudor Hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Booth was quickly hired to play Richard III. In less than a year, Booth became the most prominent actor in the United States. Critic William Winter said, &quot;He was followed as a marvel. Mention of his name stirred an enthusiasm no other could awaken&quot; (Smith 23). He embarked upon a 30-year acting career that made him famous throughout the country. Booth traveled to Baltimore, Boston, and New York.

A persistent story, but apocryphal according to some sources, is that Junius Brutus Booth was acclaimed for performing Orestes in the French language in New Orleans. Theatrical manager Noah Ludlow, who was performing with Booth at the time at the American theatre there, recounts the actual events starting on page 230 of his memoir &quot;Dramatic Life As I Found It&quot; and concludes: &quot;Therefore, I consider the story of Mr. Booth having performed Orestes in the French language, on the French stage, altogether a mistake arising from his having acted that character in the Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans of New Orleans in 1822, but in the English language.&quot;
However, author and professor of theater history Stephen M. Archer notes that Ludlow was in Mobile, Alabama, in 1828, so was not present for this performance. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, has two playbills from the production and both are in French. Booth&#x27;s daughter Asia wrote that her father spoke fluent French and cited a review on the subject. The review was not oblivious to the fact that Booth&#x27;s French pronunciation was less than perfect, however. In 1823, Booth did the role in New York in the English adaptation by Ambrose Philips with Mary Ann Duff as Hermione.

In 1825–1826 and 1836–1837, Booth made tours of his native England. He took his whole family with him for the second of these. During their stay in England, one of his children, Henry Byron, succumbed to smallpox. By 1831, he had become the manager of the Adelphi Theatre in Baltimore. His acclaim continued to grow throughout the rest of his life; Walt Whitman described him as &quot;the grandest of modern times.&quot; Although his relationship with Holmes, his supposed wife, was relatively happy, four of their children died, three in the same year (1833), when epidemics of cholera occurred. In addition, he suffered from alcoholism, which had an effect on the entire family.

Booth&#x27;s alcoholism also caused him to become increasingly unpredictable and reckless. He would drop lines, miss scenes, and cause chaos onstage. During a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Booth suddenly left the scene he was playing with Ophelia, scurried up a ladder, and perched up in the backdrops crowing like a rooster until his manager retrieved him. He was once booked for a sold-out performance in Richmond, then disappeared from town for several days. Eventually, he was found with &quot;ragged, besotted wretches, the greatest actor on the American stage.&quot;

Booth&#x27;s alcoholism and violent nature often caused problems onstage during his performances. On several occasions, when he played the title character in &quot;Richard III,&quot; the actor playing the Earl of Richmond fled the stage when Booth became too aggressive during their dueling scene. One night, when Booth was appearing as &quot;Othello,&quot; the actress playing Desdemona had to be rescued by other cast members when Booth tried to genuinely suffocate her with a pillow.

Booth soon became so unreliable that he had to be locked into his hotel rooms with a guard standing watch. Often, he would still find ways of escaping to drink at a nearby tavern. Once, when a theatre manager locked Booth in his dressing room before a performance, Booth bribed a stage hand to go out and buy a bottle of whiskey. As the stage hand stood outside the door, Booth stuck a drinking straw through the keyhole and sipped whiskey from the bottle.

Booth&#x27;s violent behavior offstage was notable as well. In Charleston, in 1838, Booth was so intoxicated that he attacked a friend, Tom Flynn, with a fireplace andiron. To defend himself, Flynn hit Booth in the face, breaking his nose and forever altering the actor&#x27;s profile and voice.

Some historians and critics have claimed that reality could become overwhelming for Booth, so he would flee into alcoholism and the roles he played. One critic said of Booth that the &quot;personality of the actor was forgotten, and all the details seemed spontaneous workings and unconscious illustrations of the character he represented. He seemed to be possessed by the characters, losing his own identity.&quot; Such subjective judgments are perhaps too facile, as Edwin Booth&#x27;s later comment about his father certainly was: &quot;Great minds to madness closely are allied.&quot; In any case, from February 1817 onward, Junius Booth played almost 3,000 performances. Booth brought a romantic, natural acting style to America, which he pioneered in the hearts of American audiences.

To help him maintain a modicum of stability and also to ensure that he sent his earnings home to the family, Junius and Mary Ann chose their son Edwin to accompany him as his dresser, aid, and guardian. This was an exhausting job because Junius Brutus could go without sleep for very long periods of time and would often disappear.

In 1835, Booth wrote a letter to President Andrew Jackson, demanding he pardon two pirates. In the letter, he threatened to kill the President. Though there would also be an actual attempt of assassination on the President early that year, the letter was believed to be a hoax, until a handwriting analysis of a letter written some days after the threat concluded that the letter was, in fact, written by Booth. Booth apologized to Jackson, though since he and Jackson were friends, the &quot;threat&quot; likely was Booth&#x27;s clumsy attempt at a joke.
Decades later, Booth&#x27;s son, John Wilkes, assassinated President Abraham Lincoln.

==Later life==
In 1852, Booth was involved in a tour of California with his sons Edwin and Junius Jr., performing in San Francisco and Sacramento, where torrential rains not only closed the theatres, but also seriously depleted food supplies. Inflation skyrocketed, and the Booths returned to San Francisco without having made a penny. On 1 October, he left San Francisco without either of his sons. (Junius Jr. had previously established his home there, and Edwin struck out on his own, acting in various venues in northern California.)

Booth had told his first wife, at the time of his initial departure from England, that he would be touring the United States for several years, but would send her money to support her and his young son, Richard, but Booth&#x27;s sister and brother-in-law later arrived with their children from England and demanded to be housed and supported in exchange for keeping quiet about his American family. After some years, this arrangement became financially untenable, and Booth stopped sending his wife money so regularly. This prompted Adelaide to send their son, now 25, to Baltimore. For three years, Booth somehow fooled him into believing that he lived alone, but eventually Richard discovered the truth. He sent word to his mother, who arrived in Baltimore in December 1846 and confronted Booth when he returned home from touring in March. After living the requisite three years in Maryland, she was able to divorce him in February 1851.

On 10 May 1851, with the youngest of their 10 children now 11 years of age, Booth finally legally married Mary Ann Holmes.

==Death==
While traveling by steamboat from New Orleans to Cincinnati in 1852, Booth developed a severe fever, presumably from drinking impure river water. No physician was on board, and he died aboard the steamboat near Louisville, Kentucky, on 30 November 1852. Booth&#x27;s widow, Mary Ann, traveled to Cincinnati alone to claim his body.

Booth is buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.
==Legacy==

<doc id="356868" wikidata="Q358885" url="?curid=356868" title="Maximilian Voloshin">
<text>Maximilian Alexandrovich Kirienko-Voloshin (; May 28, O.S. May 16] 1877 – August 11, 1932), commonly known as Max Voloshin, was a Russian poet. He was one of the significant representatives of the symbolist movement in Russian culture and literature. He became famous as a poet and a critic of literature and the arts, being published in many contemporary magazines of the early 20th century, including &quot;Vesy&quot;, &quot;Zolotoye runo&quot; (&#x27;The Golden Fleece&#x27;), and &quot;Apollon&quot;. He was known for his translations of a number of French poetic and prose works into Russian.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Voloshin was born in Kiev in 1877. He spent his early childhood in Sevastopol and Taganrog. Reportedly, &quot;his schooling included a few years at the Polivanov establishment and a school in the Crimea, where in 1893 his mother had bought a cheap plot of land at Koktebel.&quot; After secondary school, Voloshin entered Moscow University during &quot;a time of the resurgence of the radical student movement in Russia.&quot; Voloshin reportedly actively participated in it, &quot;which resulted in his expulsion from the University in 1899.&quot;

Not discouraged, Voloshin &quot;resumed his travels the length and breadth of Russia, often on foot.&quot; In 1900, he worked with an expedition surveying the route of the Orenburg-Tashkent Railway. He described this period in his life as:

Upon his return to Moscow, Voloshin did not seek reinstatement at the university, but continued his travels to such places as Western Europe, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt. Reportedly, &quot;his stay in Paris and travels all over France had a particularly deep effect on&quot; him and he came back to Russia &quot;a veritable Parisian.&quot;
While during this time in Russia there were &quot;numerous literary groups and trends, known as the Silver Age,&quot; Voloshin remained aloof despite &quot;being a close friend of many outstanding cultural figures of the day&quot;. In verses devoted to Valery Bryusov he wrote: &quot;In your world, I am a passerby, close to all and yet a stranger to all.&quot;
When &quot;a madman&quot; ripped Repin&#x27;s famous canvas &quot;Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son&quot; with a knife, shocking Intellectual Russia, Voloshin was the only person in the country to defend the man, &quot;indicating that it was an esthetic statement appropriate to the painting, which displayed gore and bad taste&quot;. Voloshin had a brief affair with Miss Sabashnikova, but they soon broke up, and this had a profound effect on his work. Gradually, Voloshin was drawn back to Koktebel in the Crimea, where he had spent much of his childhood. His first collection of poetry appeared in 1910, soon followed by others. His collected essays were published in 1914.

===Life and work===
During the years of the First World War, Voloshin, in Switzerland at the time, showed himself to be an author of profoundly insightful poems, engaging in a philosophically- and historically-based exploration of the tragic events of his contemporary Russia. He was known for his humanism, appealing &quot;in the days of revolutions to be a human, not a citizen&quot; and &quot;in the disturbances of wars to realize the oneness. To be not a part, but all: not from one side, but from both.&quot;

Eventually Voloshin made it back to France, where he stayed until 1916. A year before the February Revolution in Russia, Voloshin returned to his home country and settled in Koktebel. He would live there until the end of his life. The ensuing Civil War prompted Voloshin to write long poems linking what was happening in Russia to its distant, mythologized past. Later, Voloshin would be accused of the worst sin in the Soviet ideologue&#x27;s book: keeping aloof from the political struggle between Reds and Whites. In fact, he tried to protect the Whites from the Reds and the Reds from the Whites. His house, today a museum, still has a clandestine niche in which he hid people whose lives were in danger.

Reportedly, &quot;never were a poet&#x27;s works so closely bound up with the place where he lived. He recreated the semi-mythical world of the Cimmerii in pictures and verses. He painted landscapes of primeval eastern Crimea. Nature itself seemed to respond to Voloshin&#x27;s art. If one looks west from the Voloshin Museum, there is a mountain whose shape is uncannily similar to Voloshin&#x27;s profile.&quot;

Miraculously, Voloshin survived the Civil War, and in the 1920s set up a free rest home for writers in his house, in accordance with his rejection of private property. Yet he continued to draw most of his inspiration from solitude and contemplation of nature.

During the latter years of his life, he gained additional recognition as a subtle water-colour painter. Many of his art works now belong to museums around the world, while others are kept in private collections in Russia and abroad.

==Legacy==

Although some critics may note that Voloshin&#x27;s poetry &quot;may be esthetically inferior to that of Pasternak, say, or Akhmatova, and it is somewhat patchy,&quot; it has been noted that &quot;it contains deep philosophical insights and tells us more about Russian history than the works of any other poet.&quot; Many of Voloshin&#x27;s comments seem to be prophetic. In a normal state, he wrote, &quot;two classes are outside the law: the criminal and the ruling class. Today, Russia has fully realized this principle.&quot; Voloshin&#x27;s integrity and profound ideas made him a non-person in Soviet Union, and not a single poem of his was published in USSR from 1928 to 1961. It has been theorized that &quot;if he had not died in 1932, he would certainly have become another victim of the Great Terror. &quot;&#x27;This is not the first time that, dreaming of freedom, we build a new prison,&quot; read the first line of one of Voloshin&#x27;s finest poems.

Voloshin&#x27;s small village of Koktebel in Southern-Eastern Crimea, which inspired so much of his poetry, still retains the memory of its famous poet, who was buried there on a mountain now bearing his name. His &quot;House of a Poet&quot; (now a museum) continues to attract people from all areas of the world, reminiscent of the days when its owner served as the host of countless poets, artists, actors, scientists, and wanderers. He is regarded as one of the most notable poets of Russian Silver Age. His poems were set to music and frequently performed by singers-songwriters.

Russian progressive rock band Little Tragedies recorded music to three of Voloshin&#x27;s poems.

<text>A ministry of transport or transportation is a ministry responsible for transportation within a country. It usually is administered by the &quot;minister for transport&quot;. The term is also sometimes applied to the departments or other government agencies administering transport in nations who do not employ ministers.

Specific responsibilities may include overseeing road safety, civil aviation, maritime transport, rail transport, developing government transportation policy, organizing public transport, and the maintenance and construction of infrastructural projects. Some ministries have additional responsibilities in related policy areas such as infrastructure, public works, waterworks, construction, communication, housing and economic activities, such as industry and trade.

In many jurisdictions, transportation policy is often assumed by an infrastructure ministry.

<text>Xcode is Apple&#x27;s integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. It was initially released in late 2003; the latest stable release is version 16, released on September 16, 2024, and is available free of charge via the Mac App Store and the Apple Developer website. Registered developers can also download preview releases and prior versions of the suite through the Apple Developer website. Xcode includes command-line tools that enable UNIX-style development via the Terminal app in macOS. They can also be downloaded and installed without the GUI.

Before Xcode, Apple offered developers Project Builder and Interface Builder to develop Mac OS X applications.

== Major features ==
Xcode supports source code for the programming languages: Swift, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python, Ruby, ResEdit (Rez), and C, with a variety of programming models, including but not limited to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java. Third parties have added support for GNU Pascal, Free Pascal, Ada, C#, Go, Perl, and D.

Xcode can build &quot;fat binary&quot; (universal binary) files containing code for multiple architectures with the Mach-O executable format. These helped ease the transitions from 32-bit PowerPC to 64-bit PowerPC, from PowerPC to Intel x86, from 32-bit to 64-bit Intel, and most recently from Intel x86 to Apple silicon by allowing developers to distribute a single application to users and letting the operating system automatically choose the appropriate architecture at runtime. Using the iOS SDK, tvOS SDK, and watchOS SDK, Xcode can also be used to compile and debug applications for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

Xcode includes the GUI tool Instruments, which runs atop a dynamic tracing framework, DTrace, created by Sun Microsystems and released as part of OpenSolaris.

Xcode also integrates built-in support for source code management using the Git version control system and protocol, allowing the user to create and clone Git repositories (which can be hosted on source code repository hosting sites such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Perforce, or self-hosted using open-source software such as GitLab), and to commit, push, and pull changes, all from within Xcode, automating tasks that would traditionally be performed by using Git from the command line.

=== Composition ===
The main application of the suite is the integrated development environment (IDE), also named Xcode. The Xcode suite includes most of Apple&#x27;s developer documentation, and built-in Interface Builder, an application used to construct graphical user interfaces.
Up to Xcode 4.1, the Xcode suite included a modified version of the GNU Compiler Collection. In Xcode 3.1 up to Xcode 4.6.3, it included the LLVM-GCC compiler, with front ends from the GNU Compiler Collection and a code generator based on LLVM. In Xcode 3.2 and later, it included the Clang C/C++/Objective-C compiler, with newly-written front ends and a code generator based on LLVM, and the Clang static analyzer. Starting with Xcode 4.2, the Clang compiler became the default compiler, Starting with Xcode 5.0, Clang was the only compiler provided.

Up to Xcode 4.6.3, the Xcode suite used the GNU Debugger (GDB) as the back-end for the IDE&#x27;s debugger. Starting with Xcode 4.3, the LLDB debugger was also provided; starting with Xcode 4.5 LLDB replaced GDB as the default back-end for the IDE&#x27;s debugger. Starting with Xcode 5.0, GDB was no longer supplied.

=== Playgrounds ===
The Playgrounds feature of Xcode provides an environment for rapid experimentation and development in the Swift programming language. The original version of the feature was announced and released by Apple Inc on June 2, 2014, during WWDC 2014.

Playgrounds provide a testing ground that renders developer code in real time. They have the capability of evaluating and displaying the results of single expressions as they are coded (in line or on a side bar), providing rapid feedback to the programmer. This type of development environment, known as a read-eval-print loop (or REPL) is useful for learning, experimenting and fast prototyping. Playgrounds was used by Apple to publish Swift tutorials and guided tours where the REPL advantages are noticeable&quot;.&quot;

The Playgrounds feature was developed by the Developer Tools department at Apple. According to Chris Lattner, the inventor of Swift Programming Language and Senior Director and Architect at the Developer Tools Department, Playgrounds was &quot;heavily influenced by Bret Victor&#x27;s ideas, by Light Table and by many other interactive systems&quot;. Playgrounds was announced by Apple Inc. on June 2, 2014, during WWDC 2014 as part of Xcode 6 and released in September.

In September 2016, the Swift Playgrounds application for iPad (also available on macOS starting in February 2020) was released, incorporating these ideas into an educational tool. Xcode&#x27;s Playgrounds feature continued development, with a new step-by-step execution feature introduced in Xcode 10 at WWDC 2018.

=== Removed features ===
Formerly, Xcode supported distributing a product build process over multiple systems. One technology involved was named &quot;Shared Workgroup Build&quot;, which used the Bonjour protocol to automatically discover systems providing compiler services, and a modified version of the free software product distcc to facilitate the distribution of workloads. Earlier versions of Xcode provided a system named &quot;Dedicated Network Builds&quot;. These features are absent in the supported versions of Xcode.

Xcode also includes Apple&#x27;s WebObjects tools and frameworks for building Java web applications and web services (formerly sold as a separate product). As of Xcode 3.0, Apple dropped WebObjects development inside Xcode; WOLips should be used instead. Xcode 3 still includes the WebObjects frameworks.

== Version history ==

=== 1.x series ===
Xcode 1.0 was released in fall 2003. Xcode 1.0 was based on Project Builder, but had an updated user interface (UI), ZeroLink, Fix &amp; Continue, distributed build support, and Code Sense indexing.

The next significant release, Xcode 1.5, had better code completion and an improved debugger.

=== 2.x series ===
Xcode 2.0 was released with Mac OS X v10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;. It included the Quartz Composer visual programming language, better Code Sense indexing for Java, and Ant support. It also included the Apple Reference Library tool, which allows searching and reading online documentation from Apple&#x27;s website and documentation installed on a local computer.

Xcode 2.1 could create universal binary files. It supported shared precompiled headers, unit testing targets, conditional breakpoints, and watchpoints. It also had better dependency analysis.

The final version of Xcode for Mac OS X v10.4 was 2.5.

=== 3.x series ===
Xcode 3.0 was released with Mac OS X v10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;. Notable changes since 2.1 include the DTrace debugging tool (now named Instruments), refactoring support, context-sensitive documentation, and Objective-C 2.0 with garbage collection. It also supports Project Snapshots, which provide a basic form of version control; Message Bubbles, which show build errors debug values alongside code; and building four-architecture fat binaries (32 and 64-bit Intel and PowerPC).

Xcode 3.1 was an update release of the developer tools for Mac OS X, and was the same version included with the iPhone SDK. It could target non-Mac OS X platforms, including iPhone OS 2.0. It included the GCC 4.2 and LLVM GCC 4.2 compilers. Another new feature since Xcode 3.0 is that Xcode&#x27;s SCM support now includes Subversion 1.5.

Xcode 3.2 was released with Mac OS X v10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; and installs on no earlier version of OS X. It supports static program analysis, among other features. It also drops official support for targeting versions earlier than iPhone OS 3.0. But it is still possible to target older versions, and the simulator supports iPhone OS 2.0 through 3.1. Also, Java support is &quot;exiled&quot; in 3.2 to the organizer.

Xcode 3.2.6 is the last version that can be downloaded for free for users of Mac OS X Snow Leopard (though it’s not the last version that supports Snow Leopard; 4.2 is). Downloading Xcode 3.2.6 requires a free registration at Apple&#x27;s developer site.

=== 4.x series ===
In June 2010, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference version 4 of Xcode was announced during the Developer Tools State of the Union address. Version 4 of the developer tools consolidates the Xcode editing tools and Interface Builder into one application, among other enhancements. Apple released the final version of Xcode 4.0 on March 9, 2011. The software was made available for free to all registered members of the $99 per year Mac Developer program and the $99 per year iOS Developer program. It was also sold for $4.99 to non-members on the Mac App Store (no longer available). Xcode 4.0 drops support for many older systems, including all PowerPC development and software development kits (SDKs) for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, and all iOS SDKs older than 4.3. The deployment target can still be set to produce binaries for those older platforms, but for Mac OS platforms, one is then limited to creating x86 and x86-64 binaries. Later, Xcode was free to the general public. Before version 4.1, Xcode cost $4.99.

Xcode 4.1 was made available for free on July 20, 2011 (the day of Mac OS X Lion&#x27;s release) to all users of Mac OS X Lion on the Mac App Store. On August 29, 2011, Xcode 4.1 was made available for Mac OS X Snow Leopard for members of the paid Mac or iOS developer programs. Xcode 4.1 was the last version to include GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) instead of only LLVM GCC or Clang.

On October 12, 2011, Xcode 4.2 was released concurrently with the release of iOS 5.0, and it included many more and improved features, such as storyboarding and automatic reference counting (ARC). Xcode 4.2 is the last version to support Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, but is available only to registered developers with paid accounts; without a paid account, 3.2.6 is the latest download that appears for Snow Leopard.

Xcode 4.3, released on February 16, 2012, is distributed as one application bundle, Xcode.app, installed from the Mac App Store. Xcode 4.3 reorganizes the Xcode menu to include development tools. Xcode 4.3.1 was released on March 7, 2012 to add support for iOS 5.1. Xcode 4.3.2 was released on March 22, 2012 with enhancements to the iOS Simulator and a suggested move to the LLDB debugger versus the GDB debugger (which appear to be undocumented changes). Xcode 4.3.3, released in May 2012, featured an updated SDK for Mac OS X 10.7.4 &quot;Lion&quot; and a few bug fixes.

Xcode 4.4 was released on July 25, 2012.
It runs on both Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and is the first version of Xcode to contain the OS X 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; SDK. Xcode 4.4 includes support for automatic synthesizing of declared properties, new Objective-C features such as literal syntax and subscripting, improved localization, and more. On August 7, 2012, Xcode 4.4.1 was released with a few bug fixes.

On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 and Xcode 4.5 were released. Xcode added support for iOS 6 and the 4-inch Retina Display on iPhone 5 and iPod Touch 5th generation. It also brought some new Objective-C features to iOS, simplified localization, and added auto-layout support for iOS. On October 3, 2012, Xcode 4.5.1 was released with bug fixes and stability improvements. Less than a month later, Xcode 4.5.2 was released, with support for iPad Mini and iPad with Retina Display, and bug fixes and stability improvements.

On January 28, 2013, iOS 6.1 and Xcode 4.6 were released.

<text>Zygophyllaceae is a family of flowering plants that contains the bean-caper and caltrop. The family includes around 285 species in 22 genera.

Plants in the family Zygophyllaceae may be trees, shrubs, or herbs. They are often found in dry habitats. The leaves are usually opposite, often with stipules and spines. Some are cultivated as ornamental plants, such as species of the &quot;Guaiacum&quot;, &quot;Zygophyllum&quot;, &quot;Tribulus&quot;, and &quot;Larrea&quot; genera. King Clone, a creosote bush &quot;(Larrea tridentata)&quot; in California, is among the world&#x27;s oldest living organisms.

The distribution of plants in the Zygophyllaceae family can be found worldwide in warm tropics and cool-temperate subtropics with a concentration in hot, arid regions with alkaline soils. Regions with different species from this family include Africa, south Asia, India, Australia and parts of the United States.

==Genera==
&quot;Peganum&quot; was in Zygophyllaceae before being moved to the newly created family Nitrariaceae.

==Systematics==
In the APG III system of classification, the families Zygophyllaceae and Krameriaceae compose the order Zygophyllales. In the previous version of their classification system, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group had included the option of placing &quot;Krameria&quot; within Zygophyllaceae.

Zygophyllaceae are divided into five subfamilies. Molecular phylogenies of the family were published in 2000 and 2018. Phylogenies of groups within the family, particularly the predominantly southern African species of Zygophylloideae have also been published.

Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

<doc id="356890" wikidata="Q1429385" url="?curid=356890" title="Guaiacum">
<text>Guaiacum (), sometimes spelled Guajacum, is a genus of flowering plants in the caltrop family Zygophyllaceae. It contains five species of slow-growing shrubs and trees, reaching a height of approximately but usually less than half of that. All are native to subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and are commonly known as lignum-vitae, guayacán (Spanish), or gaïac (French). The genus name originated in Taíno, the language spoken by the native Taínos of the Bahamas; it was adopted into English in 1533, the first word in that language of American origin.

Members of the genus have a variety of uses, including as lumber, for medicinal purposes, and as ornamentals. The trade of all species of &quot;Guaiacum&quot; is controlled under CITES Appendix II.

&quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot; is the national flower of Jamaica, while &quot;Guaiacum sanctum&quot; is the national tree of the Bahamas.

==Uses==

The genus is famous as the supplier of lignum vitae, which is the wood of several species in the genus. It is the fourth-hardest variety of wood as measured by the Janka hardness test, requiring a force of to embed a steel ball in diameter half that distance into the wood.

The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood when they conquered San Domingo in the sixteenth century. It was soon brought back to Europe, where epidemic syphilis had been raging for decades. Gum guiacum quickly acquired a reputation as a cure for syphilis, a practice Benvenuto Cellini records in his memoirs. Thomas Nashe referred to its supposed medical properties in his tract &quot;Nashe&#x27;s Lenten Stuff&quot;, alluding to the exotic sound of the word itself: &quot;Physicians deafen our ears with the &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; of their heavenly &quot;panacaea&quot;, their sovereign guiacum.&quot; The detailed engraving, &quot;Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating Syphilis&quot;, published by Philips Galle after a design by the Flemish artist Jan van der Straet, depicts four servants preparing a concoction of gum guiacum for their wealthy master under the supervision of a physician. Paracelsus, the famous if controversial Swiss physician, disputed the effectiveness of this treatment and was censured for his criticism.

Gum guaiacum was used to stimulate menstruation; in a 1793 Virginia court case, Martha Jefferson Randolph testified that she had provided gum guaiacum to a female relative to &quot;produce an abortion&quot;, suggesting that it was also used as an abortifacient. In &quot;A Treatise of the Materia Medica&quot; (1789), Scottish physician William Cullen noted: &quot;Several physicians have apprehended mischief from the use of the guaiacum in a spirituous tincture.&quot;

The 1955 edition of the &quot;Textbook of Pharmacognosy&quot; states:
&quot;Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of sarsaparilla, which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis.&quot;

A phenolic compound derived from the resin of &quot;Guaiacum&quot; trees is used in a common test for blood in human stool samples. The presence of heme in the blood causes the formation of a coloured product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of peroxidases in horseradish on guiacum was first noted in 1810.

As a food additive, &quot;Guaiacum&quot; is designated E314 and classified as an antioxidant.

A widely used derivative drug is the expectorant known as guaifenesin.

The soap fragrance oil of guaiac comes from &quot;Bulnesia sarmientoi&quot;, a South American tree from the same family.

Members of the genus are grown in Florida and California as ornamental plants.

<doc id="356892" wikidata="Q847831" url="?curid=356892" title="Beware (EP)">
<text>Beware is the fifth release by the American punk rock band Misfits. First issued in January 1980, this EP combined the Misfits&#x27; previously released singles &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Horror Business&quot;, and was originally intended as a recording that the Misfits could bring with them on their tour of the United Kingdom with the British punk rock group the Damned in late 1979. Along with songs from &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Horror Business&quot;, &quot;Beware&quot; also includes the track &quot;Last Caress&quot;, which had never been released previously.

==Background==
In November 1979, the Misfits flew to the United Kingdom for a six-date tour with the Damned. The Damned, having scheduled a different opening act for their tour, were not expecting their arrival, but the Misfits were added to the bill nonetheless. After not receiving any payment for performing, the Misfits soon cancelled their remaining appearances on the tour. This was followed by the arrest of Misfits vocalist Glenn Danzig and then-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele, who had been involved in a fight with a group of skinheads at the Rainbow Theatre in London on December 2, 1979. Danzig and Steele spent two nights in jail in Brixton, England, which inspired them to create the song &quot;London Dungeon&quot;.

Then-Misfits drummer Joey Image returned to the United States by himself on December 15, effectively quitting the band. On December 18, the other members of the group flew back to their home state of New Jersey, where they produced &quot;Beware&quot;. The title of the EP was derived from a series of road signs that the Misfits had come across while in London, which read &quot;Beware Bollards&quot;. The band, unfamiliar with the term &quot;bollard&quot;, initially thought that it might refer to a cryptid such as their own Jersey Devil. Originally planned as a record that the Misfits could bring with them on their tour with the Damned (they were not able to do so, as the cover artwork had not been completed in time), &quot;Beware&quot; combined songs from the Misfits&#x27; previously issued singles &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Horror Business&quot;, except the latter&#x27;s track &quot;Children in Heat&quot; was replaced by the song &quot;Last Caress&quot;, which had never been released prior to &quot;Beware&quot;.

&quot;Beware&quot; was the Misfits&#x27; only original UK release, and was issued in the UK by Armageddon/Spartan Records and in the U.S. by the band&#x27;s own label, Plan 9 Records.

<doc id="356896" wikidata="Q336214" url="?curid=356896" title="Jack Cunningham, Baron Cunningham of Felling">
<text>John Anderson Cunningham, Baron Cunningham of Felling, (born 4 August 1939) is a British politician who was a Labour Member of Parliament for over 30 years, serving for Whitehaven from 1970 to 1983 and then Copeland until the 2005 general election, and had served in the Cabinet of Tony Blair.

==Background==
His father was Andrew Cunningham, leader of the Labour Party in the Northern Region in the 1970s, who was disgraced in the 1974 Poulson scandal. Dr Cunningham was first elected as member for Whitehaven in 1970, and the renamed Copeland constituency, which was the same as Whitehaven, in 1983.

==Early life==
He was educated at Jarrow Grammar School (now Jarrow School) in the same class as Doug McAvoy, future general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. Cunningham then studied at Bede College of Durham University, receiving a BSc in Chemistry in 1962, and a PhD in 1967. He stayed at the university to become a research fellow from 1966 to 1968, whilst working as an officer for the General and Municipal Workers&#x27; Union.

He was a district councillor for Chester-le-Street Rural &amp; Parish Council, prior to becoming an MP and continued to live in the Garden Farm area of the town, bringing up his family there.

==Political career==
Cunningham joined the Shadow cabinet in 1983, and was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Cumbria in 1991. He ran the Labour Party&#x27;s general election campaign in 1992. He also appeared on many television election programmes as one of the main spokesmen of the Labour Party.

===Minister===
Following the Labour landslide victory at the 1997 general election, he became Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and embarked on a modernisation programme for the Ministry. He worked to secure the lifting of the EU ban on the export of UK beef, and achieved some limited success on this.

===Cabinet===
He was shifted in 1998 to Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The media dubbed him &quot;cabinet enforcer&quot;, claiming that his role was effectively to sell the Government and its policies to the public and the media. He also led the government&#x27;s work on modernising government, and chaired the Ministerial Committee on genetically modified foods and crops.

===Backbenches===
He retired from the Cabinet in 1999, and returned to the backbenches. He stood down from Parliament at the 2005 general election. 
Having represented the parliamentary constituency that includes Sellafield, the UK&#x27;s largest nuclear facility for 35 years; he is a strong proponent of nuclear power and is the founding European legislative Chairman of the Transatlantic Nuclear Energy Forum.

===House of Lords===
In the 2005 Dissolution Honours, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cunningham of Felling, &quot;of Felling in the County of Tyne and Wear&quot;.

Lord Cunningham of Felling is still active in politics and chairs an all-party parliamentary committee to review the powers of the House of Lords.

===Lobbyist allegations===
Cunningham was suspended from the Labour Party whip, and the party, in June 2013 pending an investigation over claims he had offered to work for lobbyists. He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards authorities, and had the Labour whip restored.

=== Expenses claimed in the House of Lords ===
Research conducted by the Guardian newspaper revealed that Lord Cunningham claimed a total of £75,122 for 154 days&#x27; attendance in 2017–2018. This was the largest claim for attendance and travel expenses out of all the sitting members in the House of Lords. £23,108 of the £75,122 was claimed for air travel expenses.

==Personal life==
He lives with his wife near Stocksfield, in Northumberland and is an avid fly fisherman. In 2016 Cunningham was awarded with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star.

<text>Gasherbrum I (; ; ), surveyed as K5 and also known as Hidden Peak, is the 11th highest mountain in the world at above sea level. It is located between Shigar District in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan and Tashkurgan in the Xinjiang of China. Gasherbrum I is part of the Gasherbrum Massif, located in the Karakoram region of the Himalaya. Gasherbrum is often claimed to mean &quot;Shining Wall&quot;, presumably a reference to the highly visible face of the neighboring peak Gasherbrum IV; but in fact, it comes from &quot;rgasha&quot; (beautiful) + &quot;brum&quot; (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means &quot;beautiful mountain.&quot;

Gasherbrum I was designated K5 (meaning the 5th peak of the Karakoram) by T.G. Montgomerie in 1856 when he first spotted the peaks of the Karakoram from more than 200 km away during the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. In 1892, William Martin Conway provided the alternate name, Hidden Peak, in reference to its extreme remoteness.

Gasherbrum I was first climbed on July 5, 1958, by Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman of an eight-man American expedition led by Nicholas B. Clinch, Richard K. Irvin, Tom Nevison, Tom McCormack, Bob Swift and Gil Roberts were also members of the team.

<text>Nicholas Hugh Brown (born 13 June 1950), known as Nick Brown, is a British former politician and trade unionist who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne East between 1983 and 2024. He represented the Labour Party until his resignation in 2023. Brown is the longest-serving Chief Whip of the Labour Party, discontinuously holding the position several times between 1997 and 2021 under Blair, Brown, Miliband, Corbyn and Starmer. 

Brown attended Cabinet as Government Chief Whip from 1997 until 1998 and again from 2008 until 2010, and as Agriculture Minister from 1998 to 2001. Brown also held the position of Regional Minister for the North East between 2007 and 2010.

==Early life==
Nicholas Hugh Brown was born in Hawkhurst, Kent, and brought up in Tunbridge Wells. He was educated at Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys and the University of Manchester. After graduating from university, Brown worked in the advertising department of Procter &amp; Gamble. He then became a legal adviser to the Northern Region of the GMBATU, later GMB, based in Newcastle upon Tyne.

==Political career==

=== Early political career: 1980–1997 ===
In 1980, Brown was elected to Newcastle City Council as a Labour councillor, representing the Walker ward.

Brown was chosen as the new Labour Party candidate for the parliamentary seat after Mike Thomas, the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne East, defected to the SDP. Brown easily retained the seat for Labour at the 1983 general election. Originally elected to the Commons in the same year as Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, Brown was initially close to both men, but over time became his namesake Brown&#x27;s staunchest ally, though the two are unrelated.

Brown was first appointed to Labour&#x27;s frontbench team in 1985 as a shadow solicitor general. In 1988, he was moved to the position of Treasury spokesperson before briefly becoming shadow spokesperson for health between 1994 and 1995.

In the 1994 Labour leadership election, he supported Gordon Brown and acted as his unofficial campaign manager and, according to biographer Paul Routledge, advised against his withdrawing from the contest in Blair&#x27;s favour.

In 1995, Brown was appointed as Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Commons and played a central role in Parliament in trying to defeat the Conservative government&#x27;s parliamentary agenda.

=== Government: 1997–2010 ===
Following Labour&#x27;s election victory in 1997, he was appointed as Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons, but stayed there only for just over a year, to then be moved to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Tony Blair&#x27;s first ministerial shuffle in July 1998. This change, which followed the publication of the Routledge biography earlier that year, was widely seen as a demotion, and ascribed to his close connection with Gordon Brown.

His tenure as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food saw several animal health crises, ending with the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. Brown&#x27;s handling of the outbreak was criticised by some and used to attack the government, though his handling of the crisis maintained the support of the farming and food industries and the veterinary profession throughout the crisis. Suggestions that a vaccination strategy should have been practised in preference to the culling of hundreds of thousands of animals, made with the benefit of hindsight, did not help his cause, and he was demoted to Minister of State for Work, with non-voting Cabinet rank, after the general election of 2001. In June 2003, he was dropped from the Government altogether.

In 2004, he was one of the organisers of a backbench rebellion against the government&#x27;s proposals for the introduction of tuition fees, but hours before the vote announced that he had received significant concessions from the Government and would now support it. Some suspected that the Chancellor had placed considerable pressure on him to back down and the affair cost Brown some credibility.

On 29 June 2007, Gordon Brown became Prime Minister and immediately appointed Nick Brown as the Regional Minister for the North East and simultaneously as the new Deputy Chief Whip.

Following a government reshuffle in 2008, Gordon Brown returned Nick Brown to his original government position of Government Chief Whip, whilst retaining his position as Minister for the North East.

In 2009, Brown was appointed to investigate the legitimacy of expense claims by Labour MPs between 2004 and 2008. According to &quot; The Daily Telegraph&quot; in this period Brown himself claimed a total of £87,708 for his constituency home.

Brown&#x27;s mortgage interest repayments for 2007–8 totalled £6,600, but he also claimed a total of £23,068, just £15 below the maximum allowable amount for the year. The claim included £4,800 for food – the maximum allowable amount – £2,880 for repairs and insurance, £2,880 for services, £897.65 for cleaning, £1,640 for phones and £1,810 for utilities. Brown, however, has said that he saved the taxpayer a considerable amount of money by turning down a Government car and driver upon being made Chief Whip, the annual cost of which would have been around £100,000.

=== Opposition: 2010–2024 ===
On 29 September 2010, newly elected Labour Party leader Ed Miliband asked Brown to stand down as Chief Whip due to the need for a &quot;break from the past&quot;.

On 29 January 2011, during the &quot;News of the World&quot; phone hacking affair, Brown said that his landline may have been bugged in 1998, around the time of his being outed. He was also contacted by an undisclosed police force in the West of England in 2003, who told him that they were pursuing a phone-tapping prosecution and he was one of those who may have been targeted. The case collapsed when it reached court and full details of the allegations were never disclosed. Brown said that: &quot;Given that it was near [Prince Charles&#x27; home] Highgrove, my assumption was that this might involve the Royal Family. But I was never explicitly told that.&quot;

In 2014, Brown publicly opposed his party&#x27;s proposal to scrap the position of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), citing the effectiveness of the three PCCs in North East England at the time.

Ahead of the 2016 EU membership referendum, Brown stated he supported remaining in the European Union.

On 6 October 2016, Brown was reappointed as Labour Chief Whip by Jeremy Corbyn, and thus became Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Commons.

Brown was again reappointed as Labour Chief Whip by Sir Keir Starmer after the latter&#x27;s victory in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election. This reappointment meant that Brown was the only person to have held the role for three non-consecutive terms, as well as under six different leaders (Blair, Brown, Harman, briefly Miliband, Corbyn and Starmer) across four decades. Brown left the role of Chief Whip for the third time as a result of Starmer&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet reshuffle in May 2021. On 26 May 2021, Brown returned as chair of the Finance Committee.

In September 2022, Brown was suspended from the Labour Party following allegations concerning an event 25 years previously, details of which were not made public. On 12 December 2023, he resigned from the Labour Party in protest at the unresolved disciplinary process. He also announced that he would not be contesting the next election.

==Personal life==
Brown is a holder of the freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne award, a supporter of Humanists UK, a member of GMB, and an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. He is known to have a love for classical music, which developed during his time at Manchester University. Brown is a member of the Labour Friends of Israel group.

In 1998, Brown came out as gay after a former lover contacted the &quot;News of the World&quot; offering to sell his story. In a speech, he announced: &quot;The sun is out – and so am I.&quot;

From 2012 until 2022, he was a Non-Executive Director of the Mariinsky Theatre Trust (the Anglo-Russian friendship organisation that supports the work of the Mariinsky Theatre in the UK). He is a governor of Walker Riverside Academy, a patron of Leeds Youth Opera and a trustee of the Biscuit Factory art exhibition in Shieldfield, Newcastle. He formerly chaired the all-party parliamentary group for motorcycle speedway racing.

<text>Marvin Camras (January 1, 1916 – June 23, 1995) was an electrical engineer and inventor who was widely influential in the field of magnetic recording.

Camras built his first recording device, a wire recorder, in the 1930s for a cousin who was an aspiring opera singer named Willy. He also built Willy a telephone, because he could not afford one, at the age of 8. Shortly afterwards he discovered that using magnetic tape made the process of splicing and storing recordings easier.

Camras&#x27;s work attracted the notice of his professors at what became Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and was offered a position at Armour Research Foundation (which merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to become IIT) to develop his work.

Before and during World War II Camras&#x27; wire recorders were used by the armed forces to train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not going to take place. This work was kept secret until after the war.

In June 1944 he was awarded , titled &quot;Method and Means of Magnetic Recording&quot;. In all, Camras received more than 500 patents, largely in the field of electronic communications.

Camras received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1940 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1942, both in electrical engineering, from IIT. In 1968, the institution awarded him an honorary doctorate.

In May 1962 Camras wrote a speculative prediction paper titled &quot;Magnetic recording and reproduction - 2012 A.D.&quot;. In his paper Camras predicted the existence of mass-produced portable media players he described as memory packs the size of a package of playing cards holding up to 1020 bits of information. Such devices would not have any mechanical moving parts and would store both sound and movies. He also predicted music and movie downloads, online shopping, access to online encyclopedias and newspapers and the widespread use of online banking transactions.

Camras built his own house by hand, doing everything except laying the foundation. He also built a bomb shelter in this house. 
In recognition of his achievements, he received the National Medal of Technology award in 1990.

Marvin Camras died of kidney failure at the age of 79 in Evanston, Illinois.

<doc id="356905" wikidata="Q333537" url="?curid=356905" title="David Mellor">
<text>David John Mellor (born 12 March 1949) is a British broadcaster, barrister, and former politician. As a member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister John Major as Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1990–1992) and Secretary of State for National Heritage (April–September 1992), before resigning in 1992. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Putney from 1979 to 1997.

Since leaving Parliament, Mellor has worked as a newspaper columnist, a radio presenter, and an after-dinner speaker. He also served as Chairman of the government&#x27;s &#x27;Football Task Force&#x27;.

==Education and early career==
Born in Wareham, Dorset, Mellor was educated at Swanage Grammar School, and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, during which time he was chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and a contestant on &quot;University Challenge&quot;. After briefly working for Jeffrey Archer (at the time a Member of Parliament) while studying for his bar exams, Mellor was called to the bar in 1972. He ceased to practise in 1979 upon being elected as an MP, and he remains &quot;non-practising&quot;. He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
After contesting West Bromwich East in the general election in October 1974, Mellor became the MP for Putney in the general election of 1979, and held the seat until 1997.

===Government minister===
Mellor was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy in 1981.

In 1983, Mellor was appointed as a minister in the Home Office where he was involved in several pieces of legislation, including the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (which established the Crown Prosecution Service). He was also involved with legislation enabling the re-investigation of miscarriages of justice, and with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

In 1987, Mellor was moved to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office by Thatcher, and was made responsible for the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union (before the revolutions of 1989). At this point he made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; speaking about the Mafia.

Mellor was briefly Minister of State for Health in 1988–1989, during the Third Thatcher ministry. In this position, he was convinced by Graham Fraser to launch a national cochlear implants programme for people suffering from severe hearing loss.

He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1990 by Thatcher, shortly before she resigned as Prime Minister.

Mellor was briefly Minister for the Arts in 1990 before entering John Major&#x27;s new Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in November of that year. He was interviewed in December 1991 on the TV programme &quot;Hard News&quot; following the establishment of the Calcutt Review inquiring into Press Standards. Mellor said during the interview that &quot;the press – the popular press – is drinking in the last chance saloon&quot; and called for curbs on the &quot;sacred cow&quot; of press freedom to curb their more extreme activities.

Following the 1992 general election Mellor remained a Cabinet Minister as Secretary of State for National Heritage in the newly created Department of National Heritage (now the Department for Culture, Media and Sport), during which period he was occasionally referred to as the &quot;Minister for Fun&quot; after comments he made to the waiting press on leaving 10 Downing Street on his appointment.

===Resignation===
In July 1992 Mellor&#x27;s former mistress, actress Antonia de Sancha, sold her &quot;kiss and tell&quot; story of Mellor&#x27;s extra-marital affair with her for £35,000. Their telephone conversations had been secretly recorded by de Sancha&#x27;s landlord, an activity which at the time was legal in England. &quot;The Sun&quot;, relying on material supplied by the publicist Max Clifford, made a number of untrue claims about the relationship, that de Sancha later admitted. This was subsequently confirmed by David Mellor in 2011 at the Leveson Inquiry into Press Behaviour.

The Prime Minister John Major supported Mellor, but the media maintained their interest. A libel case brought by Mona Bauwens against &quot;The People&quot;, which came to the High Court in September 1992, led to the revelation that Mellor had accepted the gift of a month-long holiday in Marbella from Bauwens for his family, which took place in August 1990. Mellor&#x27;s connection to Bauwens, the daughter of Jaweed al-Ghussein, the finance director of the PLO (formally the Palestine National Fund), maintained the pressure on him. Mellor resigned on 24 September 1992.

===Defeat at 1997 general election===
Mellor contested the 1997 general election, but was defeated by the Labour Party&#x27;s Tony Colman as one of the most notable Tory casualties as Labour won by a landslide to end nearly 20 years of Conservative government. The election night was memorable for Mellor&#x27;s showdown with the Referendum Party founder Sir James Goldsmith: Mellor was taunted by Goldsmith and Michael Yardley, the Spokesperson for the Sportsman&#x27;s Alliance (who gave him a slow hand clap and shouted &quot;Out! Out! Out!&quot;) during Mellor&#x27;s concession speech. Mellor retorted:

Goldsmith would die from pancreatic cancer two months later on 18 July 1997.

==After Parliament==
Mellor was chairman of the incoming Labour government&#x27;s &#x27;Football Task Force&#x27; from August 1997 until its dissolution in 1999. Among the recommendations accepted by the Labour government and introduced into law was the criminalisation of racial abuse by an individual spectator, as distinct from a group.

Mellor has also pursued a career in journalism, and has written columns for six national newspapers including the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The People&quot;, often on current affairs, but also his specialist interests of sport and the arts. He regularly presented football-related programmes on BBC Radio 5 until 2001, and classical music programmes on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 3 for six years.

Since 2000, Mellor has also been a radio presenter at Classic FM. He is an opera and classical music critic for the newspaper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. He is a regular contributor to the radio station LBC, on which he previously co-hosted a Saturday morning politics and current affairs discussion programme for eight years with former London Mayor Ken Livingstone. This continued until 2016, when Livingstone was sacked and Mellor&#x27;s contract was not renewed.

In June 2010, it was reported in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Mellor called a chef a &quot;fat bastard&quot; during a licensing wrangle at the River Lounge restaurant near his home at St Katharine Docks, East London. The articles claimed Mellor used bad language and told the chef he should &quot;do his £10-an-hour job somewhere else&quot;.

In November 2014 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Mellor had been secretly recorded by a taxi driver, saying &quot;you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?&quot; In the secret recording of an encounter on 21 November, Mellor and the cab driver argue over which is the better route to their destination. The article alleged that he swore at the driver. Mellor later told the media that he regretted losing his temper but blamed the driver for provoking him.

==Private life==
Mellor married Judith Hall in Worthing on 20 July 1974. The couple had two sons before divorcing in 1995. Mellor lives with his partner, Penelope Lyttelton, Viscountess Cobham.

<doc id="356907" wikidata="Q333635" url="?curid=356907" title="John Gummer">
<text>John Selwyn Gummer, Baron Deben, FRASE (born 26 November 1939) is a British Conservative Party politician, formerly the Member of Parliament (MP) for Suffolk Coastal and Lewisham West, now a member of the House of Lords. He was Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1983 to 1985 and held various government posts including Secretary of State for the Environment from 1993 to 1997.

Gummer stood down from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election and was appointed to the House of Lords as Lord Deben.

Lord Deben was Chairman of the UK&#x27;s independent Climate Change Committee. He also chairs the sustainability consultancy Sancroft International, recycler Valpak, and PIMFA (Personal Investment &amp; Financial Advice Association). He is a director of &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; and the Castle Trust – a mortgage and investment firm. He is a trustee of climate change charity Cool Earth, alongside the ocean conservation charity, Blue Marine Foundation.

==Early life==

Gummer was born in Stockport, Cheshire. He is the eldest son of a Church of England priest, Canon Selwyn Gummer, and his younger brother is Peter Gummer, Baron Chadlington, a PR professional.

After being educated at King&#x27;s School, Rochester, Gummer studied History at Selwyn College, Cambridge. Whilst there, as chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and later President of the Cambridge Union Society, he was a member of what became known as the Cambridge Mafia – a group of future Conservative Cabinet ministers, including Leon Brittan, Michael Howard, Kenneth Clarke, Norman Lamont, and Norman Fowler.

==Public life==

===Elections===
First elected to Parliament at the 1970 general election, where he defeated sitting MP James Dickens in Lewisham West, Gummer had previously contested Greenwich in 1964 and 1966. He was unseated in February 1974 by Labour&#x27;s Christopher Price who achieved a 3.4% swing compared with a 1.3% swing to Labour nationally, deciding not to stand for the seat in the second election that year.

In 1979, he returned to the House of Commons, securing Eye in Suffolk, following the retirement of veteran Tory MP Harwood Harrison. He held the constituency and its successor Suffolk Coastal until his retirement from the Commons in 2010.

===In government===
Gummer was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture in Edward Heath&#x27;s government, before being appointed Conservative Party Vice-Chairman – a position he held until the government&#x27;s fall in 1974. Following his return to the House in the 1979 election, he held various government posts and was Conservative Party Chairman from 1983 to 1985 – an office he held at the time of the Brighton hotel bombing during the 1984 Conservative Party conference. He joined the Cabinet in 1989 as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, moving to become Secretary of State for the Environment under John Major in 1993.

As Environment Secretary he introduced the Environment Act 1995 and the Landfill Tax, which was the first such environmental tax in the UK. The &quot;BBC Wildlife&quot; magazine described Gummer as the &quot;Environment Secretary against which all others are judged&quot;, placing him as one of its top ten environmental heroes. In 1997, he was also awarded the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Medal, and was described by Friends of the Earth as &quot;the best Environment Secretary we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;.

He had responsibility for food safety during the mad cow disease epidemic in 1989–90 which eventually claimed 178 British lives. At the height of the crisis in May 1990, he attempted to refute the growing evidence for BSE/Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease by offering his four-year-old daughter Cordelia a burger in front of press cameras, which she declined but he consumed during a constituency event.

Gummer opposed the reduction of beds at the Aldeburgh Cottage Hospital in July 2005.

===In opposition===

Gummer managed to hold onto his seat in the 1997 Labour landslide victory, albeit with a much reduced majority of 3,254. He subsequently became a backbencher and chairman of the All-Party Group on Architecture and Planning. During this time he pursued environmental causes, introducing an Early Day Motion on global warming to Parliament along with Michael Meacher and Norman Baker. He was also instrumental in the passing of the Climate Change Act of 2008.

Because of his environmental credentials, in 2005 David Cameron asked Gummer to chair the Quality of Life Policy Group with Zac Goldsmith as his deputy.

In 2009, Gummer was involved in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, after claiming £36,000 for gardening over four years, as a parliamentary expense. Although the claims were encouraged and initially approved by the Parliamentary Fees Office, rules state claims should only be made on expenses essential to parliamentary duties. He repaid £11,538 for gardening and household bills and donated £11,500 to charity, saying that he was paying above the minimum required in order to demonstrate &quot;corporate social responsibility&quot; for the expenses system. Subsequently, the Legg Report showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay some money with Gummer paying the seventh highest figure.

===House of Lords===
It was announced that Gummer would be awarded a peerage in the 2010 Dissolution Honours List. On 21 June he was created a Life Peer as Baron Deben, &quot;of Winston in the County of Suffolk&quot;. He takes his title from the River Deben. He was introduced in the House of Lords the same day, supported by his brother, Lord Chadlington, and the composer Lord Lloyd-Webber.

As a pro-European moderate, Lord Deben supported Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s leadership bids.

In September 2012, Lord Deben was confirmed as Chairman of the UK&#x27;s independent Committee on Climate Change, succeeding Lord Turner. The committee advises the UK Government on setting and meeting carbon budgets and on preparing for the impacts of climate change. He was due to step down at the end of June 2023.

==Personal life==

Lord Deben has been married to Penelope Gardner since 1977, and lives at Winston Grange, a Grade II listed property in Suffolk. They have four children, including Ben Gummer, who was MP for Ipswich from 2010, until he lost his seat in 2017.

He converted to the Catholic Church in 1992, having previously been a practising Anglican and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England. He has supported the creation of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham for former Anglicans who have, like him, joined the Catholic Church, including serving as an Honorary Vice-President of the Friends of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.
In July 2018 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the University of East Anglia.

<doc id="356908" wikidata="Q1353201" url="?curid=356908" title="Canadian Rockies">
<text>The Canadian Rockies () or Canadian Rocky Mountains, comprising both the Alberta Rockies and the British Columbian Rockies, is the Canadian segment of the North American Rocky Mountains. It is the easternmost part of the Canadian Cordillera, which is the northern segment of the North American Cordillera, the expansive system of interconnected mountain ranges between the Interior Plains and the Pacific Coast that runs northwest–southeast from central Alaska to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico.

Canada officially defines the Rocky Mountains system as the mountain chains east of the Rocky Mountain Trench extending from the Liard River valley in northern British Columbia to the Albuquerque Basin in New Mexico, not including the Mackenzie, Richardson and British Mountains/Brooks Range in Yukon and Alaska (which are all included as the &quot;Arctic Rockies&quot; in the United States&#x27; definition of the Rocky Mountains system). The Canadian Rockies, being the northern segment of this chain, is thus defined as comprising the central-eastern section of the North American Cordillera, between the Prairies of Alberta and the Liard Plain of northeastern British Columbia to the east and the Interior Mountains/Plateau and Columbia Mountains to the west. It is divided into the Northern Rockies (which is further subdivided into the Muskwa and Hart Ranges) and Continental Ranges, separated by the McGregor River valley, the McGregor Pass and the Kakwa River valley.

The southern end of the Canadian Rockies extends into the U.S. state of Montana at various sites such as the Wilson Range, Upper Waterton Lake, Boundary Creek, Cameron Lake, Forum Peak, Long Knife Peak, North Fork Flathead River and Frozen Lake. In geographic terms, the boundary is at the Canada–United States border on 49th parallel north, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana.

The Canadian Rockies have numerous high peaks and ranges, such as Mount Robson () and Mount Columbia (). The Canadian Rockies are composed of shale and limestone. Much of the range is protected by national and provincial parks, several of which collectively comprise a World Heritage Site.

== Geography ==
The Canadian Rockies are the easternmost part of the Canadian Cordillera, the collective name for the mountains of Western Canada. They form part of the American Cordillera, an essentially continuous sequence of mountain ranges that runs all the way from Alaska to the very tip of South America. The Cordillera, in turn, is the eastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire that runs all the way around the Pacific Ocean.
The Canadian Rockies are bounded on the east by the Canadian Prairies, on the west by the Rocky Mountain Trench, and on the north by the Liard River. Contrary to popular misconception, the Rockies do not extend north into Yukon or Alaska, or west into central British Columbia. North of the Liard River, the Mackenzie Mountains, which are a distinct mountain range, form a portion of the border between the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. The mountain ranges to the west of the Rocky Mountain Trench in southern British Columbia are called the Columbia Mountains, and are not considered to be part of the Rockies by Canadian geologists.

=== Highest peaks ===
Mount Robson () is the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, but not the highest in British Columbia, since there are some higher mountains in the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains. Mount Robson lies on the continental divide near Yellowhead Pass, one of the lowest passes in the Canadian Rockies, and is close to the Yellowhead Highway. Its base is above sea level, with a total vertical relief of .

Mount Columbia () is the second-highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, and is the highest mountain in Alberta.

Snow Dome () is one of two hydrological apexes of North America. Water flows off Snow Dome into three different watersheds, into the Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean via Hudson Bay.

The Canadian Rockies are not the highest mountain ranges in Canada. Both the Saint Elias Mountains (highest point in Canada Mount Logan at ) and the Coast Mountains (highest point Mount Waddington at ) have higher summits.

===Mountain ranges===

The Canadian Rockies are subdivided into numerous mountain ranges, structured in two main groupings, the Continental Ranges, which has three main subdivisions, the Front Range, Park Ranges and Kootenay Ranges, and the Northern Rockies which comprise two main groupings, the Hart Ranges and the Muskwa Ranges. The division-point of the two main groupings is at Monkman Pass northwest of Mount Robson and to the southwest of Mount Ovington.

==Rivers==

The Canadian Rockies are noted for being the source of several major river systems, and also for the many rivers within the range itself. The Rockies form the divide between the Pacific Ocean drainage on the west and that of Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean on the east. Of the range&#x27;s rivers, only the Peace River penetrates the range. Notable rivers originating in the Canadian Rockies include the Fraser, Columbia, North Saskatchewan, Bow and Athabasca Rivers.

==Geology==
The Canadian Rockies are quite different in appearance and geology from the American Rockies to the south of them. The Canadian Rockies are composed of layered sedimentary rock such as limestone and shale, whereas the American Rockies are made mostly of metamorphic and igneous rock such as gneiss and granite.

The Canadian Rockies are overall more jagged than the American Rockies, because the Canadian Rockies have been more heavily glaciated, resulting in sharply pointed mountains separated by wide, U-shaped valleys gouged by glaciers, whereas the American Rockies are overall more rounded, with river-carved V-shaped valleys between them. The Canadian Rockies are cooler and wetter, giving them moister soil, bigger rivers, and more glaciers. The tree line is much lower in the Canadian Rockies than in the American Rockies.

==Parks==
Five national parks are located within the Canadian Rockies, four of which are adjacent and make up the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks. These four parks are Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho. The fifth national park, Waterton Lakes, is not adjacent to the others. Waterton Lakes lies farther south, straddling the Canada–US border as the Canadian part of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. The four adjacent parks, combined with three British Columbia provincial parks, were declared a single UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 for the unique mountain landscapes found there.

Numerous provincial parks are located in the Canadian Rockies, including Hamber, Mount Assiniboine and Mount Robson parks.

Throughout the Rockies, and especially in the national parks, the Alpine Club of Canada maintains a series of alpine huts for use by mountaineers and adventurers.

==Human history==
===The Rockies and the Canadian Pacific Railway===
The Canadian Pacific Railway was founded to provide a link from the province of British Columbia to the eastern provinces. The main difficulty in providing such a link were the Rockies themselves: treacherous mountain passes, fast rivers and sheer drops made for a difficult railway construction process. The following articles describe in detail the political and technical feats involved:
*Canadian Pacific Survey
*Big Hill
*Field Hill
*Kicking Horse Pass

<doc id="356910" wikidata="Q1401509" url="?curid=356910" title="List of mountains on Io">
<text>More than 135 mountains have been identified on the surface of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io. Despite the extensive active volcanism taking place on Io, most mountains on Io are formed through tectonic processes. These structures average 6 km (4 mi) in height and reach a maximum of 17.5 ± 1.5 km (10.9 ± 1 mi) at South Boösaule Montes. Mountains often appear as large (the average mountain is 157 km (98 mi) long), isolated structures with no apparent global tectonic patterns outlined, in contrast to the situation on Earth. To support the tremendous topography observed at these mountains requires rock compositions consisting mostly of silicate, as opposed to sulfur.

Mountains on Io (generally, structures rising above the surrounding plains) have a variety of morphologies. Plateaus are most common. These structures resemble large, flat-topped mesas with rugged surfaces. Other mountains appear to be tilted crustal blocks, with a shallow slope from the formerly flat surface and a steep slope consisting of formerly sub-surface materials uplifted by compressive stresses. Both types of mountains often have steep scarps along one or more margins. Only a handful of mountains on Io appear to have a volcanic origin. These mountains resemble small shield volcanoes, with steep slopes (6–7°) near a small, central caldera and shallow slopes along their margins. These volcanic mountains are often smaller than the average mountain on Io, averaging only 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 mi) in height and 40 to 60 km (25 to 37 mi) wide. Other shield volcanoes with much shallower slopes are inferred from the morphology of several of Io&#x27;s volcanoes, where thin flows radiate out from a central patera, such as at Ra Patera.

Some of Io&#x27;s mountains have received official names from the International Astronomical Union. The names are a combination of a name of a person or place derived from the Greek mythological story of Io, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, or from the name of a nearby feature on Io surface and an approved descriptive term. The descriptive terms, or categories, used for these mountains depends on their morphology, which is a reflection of the mountain&#x27;s age, geologic origin (volcanic or tectonic), and mass wasting processes. Mountains consisting of massifs, ridges, or isolated peaks use the descriptive term, &quot;mons&quot; or the plural &quot;montes&quot;, the Latin term for mountain. These features are named after prominent locations from the Greek mythological travels of Io or places mentioned in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. Plateaus are normally given the descriptive term &quot;mensa&quot; (pl. &quot;mensae&quot;), the Latin term for mesa, though some mountains with plateau morphology use &quot;mons&quot;. Ionian mensae are named after mythological figures associated with the Io myth, characters from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. Like mountains, these features can also be named after nearby volcanoes. Some units of layered plains have names using the descriptive term &quot;planum&quot; (pl. &quot;plana&quot;). However other more mountainous structures, such as Danube Planum, use the term. Partly as a result of the inconsistent use of this term, &quot;planum&quot; has not been used since the Voyager era. Ionian plana are named after locations associated with the Io myth. Rare cases of volcanic mountains, such as the shield volcano Tsũi Goab Tholus, use the term &quot;tholus&quot; (plural: &quot;tholi&quot;). Ionian tholi are named after people associated with the Io myth or nearby features on Io&#x27;s surface.

== List of named Ionian mountains ==

The following table lists those positive topographic structures (mountains, plateaus, shield volcanoes, and layered plains) that have been given names by the International Astronomical Union. Coordinates and Length come from the USGS website that hosts that nomenclature list. Height information from Paul Schenk&#x27;s 2001 paper, &quot;The mountains of Io: Global and geological perspectives from Voyager and Galileo&quot;. When the name refers to multiple mountains, the tallest peak from Schenk &quot;et al.&quot; 2001 is listed. Those whose heights come from another sources are noted and sourced in the table. Height ranges result from uncertainties due to different methods used to determine the height of the mountain.

<text>James Michael Leathes Prior, Baron Prior, (11 October 1927 – 12 December 2016) was a British Conservative Party politician. A Member of Parliament from 1959 to 1987, he represented the Suffolk constituency of Lowestoft until 1983 and then the renamed constituency of Waveney from 1983 to 1987, when he stood down from the House of Commons and was made a life peer. He served in two Conservative cabinets, and outside parliament was Chairman of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce from 1996 to 2004, and Chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University from 1992 to 1999.

Under Edward Heath, Prior was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1970 to 1972, then Leader of the House of Commons until Heath lost office in the wake of the February 1974 election. His party returned to power under Margaret Thatcher in 1979, and Prior was Secretary of State for Employment from 1979 to 1981, disagreeing with some of her views on trade unions and her monetarist economic policies generally. This made him a leader of the so-called &quot;wet&quot; faction in the Conservative ranks. In 1981 he was moved to the less pivotal role of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, from which he stood down in 1984; he never returned to government.

== Early life and career ==
Prior was born in Norwich, the son of solicitor Charles Bolingbroke Leathes Prior (1883–1964) and Aileen Sophia Mary (1893–1978), daughter of barrister Charles Storey Gilman. Charles Prior&#x27;s uncle was head of the family of Prior of Adstock Manor, Bletchley, Buckinghamshire; the family was closely related to the Lake baronets, the Stuart-Menteth baronets, the Blackett family of Wylam, Northumberland, and the Prideaux-Brune family of Prideaux Place, Cornwall. Prior was educated at Orwell Park School, then at Charterhouse School before going on to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he earned a first class honours degree in Land economy. Also prior to entering university, he performed his two-year National Service as an officer in the Royal Norfolk Regiment of the British Army, serving in Germany and India.

He was first elected to Parliament in 1959, and was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1970 to 1972, then Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council until March 1974. He was one of several unsuccessful candidates in the Conservative Party&#x27;s 1975 leadership election, entering at the second round and gaining 19 votes to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s 146.

== Cabinet years ==
Under Margaret Thatcher he was Secretary of State for Employment from May 1979 to 14 September 1981. Thatcher said of their relationship, &quot;we agreed that trade unions had acquired far too many powers and privileges. We also agreed that these must be dealt with one step at a time. But when it came down to specific measures, there was deep disagreement about how fast and how far to move.&quot;

Prior is believed to have annoyed Thatcher by being too friendly with trade union leaders, with Thatcher writing,
 

During his period in the Cabinet, he is believed to have angered the right wing of his party and the Prime Minister for not pressing far enough with anti-trade union legislation. In the September 1981 cabinet reshuffle Prior was moved from the Employment portfolio to become Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, an office he held until September 1984. At the time of the reshuffle, it was reported that Prior considered following the sacked Ian Gilmour to the back benches to oppose the Thatcher Government&#x27;s economic policies. However, Prior ultimately decided to accept being moved to the Northern Ireland Office after consulting cabinet colleagues William Whitelaw, then Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, and Francis Pym. This transfer was widely seen as a move by Thatcher to isolate Prior, who disagreed with her on a number of economic issues. The post of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was seen as a dumping ground to marginalise ministers. However, when Prior resigned, Thatcher revealed that she was going to offer him another Cabinet post during the reshuffle, which would have very likely been a non-economic one.

== Later years ==
In 1986, he collaborated with John Cassels and Pauline Perry to create the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE), which would become the National Centre for Universities and Business in 2013. He also released a memoir, &quot;A balance of power&quot;.

He retired from Parliament in 1987, and was created a life peer as Baron Prior, of Brampton in the County of Suffolk, on 14 October 1987.

He was chairman and later vice-president of the Rural Housing Trust from 1990 to 1999.

In 1992 he was appointed chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University and held that position until 1999. He was made Honorary Doctor of the University at Anglia Ruskin University in 1992.

Following his retirement from politics he was much sought after in the world of business: he served as chairman of both GEC and Allders, and had directorships at Barclays, Sainsbury&#x27;s and United Biscuits.

Prior was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot; and in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

== Personal life and death ==
In January 1954, Prior married Jane Primrose Gifford Lywood, daughter of Air Vice-Marshal Oswyn George William Gifford Lywood, CB, CBE, a developer of the Typex cypher machines, of a landed gentry family of Woodlands, near Sevenoaks, Kent. They were married until her death in 2015, and had four children. Their eldest son David Prior held the seat of North Norfolk between 1997 and 2001, and was appointed Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for NHS Productivity; he was later, in May 2015, elevated to the peerage in his own right as Baron Prior of Brampton.

Lord Prior lived at the Old Hall in Brampton, Suffolk, where he died from cancer on 12 December 2016, at the age of 89.

Following Prior&#x27;s death, Keith Simpson MP said of him: &quot;In many ways he was a larger than life figure. He had a ruddy face, he played up to being the farmer. People underestimated him because he didn&#x27;t claim to be a Keith Joseph or Enoch Powell parading their intellectualism. But he was somebody who was well-loved by the grassroots and was a decent man who was in politics out of a sense of public service.&quot;

<text>Bare-knuckle boxing (also known as bare-knuckle or bare-knuckle fighting) is a full-contact combat sport based on punching without any form of padding on the hands. The sport as it is known today originated in 17th-century England and differs from street fighting as it follows an accepted set of rules.

The rules that provided the foundation for bare-knuckle boxing for much of the 18th and 19th centuries were the London Prize Ring Rules. By the late 19th century, professional boxing moved from bare-knuckle to using boxing gloves. The last major world heavyweight championship held under bare-knuckle boxing rules happened in 1889 and was held by John L. Sullivan. The American &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; magazine was recognized as sanctioning the world championship titles.

Bare-knuckle boxing has seen a resurgence in the 21st century with English promoters such as Bare Knuckle Boxing (BKB) in Coventry and Ultimate Bare Knuckle Boxing (UBKB) in Warrington, as well as American promoters Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) in Philadelphia and BYB Extreme (BYB) in Miami.

==Early history==
The sport as it is known today originated in England. According to the boxing chronicle &quot;Pugilistica&quot;, the first newspaper report of a boxing match in England dates from 1681, when the &quot;Protestant Mercury&quot; stated: &quot;Yesterday a match of boxing was performed before his Grace the Duke of Albemarle, between the Duke&#x27;s footman and a butcher. The latter won the prize, as he hath done many before, being accounted, though but a little man, the best at that exercise in England.&quot;
The first bare-knuckle champion of England was James Figg, who claimed the title in 1719 and held it until his retirement in 1730. Before Jack Broughton, the first idea of current boxing originated from James Figg, who is viewed as the organizer of cutting edge boxing. In 1719, he set up a &#x27;pugilistic foundation&#x27; and charged himself as &#x27;a professional in the Noble Science of Defense&#x27; to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff. Noted champions were Jack Broughton, Elizabeth Wilkinson, Daniel Mendoza, Jem Belcher, Hen Pearce, John Gully, Tom Cribb, Tom Spring, Jem Ward, James Burke, William &quot;Bendigo&quot; Thompson, Ben Caunt, William Perry, Tom Sayers and Jem Mace.

The record for the longest bare-knuckle fight is listed as 6 hours and 15 minutes for a match between James Kelly and Jonathan Smith, fought near Fiery Creek in Australia on December 3, 1855, when Smith gave in after 17 rounds.

The bare-knuckle fighter Jem Mace is listed as having the longest professional career of any fighter in history. He fought for more than 35 years into his 60s, and recorded his last exhibition bout in 1909 at the age of 78.

Professional bare-knuckle boxing was never legal under any federal or state laws in the United States until Wyoming became the first to legalize on March 20, 2018. Prior to that date, the chief sanctioning organization for bare-knuckle boxing was the magazine &quot;National Police Gazette&quot;, which set up matches and issued championship belts throughout the 1880s. &quot;The Police Gazette&quot; sanctioned what is considered the last major bare-knuckle heavyweight world championship, between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain on July 8, 1889, with Sullivan emerging as the victor.

Other noted champions were Tom Hyer, Yankee Sullivan, Nonpareil Dempsey, Tom Sharkey, Bob Fitzsimmons, and John Morrissey.

===Rules===
Classical pugilism began to adopt rules by the mid-1700s to decrease cases of injuries and death, while also showcasing the sport as a respectable athletic endeavor. There were three rules that were adopted during that time until the acceptance of modern gloved boxing.
* Broughton Rules: The first set of rules devised by champion Jack Broughton in 1743. Under Broughton&#x27;s rules, a round continued until a man went down; after 30 seconds he had to face his opponent (square off), standing no more than a yard (about a metre) away, or be declared beaten. Hitting a downed opponent was also forbidden.
* London Prize Ring Rules: A new set of rules initiated by the British Pugilists’ Protective Association in 1838 and further revised in 1853. The new rules provided for a ring 24 feet (7.32 metres) square bounded by two ropes. When a fighter went down, the round ended, and he was helped to his corner. The next round would begin 30 seconds later, with each boxer required to reach, unaided, a mark in the centre of the ring. If a fighter could not reach that mark by the end of 8 additional seconds, he was declared the loser. Kicking, gouging, butting with the head, biting, and low blows were all declared fouls.
* Marquess of Queensberry Rules: Another set of rules that was codified by John Graham Chambers of the Amateur Athletic Club and patronized by John Sholto Douglas, the 9th marquess of Queensberry, in 1867. The new rules added restrictions that continued in boxing to the modern day, such as fighters having to wear padded gloves, a round being consisted of three minutes of fighting followed by a minute of rest, wrestling becoming illegal, and any fighter who went down had to get up unaided within 10 seconds. If a fighter was unable to get up, he was declared knocked out, and the fight was over. During this period the introduction of the first weight divisions also took place.

==Techniques==
Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits and no referee, resulting in very chaotic fights. An early account of boxing was published in Nottingham in 1713 by Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet, a landowner in Bunny, Nottinghamshire, who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, &quot;Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler&quot;, described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws that are not recognised in boxing today. Consequently, there were no round limits to fights. When a man could not come to scratch, he would be declared loser and the fight would be brought to a halt. Fights could also end if broken up beforehand by crowd riot, police interference or chicanery, or if both men were willing to accept that the contest was a draw. While fights could have enormous numbers of rounds, the rounds in practice could be quite short with fighters pretending to go down from minor blows to take advantage of the 30-second rest period.

Even though Broughton&#x27;s era brought rules to make boxing more civilized, there were still many moves in this era that are illegal in today&#x27;s gloved boxing. That being said, there were also new revolutionary techniques that were formulated during this time. Grappling was allowed and many favored the use of cross-buttocks throw and suplexes, although grabs below the waist were illegal. Clinching, known as chancery, were also legal and in-use. Fibbing, where a boxer grabs hold of an opponent by the neck or hair and pummels him multiple times, were allowed. The traditional bare-knuckle boxing stance was actually designed to combat against the use of grappling as well as block punching. Kicking was also allowed in boxing at that time, with William &quot;Bendigo&quot; Thompson being an expert in kicks during his fight with Ben Caunt, and the Lancanshire Navigator using purring kicks in his battle with Tom Cribb.

It was during classical pugilism where many famous boxing techniques were invented. Samuel Elias was the first to invent a punch that would later become known as the uppercut. Tom Spring popularized the use of the left hook and created a technique called the &quot;Harlequin Step&quot; where he would put himself just within reach of his opponent, then avoiding the instinctive punch while simultaneously delivering one himself, basically inventing the boxing feint. Daniel Mendoza would become the inventor of the outboxer-style of boxing.

===Irish stand down===

The &quot;Irish stand down&quot; is a type of traditional bare-knuckle fighting where the aspect of maneuvering around the ring is removed, leaving only the less nuanced aspects of punching and &quot;taking&quot; punches. This form of combat was popular in Irish-American ghettos in the late 19th century but was eclipsed in the community first by bare-knuckle boxing and then later by regulation boxing. The Irish stand down is also known as strap fighting or toe to toe.

==Modern bare-knuckle boxing==
After more than a century, bare-knuckle boxing returned legally to the UK in Kettering on 29 June 2015. The show was promoted by UBBAD, headed by Joe Smith-Brown and Jim Freeman. They discovered that, by law, fighters would have to wear hand wraps in order to compete in bare-knuckle contests legally.  

With the resurgence of bare-knuckle boxing in the 21st century, several modifications have been made to classical rules that controlled historical bare-knuckle boxing. Additionally, there are several changes from the Marquess of Queensberry Rules. Most notably, there is an 18-second count on any knockdown in the BKB, although the BKFC and BYB Extreme use the traditional 10-count. In most modern bare-knuckle promotions, there is no three-knockdown rule and fighters cannot be saved by the bell. Fights consists of 5 rounds of 2 minutes in BKFC, both for non-title and title fights. In BKB and BYB Extreme, non-title fights are 5 rounds of 3 minutes while title fights are 7 rounds of 3 minutes. Female fights in both BKB and BYB Extreme are shortened to two-minute rounds. One of the distinguishing characteristics of modern bare-knuckle boxing is the inclusion of punching in the clinch, also known as &quot;dirty boxing&quot;. In BKB, punching in the clinch is prohibited and fights can range from 3 rounds of 3 minutes to 7 rounds of 3 minutes. 

In October 2021, BKFC Thailand (later renamed BKFC Asia) was established as the officially licensed branch of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) in Asia. It hosted its first event, titled &quot;BKFC Thailand 1: The Game Changer&quot; on December 18, 2021, at the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall in Pattaya. BKFC Thailand became the first promotion to receive full licensing and sanctioning for bare-knuckle boxing in Thailand and Asia.

On 26 February 2022, Swedish fighter Mathilda Wilson defeated English fighter (and late replacement) Taylor Reeves in the UK&#x27;s first legal female bare-knuckle fight in the modern era. The bout was held in Wolverhampton and was sanctioned and governed by the International Sport Kickboxing Association, with Wilson winning by first-round TKO to become the first Scandinavian woman ever to compete professionally in bare-knuckle boxing.

In September 2022, it was announced that Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship had acquired the UK organisation Bare Fist Boxing Association (BFBA) to form Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship UK (BKFC UK). The move meant that BKFC would now regularly hold shows throughout the United Kingdom.

=== Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship rules ===
# Fighters are permitted to wrap and tape the wrist, thumb, and mid-hand. No gauze or tape can be within of the knuckles.
# Fighters will &quot;toe the line&quot;. There are two lines, apart, in the center of the ring where the fighters will start each round. The front foot will be on the line, and the referee will instruct the fighters to &quot;knuckle up&quot;, which indicates the beginning of the bout/round.
# Punches are the only strike allowed and must be with a closed fist (no kicks, elbows, knees or grappling).
# In the clinch, the fighter may punch his way out with the open hand. If there is a three-second lull in action while clinching, the referee will break the fighters.
# A fighter who is knocked down will have 10 seconds to return to his feet, or the referee will stop the fight. It is not permitted to hit a downed fighter. Any fighter who does will be disqualified, and the purse will be withheld. While a fighter is downed, the other fighter will be instructed to report to a neutral space.
# If a fighter is cut and the blood is impairing a fighter&#x27;s vision, the referee may call a timeout to give the cutman 30 seconds to stop the bleeding. If the blood cannot be controlled and the blood inhibits the fighter&#x27;s vision, the referee will stop the fight and award victory to the other fighter.
# Fights are two minutes per round and each bout will be 3 or 5 rounds in length. In BKB can be 3, 5 or 7.
# All fighters must wear a groin protector with a cup, a mouthpiece, trunks or boxing trunks, and boxing/wrestling shoes.
# All fighters are expected to give 100% effort and behave with complete sportsmanship.

<text>Maurice Victor Macmillan, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden, (27 January 1921 – 10 March 1984), was a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament. He was the only son of Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963.

==Background and education==
Macmillan was the only son of Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton, and Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He served with the Sussex Yeomanry in Europe in the Second World War. Like his father, he was chairman of Macmillan Publishers, as well as a director of two news agencies.

==Political career==
Macmillan contested Seaham at the 1945 election, Lincoln in 1951 and Wakefield at a 1954 by-election. He served on Kensington Borough Council from 1949 to 1953, then was elected MP for Halifax at the 1955 general election but lost this seat in 1964. He was then elected for Farnham in 1966. This latter seat became South West Surrey at the 1983 election. He served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury (1963–64) under Alec Douglas-Home, and as Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1970–72), Secretary of State for Employment (1972–73) and Paymaster General (1973–74) under Edward Heath. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1972.

==Family==
Macmillan married the Honourable Katharine Ormsby-Gore, daughter of William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech, on 22 August 1942. They had four sons and a daughter:

*Alexander Daniel Alan Macmillan, 2nd Earl of Stockton (born 10 October 1943)
*Hon. Joshua Edward Andrew Macmillan (1945–1965)
*Hon. Adam Julian Robert Macmillan (1948–2016)
*Hon. Rachel Mary Georgia Macmillan (1955–1987)
*Hon. David Maurice Benjamin Macmillan (born 1957); married English fashion designer Arabella Pollen in 1995 and has issue.

Macmillan was for a time the owner of Highgrove House, which he sold to the Prince of Wales in 1980. Upon his father&#x27;s elevation to the peerage as Earl of Stockton on 24 February 1984, Macmillan acquired the courtesy title Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden. He held the title for just days, dying in Westminster, London, on 10 March 1984, following a heart operation. He was 63. His father outlived him by almost three years, dying in December 1986 at the age of 92.

Macmillan&#x27;s son Alexander has held the title 2nd Earl of Stockton since the death of the first Earl.

As of 2020, the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature has officially named a total of 142 craters on Callisto, more than on any other non-planetary object such as Ganymede (131), Rhea (128), Vesta (90), Ceres (90), Dione (73), Iapetus (58), Enceladus (53), Tethys (50) and Europa (41). Although some Callistoan craters refer to the nymph Callisto from Greek mythology, they are officially named after characters from myths and folktales of cultures of the Far North.

<doc id="356925" wikidata="Q900744" url="?curid=356925" title="Semiramide">
<text>Semiramide () is an opera in two acts by Gioachino Rossini.
The libretto by Gaetano Rossi is based on Voltaire&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Semiramis&quot;, which in turn was based on the legend of Semiramis of Assyria. The opera was first performed at La Fenice in Venice on 3 February 1823.

&quot;Semiramide&quot; was Rossini&#x27;s final Italian opera and according to Richard Osborne, &quot;could well be dubbed &quot;Tancredi Revisited&quot;&quot;. As in &quot;Tancredi&quot;, Rossi&#x27;s libretto was based on a Voltaire tragedy. The music took the form of a return to vocal traditions of Rossini&#x27;s youth, and was a melodrama in which he &quot;recreated the baroque tradition of decorative singing with unparalleled skill&quot;. The ensemble-scenes (particularly the duos between Arsace and Semiramide) and choruses are of a high order, as is the orchestral writing, which makes full use of a large pit.

After this splendid work, one of his finest in the genre, Rossini turned his back on Italy and moved to Paris. Apart from &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot;, which is still in Italian, his last operas were either original compositions in French or extensively reworked adaptations into French of earlier Italian operas.

Musicologist Rodolfo Celletti sums up the importance of &quot;Semiramide&quot; by stating that it &quot;was the last opera of the great Baroque tradition: the most beautiful, the most imaginative, possibly the most complete; but also, irremediably, the last.&quot;

==Composition history==
After making his mark with a number of brilliant comic operas (most notably &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;), Rossini turned more and more to serious opera (&quot;opere serie&quot;). During the years 1813 (when Rossini composed &quot;Tancredi&quot;) until 1822 he wrote a considerable series of them, mostly for the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples&quot;.

One reason for his new interest in the serious genre was his connection with the great dramatic soprano Isabella Colbran, who was first his mistress, then his wife. She created the leading female roles in &quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; (1815), &quot;Otello&quot; (1816), &quot;Armida&quot; (1817), &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot; (1818), &quot;Maometto II&quot; (1820), and five other Rossini operas up to and including his final contribution to the genre, &quot;Semiramide&quot;, which was also written with Colbran in the major role.

Work began with the librettist in October 1822, composer and librettist taking Voltaire&#x27;s story and making significant changes. Actual composition took Rossini 33 days to complete the score.

==Performance history==
===19th century===

Following its premiere, the opera was given twenty-eight times for the rest of the season in Venice (and, at some point, for four nights in a row) and it went on to presentations throughout Italy and Europe, including Paris in 1825, Milan in 1829 and 1831, and Vienna in 1830. It reached London on 15 July 1824, was given its US premiere at the St. Charles Theatre in New Orleans on 1 May 1837, but it took until 3 January 1845, before it was performed in New York.

Other prima donnas emerged in the major roles by about 1825, since Colbran&#x27;s vocal powers had greatly diminished by the time of the Venice premiere performances and she &quot;was in no state to ever sing the role again&quot;. For 25 years after 1830, Giulia Grisi triumphed in the role notably in St Petersburg in 1849 and New York in 1854.

By the late 1800s, the opera had virtually disappeared from the repertoire. However, it was chosen in 1880 to inaugurate the Teatro Costanzi, new venue of the Rome Opera company, and appeared as part of the Cincinnati Opera Festival 1882 which was attended by Oscar Wilde and which featured the famous diva Adelina Patti who chose the aria &quot;Bel raggio lusinghiero&quot; for her farewell performance. The Metropolitan Opera revived &quot;Semiramide&quot; in 1892, 1894 (with Nellie Melba), and 1895.

===20th century and beyond===
It took until 1932 until the opera was again revived (in a German translation) in Rostock, and it then reappeared under Tullio Serafin at the 1940 Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.

Presentations at La Scala in Milan in December 1962 with Joan Sutherland and Giulietta Simionato required the re-assembly of the entire score from the Rossini autograph, since no other texts were known to exist.

Musicologist Philip Gossett noted that between 1962 and 1990 &quot;some seventy opera houses have included the work in one or more seasons&quot;. A major revival at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1980 was directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi and featured Montserrat Caballé in the title role with Marilyn Horne as Arsace. The same staging was then billed in sequence by the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa and by the Teatro Regio in Turin which had co-produced it, starring respectively Lella Cuberli/Martine Dupuy and Katia Ricciarelli/Lucia Valentini Terrani. It was not until the Met&#x27;s 1990 revival after almost 100 years that a production based on a new critical edition was mounted. It alternated Lella Cuberli and June Anderson in the title role with Marilyn Horne again as Arsace. Among other performances, the work was given by the Rossini in Wildbad Festival in 2012, which was recorded with Alex Penda in the title role. In November 2017, the Royal Opera House, London, mounted its first production of the opera since the 1890s, with Joyce DiDonato in the title role.

:Time: Antiquity or &quot;Some 2,000 Years before the Christian era&quot;
:Place: Babylon
Overture

&quot;Semiramide&quot; has its own overture, which was almost certainly composed last. Unlike many operatic overtures of the day, it borrowed musical ideas from the opera itself, thus making it unsuitable for use with another score. The range and balance of musical ideas, from the hushed, rhythmic opening through the Andantino for four horns (drawn from the opera itself) and the repetition with pizzicato countermelodies in the strings to the lively allegro, make the overture to &quot;Semiramide&quot; one of Rossini&#x27;s finest contributions to the genre and deservedly one of the most popular.

===Act 1===

&quot;Temple of Baal, Babylon&quot;

The High Priest Oroe invites all to enter the temple, and Babylonians (along with others from abroad, including Idreno the Indian King) do so carrying offerings to Baal. Assur states that the day has come for the Queen to choose a successor and he reminds all of his own valour. Idreno expresses surprise at Assur&#x27;s aspirations and all express their individual concerns and fears.

Semiramide enters to the acclaim of all, but Idreno and Assur individually speculate as to who will be chosen. They press the queen to announce her decision, but at the same time Semiramide herself is fearful about making that decision, especially as she appears to be expecting someone&#x27;s arrival. Suddenly, the temple is plunged into darkness and there is general consternation amidst fears of its imminent collapse. All desert the temple.

Arsace, a young warrior from Scythia, enters. He has been told by his dying father to go to the temple in Babylon, and he was also urgently sent for by Semiramide. He brings with him a casket belonging to his father, but he is puzzled as to why he has been called back to Babylon. He declares his love for Princess Azema who loves him though she has been promised to the dead King Nino&#x27;s lost son, Ninia. Arsace states his unwillingness to support Assur in his bid for the throne: (Scena and aria: &quot;Eccomi alfine in Babilonia... Ah! quel giorno ognor rammento&quot; / &quot;Here I am at last in Babylon... Oh, I shall ever remember the day of glory and happiness...&quot;).

Arsace asks to see the High Priest. Oroe enters, opens the casket, and exclaims upon seeing it that it contains the holy relics of the dead king. He hints to Arsace about some treachery that had been involved. Seeing Assur approach, Oroe leaves with the relics. Assur arrives and questions the reason for Arsace&#x27;s return. The two men discuss Azema, with Arsace reaffirming his love for her (Duet: &quot;Bella imago degli dei&quot; / &quot;Beautiful, divine image&quot;) while Assur states that he too loves her. &quot;You have no idea what love is&quot;, the younger man tells the older: (Aria/duet: &quot;D&#x27;un tenero amor&quot; / &quot;Of tender love...&quot;)
&quot;The entrance hall of the palace&quot;

Azema enters, happy that Arsace is now in Babylon. Idreno follows her and asks for her hand; she tells him that this must be Semiramide&#x27;s decision. &quot;What of your heart?&quot; he asks, assuming that his rival can only be Assur. Scornfully told that it will never be Assur, Idreno is comforted, although he expresses his desire &quot;to punish the wicked boldness of a rival&quot; and continues to express desire for Azema: (Aria: &quot;Ah, dov&#x27;è, dov&#x27;è il cimento?&quot; / &quot;Oh, where is it, where is the challenge?&quot;)

&quot;The Hanging Gardens&quot;

Having fallen in love with Arsace and believing that he loves her, Semiramide waits for his arrival: (Aria: &quot;Bel raggio lusinghier&quot; / &quot;Beautiful, enchanting ray&quot;). She receives a message from the Oracle, telling her that a wedding will make a new king. She believes this to be a sign from the gods that they approve of her plans, and orders preparations for a wedding. When Arsace arrives, he alludes to his love for Azema without specifically naming her, but he also declares that he will die for his queen if necessary. Semiramide still believes that he really loves her, and vows that she will give him all he desires: (Duet: &quot;Serbami ognor sì fido il cor&quot; / &quot;Always keep your heart this faithful to me&quot;). They leave separately.
&quot;The Palace Throne Room&quot;

All enter to await Semiramide&#x27;s arrival and her announcement of her choice of successor. Arsace, Idreno, Oroe, and Assur all swear to obey her command, no matter what she decides: (Ensemble: Semiramide, Arsace, Idreno, Oroe and Assur: ( &quot;Giuri ognuno, a&#x27; sommi Dei&quot; / &quot;Let everyone swear to the highest gods&quot;). She demands loyalty to the man she chooses, stating he will also be her own husband. When Semiramide names Arsace as her chosen one, Assur is outraged and Idreno accepts the decision but requests Azema&#x27;s hand, which is granted. After asking Oroe to unite her and Arsace, Semiramide is horrified by the uproar which emits from the near-by tomb of King Nino: (Ensemble: &quot;Qual mesto gemito da quella tomba&quot; / &quot;What a mournful groaning from the tomb there&quot;). All are horrified as King Nino&#x27;s ghost appears, warning of the crimes to be expiated, telling Arsace that he will reign and to respect the High Priest&#x27;s wisdom, and commanding him to come down into his tomb. Each character expresses their own anguish.

===Act 2===
&quot;A hall in the palace&quot;

In a brief encounter, Mitrane warns the royal guard to keep Assur under surveillance and not to allow him to leave the palace. Then Semiramide enters, followed shortly after by Assur.

Conflict between the two soon emerges. She reminds him that it was he who gave the cup of poison to Nino, thus causing his death, and he reminds her that it was she who had prepared it: &quot;Who handed me the cup of death?&quot; he asks. Recalling that at that time she had a son, Ninia, she speculates that he might have been killed by the same man who killed Nino. Assur continues to pressure Semiramide to make him king. In turn, she threatens to reveal the crime, and they sing an extended duet: (&quot;Se la vita ancor t&#x27;è cara&quot; / &quot;If you still hold life dear&quot;) recalling the terror and retribution that each could inflict upon the other if the truth came to light. Semiramide continues to demand that Assur acknowledge Arsace as his king.

Rejoicing is heard in the distance, and while Semiramide regains some of her former happiness, Assur becomes resigned to his fate.

&quot;King Nino&#x27;s tomb&quot;

Oroe and the Magi are assembled in the tomb. The High Priest urges Arsace to come forward but makes him aware that there may be some unpleasant news awaiting him. Upon his arrival, Oroe tells him that he is Ninia, Nino&#x27;s son, who had been saved by devoted Fradate and brought up as his own. Aghast at this news, Arsace then learns that Semiramide is his mother. To reinforce this news, Oroe hands him a scroll, written by the King before his death, the reading of which confirms the Priest&#x27;s statements. The final blow comes when Arsace reads Nino&#x27;s words, and realises that his mother and Assur were the ones who killed his father: &quot;Assur was the traitor&quot;.

Almost collapsing in grief into Oroe&#x27;s arms, he asks for comfort: (Aria: &quot;In sì barbara sciagura&quot; / &quot;In such barbarious misfortune&quot;), but the priests quickly reinforce his need to take immediate revenge. They equip him with armour and a sword and give him the determination to proceed: (cabaletta: &quot;Si, vendicato, il genitore&quot; / &quot;Yes, my father avenged&quot;). Sword in hand, Arsace leaves.

&quot;Semiramide&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Azema and Mitrane are alone, the former complaining that she has lost everything now that Arsace, the love of her life, is due to marry the queen. Entering, Idreno overhears this and is distraught. Azema promises him her hand if he so desires it, but he wishes that she would love him: (Aria: &quot;La speranza più soave&quot; / &quot;The sweetest hope&quot;). Two choruses of Maids, Lords, and Indians lead them all to the temple.
&quot;In the temple&quot;

Semiramide confronts Arsace, who finally hands her the scroll which has revealed all. Horrified, she then understands Arsace&#x27;s real identity, and becomes remorseful, offering herself to his revengeful blows. He swears filial loyalty, expressing the wish to spare his mother: (Duet: &quot;Ebben, a te, ferisci! ... Giorno d&#x27;orror! E di contento! ... Madre, addio!&quot; / &quot;Behold, you, strike me! ... Day of horror, and of joy! ... Mother, adieu!&quot;). Together, they each accept the reality, but Arsace declares that he must go to his father&#x27;s tomb and take whatever action is necessary. Knowing what is in store, Semiramide urges him to &quot;return to me victorious&quot;.

&quot;The entrance to the sepulchre of King Ninus&quot;

Defiantly, Assur enters and proclaims that this will be Arsace&#x27;s last day on earth. Learning from his men that the people have turned against him, he still vows to kill Arsace. He moves towards the tomb only to find some unknown force, some apparition holding him back: (Chorus, scena and aria: &quot;Deh ti ferma ... Que&#x27; numi furenti, Quell&#x27;ombre frementi&quot; / &quot;Oh, stop ... Those wrathful gods, those quivering shades&quot;). His men urge him on, but still the apparition remains in his mind. His men are puzzled, until he seems to recover and then, with his men beside him, vows to fight on.

&quot;Finale - Inside the sepulchre of Ninus&quot;

Along with Oroe, Arsace enters the vaults. He searches for his rival. Assur enters as well, also searching for Arsace. Semiramide then comes in to pray at Nino&#x27;s tomb, asking for forgiveness and protection for her son: (Solo: &quot;Al mio pregar t&#x27;arrendi: il figlio tuo difendi&quot; / &quot;Yield to my prayer: protect your son&quot;). In the confusion of the darkness, all three – Arsace, Semiramide, and Assur – express some bewilderment as to the loss of their courage at this crucial moment: (Trio: &quot;L&#x27;usato ardir&quot; / &quot;My former valour&quot;). But in the darkness and seeking to strike Assur, Arsace strikes Semiramide as she steps between them to forestall her erstwhile accomplice. Surprised to learn Arsace&#x27;s real identity, Assur is arrested, Semiramide dies, and to general acclaim by the people, Arsace reluctantly accepts that he shall be King.

<text>Juan Galindo (1802 – 30 January 1840) was an Irish-Honduran political activist and military and administrative officer for the Liberal government of the Federal Republic of Central America. He represented the government by a diplomatic mission to the United States and England. His duties in Central America allowed him to explore the region and examine Maya ruins. The reports on his findings earned him recognition as an early pioneer of Maya archaeology.

==Early years==
Galindo was born in Dublin in 1802 as John Galindo. His father, Philemon Galindo was an Englishman of Spanish ancestry and his mother, Catherine Gough, was Irish. Both parents were actors who met while working at a theater in Bath in England. They married in Dublin in 1801. His early life is obscure and it is not known why or exactly when he left for the New World. Sources differ on his emigration but sometime before he was twenty years old he either joined Admiral Thomas Cochrane to fight for Chile&#x27;s independence or he joined his uncle, a plantation owner in Jamaica.

The first definite record of his early career occurred in 1827 when he worked as secretary and translator for the British consul in Guatemala. By 1828 he was the superintendent for improvements for the port of Iztapa as well as a major in a Honduras battalion.

==Federal Republic of Central America==
In 1829 the Liberal forces commanded by Francisco Morazán invaded Guatemala. Galindo joined the Liberals and Morazán&#x27;s army quickly brought the revolution to a successful end. Morazán established the Federal Republic of Central America and Galindo enjoyed the patronage of Morazán and Mariano Gálvez, the chief of state in Guatemala. The new federal congress granted Galindo naturalization and he changed his name to Juan.

Galindo performed several military assignments for the new government, including officer of a military garrison at Omoa, commander of the port of Trujillo, and military governor of Petén. In 1834, he received a million-acre land grant in Petén with the stipulations that he pacify the native Lacandon Maya and settle the area in five years with colonists who would be loyal to the Guatemalan government. He soon realized that the boundary between Guatemala and British Honduras was in dispute and the British claimed that Galindo&#x27;s new land grant belonged to British Honduras. British mahogany cutters were actively logging the area, depriving Galindo of the land&#x27;s most valuable asset. When discussions with UK consul Frederick Chatfield in British Honduras failed to resolve the issue, Central America appointed Galindo as envoy to negotiate directly with the British Foreign Office in London.

Galindo left Central America in January, 1835, stopping first in Washington, DC in hopes of enlisting the United States to endorse his cause against the British. In return, Galindo offered to provide information regarding possible canal routes through Nicaragua. He met with Secretary of State John Forsyth and President Andrew Jackson in May, 1835 but failed to gain their endorsement. Galindo proceeded to London and arrived there in August. He had a meeting with Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston soon after his arrival but then talks proceeded in a desultory fashion. By April 1836 Palmerston had determined not to work with Galindo and offered the expedient excuse that since Galindo was born a British subject, he could not represent a foreign government.

Without good title to his land grant in Petén, Galindo was unable to attract settlers. Instead, he petitioned Central America for another opportunity and was provided a grant on the Mosquito Coast. While still in London, Galindo recruited his father and other relatives to direct a group of colonists to settle on this remote coast. This enterprise ended in failure; the settlers were ill-equipped, lacked sufficient supplies, and found no way to earn a living once they arrived. By the time Galindo returned to Central America in 1836, the settlement had collapsed and his father had returned to England. He also found that his influence with the Central America government was greatly diminished.

The Liberal regime that had governed Central America was by now beleaguered. Galindo attempted to rally sympathy against perceived British aggression but this effort failed to gain popular attention. When civil war began, he rejoined the army, commanded by a Liberal general, Trinidad Cabañas. Cabañas was defeated by the joint forces of Honduras and Nicaragua near the city of Tegucigalpa. Galindo was killed on January 30, 1840, after the battle.

==Maya archaeology==
As military governor of Petén, Galindo performed an exploratory journey down the Usumacinta River and then crossed overland to reach the Maya ruins at Palenque in April 1831. He spent a month exploring the site and wrote an account of the various structures, drew plans, and sketched several of the decorations he encountered. Later that year his account was published by the London &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; and the Geographical Society in Paris. He also sent a small collection of Maya objects to the Royal Society in London.

In 1834, Galindo was sent by the Central American government to survey and report on the ruins at Copán. He spent about ten weeks exploring the area, writing reports and sketching his findings. He wrote two brief reports for the London &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; and the American Antiquarian Society. A more detailed report with twenty-six illustrations was sent to the Société de Géographie in Paris and the original was sent to his government with the mistaken assumption that it would be published. Instead, it was filed away and &quot;lost&quot; for more than a hundred years when it was found and published in 1945.

Although it was just a small part of his career, Galindo proved to be an astute observer and an effective communicator who earned recognition as an early pioneer of Maya archaeology. He wrote some thirty-two letters to the Société de Géographie sharing his ideas. Galindo was one of the first to mention the close resemblance between the contemporary Maya peoples and the carved images of the ancient Maya to be found among the ruins, and suggested correctly that the original Maya civilization was created by the ancestors of the contemporary Mayas. He was also the first investigator to copy carefully the Mayan hieroglyphics and identify them as a unique form of writing.

<doc id="356928" wikidata="Q566130" url="?curid=356928" title="Let's Make a Deal">
<text>Let&#x27;s Make a Deal (also known as LMAD) is a television game show that originated in the United States in 1963 and has since been produced in many countries throughout the world. The program was created and produced by Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall, the latter serving as its host for nearly 30 years.

The format of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; involves selected members of the studio audience, referred to as &quot;traders&quot;, making deals with the host. In most cases, a trader will be offered something of value and given a choice of whether to keep it or exchange it for a different item. The program&#x27;s defining game mechanism is that the other item is hidden from the trader until that choice is made. The trader thus does not know if they are getting something of equal or greater value or a prize that is referred to as a &quot;zonk&quot;, an item purposely chosen to be of little or no value to the trader.

When &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; first started, contestants wore suits and dresses, normal attire for the time. In short order, however, audience members began to dress in outrageous and unique costumes to increase their chances of being selected as a trader, and that has become a signature feature of the show.

The current edition of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; has aired on CBS since October 5, 2009, when it took over the spot on the network&#x27;s daytime schedule vacated by the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Wayne Brady is the host of the current series, with Jonathan Mangum as his announcer/assistant. Tiffany Coyne is the current model, joining in 2010, with musician Cat Gray in 2011.

From Season 12 (2020–21) to Season 14 (2022–23), &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; filmed with a hybrid of audience members in-studio seated in pods as well as virtual traders playing from their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic (nicknamed &quot;At-Homies&quot;) that delayed the start of Season 12. According to executive producer John Quinn, all COVID-19 protocols are in effect during production, including social distancing, testing, masks (only for crewmembers and while off set), and personal protective equipment.

The 15th season of the current version premiered on September 25, 2023, and six primetime episodes were filmed during the season. One is the show&#x27;s Christmas primetime episode, and five more were broadcast in January and February 2024, between seasons of &quot;Survivor&quot;.

The show is owned by Marcus/Glass Productions, a joint venture of Marcus Entertainment (Marcus Lemonis) and Nancy Glass following an August 2021 acquisition of Hatos-Hall assets, with Sharon Hall, a former Endemol Shine executive, as the consultant.

As of January 2022, CAN&#x27;T STOP media has been in charge of the format&#x27;s international distribution.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; first aired on NBC on December 30, 1963, as part of its daytime schedule. After 1,257 episodes on NBC Daytime and 16 episodes on NBC Primetime, the show moved to ABC on December 30, 1968, where it remained until July 9, 1976; and on two occasions the show was given a weekly nighttime spot on those networks. The first syndicated edition of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; premiered on August 30, 1971. Distributed by ABC Films, and then by its successor Worldvision Enterprises once the fin-syn rules were enacted, the series ran until 1977 and aired weekly.

A revival of the series based in Hall&#x27;s native Canada was launched in 1980 and aired in syndication on American and Canadian stations for one season. This series was produced by Catalena Productions and distributed in America by Rhodes Productions, Catalena&#x27;s partner company; Catalena was forced into bankruptcy by an unpaid Monty Hall in August 1981. In the fall of 1984, the series returned for a third run in syndication as &quot;The All-New Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. Running for two seasons until 1986, this series was distributed by Telepictures.

NBC revived &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; twice in 13 years. The first was a daytime series in 1990 that was the first to not be produced or hosted by Monty Hall. Instead, the show was a production of Ron Greenberg and Dick Clark, and featured Bob Hilton (best known for announcing other game shows) as host (although Hall would eventually return as guest host after Hilton&#x27;s dismissal).

A primetime edition was launched in 2003 but drew poor ratings and was canceled after three of its intended five episodes had aired. This version had reporter Billy Bush as host, and had a significantly larger budget.

A partial remake called &quot;Big Deal&quot;, hosted by Mark DeCarlo, was broadcast on Fox in 1996. In 1998 and 1999, Buena Vista Television (now Disney–ABC Domestic Television) was in talks with Stone-Stanley (the producers of &quot;Big Deal&quot;) to create a revival hosted by Gordon Elliott, but it was never picked up. The show was one of several used as part of the summer series &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; on CBS in 2006, hosted by Ricki Lake.
As noted above, CBS revived &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; in 2009. The revival premiered on October 5, 2009, and CBS airs the show daily at 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. in other time zones). Like the program that it replaced, the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, affiliates can choose to air it in either time slot; Eastern time zone affiliates prefer the early slot to pair the two CBS daytime game shows together (which was the case pre-1993 with CBS Daytime game shows as a morning block). In other time zones, the show more often airs after &quot;The Talk&quot; in the afternoon slot, when many CBS affiliates in the Eastern time zone have either syndicated programming or the beginning of their local news block. There are notable exceptions on the Eastern time zone – Chattanooga, Dayton, Gainesville (FL), Lexington (KY), and Macon. However, no new episode is available on days CBS Daytime pre-empts shows for live sports (current such cases are the Thursday and Friday of the first round of the NCAA basketball tournament, college football games on Black Friday, the Sun Bowl and UEFA Champions League knockout phase matches), to ensure those markets that air the show late won&#x27;t lose an episode to live sports.

From September 27 to October 1, 2010, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; aired two episodes a day on an alternating week. CBS did this to fill a gap between the final episode of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which ended a fifty-four-year run on September 17, 2010, and the debut of &quot;The Talk&quot;. The double-run games aired at 2:00 pm. Eastern.

Although the current version of the show debuted in September 2009, long after &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (which made the switch in 2008, first with primetime episodes in February, then daytime in September) and the two Bell created daytime soap operas had made the switch to high definition, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was, along with &quot;Big Brother&quot;, one of only two programs across the five major networks that was still being actively produced in standard definition. For the start of production for its 2014–15 season in June 2014, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; began being produced in high definition, with &quot;Big Brother 16&quot; making the switch later in June. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was the last remaining CBS program to make the switch by air date, with the first HD episode airing on September 22, 2014.

In 2020, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal Primetime&quot; on CBS was announced, making the show one of the first to appear in primetime on the three legacy networks as a regular primetime series. Three primetime episodes were announced, with the first airing on October 27 as part of CBS launching both of their daytime game shows&#x27; pandemic-delayed seasons in primetime, the second on December 1 featuring guest star Phil Keoghan, and the third, a Holiday-themed episode with families on December 22. Three more primetime episodes aired during the 2021–22 season and four primetime episodes were filmed and planned to air in April and May during the 2022–23 season, but concerns over the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA labor disputes (the show is under a collective bargaining agreement for daytime shows signed in 2022) led to the four Season 14 broadcasts being moved to the 2023–24 season as part of moves to allow CBS original programming to continue in case of potential labor stoppages. Both unions eventually went on strike, and in July 2023, those episodes, along with new &quot;The Price Is Right at Night&quot; episodes for Season 52, were announced as replacement programming. The &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; episodes aired Fridays from November 3–17, 2023 in the 8:00 p.m. EDT time slot before Thanksgiving. Season 15 primetime episodes aired on two consecutive Mondays (November 27 and December 4), with additional episodes in January and February 2024, including the network&#x27;s Super Bowl LVIII themed episode (both CBS Daytime game shows aired on February 7 at night featuring themes related with the game that CBS broadcast) and a Valentine&#x27;s Day themed episode on February 14.

==Past personnel==

The family of Monty Hall has been involved in all versions in one form of another since the original episode in 1963. Monty was the host of nearly every episode of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; that aired from 1963 until 1986. This encompassed the entire original daytime series, which ran until 1976, as well as the accompanying primetime episodes that aired on both NBC and ABC and the three syndicated productions that launched in 1971, 1980, and 1984. He was absent only twice during that span due to illness; in 1971 Dennis James was called on to substitute while in 1985 Geoff Edwards hosted a week of episodes while Hall recovered from a bout of laryngitis.

Bob Hilton became the new host for the NBC 1990 series; however, due to low ratings, Hilton was fired from the show and in October 1990, Hall returned to the show (but was announced as &quot;guest host&quot;) and remained as host until the series was canceled in January 1991. Billy Bush emceed the 2003 series, with Hall making a cameo appearance in one episode.

Each &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; announcer also served as a de facto assistant host, as many times the announcer would be called upon to carry props across the trading floor. The original announcer for the series was Wendell Niles, who was replaced by Jay Stewart in 1964. Stewart remained with &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; until the end of the syndicated series in 1977. The 1980 Canadian-produced syndicated series was announced by Chuck Chandler. The 1984 syndicated series had Brian Cummings in the announcer/assistant role for its first season, with disc jockey Dean Goss taking the position for the following season. The 1990 NBC revival series was announced by Dean Miuccio, with the 2003 edition featuring Vance DeGeneres in that role. The 2009 (current) CBS version features Jonathan Mangum, although co-executive producer Chris Ahearn (nicknamed &quot;Money Fairy&quot;) is his backup, filling in for Mangum on a few episodes during Season 14 when Mangum was not cleared to participate in taping because of illness. After Season 14, Mangum surpassed Stewart as the longest serving announcer in the show’s franchise history.

Carol Merrill served as the prize model on the original 1963 series for its entire run, ending in 1977. She served for 14 seasons. The models on the 1980s series were Maggie Brown, Julie Hall (1980), Karen LaPierre, and Melanie Vincz (1984). For the 1990 series, the show featured Georgia Satelle and identical twins Elaine and Diane Klimaszewski, who later gained fame as the Klimaszewski Twins.

Hall (2010 and 2013) and Merrill (2013) both appeared on the current Brady version, each making one-week appearances. The 2013 celebration of the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary was Hall&#x27;s last official appearance on the show prior to his death, but Hall also appeared in 2017 CBS publicity shots with Brady as part of a CBS Daytime publicity photo celebrating the network&#x27;s daytime ratings. Hall served as a consultant on the show from 2009 until his death, although episodes which he worked continued to air into 2018 because of taping days (Hall&#x27;s death resulted in a later-season episode to be repurposed and aired earlier as a memorial episode). Following the 2021 Marcus/Glass acquisition of Hatos-Hall, television executive Sharon Hall, Monty&#x27;s daughter, was named consultant.

When the current version debuted in 2009 at Las Vegas, Alison Fiori was the show&#x27;s original model, lasting for much of the first season in Las Vegas before the show moved to Los Angeles. Danielle Demski serves as the show&#x27;s backup model, having been involved in most Season 5 episodes with Coyne on parental leave, and in Season 11 when Coyne was unavailable. In 2023, Coyne surpassed Merrill as the longest serving hostess in franchise history.

===Production locations===
The original daytime series was recorded at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and then at ABC Television Center in Los Angeles once the program switched networks in 1968. The weekly syndicated series also taped at ABC Television Center, doing so for its first five seasons. After ABC cancelled the daytime series in 1976, production of the syndicated series ceased there as well and the sixth and final season was recorded in the ballroom of the Westgate Las Vegas hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The 1980 Canadian series was taped at Panorama Film Studios in West Vancouver, British Columbia, which production company Catalena Productions used as its base of operations. &quot;The All-New Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; taped its first season of episodes in Burbank at NBC Studios, then moved to Sunset Las Palmas Studios (known as Hollywood Center Studios at the time) in Hollywood for the second and final season. The 1990 NBC daytime series was recorded at Disney-MGM Studios on the grounds of Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida. The 2003 revival returned production to Burbank.

The current edition of the series first originated from the Tropicana outside of Las Vegas. The show returned for good to Los Angeles in 2010, first at Sunset Bronson Studios from 2010 to 2015 and later at Raleigh Studios from 2015 to 2017. From 2017 to 2022, the show taped at Saticoy Studios in Van Nuys. During the 2022–23 season, the show taped at Quixote Studios in Sylmar. Beginning in its 2023–24 season, the show will be taping at Haven Studios in Atwater Village; the facility is leased by Fremantle, and will also house &quot;The Price is Right&quot; and other Fremantle-produced game shows in California.

===Music===
The theme music for the 1963–77 versions was composed by Sheldon Allman. The theme, along with all incidental music, was performed by an in-studio combo led by Ivan Ditmars, consisting of an electric organ, guitar, drums, and on the nighttime version, a harp. In some seasons of the nighttime show, the combo was further augmented by a horn section. The final season of the nighttime show taped in Las Vegas eliminated the in-studio band in favor of pre-recorded tracks, due to Ivan Ditmars&#x27; retirement.

The 1980–81 theme, composed by Stan Worth, was an updated version of the original theme, with more of a disco sound.

The 1984–86 version featured a brand new theme provided by Score Productions, although original composer Sheldon Allman returned as music director for the first season. Todd Thicke replaced Allman in that role for the second season. Both music directors used music from previous Hatos-Hall shows, such as &quot;Split Second&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Anybody&#x27;s Guess&quot; as incidental cues during the show.

The 2009 revival features another new theme composed by Brian Teed. Since 2011, keyboardist Cat Gray has provided in-studio musical accompaniment.

==Format==
===Gameplay===

Each episode of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; consists of several &quot;deals&quot; between the host and one or more members of the studio audience, referred to as &quot;traders&quot;. Audience members are picked at the host&#x27;s whim as the show moves along, and married couples are often selected to play together as traders. The deals are mini-games within the show that take several formats.

In the simplest format, a trader is given a prize or cash amount of medium value (on the order of a few hundred dollars), and the host offers them the opportunity to trade for an unknown prize. This latter item may be concealed on the stage behind one of three curtains, within a large &quot;box&quot; onstage (large panels painted to look like a box), inside a smaller box carried on a tray, or occasionally in other formats. On occasion, the initial prize may itself be hidden behind a curtain, or in a box or some other container.

Technically, traders are supposed to bring something to trade in, but this rule has seldom been enforced. On several occasions, a trader is actually asked to trade in an item such as their shoes or purse, only to receive the item back at the end of the deal as a &quot;prize&quot;. On at least one occasion, the purse was taken backstage and a high-valued prize such as the ignition key to a new car was placed inside of it.

Prizes generally consist of either cash or merchandise with genuine value, such as a trip, electronics, furniture, appliances, or a car. At times, a small prize (typewriter, pocket tape recorder, etc.) may contain a cash bonus or a written/recorded message awarding cash or a larger prize to a trader who has chosen it. Traders who choose boxes or curtains are at risk of receiving booby prizes called &quot;zonks&quot;, which can be outlandish items (live animals, junked cars, giant articles of clothing, etc.) or legitimate prizes with relatively very little value (wheelbarrows, giant teddy bears, piles of food, etc.). On rare occasions, a trader receives a zonk that proves to be a cover-up for a valuable prize, such as a fur coat hidden inside a garbage can.

Though usually considered joke prizes, traders legally win the zonks. However, after the taping of the show, any trader who had been zonked is offered a consolation prize (currently $100) instead of having to take home the actual zonk. This is partly because some of the zonks are impractical or physically impossible to receive or deliver to the traders (such as live animals or a stagehand wearing an animal costume), or the props are owned by the studio. A disclaimer at the end of the credits of later 1970s episodes read: &quot;Some traders accept reasonable duplicates of zonk prizes.&quot; Starting in the 2012–13 season, CBS invited viewers to provide zonk ideas to producers. At the end of the season, the viewer whose zonk was judged the most creative won $2,500, and other viewers&#x27; zonk ideas were also used. Whenever a viewer-submitted zonk appeared on the show, the announcer credited its originator. The contest has been continued throughout the past several seasons after its 2012 introduction. In some deals, it is possible to win both an actual prize or cash as well as a zonk.

===Quickie Deals===
As the end credits of the show roll, it is typical for the host to ask random members of the studio audience to participate in fast deals. In the current Wayne Brady version, these are often referred to as &quot;quickie deals&quot;, and are conducted by the host, announcer, and model each. Marcus/Glass will post information on the show&#x27;s X address (@LetsMakeADeal) days before taping to encourage audience members to carry certain items in their pockets to win an additional $100–$500 when the host, announcer, or model approaches them at the end of the show and asks to see such items. The deals are usually in the form of the following:
*Offering cash to a person for possessing a certain item.
*Offering cash to a person for answering a question about what happened earlier in the show.
*Paying a small cash amount for each instance of a certain item (coins, paperclips, etc.) that a person can produce.
*Offering cash for each instance of a particular digit in the serial number on a dollar bill, driver&#x27;s license, etc.
*Offering to pay the last check in the person&#x27;s checkbook, if they had one, up to a certain limit (usually $500 or $1,000).
*Offering cash to one person if they can correctly state the exact value of the Big Deal of the Day, or the name of the trader who played for it.
*Offering $500 to one person if they brought a specified item listed on the show&#x27;s Twitter account.
*Offering cash to one person if they can correctly choose which one of two photos appeared on the show&#x27;s Instagram account.
*Offering cash to one person if they can correctly answer a question relating to their costume.
*Offering cash to one person if they can correctly guess how much money ($100, $200, or $300) was in the announcer&#x27;s hand.

During Season 13 and 14 (2021–23), as the show modified its format due to the COVID pandemic, traders at home play the Quickie Deals round the same way as the in-studio traders.

===Other deal formats===
Deals are often more complicated than the basic format described above. Additionally, some deals take the form of games of chance, and others are played as pricing games.

====Trading deals====
Types of trading deals employed on the show include:

*Choosing one of several envelopes/wallets/purses that contain various amounts of money. At least one of them conceals a pre-announced value (usually $1 or $5), which awards a car or trip; the others contain larger amounts as consolation prizes. Each trader must decide whether to keep or trade the one he/she chose.
*Making decisions for another person, such as a spouse or a series of unrelated traders, or every member of a team receiving the same item based on majority vote. Sometimes after several offers, a team is broken up and each individual trader can make one final deal on his/her own.
*Two or more traders guessing the weight of a studio audience member chosen by the host, with cash awarded to the trader whose guess is closer.
*Being told the weight or number of items in a prize behind a box or curtain, and then choosing to keep it or sell it back to the host for a certain price per pound/item.
*Being offered a quantity of some foreign currency, and then choosing to receive its equivalent in United States dollars or trade it for a box/curtain.
*Being presented with an item having an unknown cash value, such as a claim check or gift certificate, and deciding whether to keep or trade it. Variations have included a cash box, to which the host adds packets of money at intervals; a shopping bag, to which he adds grocery items containing money; or a package of some grocery item such as candy or gum that may or may not contain money. Over the course of the episode, the trader holding the item is given several opportunities to exchange it for a box, curtain, or chance to win a large prize; in each case, the option he/she declines is given to another trader. Typically, but not always, the last trader holding the item is given the first chance to return it and play for the Big Deal. The total cash value of the item (if any) is revealed only after the trader has made his/her decision or, on occasion, during the closing credits.

====Games of chance====
A wide variety of chance-based games have been used on the show. Examples:
*Collecting a certain amount of money hidden inside wallets, envelopes, etc., or by pressing unlabeled buttons on a cash register, in order to reach a pre-stated &quot;selling price&quot; for a larger prize, such as a car, trip or larger amount of cash. Typically, there may also be one or more zonk items hidden which end the game immediately and forfeit all winnings if found. The trader may choose to stop at any time and keep all the money found. The cash register game used 15 buttons, two of which would ring up &quot;No Sale&quot; as the zonk. If a trader found one of these, he/she was offered a chance to press one more button and receive the amount rung up (sometimes doubled by the host), or win either a larger amount or the grand prize for finding the other &quot;No Sale&quot;. In the current CBS version, the game is played using a board with 13 cash amounts and two zonks.
*Choosing one of several items in the hope that it will lead to cash or a prize (e.g., a key that unlocks a safe, or an egg that is raw instead of hard-boiled). Before the host tests the chosen item to see if it is a winner, the trader is offered a chance to exchange it for a box/curtain. This game is often played with multiple traders, and more than one of the offered items may win the prize. 
*Games involving a deck of cards in which a trader must find matching cards, draw cards that reach a cumulative total within a certain number of draws, draw a certain number of cards from a certain suit to win a designated prize (with one suit always designated as going toward a &quot;zonk&quot;, which ends the game with nothing won), etc. to win a prize or additional money.
*Receiving clues about an unknown prize (such as a partial spelling of the prize or clues in the form or rap, rhyme, etc.) and deciding whether to take the unknown prize or a cash prize.
*Choosing face-down number cards from a board in the hope of winning prizes by out-scoring a rival trader or the host.
*Receiving money in the form of a long strip of bills dispensed one at a time from a machine. The trader can end the game at any time and keep the accumulated money, but he/she forfeits it if a blank sheet or a card marked &quot;curtains&quot; appears. Updated versions of the game involve an ATM; the trader inserts a card and begins to withdraw cash, but an &quot;overdrawn&quot; message on the screen at any time ends the game and forfeits the money.
*Choosing between a known cash prize and a chance to spin a carnival wheel, which can award a car, larger/smaller cash amounts, or a zonk. 
*Rolling dice to receive cash based upon the roll or achieving a cumulative score within a certain number of rolls to win a larger prize. Depending on the game, the trader is given the opportunity to stop playing at various points, keeping any cash/prizes already won or accepting an offer of a guaranteed prize, or continue to play and risk losing everything.
* Choosing numbers from a board after a brief look at what is behind them (cash, prizes, zonks). The trader keeps all cash/prizes matched and may stop after any turn, but loses everything upon finding two zonks.

====Pricing games====
Other deals related to pricing merchandise are featured to win a larger prize or cash amount. Sometimes traders are required to price individual items (either grocery products or smaller prizes generally valued less than $100) within a certain range to win successively larger prizes or a car. Other times traders must choose an item that has a pre-announced price, order grocery items or small prizes from least to most expensive, or two items with prices that total a certain amount to win a larger prize. The pre-announced price and two-items-to-a-given-amount games were often played multi-player style.

A two-player variant often had traders competing for cash, with the trader who guessed closer to the correct price of a grocery item or small prize getting progressively larger amounts of cash; whomever has a pre-announced amount after (typically) four such questions winning a larger prize. A similar variant had player compete for cash, with double the amount available for exact guesses, and afterward the chance to spend the cash on a curtain or box.

These games are not used on the CBS version because of their similarities to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

====Quiz games====
On the CBS version, due to the similarities of the pricing game concept with &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, quiz games are used instead. These deals involve products in the form of when they were introduced to the market, general knowledge quizzes, currency exchange rates (at the time of taping), or knowledge of geography of trips to certain locales used as prizes.

===Big Deal===
The Big Deal serves as the final segment of the show and offers a chance at a significantly larger prize for a lucky trader. Before the round, the value of the day&#x27;s Big Deal is announced to the audience.

The process for choosing traders (two up to 2003, one since 2009) has remained the same. Starting with the highest winner, the host asks traders if they are willing to trade in everything they have won to that point for a chance to choose one of three numbered doors on the stage. The process continues until a trader agrees to play; up to 2003, a second trader was chosen in this fashion and the higher winner of the two received first pick of the doors. In case of a tie between two or more traders, the host starts with the trader that was selected first.

Each of the doors conceals either a prize package of some sort, or a cash award hidden inside a prop such as a bank vault, piggy bank, or blank check. On occasion, a door containing an all-cash prize is opened before the traders make their choices, but the amount of the prize is not revealed. Frequently but not always, one of the two non-Big Deal doors holds a prize whose value is lower than that of the trader&#x27;s original winnings, while the value of the other one is at least $1,000 more than this total. There are no Zonks in the Big Deal.

Before 2003, a non-Big Deal door chosen by one of the traders would be opened first, and the Big Deal door would be opened last whether it had been chosen or not. This procedure is followed in the majority of episodes since 2009, although occasionally the Big Deal door is instead opened second when a trader has chosen it.

The Big Deal prize is usually the most extravagant on each episode, and is often a car, a vacation with first-class accommodations, or a collection of high-value furniture/appliances. On occasion, the Big Deal consists of one of the all-cash prizes mentioned above; at other times, a cash bonus is added to the prizes in the Big Deal to bring the total up to the announced value. On other occasions, the prize consists of &quot;Everything in the Big Deal&quot;, which awards the cash/merchandise behind all three doors to the trader who chooses it.

Traders who have won zonks become eligible for the Big Deal only if not enough winners of actual cash/prizes volunteer to play. The Big Deal is the only time during the show in which participants are guaranteed to receive a genuine prize, although it may be of lower value than the one(s) they trade away. (On the pilot episode only, a zonk was placed behind one of the doors; however, it was not chosen.)

====Super Deal====
During the 1975–76 syndicated season, winners of the Big Deal were offered a chance to win the &quot;Super Deal&quot;. At this point, Big Deals were limited to a range of $8,000 to $10,000. The trader could risk their Big Deal winnings on a shot at adding a $20,000 cash prize, which was hidden behind one of three mini-doors onstage. The other two doors contained cash amounts of $1,000 or $2,000; however, the $1,000 value was later replaced with a &quot;mystery&quot; amount between $1,000 and $9,000. A trader who decided to play risked their Big Deal winnings and selected one of the mini-doors. If the $20,000 prize was behind the door, the trader kept the Big Deal and added the $20,000 prize, for a potential maximum total of $30,000. However, a trader who selected one of the other two doors forfeited the Big Deal prizes but kept the cash amount behind the door. The Super Deal was discontinued when the show permanently moved to Las Vegas for the final season (1976–77), and Big Deal values returned to the previous range of $10,000 to $15,000.

From 2012 to 2016 of the Brady version, the Super Deal was offered as a limited event (usually for a week of shows promoted as &quot;Super Deal Week&quot;). In this version, the top cash prize was $50,000 while the other two cash prizes were $1,000 and $2,000. In addition, instead of using mini-doors, the cash amounts were hidden in three large colored envelopes of red, green, and blue, respectively referred by Brady as ruby, emerald, and sapphire.

===Trip-Tastic===
A &quot;Trip-Tastic&quot; game was played during the first week of the 2019–20 season on the Brady version. At three different points during each episode, the assistant would hand a golden ticket to a trader, enabling them to play the game. The traders were shown a world map with three envelopes attached, and they each chose one in the same order that they received their tickets. Cash prizes of $500 and $1,000 were hidden in two of the envelopes, while the third one awarded three trips.

===Mega-Deal week===
During the first week of the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons on the Brady version, any trader who won a Big Deal had a chance to win the day&#x27;s &quot;Mega-Deal&quot;, which consisted of every non-cash, non-zonk prize offered during the episode. The Big Deal trader would choose both one of the three doors and one of seven cards (reduced by one for every day in which the Mega-Deal went unclaimed during the week). Only if the trader won the Big Deal would the chosen card be revealed; if it was the Mega-Deal card, they won all the prizes, including whatever they had traded away to play the Big Deal. Regardless of the outcome, the trader received the prize(s) in the Big Deal.

===Mash-Up Week===
The week of May 9, 2016, was designated &quot;Mash-Up Week.&quot; During each of the five broadcast days, &quot;Deal&quot; and sister show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; each featured one game from the other&#x27;s lineup. The games were slightly modified to reflect the nature of the shows on which they were played; those on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; required traders to price items, while those on &quot;Deal&quot; used random draws and the offer of cash/prize deals to stop a game early. &quot;Mash-Up Week&quot; returned to both shows the week of March 23, 2020.

===Themed Days===
Starting with Season 13, the Monday and Friday shows have had their own ongoing themes. In Season 14, an additional theme was added for the Wednesday shows. 
Mondays are Mega Money Mondays, meaning that one trader is guaranteed to win a large amount of cash (basically a condensed version of Big Money Week from &quot;The Price is Right&quot;). The amount for each Monday episode is usually $10,000 but could be as much as $50,000. The prize could either be offered as the main prize for a Trading deal or added on as an additional prize to another prize package. On occasion, it has even been hidden in a Zonk prize. On at least one occasion, since it had not been won during regular game play, the $10,000 was given as a prize for a Quickie Deal at the end of the show (in this case, it was substituted for the usual $500 prize given to a Twitter/X follower for bringing the requested item of the day). This was played only on selected Mondays since Season 15, in order to lighten the shows budget.

Wednesdays are Worldwide Wednesdays, where one Trader has a chance to win a trip to exotic destinations anywhere in the world. The value of the trip is worth at least $20,000 or greater.

Fridays were Fabulous Car Fridays, where one Trading game was played for a premium luxury car. On these shows, the game with the car is the only one played for a car as the main prize (other episodes usually have two &quot;car games&quot;); typically, the other &quot;car game&quot; prize is replaced by a cash amount of $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000. In Season 14, the luxury car events were changed to ten episodes during the season, with episodes airing during the weeks of September 19, 2022, and January 30, 2023, designated Fabulous Car Week, similar to its sister show featuring Dream Car Week. The theme was not played on any Friday episode during Season 15, but it has been reinstated for Season 16.

On the November 17, 2023, primetime episode (Season 14), all three themes were played on the episode, plus two alliterative themes made for the day based on popular culture, Taco Tuesday, with a deal based on a taco truck (driven by Tiffany Coyne), and Throwback Thursday, which used clips from the 1963–76 version and the current version in 2010 and 2013, all of which featured Monty Hall and Carol Merrill. That episode used clips requiring approval from Merrill and consultant Sharon Hall Kessler.

==Reception==
Upon the original &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;″s debut, journalist Charles Witbeck was skeptical of the show&#x27;s chances of success, noting that the previous four NBC programs to compete with CBS&#x27;s &quot;Password&quot; had failed. Some critics described the show as &quot;mindless&quot; and &quot;demeaning to traders and audiences alike&quot;.

By 1974, however, the show had spent more than a decade at or near the top of daytime ratings, and became the highest-rated syndicated primetime program. It was so popular that, when Hall moved &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; to ABC because of a contract dispute, doing so greatly damaged NBC&#x27;s daytime ratings and greatly improved ABC&#x27;s. The show held the world&#x27;s record for the longest waiting list for tickets in show-business history; there were 350 seats available for each show, and a wait time of two to three years after requesting a ticket.

In 2001, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was ranked as No. 18 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time&quot;. In 2006, GSN aired a series of specials counting down its own list of the &quot;50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time&quot;, on which &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was No. 7.

In 2014, the American series won a Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song for &quot;30,000 Reasons to Love Me&quot;, composed by Cat Gray and sung by Wayne Brady.

==Episode status==
*ABC Daytime: A clip from the ABC daytime premiere was used on the &quot;Biography&quot; episode profiling Hall, which aired during the series&#x27; &quot;Game Show Week&quot; in December 1999. Another episode from 1969 was found, which features a gaffe that Hall himself rated as his most embarrassing moment on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; – at the end of the show, he attempted to make a deal with a woman carrying a baby&#x27;s bottle. Noting that it had a removable rubber nipple, he offered the woman $100 if she could show him another nipple (she did not do so). Episodes substitute-hosted by Dennis James exist in his personal library; a portion of one such episode is widely circulated as part of a pitch film for James&#x27; version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.
*ABC Nighttime/1971–77 Syndicated: Episodes have been seen on GSN in the past. The CBN Cable Network reran the syndicated series in the 1980s and its successor, The Family Channel, from June 7, 1993 to March 29, 1996. Buzzr also aired the series in 2015 and 2016. 
*The 1980–81 version continued to air in reruns on Canada&#x27;s Global Television Network through the late 1980s.
*The 1984–86 syndicated version has been seen on GSN in the past. Reruns previously aired on the USA Network from December 29, 1986 to December 30, 1988 and The Family Channel from August 30, 1993 to March 29, 1996. Buzzr began airing episodes from 1985 on June 1, 2016; this version returned to Buzzr&#x27;s schedule on September 30, 2019, then aired until March 20, 2021, and will return July 18, 2022, for a limited run then will permanently return to the Buzzr schedule on August 1, 2022. GameTV in Canada aired 40 episodes of this version starting in July 2018, as part of their Game Show Retro block, until it was dropped in October 2018.
*The 1990s NBC version has not been seen since its cancellation. 
*The 2003 NBC prime time version only aired three of the five episodes produced, with no rebroadcasts since.
*The current 2009 version classic episodes began airing in July 2022 on Paramount-owned Pluto TV and BET began airing vintage episodes.

==International versions==
Rights were formerly held by RTL Group worldwide, but under current owners Marcus Lemonis and Nancy Glass, international rights are held by Can&#x27;t Stop Media except for countries where it currently is produced by RTL. The show has been licensed the show to 22 countries.
===Notes===
==Merchandise==
In 1964, Milton Bradley released a home version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; featuring gameplay somewhat different from the television show. In 1974, Ideal Toys released an updated version of the game featuring Hall on the box cover, which was also given to all traders on the syndicated version in the 1974–75 season. An electronic tabletop version by Tiger Electronics was released in 1998. In the late summer of 2006, an interactive DVD version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was released by Imagination Games, which also features classic clips from the Monty Hall years of the show. In 2010, Pressman Toy Corporation released an updated version of the box game, with gameplay more similar to the 1974 version, featuring Brady on the box cover.

Various U.S. lotteries have included instant lottery tickets based on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;.

In 1999, the website BuyBidWin.com licensed the rights to &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; as it launched a website featuring Monty Hall.

In 1999, Shuffle Master teamed up with Bally&#x27;s to do a video slot machine game based on the show with the voice and likeness of Monty Hall.

In 2004, IGT (International Gaming Technology) did a new video slot game based on the show still featuring Monty Hall.

In 2004, the now defunct website GameShow24.com was going to release a beta game based on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;.

In 2012, a Facebook game based on the Wayne Brady version was released by RealNetwork&#x27;s GameHouse.

In 2013, Aristocrat Technology did an all-new video slot machine game based on the Wayne Brady version.

==Monty Hall problem==
The Monty Hall problem, also called the Monty Hall paradox, is a famous question in probability theory presented as a hypothetical game on the show. In this game, a trader is allowed to choose among three doors that conceal a true prize and two zonks. After this choice is made, the host opens a door that was not chosen and reveals a zonk, and then offers to trade the trader&#x27;s original choice for the item behind the other unopened door. The problem is to determine whether taking the trade improves the trader&#x27;s chance of winning. The correct answer is that it does, although people often reach the opposite conclusion through faulty reasoning.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter John Tierney in 1991, Hall confirmed that when the host behaves strictly according to the problem description, it is advantageous for the trader to take the trade. Yet as host on the show, he could decide which trades to offer based on the traders&#x27; prior choices, which allowed him to play on them psychologically and control the number of wins.

==Physics==
* Megh Nad Saha states his ionization equation.
* Albert Einstein delivers his Leiden Lecture.

<text>Yellowstone Lake is the largest body of water in Yellowstone National Park. The lake is above sea level and covers with of shoreline. While the average depth of the lake is , its greatest depth is at least . Yellowstone Lake is the largest freshwater lake above in North America.

In winter, ice nearly thick covers much of the lake except where shallow water covers hot springs. The lake freezes over by early December and can remain frozen until late May or early June.

==History==
The forest and valleys surrounding Yellowstone Lake had been populated with Native Americans since pre-historic times. Archeologists have found evidence of human presence in the park long before 1872. They found that Native Americans hunted bison and bighorn sheep, fished for cutthroat trout, and gathered bitterroot and camas bulbs for at least 11,000 years. Today, 26 tribes claim cultural association with Yellowstone. The first human of European descent to see the lake was trapper John Colter in the early 19th century. During the fur trading era of 1820–1840, the lake was probably visited by many trapping parties moving through the park region. In trapper Osborne Russell&#x27;s diary, he describes a visit to the lake in 1836 as follows:

16th [August] -Mr. Bridger came up with the remainder of the party. 18th-The whole camp moved down the east shore of the lake through thick pines and fallen timber about eighteen miles and encamped in a small prairie. 19th-continued down the shore to the outlet about twenty miles, and encamped in a beautiful plain { Hayden Valley } which extended along the northern extremity of the lake. This valley was interspersed with scattering groves of tall pines, forming shady retreats for the numerous elk and deer during the heat of the day. The lake is about 100 miles in circumference, bordered on the east by high ranges of mountains whose spurs terminate at the shore and on the west by a low bed of piney mountains. Its greatest width is about fifteen miles, lying in an oblong from south to north, or rather in the shape of a crescent. Near where we encamped were several hot springs which boiled perpetually. Near these was an opening in the ground about eight inches in diameter from which hot steam issued continually with a noise similar to that made by the steam issuing from the safety valve of an engine, and could be heard five or six miles distant.
===Name===
The lake has been known by various names as depicted on early maps and in journals. Both fur trader David Thompson and explorer William Clark referred to the lake as &quot;Yellow Stone&quot;. Osborne Russell referred to the lake as &quot;Yellow Stone Lake&quot; in his 1834 journal. On some William Clark maps, the lake has the name &quot;Eustis Lake&quot; and the name &quot;Sublette&#x27;s Lake&quot; was also used to name the lake in the early 19th century. The name &quot;Yellowstone Lake&quot; appears formally first in the 1839 maps of the Oregon Territory by U.S. Army topographical engineer, Captain Washington Hood and has remained so since that time.

===Pre-park era exploration===
Although many prospecting parties traversed the Yellowstone region throughout the 1850–60s, the first detailed descriptions of the lake came in 1869, 1870 and 1871 as a result of the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.

Cook, Folsom and Peterson first encountered the lake near Pelican Creek as they moved south along the Yellowstone River on September 24, 1869. They eventually followed the western shoreline to West Thumb before moving west to the geyser basins. Cook described the lake at Pelican Creek as follows:

The main body is ten miles long from east to west and sixteen miles long from north to south, but at the south end it puts out two arms, one to the southeast and the other to the southwest, making the entire length about 30 miles ... There are three small islands which are also heavily timbered ... The shallow water in some of the coves affords feeding ground for thousands of water fowl and we can take our choice of ducks, geese, trout, pelican or swan.
The Washburn party was the first to describe the remote eastern and southern shorelines of the lake. From September 3, 1870, to September 17, 1870, the Washburn party traveled from the outlet of the lake around the northern, eastern, and southern shorelines to West Thumb . The September 4, 1870 journal entry of Lieutenant Gustavus C. Doane, the leader of the U.S. Army escort during the expedition, describes the lake as follows:

On the south side, these promontories project far into the lake in great numbers, dividing it into bays and channels. On the west side is a low bluff of the timbered ridges, with a sand beach in front along the margins of the waters. The greatest width of open water in any direction is about eighteen miles. Several islands are seen, one of which is opposite the channel of the river and five miles from the east shore; another is ten miles farther south, and two miles from the shore a mountain isle with a bold bluff all around to the water&#x27;s edge. These islands doubtless have never been trodden by human footsteps, and still belong to the regions of the unexplored. We built a raft for the purpose of attempting to visit them, but the strong waves of the lake dashed it to pieces in an hour. Numerous steam jets pour out from the bluffs on the shore at different points. The waters of the lake reflect a deep blue color, are clear as crystal, and doubtless of great depth near the center. The extreme elevation of this great body of water, 7,714 3/5 feet, is difficult to realize. Place Mount Washington, the pride of New England, with its base at the sea level, at the bottom of the lake, and the clear waters of the latter would roll 2,214 feet above its summit. With the single exception of Lake Titticaeca, Peru, it is the highest great body of water on the globe. No shells of any description are found on the lake shore, nor is there any evidence of the waters ever having stood at a much higher level than the present. Twenty-five feet will cover the whole range of the water-marks. Its annual rise and falls are about two feet. Its waters abound with trout to such an extent that the fish at this season are in poor condition, for want of food. No other fish are seen; no minnows, and no small trout. There are also no clams, crabs, nor turtles -- nothing but full-grown trout. These could be caught in mule loads by wading out a few feet in the open waters at any point with a grasshopper bait. Two men could catch them faster than half a dozen could clean and get them ready for the frying pan. Caught in the open lake, their flesh was yellow; but in bays, where the water was strongly impregnated with chemicals, it was blood-red. Many of them were full of long white worms, woven across the interior of the body, and through to the skin on either side. These did not appear to materially affect the condition of the fish, which were apparently as active as the others.
The Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 provided the most detailed and scientific descriptions of the lake in the pre-park era. The Hayden party, 34 men in all, encountered the lake at the outlet on July 28, 1871, spending two days there and returned to the lake at West Thumb on August 7, 1871. From West Thumb, the survey party took 15 days to explore the southern and eastern flanks of the lake. On July 28, 1871, they launched &quot;Annie&quot;, the first European boat ever to sail on the lake and began exploring the islands and shoreline. Additionally, the first ever photographs of the lake were taken during this expedition by William Henry Jackson.

In correspondence that was Hayden&#x27;s Report No. 7 to Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Spencer Baird, a bit of which is excerpted below, Dr. Ferdinand V. Hayden described some of the explorations being conducted on the lake as follows:

Yellowstone Lake, WY August 8th, 1871 - Dear Professor Baird, Your letters of June 6th and July 3rd were brought us from Fort Ellis by Lt. Doane who has just arrived to take command of our escort and accompany my party the remainder of the season ... We arrived at the banks of the Yellow Stone Lake &quot;&quot; July 26th [actually July 28] and pitched our camp near the point where the river leaves the Lake. Hence we brought the first pair of wheels that ever came to the Lake with our Odometer. We launched the first Boat on the Lake, 4.5 feet wide and 11 feet long, with sails and oars ... A chart of this soundings will be made. Points have been located with a prismatic compass all around the Lake. A man stands on the shore with a compass and takes a bearing to the man in the Boat as he drops the lead, giving a signal at the time. Then a man in the Boat takes a bearing to the fixed point on the shore where the first man is located and thus the soundings will be located on the chart. Henry Elliot and Mr. Carrington have just left in our little boat, the &quot;Annie&quot;. [They] will make a systematic sketch of the shore with all its indentations, with the banks down, indeed, making a complete topographical as well as a pictorial sketch of the shores as seen from the water, for a circuit--of at least 130 miles ... One of the islands has been explored. We have called it Stevenson&#x27;s Island as he was undoubtedly the first human that ever set foot upon it ... Write at once. Yours Truly, F. V. Hayden, I will send you some Photographs soon.

===Proposals to dam the lake===
Between 1920 and 1937, multiple proposals were made to Congress and the Department of the Interior to construct dams of various sizes at the Yellowstone Lake outlet or a few miles downstream. Montana and Wyoming politicians, the Army Corps of Engineers and lobbying groups in both states all had a variety of reasons to support the dams—flood control in the Yellowstone Valley, reclamation, or diversion of water over the continental divide to the Snake River. All the proposals and legislation were eventually defeated.

==Geology==

In the southwest area of the lake, the West Thumb Geyser Basin is easily accessible to visitors. Geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs are found both alongside and in the lake.

As of 2004, the ground under the lake has started to rise significantly, indicating increased geological activity, and limited areas of the national park have been closed to the public. As of 2005, no areas are currently off limits aside from those normally allowing limited access such as around the West Thumb Geyser Basin. There is a &quot;bulge&quot; about long and high under a section of Yellowstone Lake, where there are a variety of faults, hot springs and small craters. Seismic imaging has recently shown that sediment layers are tilted, but how old this feature is has not yet been established.

After the magma chamber under the Yellowstone area collapsed 640,000 years ago in its previous great eruption, it formed a large caldera that was later partially filled by subsequent lava flows (see Yellowstone Caldera). Part of this caldera is the basin of Yellowstone Lake. The original lake was higher than the present-day lake, extending northward across Hayden Valley to the base of Mount Washburn.

It is thought that Yellowstone Lake originally drained south into the Pacific Ocean via the Snake River. The lake currently drains north from its only outlet, the Yellowstone River, at Fishing Bridge. The elevation of the lake&#x27;s north end does not drop substantially until LeHardy Rapids. Therefore, this spot is considered the actual northern boundary of Yellowstone Lake. Within a short distance downstream the Yellowstone River plunges first over the upper and then the lower falls and races north through the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.

In the 1990s, geological research determined that the two volcanic vents, now known as &quot;resurgent domes&quot;, are rising again. From year to year, they either rise or fall, with an average net uplift of about one inch per year. During the period between 1923 and 1985, the Sour Creek Dome was rising. In the years since 1986, it has either declined or remained the same. The resurgence of the Sour Creek dome, just north of Fishing Bridge is causing Yellowstone Lake to &quot;tilt&quot; southward. Larger sandy beaches can now be found on the north shore of the lake, and flooded areas can be found in the southern arms.

The Hayden Valley was once filled by an arm of Yellowstone Lake. As a result, it contains fine-grained lake sediments that are now covered with glacial till left from the most recent glacial retreat 13,000 years ago. Because the glacial till contains many different grain sizes, including clay and a thin layer of lake sediments, water cannot percolate readily into the ground. This is why the Hayden Valley is marshy and has little encroachment of trees.

==Ecology==

===Fish===
Non-native lake trout were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994, and were believed to have been either accidentally or intentionally introduced as early as 1989 with fish taken from Lewis Lake. The introduction of Lake trout has caused a serious decline in the cutthroat trout population and the National Park Service has an aggressive Lake trout eradication program on the lake. All lake trout caught by anglers must be killed. If the cutthroat trout isn’t protected from this invasive fish then ecologist predict that they could see a decline in surrounding birds and mammals that are natural predators to the cutthroat trout. The longnose sucker is an invasive fish that was believed to be introduced into the Yellowstone Lake in the late 1980s or early 1990s. With this foreign species in the Lake researchers have noticed a shift in the food chain. They have seen a rapid decline in the population of the cutthroat trout which in turn could cause other animal populations to start declining. One study found that the introduced longnose sucker competes with cutthroat trout for some of the same food sources. 

The declining population of cutthroat trout in the Yellowstone Lake can negatively impact fish predators. One in particular is the North American river otter which relies on the cutthroat fish as a prey. With a declining number of cutthroat trout in the spawning streams researchers saw a shift in the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that are linked together. 

===Other animals===
Yellowstone is home to a large concentration of mammals. Whether that be large mammals such as bison, elk, or bighorn sheep there is a variety of different animals that are native to the Yellowstone area. On the other hand Yellowstone is also home to many smaller animals, and a few that are constantly around the lake are beavers, short tailed weasels, and river otters which have previously been mentioned.

==Climate==
Yellowstone Lake has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).
==Angling and boating==
Angling for Yellowstone cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake has been a popular pastime for both subsistence and recreation since the first explorers, surveyors and tourists visited the park. During the early days of fish stocking in Yellowstone (1890–1910), Atlantic Salmon, Mountain whitefish, and Rainbow trout were stocked in the lake; none of these introduced species survived. Today only native cutthroat and non-native lake trout and Longnose sucker exist in the lake. Today, Yellowstone Lake is open for angling during the entire Yellowstone angling season (Memorial Day weekend thru Oct 31). All Cutthroat trout caught must be released.

Recreational boating has been permitted on the lake in various forms since 1890 when the first permits for the &quot;Yellowstone Boat Company&quot; were issued to operate a ferry across the lake between road junctions. Today, powerboats, sailboats, canoes and kayaks are allowed on the lake with a Yellowstone Boating Permit. A Marina is operated at Bridge Bay and there is a boat ramp at Grant Village on the West Thumb. Areas in the southern arms of the lake are speed-restricted and/or no-motor zones to protect sensitive wildlife areas. Access to some of the lake&#x27;s islands is also restricted. Xanterra Parks and Resorts at Bridge Bay Marina on Yellowstone Lake provides boat rentals and other boating services. Numerous outfitters operating outside the park are licensed to provide boating services in the park. Several dozen backcountry campsites line the southern shoreline that is accessible only by boat. Two major hiking trails provide access to the lake shore away from the major road. The &quot;Nine Mile Post&quot; trail hugs the eastern shoreline into the Thorofare region and intersects with the &quot;Trail Creek&quot; and &quot;Heart Lake&quot; trails that touch the ends of both the south and southeast arms of the lake.

<doc id="356933" wikidata="Q657595" url="?curid=356933" title="Mignon">
<text>Mignon () is an 1866 &quot;opéra comique&quot; (or opera in its second version) in three acts by Ambroise Thomas. The original French libretto was by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, based on Goethe&#x27;s 1795-96 novel &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre&quot;. The Italian version was translated by Giuseppe Zaffira. The opera is mentioned in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;The Dead&quot; (in &quot;Dubliners&quot;) and Willa Cather&#x27;s &quot;The Professor&#x27;s House&quot;. Thomas&#x27;s goddaughter Mignon Nevada was named after the main character.

==Performance history==
The first performance was at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 17 November 1866. The piece proved popular: more than 100 performances took place by the following July, the 1,000th was given there on 13 May 1894, and the 1,500th on 25 May 1919.

The opera was also adapted and translated into German for performance in Berlin with Madame Lucca as Mignon. Lucca was well received, but the German critics were unhappy with the opera&#x27;s alterations to the Goethe original, so Thomas composed a shorter finale with a tragic ending, in which Mignon falls dead in the arms of Wilhelm. This ending was an attempt to make the story of the opera somewhat more similar in tone to the tragic outcome of Goethe&#x27;s. (The original version of &quot;Mignon&quot; for the Opéra-Comique had to have a happy ending, since at that time in Paris tragic operas in French were exclusively reserved for the Opéra.) Unsurprisingly, this &quot;Version allemande&quot; still failed to satisfy the German critics and proved to be a futile endeavour. As Henry Edward Krehbiel describes it, the &quot;&quot;Mignon&quot; of Carré and Barbier bears little more than an external resemblance to the &quot;Mignon&quot; of Goethe, and to kill her is wanton cruelty.&quot;

Despite his success in Paris with the French version, Thomas was asked to revise the work for the first performance at the Drury Lane Theatre in London on 5 July 1870. This version was given in Italian with recitatives (instead of spoken dialogue). The role of Mignon, originally for mezzo-soprano, was sung by a soprano (Christina Nilsson), and the role of Frédéric, originally a tenor, was sung by a contralto (Zelia Trebelli-Bettini). A second verse was added to Lothario&#x27;s aria in the first act (&quot;Fugitif et tremblant&quot; in the French version), and in the second act, a rondo-gavotte for Frédéric (&quot;Me voici dans son boudoir&quot;) was devised using the music of the &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; preceding that act, to satisfy Mme Trebelli-Bettini, who was discomfited by having to take on a role originally written for buffo tenor. Apparently, the coloratura soprano Elisa Volpini, who was to sing Philine, felt that her aria at the end of the second act (&quot;Je suis Titania&quot;) was insufficient, and another florid aria (&quot;Alerte, alerte, Philine!&quot;) was inserted after the second act &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; and before Laerte&#x27;s 6/8 Allegretto (&quot;Rien ne vaut&quot;). The finale was also much shortened. Philine&#x27;s extra aria appears to have either never been orchestrated, or the orchestration was lost or destroyed. (Most sources say that the aria was performed and not cut from the Drury Lane production, implying that Thomas must have orchestrated it.) The aria is known from several piano-vocal scores and is included as an appendix, sung by Ruth Welting with flute and harpsichord accompaniment, as part of the 1978 recording with Marilyn Horne as Mignon. The recording also includes a second appendix with the original, longer version of the finale.

The United States premiere was given on 9 May 1871 at the French Opera House in New Orleans. This was followed by a Maurice Strakosch production in Italian at the New York Academy of Music on 22 November 1871 with Christine Nilsson as Mignon, Mlle. Léon Duval as Philine, Victor Capoul as Wilhelm, and Mlle. Ronconi as Frédéric. The substantial success of the opera in London and New York has been attributed to the presence of Christine Nilsson in both productions. Nilsson also performed the role at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1883.

The versions of the opera performed outside France, in particular, those in the United States and Italy, have been in Italian (later also in French), with Mignon as a soprano or mezzo-soprano, and Frédéric as a mezzo-soprano or contralto, and with the sung recitatives and the shortened finale. More recently, in 1986, the original opéra comique version with soprano Cynthia Clarey as Mignon was revived for a production at the Wexford Festival Opera.

Noted soprano interpreters of Mignon have included Emma Albani (Covent Garden&#x27;s first Mignon in 1874), Lucrezia Bori, and Geraldine Farrar; mezzo-sopranos have included Marilyn Horne, Giulietta Simionato, Frederica von Stade, Risë Stevens, and Ebe Stignani. Lily Pons was famous for singing Philine.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Time: End of the 18th century.
:Place: Germany and Italy.

===Act 1===
In the courtyard of an inn in a small German town, the wandering minstrel Lothario sings and the Gypsies dance while the townspeople watch and drink. Jarno threatens Mignon with a stick when she refuses to dance, but Lothario and Wilhelm Meister come to her aid. She thanks them and divides her bouquet of wildflowers between them. Wilhelm and Laerte have a drink together. Philine and Laerte leave, after he gives her his flowers from Mignon. Mignon tells Wilhelm she was captured by Gypsies as a child. Wilhelm decides to purchase Mignon’s freedom. Lothario comes to say goodbye to Mignon. Lothario wants Mignon to travel with him, but she stays with Wilhelm. Frédéric lovingly follows Philine in, but she also wants Wilhelm. The acting troupe is about to set off for a baron&#x27;s castle after receiving an invitation to perform there. Mignon is deeply in love with Wilhelm, but upset to see the flowers that she gave him in the hands of Philine.

===Act 2===

In Philine’s room in the baron&#x27;s castle, Philine is elated, living in the luxury and charming the baron. Laerte is heard outside, praising Philine. Wilhelm and Mignon enter. She pretends to sleep while Wilhelm and Philine sing. When the couple leave, Mignon tries on Philine’s costumes and make-up. She is jealous and exits. Frédéric enters. When Wilhelm returns for Mignon he is confronted by Frédéric. Mignon rushes in to break up their impending fight. Wilhelm decides that he cannot stay with Mignon and says goodbye to her. He leaves arm-in-arm with a jubilant Philine. Later, in the courtyard of the castle, Mignon is consumed by a jealous rage, when she hears Lothario playing the harp. He comforts the girl. Philine&#x27;s portrayal of Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is applauded in the conservatory. Mignon, in jealousy, shouts that she wishes the building would catch fire and runs out. Lothario hears her and moves toward the conservatory. After Mignon returns, Wilhelm receives her so warmly that Philine, now jealous, sends her to fetch the wildflowers in the conservatory. Wilhelm rushes to save Mignon from the fire that Lothario had set to please her, carrying her unconscious body out of the conservatory with the singed flowers still in her hand.

===Act 3===

Wilhelm has brought Mignon and Lothario to a castle in Italy which he considers buying. There an old man watches over Mignon and prays for her recovery. Antonio relates how the castle’s previous owner had gone mad after his wife had died of grief over the loss of their young daughter. Wilhelm decides to buy the castle for Mignon because it has so speeded her recovery. Mignon awakens and confesses to Wilhelm of her love for this strangely familiar place. He finally realizes that he loves her deeply and resists Philine’s attempts to win him back. Lothario re-enters and informs the couple that he is the owner of the castle and that returning here has restored his sanity. After reading a prayer found in a book in the house, Mignon realizes that she is his daughter Sperata. The three embrace happily.

<text>Charles Louis Ambroise Thomas (; 5 August 1811 – 12 February 1896) was a French composer and teacher, best known for his operas &quot;Mignon&quot; (1866) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1868).

Born into a musical family, Thomas was a student at the Conservatoire de Paris, winning France&#x27;s top music prize, the Prix de Rome. He pursued a career as a composer of operas, completing his first opera, &quot;La double échelle&quot;, in 1837. He wrote twenty further operas over the next decades, mostly comic, but he also treated more serious subjects, finding considerable success with audiences in France and abroad.

Thomas was appointed as a professor at the Conservatoire in 1856, and in 1871 he succeeded Daniel Auber as director. Between then and his death at his home in Paris twenty-five years later, he modernised the Conservatoire&#x27;s organisation while imposing a rigidly conservative curriculum, hostile to modern music, and attempting to prevent composers such as César Franck and Gabriel Fauré from influencing the students of the Conservatoire.

Thomas&#x27; operas were generally neglected during most of the 20th century, but in more recent decades they have experienced something of a revival both in Europe and the US.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Thomas was born in Metz, the youngest of four children of Martin Thomas (1770–1823) and his wife, Jeanne, &quot;née&quot; Willaume (1780–1866), both music teachers. By the age of ten he was already an experienced pianist and violinist. When he was twelve his father died, and Ambroise&#x27;s elder brother Charles moved to Paris, where he played the cello in the Opéra orchestra. In 1828, aged 17, Ambroise joined him in Paris, where he was admitted as a student by the Conservatoire de Paris. He studied the piano with Pierre Zimmerman and harmony and counterpoint with Victor Dourlen. He won premiers prix in these subjects in 1829 and 1830. He went on to study the piano with Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and composition with Jean-François Lesueur and Auguste Barbereau.

In 1832, at his second attempt, Thomas won France&#x27;s premier music prize, the Grand Prix de Rome, with his cantata &quot;Hermann et Ketty&quot;. The prize brought him three years&#x27; study at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome. During his time there he became friendly with the painter Ingres, the head of the academy, with whom he shared an admiration for both Mozart and Beethoven; he also met Berlioz, who encouraged him and wrote about him favourably. During his Italian sojourn he wrote chamber music – a piano trio, a string quintet and a string quartet – and a set of six songs, &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;Italie&quot;. After leaving Rome, Thomas stayed briefly in Germany, before returning to Paris in 1835, when he began writing for the stage.

===Composing career===

The first opera Thomas composed was &quot;La double échelle&quot; (The Double Ladder, 1837), a one-act comedy, praised by Berlioz for its &quot;extreme vivacity and wit&quot;. It was produced at the Opéra-Comique, received 247 performances, and in the next few years was given in Brussels, New Orleans, Berlin, Vienna and London.
His first full-length opera, &quot;Le perruquier de la Régence&quot; (The Regency Wigmaker, 1838) was followed in the next decade by six more, none of which made any permanent impression. During this period he also composed a ballet (&quot;La Gipsy&quot;, 1839). His first completely successful three-act opera was &quot;Le caïd&quot; (The Qaid, 1849), described by the musicologist Elizabeth Forbes as &quot;a mixture of &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;&quot;; it remained in the French operatic repertoire throughout the nineteenth century, and achieved more than four hundred performances over the next fifty years.

Thomas&#x27; next work for the Opéra-Comique, &quot;Le songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; (The Summer Night&#x27;s Dream, 1850), was also a popular success. The text, by Joseph-Bernard Rosier and Adolphe de Leuven, owes nothing to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;: Shakespeare appears as one of the characters, along with Queen Elizabeth I and Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff, the governor of &quot;Richemont&quot;, where the action takes place. The premiere in Paris was followed by productions in many European and American theatres. The work, described by &quot;The Musical Times&quot; as &quot;a little masterpiece&quot;, was frequently revived, but fell out of the repertory after the composer&#x27;s death. Later in 1850 Thomas&#x27; next opera, &quot;Raymond&quot;, was premiered. It has not survived in the operatic repertoire, but the overture became a popular orchestral showpiece. In 1851, following the death of the composer Gaspare Spontini, Thomas was elected to succeed him as a member of the Académie des Beaux Arts.

===Professor===
In 1856 Thomas was appointed professor of composition at the Conservatoire, under the directorship of Daniel Auber. He remained on the staff, as professor and subsequently director, until his death forty years later. Over these years his students included the composers Jules Massenet, Gaston Serpette, and, late in Thomas&#x27; career, George Enescu; future academics included Théodore Dubois and Charles Lenepveu; and conductors who were Thomas&#x27; students included Edouard Colonne and Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht.
During the 1850s Thomas continued to compose, writing five operas, none of which made much impression. After a fallow spell in the early 1860s he wrote &quot;Mignon&quot;, the work by which his name became most widely known. The libretto was by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, based on Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre&quot;. Forbes writes that, unusually, Thomas had the advantage of a well-judged and theatrically effective libretto, and that although in the novel Mignon dies, the happy ending works well in the opera. (A happy ending was then compulsory at the Opéra-Comique: it was another nine years before &quot;Carmen&quot; defied the convention there, ending with the death of the main character.) The strong original cast featured, in the title role, Célestine Galli-Marié, a celebrated singer who later created the part of Carmen in Bizet&#x27;s opera.

Thomas was similarly fortunate in his cast for his next success, &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1868), which starred Jean-Baptiste Faure as Hamlet and Christine Nilsson as Ophelia. The opera was distantly based on Shakespeare by way of a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, père, and Paul Meurice, further adapted as a libretto by Carré and Barbier. Although the adaptation was seen as a travesty of the play, with a ballet-divertissement (obligatory at the Opéra) and a happy ending, with Hamlet acclaimed as king, the work was successful not only in Paris but in London. Despite disparaging reviews of the libretto from English-speaking critics at the time and subsequently, the work has remained an occasional part of the operatic repertoire; later singers of Ophelia included Emma Calvé, Emma Albani, Nellie Melba and Mary Garden, and among the Hamlets have been Victor Maurel, Titta Ruffo, Mattia Battistini and more recently Sherrill Milnes, Thomas Allen and Thomas Hampson. Although Thomas had by now a reputation for musical conservatism, the score of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was innovative in one respect: its incorporation of saxophones into the instrumentation.

Later in Thomas&#x27; life his academic career largely overtook his activities as a composer, and after &quot;Hamlet&quot;, he composed only one more opera: &quot;Françoise de Rimini&quot; (1882), which was well received but did not enter the regular operatic repertoire.

===Later years===

On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 Thomas, though aged nearly sixty, volunteered to serve in the Garde Nationale. The following year Auber resigned as director of the Conservatoire, shortly before his death, and Thomas was appointed his successor. He was so widely seen as Auber&#x27;s heir apparent that the minister of education, Jules Simon, said in his letter offering Thomas the post, &quot;You are so obviously fitted for the office that if I did not nominate you I should seem to be signing your dismissal from a post already yours.&quot; As director Thomas ran an intransigently conservative regime. The music of Auber, Halévy and especially Meyerbeer was regarded as the correct model for students, and early French music such as that of Rameau and modern music, including that of Wagner were kept rigorously out of the curriculum. Thomas strove to keep progressive musicians from being appointed to the faculty of the Conservatoire – unsuccessfully in the case of César Franck, who was appointed against Thomas&#x27; wishes in 1872, but successfully as regards Gabriel Fauré whose appointment to the Conservatoire was delayed until after Thomas&#x27; death.

Thomas was, on the other hand, innovative in the running of the Conservatoire: he increased the number of classes, improved the conditions of the faculty, and expanded the curriculum to include solfège, sight-reading and compulsory orchestral practice. The faculty under Thomas included, at various times the composers Franck, Théodore Dubois, Jules Massenet and Ernest Guiraud, and the singers Pauline Viardot and Romain Bussine.

In 1889 the Opéra staged Thomas&#x27; ballet &quot;La tempête&quot; (another treatment of a Shakespeare play – &quot;The Tempest&quot;), but it made little impression. In 1894, after the 1,000th performance of &quot;Mignon&quot; at the Opéra-Comique, the octogenarian composer was embraced on the stage by Verdi, his junior by two years, before President Carnot decorated Thomas with the ribbon of the Grand-Croix de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.

Thomas died in his flat in the Conservatoire in 1896, aged 84, of congestion of the lungs. He was survived by his widow, Elvire, &quot;née&quot; Remaury (1827–1910), whom he married in 1878. He was succeeded as director of the Conservatoire by Dubois.

==Music==

Emmanuel Chabrier&#x27;s jibe, &quot;There is good music, there is bad music, and then there is Ambroise Thomas&quot; is often quoted, but, as the musicologist Richard Langham Smith observes, it is not clear whether Chabrier meant that Thomas&#x27; music was worse than bad, somewhere between good and bad, or something else. A contemporary assessment was given in the first edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1889), where Gustave Chouquet wrote of Thomas:

In the 2001 edition of &quot;Grove&quot;, Langham Smith writes, &quot;In the context of French opera of the late 19th century Thomas was a figure of considerable importance, an imaginative innovator and a master of musical characterization.&quot; Langham Smith concludes that after years of neglect, Thomas&#x27; work saw a considerable revival, beginning in the late 20th century, with major productions of &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; in France, Britain and the US.

Forbes writes that Thomas was an eclectic composer able to write in a wide variety of styles. She identifies Hérold and Auber as influences on his early works, and considers &quot;Le caïd&quot; the first of his works to show true originality, though nonetheless clearly showing the influence of Rossini. In later works, Thomas&#x27; music could still be derivative: Forbes cites &quot;Psyché&quot; (1857) as &quot;an inferior copy of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Sapho&quot;&quot; and his &quot;Le carnaval de Venise&quot; (also 1857) as imitating Victor Massé. She concludes that at his best – which he was not always – Thomas wrote delightful and individual music, was capable of orchestration that is &quot;often quite ravishing&quot;, and musically conveyed the character of the important roles strongly and clearly. &quot;If Thomas had written no stage works except &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; he would probably be more widely recognized as one of the most influential and important of French 19th-century operatic composers.&quot;

<text>A nursemaid (or nursery maid) is a mostly historical term for a female domestic worker who cares for children within a large household. The term implies that she is an assistant to an older and more experienced employee, a role usually known as nurse or nanny. A family wealthy enough to have multiple servants looking after the children would have a large domestic staff, traditionally within a strict hierarchy, and a large house (or possibly several, such as the townhouse and country house) with nursery quarters.

==History==
The term &#x27;nursemaid&#x27; has wide historical use, mostly related to servants charged with the actual care of children. In ancient usage, the terms &#x27;nursemaid&#x27; and &#x27;nurse&#x27; (as, for example, the character in Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet) are largely interchangeable. Everything that a parent ordinarily might do, especially the more onerous tasks, could be turned over to a nursemaid. Feeding very young children and supervising somewhat older children at meal times, seeing that the children are dressed properly, watching over the children as they play outside, and other such tasks could be left to a nursemaid.

==Victorian nursery maid==
The title &#x27;Nursery Maid&#x27; refers to a specific role within the hierarchy of a great house. In the 21st century, the position is largely defunct, owing to the relatively small number of households who maintain large staffs with the traditional hierarchy. In the Victorian household, the children&#x27;s quarters were referred to as the &#x27;nursery&#x27;, but the name of the responsible servant had largely evolved from &#x27;nurse&#x27; to &#x27;nanny&#x27;. The Nursery Maid was a general servant within the nursery, and although regularly in the presence of the children, would often have a less direct role in their care. The nursery maid reported to the nanny (or nurse) and assisted her in taking care of the children of the employer&#x27;s family, her duties including tidying and maintaining the nursery, lighting the nursery fires, and carrying meals, laundry, and hot water between the nursery, kitchen, and scullery. It was a junior role for young girls, working under the supervision of the experienced and usually older nanny. Nursery Maids wore a uniform, similar to the other maids in the household. In 1845 the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; published a guide to domestic servants in which it suggested that any girl could undertake the duties of a Nursery Maid, as every girl had the requisite training of &quot;snubbing and slapping&quot; either her own siblings, or the siblings of other people. Domestic service agencies supplied nursery maids and sometimes gave basic training, for which popular manuals were also published.

==Relationships==
By reason of their close involvement in most if not all the daily affairs of the children, including maintaining proper standards of behaviour, nannies and nursemaids might easily establish the close kind of relationship with the children that a mother would herself ordinarily form. In many cases this could lead to nannies being retained on the staff even after the children had grown up, or to nursemaids continuing to hold a responsible role for the adult child as a type of chaperone, as in the example of Juliet&#x27;s nurse.

Bland was born in Woolwich, south-east London, the youngest of the four children of Henry Bland, a successful commercial clerk, and his wife Mary Ann. He was baptised on 14 March 1855 at St Mary Magdalene, Woolwich.

He received his formal education in local schools.

As a young man, Bland, showed his &quot;passion was for politics&quot; by his &quot;strong interest in the political ideas raised at social protest meetings.&quot;

Bland wanted to attend the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and become an army officer, but there was not enough money after his father&#x27;s death, so he went to work as a bank clerk. Later, he went into a brush-making business that failed. After that, he worked as secretary to the General Hydraulic Power Company, parent company of the London Hydraulic Power Company.

==Marriage and mistresses==
In 1877, he met 19-year-old Edith Nesbit (1858–1924). They married on 22 April 1880 with Nesbit already seven months pregnant. They did not immediately live together as Bland initially continued to live with his mother. According to biographer, Julia Briggs,Bland continued to spend half of each week with his widowed mother and her paid companion, Maggie Doran,who also had a son by him, though Nesbit did not realize this until later that summer when Bland fell ill with smallpox. When, in 1880, Nesbit learned of her husband&#x27;s affair with Maggie, she made friends with her.

With Nesbit, Bland produced three children: Paul (1880–1940), Iris (1881-1965) and Fabian (1885–1900), who died aged 15 from a tonsil operation performed at home. Fabian had been given food before the anaesthetic for the operation.

Bland met Alice Hoatson, a friend of Nesbit, after getting her pregnant in 1886: she became their housekeeper and his mistress for the rest of his life. Bland had two children by Hoatson: Rosamund (b. 1886), his favourite, and John (b. 1899). Despite initial reluctance, they were raised by Nesbit as her own.

Given Bland&#x27;s affairs and out of wedlock children, his &quot;marriage to Edith was inevitably stormy at times.&quot;

===Bland&#x27;s licentiousness===

Bland, &quot;a poseur by nature, was something more than a philanderer by habit.&quot;
He had &quot;a voracious sexual appetite.&quot; When Nesbit met Bland, he &quot;already had a mistress with child.&quot; After Alice Hoatson joined the Bland household, &quot;he proceeded to father children on both her and Edith regularly.&quot; George Bernard Shaw described Bland as maintaining &quot;simultaneously three wives, all of whom bore him children,&quot; and two of the &quot;wives&quot; lived in the same house. To top it off, Bland &quot;was not averse to seeking to seduce&quot; the girlfriends of his daughter Rosamund.

Bland wrote that he &quot;hated the Pharisees, the Prigs, the Puritans.&quot; He smoked, and claimed to be &quot;adventurous&quot; with drugs, having taken &quot;opium in all its forms&quot; as well as other drugs.

==Fabian Society==
In 1883, the Blands joined a socialist debating group which evolved to become the (middle-class, socialist) Fabian Society in January 1884. On 4 January 1884, Bland chaired the first meeting and was subsequently elected to be the Society&#x27;s honorary treasurer, a position he held until his sight failed in 1911. With Edward Pease. Bland served as co-editor of the &quot;Fabian News&quot;, a monthly journal.

Nevertheless, &quot;he sometimes disagreed with others in the group, and over the years he had been repeatedly outmanoeuvred and overruled by Shaw, Sidney Webb, and their supporters. Fellow members included Edward Pease, Havelock Ellis, and Frank Podmore.
George Bernard Shaw described how Bland intimidated other Fabian Society members, describing him asa man of fierce Norman exterior and huge physical strength... never seen without an irreproachable frock coat, tall hat, and a single eyeglass which infuriated everybody. He was pugnacious, powerful, a skilled pugilist, and had a shrill, thin voice reportedly like the scream of an eagle. Nobody dared be uncivil to him. 

Biographer, Julia Briggs, describes Bland as &quot;an atypical Fabian&quot;:Bland was an atypical Fabian, since he combined socialism with strongly conservative opinions that reflected his social background and his military sympathies... He was also strongly opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage. At the same time he advocated collectivist socialism, wrote Fabian tracts, and lectured extensively on socialism. Bland was unconvinced by democracy and described it as &#x27;bumptious, unidealistic, disloyal… anti-national and vulgar&#x27;. 

Bland was (unlike most socialists) also an opponent of women&#x27;s rights. He wrote:Woman&#x27;s metier in the world—I mean, of course, civilized woman, the woman in the world as it is—is to inspire romantic passion... Romantic passion is inspired by women who wear corsets. In other words, by the women who pretend to be what they not quite are.

By 1900, Bland was part of the inner circle who controlled the Fabian Society. In December 1906, he and other members of the inner circle defeated H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;attempt to take over and change the Fabian Society&quot;. Bland was the Fabian delegate at the Labour Party conferences in 1908 and 1910.

&quot;The Blands&#x27; socialist principles and sympathy for the oppressed never prevented them from enjoying a thoroughly bourgeois affluence, reflected in their increasingly grand houses [and] growing numbers of servants.&quot; Their affluence began in the late 1880s when both of them were selling more of their writings.

==Other political activity==
In 1885, Bland was briefly a member of the Social Democratic Federation, but he &quot;found its programme too inflammatory.&quot;

In the 1890s, Bland supported the liberal Independent Labour Party. However, he took what some socialists saw as a reactionary position by supporting the South African Second Boer War. He wrote in December 1899 that defeat in Africa would mean &quot;starvation in every city of Great Britain&quot;, while war would &quot;overcome national flabbiness and restore the manhood of the British people.&quot; Bland&#x27;s support of Britain&#x27;s imperial interests began to make him unpopular with his fellow socialists.

Bland served for a while on the Board of Governors of the London School of Economics and Political Science.
==Journalist==
Before his journalism career, Bland had shown that he was &quot;ill-equipped for business.&quot; It was Nesbit who kept the household going financially by having her poems and stories published. With Nesbit&#x27;s support, Bland became a journalist in 1889, at first as a freelancer. In 1892, he became a regular columnist for the radical newspaper, &quot;Manchester Sunday Chronicle&quot;. His column contained &quot;amusing, sharp-eyed, and pithy&quot; comments. Critics praise Bland as having been &quot;the most forceful and influential columnist of his day&quot; who reached &quot;almost the high-water mark of English journalism.&quot;
Yet, Bland&#x27;s &quot;writings are now forgotten, except by a few historians.&quot;

By 1899, the couple were financially secure. Bland&#x27;s job as a columnist gave him &quot;a secure income for the rest of his life&quot; and Nesbit had become a successful writer. The couple lived in Well Hall House, Eltham from 1899 until Bland&#x27;s death and Nesbit until 1920. Well Hall was their finest home and it served &quot;a salon for figures in the literary political world.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
After years of suffering from heart trouble, in November 1910 Bland had &quot;a massive heart attack.&quot; The following year, his sight failed him. He had to give up lecturing and resign as treasurer of the Fabian Society. However, he continued writing his weekly column, with Alice Hoatson as his stenographer. He was dictating to her at Well Hall 14 April 1914, when he suddenly felt giddy, lowered himself to the floor, and died of a heart attack in her arms. He was buried with Catholic rites on 18 April in the family plot at Woolwich cemetery.

Regarding Bland&#x27;s legacy, Claire Tomalin has written thatBland is one of the minor enigmas of literary history in that everything reported of him makes him sound repellent, yet he was admired, even adored, by many intelligent men and women... He did not aspire to be consistent. He allowed his wife to support him with her pen for some years, but was always opposed to feminism... In mid-life, he joined the Catholic Church, a further cosmetic touch to his old-world image, but without modifying his behaviour or even bothering to attend more than the statutory minimum of masses.

<text>The Human Be-In was an event held in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park Polo Fields on January 14, 1967. It was a prelude to San Francisco&#x27;s Summer of Love, which made the Haight-Ashbury district a symbol of American counterculture and introduced the word &quot;&quot; to suburbia.

==Origins==
===Counterculture===
The Human Be-In focused the key ideas of the 1960s counterculture: personal empowerment, cultural and political decentralization, communal living, ecological awareness, higher consciousness (with the aid of psychedelic drugs), acceptance of illicit psychedelics use, and radical New Left political consciousness. The hippie movement developed out of disaffected student communities around San Francisco State University, City College and Berkeley and in San Francisco&#x27;s beat generation poets and jazz hipsters, who also combined a search for intuitive spontaneity with a rejection of &quot;middle-class morality&quot;. Allen Ginsberg personified the transition between the beat and hippie generations.

===Protests===

The Human Be-In took its name from a chance remark by the artist Michael Bowen made at the Love Pageant Rally. The playful name combined humanist values with the scores of sit-ins that had been reforming college and university practices and eroding the vestiges of entrenched segregation, starting with the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. The first major teach-in had been organized by Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Michigan, 24–25 March 1965.

==Event==
The Human Be-In was announced on the cover of the fifth issue of the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot; as &quot;A Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In&quot;. The occasion was a new California law banning the use of the psychedelic drug LSD that had come into effect on October 6, 1966. The speakers at the rally were all invited by Bowen, the main organizer. They included Timothy Leary in his first San Francisco appearance, who set the tone that afternoon with his famous phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; and Richard Alpert (soon to be known as &quot;Ram Dass&quot;), and poets like Allen Ginsberg, who chanted mantras, Gary Snyder and Michael McClure. Other counterculture gurus included comedian Dick Gregory, Lenore Kandel, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jerry Rubin, and Alan Watts. Music was provided by a host of local rock bands including Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Blue Cheer, most of whom had been staples of the Fillmore and the Avalon Ballroom. &quot;Underground chemist&quot; Owsley Stanley provided massive amounts of his &quot;White Lightning&quot; LSD, specially produced for the event, as well as 75 turkeys, for free distribution by the Diggers.

The national media were stunned, publicity about this event leading to the mass movement of young people from all over America to descend on the Haight-Ashbury area. Reports were unable to agree whether 20,000 or 30,000 people showed up at the Be-In. Soon every gathering was an &quot;-In&quot; of some kind: Just four weeks later was Bob Fass&#x27;s Human Fly-In, then the Love-In (March 26, 1967 at Elysian Park, Los Angeles), the Emmett Grogan inspired Sweep-In, Rowan and Martin&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In&quot; comedy television show began airing over NBC just a year later on January 22, 1968. This was followed by the first &quot;Yip-In&quot; (March 21, 1968, at Grand Central Terminal), another &quot;Love-In&quot; (April 14, 1968, at Malibu Canyon) and, John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Bed-In&quot; (March 25, 1969, in Amsterdam).

=== Inspiration ===
The Human Be-In was organized mainly by Bowen with the assistance of poet Allen Cohen in the organizational work. The idea of the Human Be-In was born of a fear that the movement would be erased due to tensions between factions of the Hippie movement. Bowen writes &quot;The anti-war and free speech movement in Berkeley thought the Hippies were too disengaged and spaced out. Their influence might draw the young away from resistance to the war. The Hippies thought the anti-war movement was doomed to endless confrontations with the establishment which would recoil with violence and fascism&quot;. They decided to thus create &#x27;A Gathering of the Tribes&#x27;, as the event was advertised on posters later on. This event would use musical performances , group meditation and chanting sessions, political rallies, and speeches to inspire all the factions that they had all joined this movement because they had the same beliefs: peace, love for one another, and freedom. This would be the first moment of true unification within the Hippie Movement in its history.

==Legacy==
The counterculture that surfaced at the &quot;Human Be-In&quot; encouraged people to &quot;question authority&quot; with regard to civil rights, women&#x27;s rights, and consumer rights. Underground newspapers and radio stations served as its alternative media.

A Human Be-In was put on in Denver, Colorado in July 1967 by Chet Helms and Barry Fey to harness the energy of the famed San Francisco event that occurred in January and promote their new Family Dog Productions venue, The Family Dog Denver. The event attracted 5,000 people and featured performances by Grateful Dead, Odetta and Captain Beefheart. Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey were said to have also been in attendance.

A &quot;Digital Be-In&quot; has been produced in San Francisco since 1989.

A UK theatre company, Theatre 14167 (ddmyy), (also 14167 films) takes its name from the date of the Be-In; the company subsequently produced work by Michael McClure, who read at the event.

<doc id="356955" wikidata="Q374037" url="?curid=356955" title="Max &amp; Ruby">
<text>Max &amp; Ruby is a Canadian children&#x27;s preschool animated cartoon series based on the book series by Rosemary Wells and co-produced by Nelvana Limited. The series follows two young rabbit siblings in the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1988 and 1991, the books were adapted into short films. These shorts were later remade into episodes for the television series.

&quot;Max &amp; Ruby&quot; first aired in Canada on Treehouse TV on May 3, 2002. In the United States, the series first aired on Nickelodeon on the Nick Jr. block on October 21, 2002. 130 half-hour episodes were produced. The final episode aired on April 9, 2020.

== Premise ==
&quot;Max &amp; Ruby&quot; follows two young rabbits: Max, a rambunctious and achievement-determined three-year-old and his older sister Ruby, a seldom-patient, goal-oriented and sometimes, bossy seven-year-old. The series takes place in a town called Eastbunny Hop, in a universe populated by bunnies and other creatures, in the 1940s and 1950s. According to Wells, the series shows the relationship between Ruby, Max and the universal nature of sibling relationships.

== Episodes ==

The TV series premiered in 2002, but was preceded by a 1988 and 1991 short adapting the characters for the first times. The shorts were individually produced and later remade into broadcast episodes.

== Characters ==
=== Main ===
* Max Bunny (voiced by Billy Rosemberg in seasons 1-3, Tyler Stevenson in seasons 4-5, and Gavin MacIver-Wright in seasons 6-7) is a 4-years-old (starting off at three and a half-year-old) bunny and Ruby&#x27;s younger brother. He has white fur and wears some clothes including some long overalls. Prior to seasons 3 &amp; 5 and for the first few episodes of seasons 1 and 2, Max only says 1-3 words or phrases (with the exception of a few episodes like &quot;Max&#x27;s Bedtime&quot; and &quot;Ruby&#x27;s Candy Store&quot; and of voiceover on the title card for episodes featuring Ruby). He does this again in season 5 (voiceover on the episode&#x27;s title card; except in just the ones featuring Ruby). In seasons 6 and 7, Max (along with Morris) is able to speak in full sentences.
* Ruby Bunny (voiced by Samantha Morton in seasons 1-2, Rebecca Peters in seasons 3-5, and Lana Carillo in seasons 6-7) is an 8-year-old (starting off at 7 years old) white bunny, and is Max&#x27;s older sister. She has white fur and has been considered the more level-headed of the siblings. She is also a member of the bunny scouts (a formula similar to the &quot;girl scouts&quot;).

=== Recurring ===
* Grace (voiced by Julie Lemieux) is one of Max and Ruby&#x27;s new baby siblings and Oliver&#x27;s older twin sister. Like Max, Grace likes getting dirty.
** Lemieux also voiced Oliver (the other one of Max and Ruby&#x27;s new baby siblings and Grace&#x27;s younger twin brother who, like Ruby, likes being clean) and Louise (Ruby&#x27;s best friend with tan/auburn fur who is also 7 years old).
* Mom (also known as Mrs. Bunny; voiced by Carolyn Larson) is Max and Ruby&#x27;s mother. She and Ruby are close and she trusts Ruby&#x27;s ability to help out with Max. She is Grandma and Grandpa’s daughter-in-law.
* Dad (also known as Mr. Bunny; voiced by Paul Bates) is Max and Ruby&#x27;s father. He is Grandma and Grandpa’s son.
* Grandma (voiced by Kay Hawtrey) has grey fur and is the paternal grandmother to Max and Ruby. Max and Ruby sometimes compete as to whose ideas are better in order to impress her, but in the end she likes both of their ideas equally. She is Dad&#x27;s mother and Mom&#x27;s mother-in-law.
* Louise (voiced by Julie Lemieux) is Ruby&#x27;s best friend; she is 7 years old and has tan/auburn fur.
* Baby Huffington &quot;Baby H&quot; (voiced by Julie Lemieux) is Mr. and Mrs. Huffington&#x27;s baby son and Bunny Scout Leader&#x27;s grandson.
* Mrs. Huffington (voiced by Emily Scott in seasons 1–5 and Catherine Disher in seasons 6–7) is the wife of Mr. Huffington, mother of Baby Huffington and daughter of Bunny Scout Leader.
* Mr. Huffington (voiced by John Torres) is the husband to Mrs. Huffington, father of Baby Huffington, and son-in-law of Bunny Scout Leader.

== Production ==
Nelvana Limited and Silver Lining Entertainment Limited co-produced the show for its first five seasons (in 2005, Silver Lining itself was acquired by Chorion). 9 Story Media Group overtook producing the animation from Nelvana Limited in season 3 (and continues animating the series for seasons 4 and 5 while Chorion co-produced at the same time); with season 6, Nelvana Limited still handles production of the series and also for the rest of its run.

Shortly after Chorion and its division Silver Lining Entertainment Limited both close their doors when season 5 finished production, Atomic Cartoons overtook co-producing the series, season 6 of which premiered on September 18, 2016, with a new main voice cast and theme song, along with each episode now having 2 10-minute segments per half-hour, rather than having 3 7-minute segments as in the previous five seasons.

In an interview with Nickelodeon, Wells has stated about Max and Ruby&#x27;s unseen parents that &quot;we don&#x27;t see Max and Ruby&#x27;s parents, because [she] believe[s] that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they are on their own. The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way.&quot; However, in season 6, the series finally introduced Max and Ruby&#x27;s parents.

== Telecast and home media ==
&quot;Max &amp; Ruby&quot; first aired on Treehouse TV in Canada on May 3, 2002. In the United States, the series first aired on the Nick Jr. Channel on October 21, 2002. The series also featured a British English dub that first aired on Nick Jr. in the UK and Ireland in February 2003.

Paramount Home Entertainment is the DVD distributor for the series in the United States. As of March 29, 2012, 2.9 million DVD units of the series from Nickelodeon have been sold in the U.S. These DVDs (see below) only have episodes from the first five seasons.

<text>Mount Wellington, also known as kunanyi () in palawa kani and gazetted as kunanyi / Mount Wellington, is a mountain in the south-east of Tasmania, Australia. It is the summit of the Wellington Range and is within Wellington Park reserve. Hobart, Tasmania&#x27;s capital city, is located at the foot of the mountain.

The mountain rises above sea level and is frequently covered by snow, at times even in summer, and the lower slopes are thickly forested, but crisscrossed by many walking tracks and a few fire trails. There is also a sealed narrow road to the summit, about from Hobart central business district. An enclosed lookout near the summit has views of the city below and to the east, the Derwent estuary, and also glimpses of the World Heritage Area nearly west. From Hobart, the most distinctive feature of Mount Wellington is the cliff of dolerite columns known as the Organ Pipes.

==Geology==

The low-lying areas and foothills of Mount Wellington were formed by slow geological upsurge when the whole Hobart area was a low-lying cold shallow seabed. The upper reaches of the mountain were formed more violently, as a Sill with a tabular mass of igneous rock that has been intruded laterally between layers of older rock pushing upwards by upsurges of molten rock as the Australian continental shelf tore away from Antarctica, and separated from Gondwana over 40 million years ago. A small volcanic vent was active about 300m south of the Pinnacle during Tertiary times, between 50 and 10 million years ago.

==Aboriginal history==
The Aboriginal people of the area referred to Mount Wellington as &quot;kunanyi&quot; (or &quot;ungyhaletta&quot;), &quot;poorawetter&quot; (or &quot;pooranetere&quot;, also &quot;pooranetteri&quot;). The Palawa, the surviving descendants of the original Aboriginal Tasmanians, tend to prefer the latter name. In 2013, the Tasmanian government announced a dual naming policy and &quot;kunanyi / Mount Wellington&quot; was named as one of the inaugural dual named geographic features.

==European history==
The first recorded European in the area, Abel Tasman, probably did not see the mountain in 1642, as his ship was quite a distance out to sea as he sailed up the south east coast of the island – coming closer in near present-day North and Marion Bays.

No other Europeans visited Tasmania until the late eighteenth century, when several visited southern Tasmania (then referred to as Van Diemens Land), including Frenchman Marion du Fresne (1772), Englishmen Tobias Furneaux (1773), James Cook (1777) and William Bligh (1788 and 1792), and Frenchman Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux (1792–93). In 1793 John Hayes arrived at the River Derwent, naming the mountain Skiddaw, after the mountain in the Lake District, although this name never gained popularity.

In 1798 Matthew Flinders and George Bass circumnavigated the island. While they were resting in the area Flinders named the river the River Derwent (the name Hayes had given only to the upper part of the river), Flinders referred to the mountain as &quot;Table Mountain&quot; (the name given to it by Bond and Bligh) for its similarity in appearance to Table Mountain in South Africa. d&#x27;Entrecasteaux&#x27;s men were the first Europeans to sail up the river and chart it. Later Nicholas Baudin led another French expedition in 1802, and while sheltering in the River Derwent (which they referred to as &quot;River du Nord&quot; – the name d&#x27;Entrecasteaux had given to it) Baudin also referred to the mountain as &quot;Montagne du Plateau&quot; (also named by d&#x27;Entrecasteaux). However, the British first settled in the Hobart area in 1804, resulting in Flinders&#x27; name of &quot;Table Mountain&quot; becoming more popular. Table Mountain remained its common name until in 1832 it was decided to rename the mountain in honour of the Duke of Wellington who, with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in present-day Belgium on 18 June 1815.

In February 1836, Charles Darwin visited Hobart Town and climbed Mount Wellington. In his book &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, Darwin described the mountain thus:
&quot;... In many parts the Eucalypti grew to a great size, and composed a noble forest. In some of the dampest ravines, tree-ferns flourished in an extraordinary manner; I saw one which must have been at least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds, and was in girth exactly six feet. The fronds forming the most elegant parasols, produced a gloomy shade, like that of the first hour of the night. The summit of the mountain is broad and flat, and is composed of huge angular masses of naked greenstone. Its elevation is above the level of the sea. The day was splendidly clear, and we enjoyed a most extensive view; to the north, the country appeared a mass of wooded mountains, of about the same height with that on which we were standing, and with an equally tame outline: to the south the broken land and water, forming many intricate bays, was mapped with clearness before us. ...&quot;

The first weather station was set up on Mount Wellington in 1895 by Clement Lindley Wragge.

Mount Wellington has played host to some notorious characters over time, especially the bushranger John &quot;Rocky&quot; Whelan, who murdered several travellers in the middle of the 19th century. The cave where he lived is known as &quot;Rocky Whelan&#x27;s Cave&quot;, and is an easy walk from the Springs.

===Development===
Throughout the 19th and into the 20th centuries, the mountain was a popular day-resort for residents of Hobart. To that end, many excursion huts were built over the lower slopes of the mountain. However, none of these early huts survive; they were all destroyed during the bushfires of 1967. Modern huts are open to the public at the Springs, the Pinnacle, the Chalet – a picnic spot about halfway between the Springs and the Pinnacle – and elsewhere. Many of the more remote huts have suffered from vandalism, and some are virtually derelict.

The road to the summit was constructed in the early 1930s as a relief scheme for the unemployed, an idea initiated by Albert Ogilvie, the premier of Tasmania of the day. While the road is officially known as the Pinnacle Drive, it was for some time also widely known among residents of Hobart as &quot;Ogilvie&#x27;s Scar&quot; because at the time it was constructed &quot;the Mountain&quot; was heavily logged and almost bare, and the road was an all-too-obvious scar across the already denuded mountain. Today the trees have grown again, but the &quot;scar&quot; most people see today is not actually the road but a line of large rocks with no trees 50–100 m above the road, provided as an easement for power lines. The road itself was opened on 23 January 1937, after two years of work, by Governor Sir Ernest Clark.

The road carries tourist traffic during the day, and sections may be closed at any time of the year due to snowfalls or icy conditions. Halfway up this road (at 720 metres) is a picnic area called &quot;The Springs&quot;, near the site of a chalet/health spa that was destroyed by bushfire in 1967.

===Broadcast tower===
Mount Wellington was selected by many broadcasters as the site of radio and television transmitters as it provides line-of-sight transmission to a large area of Hobart and surrounding districts. 
Two steel lattice towers were erected in 1960 to deliver television services to Tasmania, these being a 104m tower known as the Post Master General tower (PMG tower) and another owned by WIN Corporation, the latter still present today. The PMG tower faced significant issues with snow and ice, and in 1982 a radome was added to protect the tower&#x27;s antennas. Planning for a replacement tower began in the late 1980s, and in 1993 plans were finalised for a new 131m concrete and steel tower to withstand the mountain&#x27;s harsh weather conditions.
Between 1994 and 1995, the new concrete and steel Broadcast Australia tower (NTA tower) was constructed, leading to the PMG tower being demolished in January 1997. The NTA tower broadcasts all of Hobart&#x27;s high-power FM radio stations, plus the digital TV services for ABC and SBS. It also has a small accommodation area at its base, with a kitchen and workshop area. The WIN tower broadcasts the digital TV services for Southern Cross, WIN Television, and Tasmanian Digital Television. The site also contains some data links from local Hobart businesses. An amateur radio repeater is also installed on the mountain.


====Cable car proposals====
An aerial cable car has been proposed for the mountain on four occasions. On 27 July 2022, the Hobart City Council rejected the planning application on 21 areas of non-compliance. The council received over 16,500 public submissions on the proposal, of which 70% were against it. The Mount Wellington Cableway Company (MWCC) then appealed to the Tasmanian Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which in November 2022 upheld the decision of the Hobart City Council, rejecting the proposal on 18 of 26 contested grounds of refusal. The MWCC has not submitted an appeal to the decision.

==Climate==
The summit of the mountain has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;; Trewartha &quot;Ftkk&quot;) according to the standard Köppen–Geiger and Trewartha climate classification systems, as a maritime polar climate according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology classification system. Using Otto Nordenskjöld&#x27;s alternative polar isotherm, it could be considered to have a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) or a maritime sub(ant)arctic climate (Trewartha &quot;Eo&quot;), though extreme winds—having been recorded at sustained speeds of over , with rare gusts of up to —prevent tree cover.

Its record low temperature is recorded on 3 September 1993, low for Australia and Tasmania though not especially so, lying outside the top 10 readings and top 7 locations for the state with its exposed, maritime aspect; its average yearly record low of around places it within USDA hardiness zone 9a and Australian National Botanic Gardens hardiness zone 2. It is one of a handful of Australian locations to have never recorded a temperature above ; its highest temperature being , most recently recorded on 31 January 2020, automatically putting it within American Horticultural Society heat zone 1; the average yearly record high is around .

The mountain significantly influences Hobart&#x27;s weather, and intending visitors to the summit are advised to dress warmly against the often icy winds. Between May and October it frequently snows and the mountain is often snowcapped. Lighter snowfalls in late spring, summer and autumn are also common. A day on the summit can consist of clear sunny skies, then rain, snow, icy winds and clear again. Only in the months of January and February is it expected that fewer than 3 days will record an air frost; and its summit is one of the few sites in Australia to routinely experience sub-freezing daily maxima, with more than 1 in 10 days in both July and August expected to be ice days, and recorded the coldest daily highs in Tasmanian history at on 5 September 1995 and 11 August 2005. 

Very cold days may even occur at the height of summer, with a daily maximum of having occurred on 18 February 1994, followed by a minimum of the next morning. This was part of an extremely cold three-day spell that featured the following daily minima and maxima: low / high [17/02/1994], low / high [18/02/1994], low / high [19/02/1994].

<doc id="356969" wikidata="Q1385100" url="?curid=356969" title="Geoffrey Palmer (politician)">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Winston Russell Palmer (born 21 April 1942) is a New Zealand lawyer and former politician who was a member of Parliament from 1979 to 1990. He served as the 33rd prime minister of New Zealand for a little over a year, from August 1989 until September 1990, leading the Fourth Labour Government. As minister of justice from 1984 to 1989, Palmer was responsible for considerable reforms of the country&#x27;s legal and constitutional framework, such as the creation of the Constitution Act 1986, New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, Imperial Laws Application Act 1988, and the State Sector Act 1988. He served as president of the New Zealand Law Commission, from 2005 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
Palmer was born in Nelson and attended Nelson Central School, Nelson Intermediate School and Nelson College. At Victoria University of Wellington, he studied both political science and law. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1965. After working for a time in Wellington, he attended the University of Chicago Law School, gaining a Juris Doctor in 1967. He moved from New Zealand to Iowa in August 1969 to become a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law. In his first year, he taught the newly adapted small-section courses of American Property law, Conflict Resolution, and International law. He also developed the curriculum for a Torts course to be taught during the second year of law school. This was the first course of its kind in the United States and he was granted tenure in his second year of teaching at the college. In 1972, he left to be a visiting professor at the University of Virginia College of Law. Eventually, in 1974, he was appointed to a professorship of law at Victoria University of Wellington, bringing him back to New Zealand. At the 1975 general election, Palmer took part in the &quot;Citizens for Rowling&quot; campaign.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===


In a 1979 by-election, Palmer was elected to Parliament as the member for Christchurch Central, having stood as the Labour Party candidate. In March 1981 he was elevated to the shadow cabinet as spokesperson for constitutional affairs and associate spokesperson for justice. Following Labour&#x27;s unexpected loss at the 1981 general election Palmer gained the social welfare and accident compensation portfolios.

In 1983, Palmer stood for the deputy leadership of the party. In a three-way contest, in which all candidates were from Christchurch to reflect geographical proportionality, Palmer trailed on the first ballot to Papanui MP Mike Moore. Lyttelton MP Ann Hercus was eliminated and on the second ballot almost all of her supporters voted for Palmer, who beat Moore by one vote. He became deputy Leader of the Opposition.

When, in 1984, the Labour Party won the general elections, Palmer became Deputy Prime Minister of the Fourth Labour Government. He also became Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. The new justice minister, who had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book &quot;Unbridled Power?&quot;, also published in 1984, set up a Royal Commission to investigate the electoral system and propose modifications or alternatives. His Royal Commission reported in December 1986, recommending the mixed-member proportional representation system. After the 1987 elections, when Labour was re-elected, he also became Minister of the Environment, an area in which he took personal interest.

===Prime Minister (1989–1990)===

The most notable feature of New Zealand politics at the time was the economic change promoted by the Finance Minister, Roger Douglas. Douglas was advancing monetarist policies involving extensive privatisation of state assets and the removal of tariffs and subsidies—these reforms were dubbed &quot;Rogernomics&quot;. These policies, which contravened Labour&#x27;s basic policy platform and campaign promises, were deeply unpopular with Labour&#x27;s traditional support base, and resulted in a confrontation between Prime Minister David Lange and Roger Douglas. Lange also reneged from his promise to hold a binding referendum on the MMP system. Palmer conceded defeat on MMP at an April 1989 Labour regional conference, saying that the issue was &quot;effectively dead for the immediate future.&quot; Eventually, Douglas was removed from Cabinet, but the dispute had weakened Lange enough that he resigned a month later. Palmer, being deputy leader, took over as prime minister. Electoral reformers in the Labour Party kept up the pressure, and in September 1989, after Palmer had become prime minister, the full annual conference of the Labour Party passed a remit endorsing a referendum on the principle of proportional representation.
Palmer, however, was perceived by the public as being too closely involved with Douglas&#x27;s reforms. Of particular concern to many people was his work on the legal aspects of state sector rearrangement, such as his preparation of the State Owned Enterprises Act. The presence of David Caygill (a Douglas ally) as Minister of Finance further compounded perception that Palmer was doing nothing to address public concerns. The only area in which Palmer won praise from traditional left-wing supporters was in his handling of the Environment portfolio, which he kept when he became Prime Minister – it was his work here in initiating the resource management law reform process that eventually led to the creation of the Resource Management Act 1991.

Palmer later reflected on his brief premiership:
Two months before the 1990 elections, it was clear that Labour would not be reelected. The perceived damage done by Roger Douglas&#x27;s reforms, as well as Palmer&#x27;s lack of general charisma, caused too many Labour supporters to abandon the party. In addition, Palmer was perceived as being too academic and aloof, reminding people of the paternalistic attitude that Douglas was accused of. Palmer resigned and was replaced by Overseas Trade Minister Mike Moore, who Labour believed would give it a better chance of winning. Palmer stated he had been prepared to lead the party to a likely defeat but was just as happy to step aside: &quot;I was actually pretty pleased to get out at the end of 1990. I was quite happy to run through as PM and take the defeat, but if other people wanted to do it — be my guest!&quot;.

Palmer also chose to retire from parliament at the election, and was replaced as the Labour candidate in his seat by Lianne Dalziel. The leadership change failed, however, and the opposition National Party under Jim Bolger won a landslide victory.

Palmer became the first Labour leader to leave the party leadership without taking the party into an election since the modern party&#x27;s first leader, Alfred Hindmarsh. Of the Labour Prime Ministers (notwithstanding Hugh Watt&#x27;s tenure as interim prime minister following the death of Norman Kirk), Palmer is the only one who had not also served as Leader of the Opposition before and/or after his tenure as prime minister.

==After Parliament==
Palmer later went on to serve as Professor of Law at Victoria University again. He also held a position as Professor of Law at the University of Iowa, and worked for a time as a law consultant. While at the University of Iowa he taught courses on International law and global environment issues as well as a two-week mini course about the International Court of Justice. The MMP system which he had helped promote was adopted in a 1993 referendum. In 1994, he established Chen Palmer &amp; Partners, a specialist public law firm he began with Wellington lawyer Mai Chen. In September 2001 Palmer became a founding trustee of Motu Economic and Public Policy Research and in December 2002 was appointed to be New Zealand&#x27;s representative to the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Palmer continued his involvement with, and teaching at Victoria University of Wellington and was regularly engaged as an expert consultant on public and constitutional law issues. , Palmer is an honorary fellow in the Faculty of Law at Victoria University of Wellington, and coordinates and lectures a course on public law and constitutional values in relation to public inquiries. His son Matthew Palmer was also a prominent legal academic and public servant, and was appointed a High Court judge in 2015. Notable students of Palmer include Nicola Wheen.

===Law Commissioner===

On 1 December 2005, Palmer was appointed to the presidency of the New Zealand Law Commission (the government agency that reviews, reforms and seeks to improve the country&#x27;s laws) by the Governor-General for a term of five years. During his tenure, he persuaded the Government to engage in a programme of reviewing the old Law Commission reports with a view to actioning them. This resulted in a number of existing reports being actioned. Palmer stepped down from the Law Commission at the end of his tenure on 1 December 2010.

===UN Inquiry===
In August 2010, Palmer was chosen to chair a UN Inquiry panel into the fatal Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship participating in a Gaza-bound protest flotilla in May of that year. The panel included the outgoing Colombian President Álvaro Uribe as the Vice-chair, and representatives from Turkey and Israel. The report, released on 2 September 2011, found that Israel&#x27;s &quot;naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law,&quot; and that Israeli soldiers enforcing the blockade faced &quot;organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers&quot; when they boarded the ship. However, the report also found that the Israeli soldiers responded with &quot;excessive and unreasonable&quot; force and recommended that Israel make &quot;an appropriate statement of regret&quot; and pay compensation.

=== Constitutional reform campaign ===
In September 2016, Palmer and legal academic Andrew Butler published &quot;A Constitution for Aotearoa New Zealand&quot;. In this book the pair outlined their arguments for New Zealand to adopt a written Constitution, and also drafted out what this would look like. They then invited public submissions on the subject online and spent a year promoting the book and their campaign. The pair released a second book in 2018, &quot;Towards Democratic Renewal&quot;, that amends some of their proposal in the previous text and further argues their cause for a written Constitution, taking on board the response of the public. This campaign is ongoing.

In January 2025, Palmer proposed 12 parliamentary reforms including raising the number of legislators, increasing the number of Parliament&#x27;s sitting hours, extending the parliamentary term from three to four years, reforming the select committee system, introducing compulsory voting for general elections, lowering the voting age to 16 years, civics education in schools, appointing the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives by secret ballot, reforming the Official Information Act 1982, limiting the amount that individuals can donate to political parties, creating a public register for lobbyists, and amending the Public Service Act 2020 to require public servants to provide &quot;full and frank&quot; advice on legislative proposals and to make that advice public. 

==Honours and awards==
Palmer was appointed a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council in 1985. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1991 New Year Honours, and made an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia in the same year. In 1991 he was listed on the United Nations &quot;Global 500 Roll of Honour&quot; for his work on environmental issues. These included reforming resource management law. Palmer also sat as a Judge ad hoc on the International Court of Justice in 1995. He holds honorary doctorates from three universities. In 2008 Palmer was one of the first people appointed as Senior Counsel during the temporary change from Queen&#x27;s Counsel in the Helen Clark Government.

<text>Bob the Builder is a British animated children&#x27;s television series created by Keith Chapman for HIT Entertainment which ran from to in the United Kingdom through the CBBC strand and later CBeebies. The series centres on the adventures and escapades of a general contractor named Bob who owns a team of anthropomorphised construction vehicles that go about their day helping out the residents of Bobsville; Sunflower Valley and Fixham Harbour are featured in later seasons. They are also joined by work colleague Wendy, alongside their neighbours and friends.

The series used stop-motion animation for the original series as well as &quot;Project: Build It&quot;, provided by Hot Animation in Manchester. The series changed to CGI animation in 2010 for its final two seasons; titled &quot;Ready, Steady, Build!&quot;, of which SD Entertainment handled animation production.

Following the series&#x27; conclusion, HIT Entertainment was purchased by US toy company Mattel for $680 million. In October 2014, the company announced a new series that would feature changes in the setting, casting and character designs. The revival aired on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Milkshake!&quot; for three series from 2015–2018, and was severely criticised by fans of the original version. An animated theatrical movie adaptation of the series was announced in January 2024; which will be produced by Jennifer Lopez’s Nuyorican Productions and star Anthony Ramos as the voice of Bob.

==About==
In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasises conflict resolution, co-operation, socialisation, and various learning skills. Bob&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Can we fix it?&quot;, to which the other characters respond with &quot;Yes we can!&quot; This phrase is also the title of the show&#x27;s theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK.

==Episodes==

==Characters and voice actors==
Voice actors who have contributed to the original British version include Neil Morrissey, Rob Rackstraw, Kate Harbour, Rupert Degas, Colin McFarlane, Maria Darling, Emma Tate, Richard Briers, and June Whitfield.

Celebrities who have provided voices for the series (usually for one-off specials) include John Motson, Sue Barker, Kerry Fox, Ulrika Jonsson, Alison Steadman, Stephen Tompkinson, Elton John, Noddy Holder, and Chris Evans (Bobsville&#x27;s resident rock star Lennie Lazenby).

==International broadcasts==
&quot;Bob the Builder&quot; is shown in more than thirty countries, and versions are available in English, French, Spanish, Serbian, Swedish, Slovenian, German, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, and Croatian, among other languages. It was shown on CBeebies on BBC television in the UK. It has also aired on Nick Jr. in the UK.

The North American version of the show uses the original British footage and script, but replaces the voices with American accents and verbiage; for example, &quot;wrench&quot; is used instead of &quot;spanner&quot;, owing to the former&#x27;s use in North America. The original North American voice of Bob (and Farmer Pickles/Mr. Beasley/Mr. Sabatini) was William Dufris; he was replaced with comedian Greg Proops. More recently, Bob&#x27;s US voice has been provided by Marc Silk, an English voice actor from Birmingham. In the United States, the series first aired during the Nick Jr. block (from 2001 to 2004) before moving to PBS Kids for a long run, from January 1, 2005 through November 6, 2015, after which it was replaced with the 2015 reboot. Qubo also started airing the show from 7 October 2020 through 28 February 2021 due to the channel&#x27;s closure, but with the original British English dub.

When being exported to Japan, it was reported that characters of &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; would be doctored to have five fingers instead of the original four. This was because of a practice among the Japanese organized crime gangs, the yakuza, where members would &quot;cut off their little fingers as a sign they can be trusted and have strength of character, and will stay through.&quot;

==Impact==
&quot;Bob the Builder&quot; was nominated in the BAFTA &quot;Pre-school animation&quot; category from 1999 to 2009, and won the &quot;Children&#x27;s Animation&quot; category in 2003 for the special episode &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot;. Of the show&#x27;s success, Sarah Ball said:
&quot;Bob the Builder&quot; has been parodied by &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in the episode &quot;More Blood, More Chocolate&quot;, and by &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; as &quot;Bodgy Builder&quot;.

Bob has also been parodied on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;MAD&quot; on several occasions. In the episode &quot;S&#x27;UP / Mouse M.D.&quot;, Bob is seen with a smashed thumb and asks &quot;Can we fix it?&quot; In another episode, Bob encounters the title character of &quot;Handy Manny&quot;, whom he tells to &quot;Stop copying my show!&quot;

A New Yorker cartoon shows a parent in a toy store asking for toys depicting &quot;Alex the Architect&quot;, supposedly a white-collar equivalent to &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;.

Some have complained about technical errors and lack of proper safety practices in the programme, especially the absence of protective eyewear. However, in later episodes, Bob is seen using safety glasses.

==&quot;Project: Build It&quot;==
In May 2005, a sort of spin-off series was released titled &quot;Bob the Builder: Project: Build It&quot;. Bob hears of a contest to build a new community in a remote area called Sunflower Valley, outside of Bobsville. He moves from Bobsville (supposedly temporarily) with Wendy and the machines and builds a new Yard there. Bob convinces his father, Robert, to come out of retirement and take over the Bobsville building business. It is unknown whether Bob returned to Bobsville in the stop-motion series or not after this spin-off series was finished.

For the US version of the &quot;Project: Build It&quot; series, different actors were found to do the voices for many of the human characters, including casting Greg Proops as the new voice of Bob, and Rob Rackstraw, who played the original voices of Scoop, Muck and Travis, to be the voices of Spud the Scarecrow and Mr. Bentley for both the UK and the US. The show also added recycling and being environmentally friendly to its lessons, emphasising the phrase &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.&quot;

This series premiered on 2 May 2005 in the United Kingdom and 3 September of the same year in the United States, and was the first series made in HD 1080p.

==&quot;Ready, Steady, Build!&quot;==
The third spin-off was titled &quot;Bob the Builder: Ready, Steady, Build!&quot; It was created by Keith Chapman and Mallory Lewis. The group, now joined by newcomer Scratch are now residing in the town of Fixham Harbour (which is very similar to Bobsville, and is even implied to be Bobsville in several episodes), deal with construction and other building tasks around the area. Unlike the previous series, &quot;Ready, Steady, Build!&quot; is animated in full CGI animation, which allows for larger and more elaborate construction projects that would be too large or expensive for the model sets of the stop-motion series, though it still retains the theme song.

==Merchandise==

Various companies manufacture licensed &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; merchandise (e.g.: Brio, Lego Duplo, Hasbro, Learning Curve, etc.) since about 1999 to present. Sometimes some fans make fan-made merchandise for the television show, such as racing games that are not related to the show.

===Lego Duplo/Explore===
Lego began manufacturing licensed Duplo &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; sets in 2001. Lego Explorer also made the sets using the same bricks that Duplo used (e.g. Naughty Spud, Wallpaper Wendy, etc.). The sets were aimed at younger children, two and up. Duplo manufactured the sets (e.g. Scoop at Bobland Bay, Muck Can Do It, etc.) until 2009 when Lego&#x27;s contract expired.

===Hasbro===
Hasbro created licensed &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; characters. They included talking characters and others to go with the &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; line. The Hasbro line was discontinued in 2005 when Learning Curve took over.

===Learning Curve===
Learning Curve among countless others held a license to make the toys, but discontinued them. They first merchandised their &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; products in 2005 after the Hasbro range was discontinued. Learning Curve also created the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; characters, while the company still makes the sets (e.g. Scoop, Muck, Lofty, Dizzy, Andy&#x27;s trailer etc.) and then sold them to stores. They discontinued them in 2010 and it is unknown if they could ever return to making them. The toys are currently available in the United Kingdom by Character Options.

===Character World===
In 2012, Character World announced that they had signed a license to manufacture official &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; bedding and bedroom textiles. A duvet cover is said to be available in the UK in late 2012.

===Video games===
Various video game publishers released &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; video games throughout the 2000s:

* &quot;Can We Fix It?&quot; (PC, PS1, NTSC/PAL) - 2001

In the United States, &quot;Bob the Builder: Can We Fix It?&quot;″s computer version sold 350,000 copies and earned $6.1 million by August 2006, after its release in August 2001. It was the country&#x27;s 50th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; computer games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 520,000 units in the United States by the latter date.

===Kiddie rides===
Jolly Roger (Amusement Rides) Ltd. released two kiddie rides based on the series, a Scoop in January 2000, and a Roley in March 2003. In March 2003, Scoop was re-released with a new dashboard and a Stamar soundboard. Then, in 2004, versions of both rides were released with video screens.

<text>Archibald Alison (13 November 175717 May 1839) was a Scottish Anglican priest and essayist.

==Early life==
He was born in Edinburgh, to Patrick Alison a Edinburgh magistrate, himself a younger son of an Alison of Newhall, near Coupar Angus.

After studying at the University of Glasgow, where he established his lifelong friendship with Dugald Stewart, he studied civil law at Balliol College, Oxford. He was ordained in the Church of England as deacon in 1779 and as priest in 1782. He was appointed in 1778 to the curacy of Brancepeth, near Durham. In 1784 he married Dorothea Gregory, youngest daughter of Professor John Gregory of Edinburgh. She had escaped an arranged marriage designed by her employer Elizabeth Montagu to marry her to her nephew and heir when she met Alison.

==Career==
The next 20 years of his life were spent in England, where he held in succession the livings of High Ercall, West Lavington, Rodington and Kenley. From 1791 until his death, he held the title of Prebendary to Salisbury Cathedral. 

In 1800 he moved back to Edinburgh, having been appointed senior incumbent of episcopalian St Paul&#x27;s Chapel in the Cowgate. For 34 years he filled this position with much ability; his sermons were characterised by quiet beauty of thought and grace of composition. His preaching attracted so many hearers that a new and larger church was built for him. The new St Paul&#x27;s Chapel on York Place in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town was completed in 1818, and Alison, along with Rev Robert Morehead served as clergy there.

In 1832 he was living at 44 Heriot Row in Edinburgh&#x27;s city centre. His last years were spent at Colinton near Edinburgh, where he died on 17 May 1839. He was interred at St John&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard in Edinburgh.

==Family==

He married Dorothea Gregory, the sister of James Gregory in 1784. She died in 1830. Their sons included Sir Archibald Alison, 1st Baronet and William Pulteney Alison.

==Works==

Alison published, besides a &quot;Life of Lord Woodhouselee&quot;, a volume of sermons, which passed through several editions, and a work entitled &quot;Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste&quot; (1790), based on the principle of association of ideas.

<text>Washington Allston (November 5, 1779 – July 9, 1843) was an American painter and poet, born in Waccamaw Parish, South Carolina. Allston pioneered America&#x27;s Romantic movement of landscape painting. He was well known during his lifetime for his experiments with dramatic subject matter and his bold use of light and atmospheric color. While his early artworks concentrate on grandiose and spectacular aspects of nature, his later pieces represent a more subjective and visionary approach.

==Biography==

Allston was born on a rice plantation on the Waccamaw River near Georgetown, South Carolina. His mother Rachel Moore had married Captain William Allston in 1775, though her husband died in 1781, shortly after the Battle of Cowpens. Moore remarried to Dr. Henry C. Flagg, the son of a wealthy shipping merchant from Newport, Rhode Island.

Named in honor of the leading American general of the Revolution, Washington Allston graduated from Harvard College in 1800 and moved to Charleston, South Carolina, for a short time before sailing to England in May 1801. He was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in London in September, when painter Benjamin West was then the president.

From 1803 to 1808, he visited the great museums of Paris and then, for several years, those of Italy, where he met Washington Irving in Rome and Coleridge, his lifelong friend. In 1809, Allston married Ann Channing, sister of William Ellery Channing. Samuel F. B. Morse was one of Allston&#x27;s art pupils and accompanied Allston to Europe in 1811. After traveling throughout western Europe, Allston finally settled in London, where he won fame and prizes for his pictures.

Allston was also a published writer. In London in 1813, he published &quot;The Sylphs of the Seasons, with Other Poems&quot;, republished in Boston, Massachusetts, later that year. His wife died in February 1815, leaving him saddened, lonely, and homesick for America.

In 1818, he returned to the United States and lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for twenty-five years. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1826. He was the uncle of the artists George Whiting Flagg and Jared Bradley Flagg, both of whom studied painting under him.

The first American exhibition of Allston&#x27;s work was in 1827 when twelve of his paintings were shown at the Boston Athenæum. Allston also exhibited five paintings at the National Academy of Design, but this number is low given his place in the artistic community of the time. Four of his paintings were engraved and published in &quot;The Atlantic Souvenir&quot; and &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift books in the 1820s and 30s. Among them were &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;The Mother and Child&quot;, the latter being considered by Allston to be one of his best works.

In 1830 Allston married Martha Remington Dana (daughter of Chief Justice Francis Dana), the sister of the novelist Richard Henry Dana Sr.; Dana was a cousin of Allston&#x27;s first wife.

In 1841, he published &quot;Monaldi,&quot; a romance illustrating Italian life, and in 1850, a volume of his &quot;Lectures on Art, and Poems&quot;. He worked for years on what he envisioned would be his masterpiece: a painting called &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;; he died before finishing it.

Allston died on July 9, 1843, at age 63. Allston is buried in Harvard Square, in the Old Burying Ground between the First Parish Church and Christ Church.

==Recognition==

Allston was sometimes called the &quot;American Titian&quot; because his style resembled the great Venetian Renaissance artists in their display of dramatic color contrasts. His work greatly influenced the development of U.S. landscape painting. Also, the themes of many of his paintings were drawn from literature, especially Biblical stories.

His artistic genius was much admired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Ralph Waldo Emerson was strongly influenced by his paintings and poems, but so were both Margaret Fuller and Sophia Peabody, wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The influential critic and editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold dedicated his famous anthology &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; to Allston in 1842. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 17 years after Allston&#x27;s death, wrote that: &quot;One man may sweeten a whole time. I never pass through Cambridge Port without thinking of Allston. His memory is the quince in the drawer and perfumes the atmosphere.&quot;

Boston painter William Morris Hunt was an admirer of Allston&#x27;s work, and in 1866 founded the Allston Club in Boston, and in his arts classes passed on to his students his knowledge of Allston&#x27;s techniques. Contemporary critic James Miller of the same city held him in high regard, saying, &quot;He labors in the highest walks of art.&quot; Another contemporary critic, John Neal of &quot;The Yankee&quot;, felt Allston had unrealized talent: &quot;Mr. Allston&#x27;s faculties are a very uncommon union of the bold and beautiful&quot;, and yet he lacks &quot;that sort of inward fervor which flashes into spontaneous combustion, whenever it is excited or exasperated.&quot; Historian David S. Lovejoy nevertheless judged Allston &quot;doubtless the finest American romantic painter&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites Allston as the first to use the term &quot;Objective Correlative&quot; in 1850. The term, subsequently made famous by T.S Eliot in essay on &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1919), denotes a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of a particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.

The west Boston, Massachusetts neighborhood of Allston is named after him, as is Allston Way, in the &quot;Poets Corner&quot; neighborhood of Berkeley, California.

<text>Julianna Margulies (; born June 8, 1966) is an American actress. After several small television roles, Margulies received wide recognition for her starring role as Carol Hathaway in the NBC medical drama series &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2000; 2009), for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award and six Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to four Golden Globe Award nominations. In 2009, she took on the lead role of Alicia Florrick in the CBS legal drama series &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2009–2016). Her performance garnered critical acclaim, winning an additional two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Television Critics Association Award.

Margulies also had roles in the TNT miniseries &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (2001), the HBO crime drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2006–2007), the National Geographic miniseries &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; (2019), and as Laura Peterson in the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (2021–2023).

She starred in the adventure film &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000), the drama film &quot;Evelyn&quot; (2002), the supernatural horror film &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (2002), the action horror film &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; (2006), the comedy drama film &quot;City Island&quot; (2009), the crime comedy film &quot;Stand Up Guys&quot; (2012), and the comedy drama film &quot;The Upside&quot; (2017).

Margulies has received one Golden Globe Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and eight Screen Actors Guild Awards, making her the second most awarded woman ever within SAG after Julia Louis-Dreyfus. She is also the recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2015, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

==Early life and education==
Julianna Margulies was born in Spring Valley, New York, the youngest of three daughters. Her mother Francesca ( Goldberg, later Gardner) was a ballet dancer and eurythmy teacher. Her father Paul Margulies was a writer, philosopher, and Madison Avenue advertising executive. Her parents were both Jewish, descendants of Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Russia. They divorced when she was a year old.

In her memoir, &quot;Sunshine Girl&quot;, Margulies wrote that her parents both adhered to the teachings of anthroposophy. Margulies, herself, has said that she does not hold religious beliefs, although she is ethnically Jewish and teaches the traditions to her son. In a 2013 interview, she said, &quot;I would say if I had a religion, it would be gratitude…I love the tradition of Judaism that on Friday nights, Shabbat means &#x27;Goodbye to the workweek; hello to family and the weekend.&#x27;&quot;

In her memoir, Margulies also wrote about her difficult, nomadic childhood. She is from New York City, but she moved with her mother to different countries and states throughout her youth, including Sussex, England, and Paris, France. As a result, French was Margulies&#x27; first language. She has since lost the ability to speak it fluently.

In the book, Margulies described her childhood as ultimately loving, but unpredictable and unstable. She detailed many emotionally traumatic experiences.

Margulies attended many different schools as a child, including Green Meadow Waldorf School and High Mowing School. She graduated with a degree in art history and English from Sarah Lawrence College, where she appeared in several campus plays. At Sarah Lawrence College, students select three areas of focus for coursework. Margulies focused on art history, English, and theatre. She originally enrolled in college with the goal of becoming a lawyer, like her grandmother, or a psychologist, but fell in love with the craft of acting.

==Career==
===1994–2000: &quot;ER&quot;===
Margulies made her feature film debut in Steven Seagal&#x27;s action film &quot;Out for Justice&quot; (1991), playing a prostitute. In 1994, Margulies was cast in the pilot episode of the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; as Carol Hathaway, an emergency care nurse who attempts suicide. Her character was originally intended to die; however, test audiences overwhelmingly wanted her to survive, so the producers changed the plot.

At the time she was offered &quot;ER&quot;, Margulies had also been offered an extended role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, after a two-episode appearance earlier in the year. Then-unknown actor George Clooney, who had filmed the pilot episode with Margulies, called her to let her know that he had overheard producers saying that her character might become a series regular. He encouraged her to consider waiting for &quot;ER&quot; producers to call her and not take another job. Clooney was right, and Margulies accepted the role on &quot;ER&quot; in 1994.

She remained on the show as a series regular for six seasons until 2000 and returned to the show for one episode during its final season in 2009. She won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1994, and was nominated for an Emmy Award every year during her tenure on &quot;ER&quot;. She was the only series regular cast member to win a Primetime Emmy Award. She was also nominated four times for a Golden Globe Award during the show&#x27;s tenure.

Originally, Margulies had signed a five-year contract to work on &quot;ER&quot;. She extended the contract for a sixth year, but made the &quot;very difficult, painful decision&quot; to opt out of another renewal. In 2021, she explained in her memoir, &quot;Sunshine Girl&quot;, that she had been feeling homesick for New York after spending six years filming the show in Los Angeles. She wanted to return to theatre and take on a leading role in &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, a miniseries based on the 1983 fantasy novel of the same name, which she had loved as a child.

In 2021, Margulies said during an interview with Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa, &quot;I thought, didn&#x27;t I work six years on a show I loved — I loved being on &quot;ER&quot;, I was so grateful, and it was a great experience — but didn&#x27;t I work this hard to be able to do theatre for $235 a week without worrying about my rent?&quot; She explained that, before NBC offered her $27 million to sign on for another two years, she had already helped plan out the conclusion of her character&#x27;s story arc on the show and mapped out a year&#x27;s worth of work for herself.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview with Bill Carter, Margulies shared that another factor in her decision was a desire to protect her &quot;ER&quot; character, Carol Hathaway, from certain story changes that were happening as the show continued on into later years. She explained that she didn&#x27;t like how her character became the focus of too much romance whenever she wasn&#x27;t with George Clooney&#x27;s character, and that all of the research she had previously done in order to play the character was then undone by certain storylines.

Margulies recalled, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget, there was a line [in the script] where [my character] says, &#x27;I had to share a bathroom with seven sisters.&#x27; I was like, guys, I&#x27;ve been playing her as an only child for six years…I had actually done research on what it&#x27;s like to be an only child. I was starting to feel very sad about a character I loved so much. It started to become very clear to me that without George, my character was just going to be the liaison to flashy sort of bits of things instead of one fluent, cognizant thought and I felt sad about it.&quot;

Had Margulies accepted the $27 million contract for a seventh and eighth year of &quot;ER&quot;, it would have made her one of the highest paid women on television. The actress said that she received intense, hurtful backlash for her decision to ultimately leave &quot;ER&quot;, but was &quot;doing what fed me, as an actor,&quot; she said in 2021. &quot;And keeping my promises to playwrights and directors who I&#x27;d already made a commitment to.&quot; She also said that she wanted to move on as an actress:

In an interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, she further explained, &quot;I felt like I had a great character and I did as much as I could do with her, but I was feeling bored. I wasn&#x27;t excited about the work and I certainly didn&#x27;t want to go out with a bomb, but as an inspiration.&quot;

===2000–2009===
In February 2000, Margulies hosted an episode of the NBC late-night sketch series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She brought on &quot;ER&quot; co-star Noah Wyle for one of the show&#x27;s sketches.

After leaving &quot;ER&quot; as a series regular, Margulies worked on stage and screen. On stage, she appeared in a MCC Theater production of Kate Robin&#x27;s &quot;Intrigue With Faye&quot;, a Lincoln Center production of Jon Robin Baitz&#x27;s &quot;Ten Unknowns&quot;, and &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

Her work after &quot;ER&quot; included the 2002 films &quot;Evelyn&quot;, with Pierce Brosnan, and &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, with Gabriel Byrne and Ron Eldard. She starred as Morgaine, the protagonist and narrator of the TNT miniseries &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (2001) and participated in the documentary film &quot;Searching for Debra Winger&quot; (2002).

In 2004, she guest-starred in a two-episode arc in season four of the hit NBC comedy series &quot;Scrubs&quot; as Neena Broderick, an unscrupulous lawyer who sues Turk and has a brief sexual relationship with J.D. That same year, she starred in another miniseries on TNT, &quot;The Grid&quot;. In April 2006, she appeared in four episodes of the sixth season of the HBO crime drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, portraying realtor Julianna Skiff. In August 2006, she appeared alongside Samuel L. Jackson in the action film &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;, as flight attendant Claire Miller. In December 2006, she played Jennifer Bloom in the Syfy Channel miniseries &quot;The Lost Room&quot;.

In an August 2006 interview with tvguide.com, Margulies said she was close to accepting an offer to return to &quot;ER&quot; for a four-episode arc, with Noah Wyle, that filmed in Hawaii during the 2005/06 season. However, she decided against it at the last minute. &quot;I left on very good terms with [&quot;ER&quot; exec producer] John Wells, and every year they ask me back and I love that they do,&quot; she told &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 2006. &quot;So, at the last minute, I went, &#x27;John, thank you and keep asking, because you never know, but no.&#x27;&quot; 

Margulies was invited to return during &quot;ER&quot;&#x27;s final season. The actress hesitated, saying she felt like she left Carol Hathaway in the perfect place and could not imagine bettering her departure episode, but Margulies did return to &quot;ER&quot; for one more episode during its 15th and final season. In a 2013 interview, she said of her appearance, &quot;I called George up and said, &#x27;If you do it, I&#x27;ll do it.&#x27; We were both very aware we had careers because of that show, and we also loved those characters. I remember walking on to the Warner Brothers lot, and they asked for my ID. I used to have my picture on the wall there. It was a little surreal, but a lovely way to come full circle.&quot;

Margulies had a minor role in the film &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; (2007). In 2008, Margulies starred in the legal series &quot;Canterbury&#x27;s Law&quot;, a Fox mid-season replacement show. She played the title character, Elizabeth Canterbury, a lawyer. She was also credited as a producer of the show. The series was severely affected by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike; it was cancelled by the network after only six episodes.

===2009–present: &quot;The Good Wife&quot;===

In 2009, after returning to &quot;ER&quot; for one episode during its 15th and final season, Margulies began starring in the CBS legal drama series &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. She played Alicia Florrick, an attorney returning to legal practice after her husband Peter Florrick (played by Chris Noth) resigned as Illinois State&#x27;s Attorney amid a sex and corruption scandal. She won two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for the series. Beginning in 2011, starting with the third season, Margulies was credited as a producer of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. The series ended in May 2016.

Reflecting on her roles as Alicia on &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and as Carol on &quot;ER&quot;, Margulies told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2021, &quot;I have gotten to play two of the richest, I think, female characters on television.&quot; In a 2019 interview for the Series Mania Festival, Margulies said that &quot;it&#x27;s tied between Carol Hathaway and Alicia Florrick&quot; when it comes to the role she is most proud of having played.

Since 2013, the actress has done voiceovers for a Chase credit card commercial. In 2014, Margulies narrated &quot;Women in Business&quot;, an episode of season 2 of the documentary series &quot;&quot;. In 2015, &quot;TIME&quot; featured Margulies as one of the &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;. It noted her work to get Erin&#x27;s Law, concerned with child sexual abuse, passed in every US state.

In 2018, Margulies co-starred in the dark comedy series &quot;Dietland&quot; on AMC, which was cancelled after one season despite positive reviews. In 2019, she starred in the National Geographic series &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;, as Dr. Nancy Jaax. The limited series became the highest-rated scripted series in National Geographic&#x27;s history and ranking second among all series.

In 2019, Margulies was slated to reprise the role of Alicia Florrick for three episodes of &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. However, negotiations broke down over the question of Margulies&#x27; salary, with CBS offering to pay her at the guest star rate instead of the same rate she had been paid on &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. She stated that: &quot;I watch the show, I love the show. But I&#x27;m not a guest star. You don&#x27;t pay me a guest-star salary. I would get a guest-star salary if I went and did &quot;SVU&quot;—it&#x27;s not my show. I wouldn&#x27;t ask for what I got paid as Alicia Florrick. I also know for a fact that any male star who got asked to go on a spinoff of his show would have been offered at least $500,000. I know that for a fact.&quot;

In November 2019, Margulies guest starred in the Showtime drama series &quot;Billions&quot;. In December 2020, she joined the second season of the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. She joined returning series stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.

In 2021, Margulies appeared with many of her former &quot;ER&quot; cast members in a virtual cast reunion show that benefited the Waterkeeper Alliance charity.

In 2024, Margulies returned to Broadway, portraying Delia Ephron in a new play based on Ephron&#x27;s life titled &quot;Left on Tenth&quot;.

==Writing==

Margulies published a picture book with Random House Children&#x27;s Books in May 2016. Titled &quot;Three Magic Balloons&quot;, the story is based on one that the actress&#x27;s father, Paul Margulies, wrote for her and her sisters. In October 2020, Margulies announced on her Instagram that she was writing an autobiography, &quot;Sunshine Girl: An Unexpected Life&quot;, published by Ballantine Books. She had originally intended to write an acting handbook about set etiquette, but ended up writing a memoir, instead. The book chronicles her nomadic childhood and journey to becoming an actress. Her book was released on May 4, 2021. Margulies also recorded the audiobook. A paperback version with additional chapters is set to be released in May 2022.

==Personal life==
From 1991 to 2003, Margulies was in a relationship with actor Ron Eldard, whom she met in an acting class.

On November 10, 2007, Margulies married attorney Keith Lieberthal, the son of academic Kenneth Lieberthal, in Lenox, Massachusetts. They have a son, Kieran Lindsay Lieberthal, who was born in 2008. They reside in Manhattan. The couple also owns a country house in Upstate New York.

Margulies is on the board of the MCC Theater Company in New York City. She is also a supporter of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through Project ALS, as well as Erin&#x27;s Law. In 2022, she hosted the Physicians for Human Rights virtual gala, &quot;A Celebration of Health and Human Rights Heroes&quot;.

Margulies created the educational program Holocaust Educator School Partnership (HESP) at the Museum of Jewish Heritage as a way to promote Holocaust education in schools. In June 2023, she spoke about her experience as an actress from a Jewish background at a panel discussion at the Paley Center for Media on the topic of &quot;Jewish Representation on Television&quot;. In October 2023, she was one of many Hollywood signatories of a letter calling on President Joe Biden to work toward the release of all Israeli hostages after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. In January 2024, she signed an open letter calling on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to include Jews in its representation and inclusion standards.

In 2023, Margulies faced backlash from comments she made in a discussion of antisemitism and the Israel–Hamas conflict on &quot;The Back Room with Andy Ostroy&quot; podcast. Seemingly referencing an instance where what she described as a &quot;Black lesbian club&quot; on the Columbia University campus discouraged Zionists from attending a film screening, Margulies was quoted as saying &quot;As someone who plays a lesbian journalist on &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, I am more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew, to be honest with you&quot; and that to Hamas, members of that group would be &quot;even lower than the Jews – (a) you&#x27;re Black, and (b) you&#x27;re gay. And you&#x27;re turning your back against the people who support you?&#x27; Because Jews, they rally around everybody.&quot; Margulies later released a statement, saying, &quot;I am horrified by the fact that statements I made on a recent podcast offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect. I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone&#x27;s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop.&quot;

<text>A pleural effusion is accumulation of excessive fluid in the pleural space, the potential space that surrounds each lung.
Under normal conditions, pleural fluid is secreted by the parietal pleural capillaries at a rate of 0.6 millilitre per kilogram weight per hour, and is cleared by lymphatic absorption leaving behind only 5–15 millilitres of fluid, which helps to maintain a functional vacuum between the parietal and visceral pleurae. Excess fluid within the pleural space can impair inspiration by upsetting the functional vacuum and hydrostatically increasing the resistance against lung expansion, resulting in a fully or partially collapsed lung.

Various kinds of fluid can accumulate in the pleural space, such as serous fluid (hydrothorax), blood (hemothorax), pus (pyothorax, more commonly known as pleural empyema), chyle (chylothorax), or very rarely urine (urinothorax) or feces (coprothorax). When unspecified, the term &quot;pleural effusion&quot; normally refers to hydrothorax. A pleural effusion can also be compounded by a pneumothorax (accumulation of air in the pleural space), leading to a hydropneumothorax.

==Types==
Various methods can be used to classify pleural fluid.
By the origin of the fluid:
* Serous fluid (hydrothorax)
* Blood (haemothorax)
* Chyle (chylothorax)
* Pus (pyothorax or empyema)
* Urine (urinothorax)

By pathophysiology:
* Transudative pleural effusion
* Exudative pleural effusion

By the underlying cause (see next section).

== Causes ==
=== Transudative ===
The most common causes of transudative pleural effusion in the United States are heart failure and cirrhosis. Nephrotic syndrome, leading to the loss of large amounts of albumin in urine and resultant low albumin levels in the blood and reduced colloid osmotic pressure, is another less common cause of pleural effusion. Pulmonary emboli were once thought to cause transudative effusions, but have been recently shown to be exudative.
The mechanism for the exudative pleural effusion in pulmonary thromboembolism is probably related to increased permeability of the capillaries in the lung, which results from the release of cytokines or inflammatory mediators (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor) from the platelet-rich blood clots. The excessive interstitial lung fluid traverses the visceral pleura and accumulates in the pleural space.

Conditions associated with transudative pleural effusions include:
* Congestive heart failure
* Liver cirrhosis
* Severe hypoalbuminemia
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Acute atelectasis
* Myxedema
* Peritoneal dialysis
* Meigs&#x27;s syndrome
* Obstructive uropathy
* End-stage kidney disease

=== Exudative ===
When a pleural effusion has been determined to be exudative, additional evaluation is needed to determine its cause, and amylase, glucose, pH and cell counts should be measured.
* Red blood cell counts are elevated in cases of bloody effusions (for example after heart surgery or hemothorax from incomplete evacuation of blood).
* Amylase levels are elevated in cases of esophageal rupture, pancreatic pleural effusion, or cancer.
* Glucose is decreased with cancer, bacterial infections, or rheumatoid pleuritis.
* pH is low in empyema (&lt;7.2) and maybe low in cancer.
* If cancer is suspected, the pleural fluid is sent for cytology. If cytology is negative, and cancer is still suspected, either a thoracoscopy, or needle biopsy of the pleura may be performed.
* Gram staining and culture should also be done.
* If tuberculosis is possible, examination for &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (either a Ziehl–Neelsen or Kinyoun stain, and mycobacterial cultures) should be done. A polymerase chain reaction for tuberculous DNA may be done, or adenosine deaminase or interferon gamma levels may also be checked.

The most common causes of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial pneumonia, cancer (with lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma causing approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions), viral infection, and pulmonary embolism.

Another common cause is after heart surgery when incompletely drained blood can lead to an inflammatory response that causes exudative pleural fluid.

Conditions associated with exudative pleural effusions:
* Parapneumonic effusion due to pneumonia
* Malignancy (either lung cancer or metastases to the pleura from elsewhere)
* Infection (empyema due to bacterial pneumonia)
* Trauma
* Pulmonary infarction
* Pulmonary embolism
* Autoimmune disorders
* Pancreatitis
* Ruptured esophagus (Boerhaave&#x27;s syndrome)
* Rheumatoid pleurisy
* Drug-induced lupus

=== Other/ungrouped ===
Other causes of pleural effusion include tuberculosis (though stains of pleural fluid are only rarely positive for acid-fast bacilli, this is the most common cause of pleural effusions in some developing countries), autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, bleeding (often due to chest trauma), chylothorax (most commonly caused by trauma), and accidental infusion of fluids. Less common causes include esophageal rupture or pancreatic disease, intra-abdominal abscesses, rheumatoid arthritis, asbestos pleural effusion, mesothelioma, Meigs&#x27;s syndrome (ascites and pleural effusion due to a benign ovarian tumor), and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Pleural effusions may also occur through medical or surgical interventions, including the use of medications (pleural fluid is usually eosinophilic), coronary artery bypass surgery, abdominal surgery, endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy, radiation therapy, liver or lung transplantation, insertion of ventricular shunt as a treatment method of hydrocephalus, and intra- or extravascular insertion of central lines.

==Pathophysiology==
Pleural fluid is secreted by the parietal layer of the pleura by way of bulk flow and reabsorbed by the lymphatics in the most dependent parts of the parietal pleura, primarily the diaphragmatic and mediastinal regions. Exudative pleural effusions occur when the pleura is damaged, e.g., by trauma, infection, or malignancy, and transudative pleural effusions develop when there is either excessive production of pleural fluid or the resorption capacity is reduced. Light&#x27;s criteria can be used to differentiate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

== Diagnosis ==

A pleural effusion is usually diagnosed on the basis of medical history and physical exam, and confirmed by a chest X-ray. Once accumulated fluid is more than 300 mL, there are usually detectable clinical signs, such as decreased movement of the chest on the affected side, dullness to percussion over the fluid, diminished breath sounds on the affected side, decreased vocal resonance and fremitus (though this is an inconsistent and unreliable sign), and pleural friction rub. Above the effusion, where the lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing sounds and egophony. A large effusion there may cause tracheal deviation away from the effusion. A systematic review (2009) published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that dullness to conventional percussion was most accurate for diagnosing pleural effusion (summary positive likelihood ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–33.8), while the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus made pleural effusion less likely (negative likelihood ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.37).

=== Imaging ===
A pleural effusion appears as an area of whiteness on a standard posteroanterior chest X-ray. Normally, the space between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura cannot be seen. A pleural effusion infiltrates the space between these layers. Because the pleural effusion has a density similar to water, it can be seen on radiographs. Since the effusion has greater density than the rest of the lung, it gravitates towards the lower portions of the pleural cavity. The pleural effusion behaves according to basic fluid dynamics, conforming to the shape of pleural space, which is determined by the lung and chest wall. If the pleural space contains both air and fluid, then an air-fluid level that is horizontal will be present, instead of conforming to the lung space. Chest radiographs in the lateral decubitus position (with the patient lying on the side of the pleural effusion) are more sensitive and can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid. Between 250 and 600mL of fluid must be present before upright chest X-rays can detect a pleural effusion (e.g., blunted costophrenic angles).

Chest computed tomography is more accurate for diagnosis and may be obtained to better characterize the presence, size, and characteristics of a pleural effusion. Lung ultrasound, nearly as accurate as CT and more accurate than chest X-ray, is increasingly being used at the point of care to diagnose pleural effusions, with the advantage that it is a safe, dynamic, and repeatable imaging modality. To increase diagnostic accuracy of detection of pleural effusion sonographically, markers such as boomerang and VIP signs can be utilized.
=== Thoracentesis ===
Once a pleural effusion is diagnosed, its cause must be determined. Pleural fluid is drawn out of the pleural space in a process called thoracentesis, and it should be done in almost all patients who have pleural fluid that is at least 10 mm in thickness on CT, ultrasonography, or lateral decubitus X-ray and that is new or of uncertain etiology. In general, the only patients who do not require thoracentesis are those who have heart failure with symmetric pleural effusions and no chest pain or fever; in these patients, diuresis can be tried, and thoracentesis is avoided unless effusions persist for more than 3 days. In a thoracentesis, a needle is inserted through the back of the chest wall in the sixth, seventh, or eighth intercostal space on the midaxillary line, into the pleural space. The use of ultrasound to guide the procedure is now standard of care as it increases accuracy and decreases complications. After removal, the fluid may then be evaluated for:

# Chemical composition including protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, amylase, pH, and glucose
# Gram stain and culture to identify possible bacterial infections
# White and red blood cell counts and differential white blood cell counts
# Cytopathology to identify cancer cells, but may also identify some infective organisms
# Other tests as suggested by the clinical situation – lipids, fungal culture, viral culture, tuberculosis cultures, lupus cell prep, specific immunoglobulins

=== Light&#x27;s criteria ===
Definitions of the terms &quot;transudate&quot; and &quot;exudate&quot; are the source of much confusion. Briefly, transudate is produced through pressure filtration without capillary injury while exudate is &quot;inflammatory fluid&quot; leaking between cells.

Transudative pleural effusions are defined as effusions that are caused by &quot;systemic&quot; factors that alter the pleural equilibrium, or Starling forces. The components of the Starling forces – hydrostatic pressure, permeability, and oncotic pressure (effective pressure due to the composition of the pleural fluid and blood) – are altered in many diseases, e.g., left ventricular failure, kidney failure, liver failure, and cirrhosis. Exudative pleural effusions, by contrast, are caused by alterations in &quot;local&quot; factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, cancer, pulmonary embolism, and viral infection).

An accurate diagnosis of the cause of the effusion, transudate versus exudate, relies on a comparison of the chemistries in the pleural fluid to those in the blood, using Light&#x27;s criteria. According to Light&#x27;s criteria (Light, et al. 1972), a pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the following exists:

# The ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein is greater than 0.5
# The ratio of pleural fluid LDH and serum LDH is greater than 0.6
# Pleural fluid LDH is greater than 0.6 or times the normal upper limit for serum. Different laboratories have different values for the upper limit of serum LDH, but examples include 200 and 300 IU/l.

The sensitivity and specificity of Light&#x27;s criteria for detection of exudates have been measured in many studies and are usually reported to be around 98% and 80%, respectively. This means that although Light&#x27;s criteria are relatively accurate, twenty percent of patients that are identified by Light&#x27;s criteria as having exudative pleural effusions actually have transudative pleural effusions. Therefore, if a patient identified by Light&#x27;s criteria as having an exudative pleural effusion appears clinically to have a condition that usually produces transudative effusions, additional testing is needed. In such cases, albumin levels in blood and pleural fluid are measured. If the difference between the albumin level in the blood and the pleural fluid is greater than 1.2 g/dL (12 g/L), this suggests that the patient has a transudative pleural effusion. However, pleural fluid testing is not perfect, and the final decision about whether a fluid is a transudate or an exudate is based not on chemical analysis of the fluid, but an accurate diagnosis of the disease that produces the fluid.
The traditional definitions of transudate as a pleural effusion due to systemic factors and an exudate as a pleural effusion due to local factors have been used since 1940 or earlier (Light et al., 1972). Previous to Light&#x27;s landmark study, which was based on work by Chandrasekhar, investigators unsuccessfully attempted to use other criteria, such as specific gravity, pH, and protein content of the fluid, to differentiate between transudates and exudates. Light&#x27;s criteria are highly statistically sensitive for exudates (although not very statistically specific). More recent studies have examined other characteristics of pleural fluid that may help to determine whether the process producing the effusion is local (exudate) or systemic (transudate). The table above illustrates some of the results of these more recent studies. However, it should be borne in mind that Light&#x27;s criteria are still the most widely used criteria.

The Rational Clinical Examination Series review found that bilateral effusions, symmetric and asymmetric, are the most common distribution in heart failure (60% of effusions in heart failure will be bilateral). When there is asymmetry in heart failure-associated pleural effusions (either unilateral or one side larger than the other), the right side is usually more involved than the left.
The instruments pictured are accurately shaped, however, most hospitals now use safer disposable trocars. Because these are single use, they are always sharp and have a much smaller risk of cross patient contamination.

== Treatment ==

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion.

Therapeutic aspiration may be sufficient; larger effusions may require insertion of an intercostal drain (either pigtail or surgical). When managing these chest tubes, it is important to make sure the chest tubes do not become occluded or clogged. A clogged chest tube in the setting of continued production of fluid will result in residual fluid left behind when the chest tube is removed. This fluid can lead to complications such as hypoxia due to lung collapse from the fluid, or fibrothorax if scarring occurs. Repeated effusions may require chemical (talc, bleomycin, tetracycline/doxycycline), or surgical pleurodesis, in which the two pleural surfaces are scarred to each other so that no fluid can accumulate between them. This is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a chest tube, then either mechanically abrading the pleura or inserting the chemicals to induce a scar. This requires the chest tube to stay in until the fluid drainage stops. This can take days to weeks and can require prolonged hospitalizations. If the chest tube becomes clogged, fluid will be left behind and the pleurodesis will fail.

Pleurodesis fails in as many as 30% of cases. An alternative is to place a PleurX Pleural Catheter or Aspira Drainage Catheter. This is a 15Fr chest tube with a one-way valve. Each day the patient or caregivers connect it to a simple vacuum tube and remove from 600 to 1000 mL of fluid, and can be repeated daily. When not in use, the tube is capped. This allows patients to be outside the hospital. For patients with malignant pleural effusions, it allows them to continue chemotherapy if indicated. Generally, the tube is in for about 30 days, and then it is removed when space undergoes spontaneous pleurodesis.

Tubercular pleural effusion is one of the common extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. Treatment consists of antituberculosis treatment (ATT). The currently recommended ATT regime is two months of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide followed by four months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol.

<doc id="356996" wikidata="Q6691141" url="?curid=356996" title="Love Pageant Rally">
<text>The Love Pageant Rally took place on October 6, 1966—the day LSD became illegal—in the &#x27;panhandle&#x27; of Golden Gate Park, a narrower section that projects into San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district. The &#x27;Haight&#x27; was a neighborhood of run-down turn-of-the-20th-century housing that was the center of San Francisco&#x27;s counterculture in the 1960s.

The major instigators of the rally were Allen Cohen and artist Michael Bowen, the creators of the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;, which first hit the streets in September 1966. The occasion was the banning of LSD, by the California legislature in Sacramento, an enactment which virtually created a neighborhood of outlaws in the Haight, where &#x27;acid&#x27; was a staple of community culture. Since the new law was to go into effect on October 6, 1966, Cohen and others related the event to the number of the Beast of &quot;Revelation&quot;. On a more serious level, busts for drugs were ramping up locally and on the national level, and confrontations between the hippie communes and the local police were getting more intense and led to street protests and rioting, followed by neighborhood curfews. A better form of protest, more suited to hippie culture was needed.

&quot;Without confrontation,&quot; said Allen Cohen, &quot;we wanted to create a celebration of innocence. We were not guilty of using illegal substances. We were celebrating transcendental consciousness. The beauty of the universe. The beauty of being.&quot;

Posters advertising the event invited participants to &quot;Bring the color gold... Bring photos of personal saints and gurus and heroes of the underground... Bring children... Flowers... Flutes... Drums... Feathers... Bands... Beads... Banners, flags, incense, chimes, gongs, cymbals, symbols, costumes, joy.&quot;

Thousands showed up for the event, read a &quot;prophecy of a declaration of independence&quot; written by Cohen, after which many placed a tab of acid on their tongues and swallowed in unison. Music was provided by the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin, both invited to play by Michael Bowen for free. Ken Kesey was on hand with the Merry Pranksters in the legendary bus.

The Love Pageant Rally drew several thousand people. It was a warm-up for the Human Be-In the following January, which brought 30,000 together and established media attention to hippie culture that then led to The Summer of Love.

<text>Almadén () is a town and municipality in the Spanish province of Ciudad Real, within the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha. The town is located at 4° 49&#x27; W and 38° 46&#x27; N and is 589 meters (1,932 ft) above sea level. Almadén is approximately 300 km (186 miles) south of Madrid in the Sierra Morena. The name Almadén is from the , &#x27;the mineral&#x27; or &#x27;lode&#x27;, and so by extension, the place where these are excavated, &#x27;the mine&#x27;. Originally a Roman, and later, a Moorish mining settlement when taken from the Visigoths, the town was captured by the Christians in 1151 under king Alfonso VII and given to the Knights of the Order of Calatrava.

The mercury deposits of Almadén account for the largest quantity of liquid mercury metal produced in the world. Approximately of mercury have been produced there in the past 2,000 years. Due to the toxicity of mercury and its byproducts to humans, the mine has variously employed penal labour, slave labour, and prisoners of war over its long history. Almadén mine stopped working in 2002, due to the European mercury mining prohibition. In 2006, the mine opened to the public who can visit the first level, underground.

In 2012, Almadén and Idrija (Slovenia) were declared World Heritage Sites, with the nomination &quot;Heritage of Mercury&quot;.

==History of the mines==

The geology of the area is characterised by volcanism.
Almadén is home to the world&#x27;s greatest reserves of cinnabar, a mineral associated with recent volcanic activity, from which mercury is extracted. From antiquity, cinnabar was used to make the pigment vermillion and this is the likely end-use of the mineral extraction of Almadén of the Roman and Visigothic periods, for which times historical records are limited. In the Islamic era, furnaces capable of extracting mercury from the cinnabar were installed. With the more advanced expertise available to the alchemists of Al-Andalus, the mines of Almadén exported mercury throughout the entire Mediterranean basin. They were important enough to be described in the learned literature of the day.

The Fuggers of Augsburg, two German bankers, administered the mines during the 16th and 17th centuries in return for loans to the Spanish government. Mercury became very valuable in the Americas in the mid-16th century due to the introduction of amalgamation, a process that uses mercury to extract metals from gold and silver ore. The demand for mercury grew, and so did the town&#x27;s importance as a center of mining and industry. Most of the mercury produced at this time was sent to Seville, then to the Americas.

The dangerous working conditions of the mines made it difficult for the Fuggers to find willing laborers. As the demand for mercury grew, convict labor was introduced.

===Convict labor===
After the Fuggers failed to meet production quotas in 1566, the King of Spain agreed to send 30 prisoners to serve their sentences as laborers at Almadén. The first group of arrived at Almadén at the end of February 1566. The number was increased to 40 in 1583. The prisoners, known as , were selected out of criminals waiting for transport to the galleys in the jail of Toledo. Those selected usually had limited sentences and good physical abilities. Murderers and capital criminals were rarely selected, as the galleys were considered a far harsher punishment than the mines of Almadén.

====Daily life====

A steady run of complaints to the king in the 1580s led to an investigation of convict living conditions at Almadén in 1593. The investigation was conducted by royal commissioner and famous author Mateo Alemán and was based largely on convict interviews.

The mine at Almadén provided with acceptable living conditions. Each convict received daily rations of meat, bread, wine. Each year, a was issued a doublet, one pair of breeches, stockings, two shirts, one pair of shoes, and a hood. Medical care was available at the infirmary, and the mine even housed its own apothecary.

Despite these positive offerings, the danger of death or sickness from mercury poisoning was always present. Twenty-four percent of convicts at Almadén between 1566 and 1593 died before their release dates, most often because of mercury poisoning. Nearly all prisoners experienced discomfort due to mercury exposure. Common symptoms included severe pains in any part of the body, trembling limbs, and loss of sanity. Most of the men at the furnaces died from poisoning.

 were also forced to bail water out of the mines. These men escaped the dangers of mercury exposure but suffered exhaustion on a daily basis. A group of four men had to bail out 300 buckets of water without rest. Those that could not meet this quota were whipped. Sick prisoners were not exempt from this practice.

Death was common, and the convicts wished to provide a proper burial for each of the men that died at the mine. A religious confraternity was formed, conducted by a prior who was administrator of the mine for the Fuggers. The prior also chose devout convicts to serve as officials. Mass was held on Sundays and feast days, and non-attendance was punishable by fine.

===Slave labor===
People abducted for slavery, mainly from North Africa, were purchased directly from slaveholders to work alongside the convicts. The enslaved people purchased to work in the mines at Almadén were those considered less desirable, unwanted by their slaveholders for various reasons (&quot;rebelliousness&quot;, for example), so were much cheaper than others on the market at the time. Such were the dangers of the work and the likelihood of early death, that purchasing enslaved people at the usual market price would have been uneconomic. By 1613, the enslaved outnumbered by a two-to-one ratio.

===From 1645===
In 1645, the Fugger concession was cancelled and the mines were taken over by the state, to be managed by the royal government. All capital criminals were to be sent to Almadén by court order in 1749, but the mine simply could not accommodate all of them. The act was cancelled in 1751.

Two disastrous fires occurred in 1775 that were blamed on the .

Safer mining technology was introduced in the last quarter of the 18th century, and free laborers began to take an interest in the mine again. By the end of the century, free workers had replaced most of the slave labor. The penal establishment at Almadén was closed in 1801.

In 1835, during the First Carlist War, the mine was leased indefinitely to the bank of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons. The price paid was high, but one of the Rothschild family firms had previously purchased the quicksilver mine in Idrija (now in Slovenia) from Austria; thus the firm had a monopoly on quicksilver, until the discovery of New Almaden in California. Volume was expanded and the metal sold at a substantial markup returning a substantial profit to both Spain and the firm. Spain reclaimed the mine in 1863.

In 1916, a special council was created to operate the mines, introducing new technology and safety improvements. A record production of 82,000 mercury flasks () was reached in 1941, just after the Spanish Civil War, using prisoners of war as forced labor. This amount is comparable to the that were produced by China in 2018. The price for mercury decreased from a peak of US$571 per flask in 1965 to US$121 in 1976, making economic planning difficult. In 1981, the Spanish government created the company to operate the mine. In 2000, the mines closed due to the fall of the price of mercury on the international market, caused by falling demand. However, Almadén still has one of the world&#x27;s largest mercury resources.

===Heritage site===
Almadén is now a World Heritage Site, Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija. A museum has been built; the site allows visits to the mines (in areas dating from 16th to 20th century).

The International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) acknowledged Almadén as &quot;the largest known mercury deposit in the Earth and with a longest productive history dating back to the 3rd century BCS&quot;. Due to this, IUGS included &quot;the giant mercury deposit of the Almadén syncline&quot; in its assemblage of 100 world &quot;geological heritage sites&quot; published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history&quot;.

==Climate==
Almadén has a mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; on the Köppen climate classification), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) and a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;). The city has mild winters, although temperatures can sometimes drop below on some nights. Summers are very hot, with mean maximum temperatures often above and days above are common. Precipitation is generally scarce, with summer being the driest season and the remaining seasons having similar but scarce precipitation values. The annual temperature range is high, exceeding .

<doc id="356999" wikidata="Q1602343" url="?curid=356999" title="Self-deception">
<text>Self-deception is a process of denying or rationalizing away the relevance, significance, or importance of opposing evidence and logical argument. Self-deception involves convincing oneself of a truth (or lack of truth) so that one does not reveal any self-knowledge of the deception.

== Brief history ==
While Freudian analysis of the conscious and the unconscious minds dominated the field, psychological scientists in the 1970s became curious about how those two seemingly separate worlds could work together. The lack of mechanistic models available to this line of research, led to the debate being unresolved. Later, the focus has been shifted to vision-related research in social psychology.

==Theorization==

===Analysis===
The traditional paradigm of self-deception is modeled after &quot;interpersonal&quot; deception, where &quot;A&quot; intentionally gets &quot;B&quot; to believe some proposition &quot;p&quot;, all the while knowing or believing truly ¬&quot;p&quot; (not &quot;p&quot;). Such deception is intentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe ¬&quot;p&quot; and the deceived to believe &quot;p&quot;. On this traditional mode, self-deceivers must (1) hold contradictory beliefs and (2) intentionally get themselves to hold a belief they know or believe truly to be false.

The process of rationalization, however, can obscure the intent of self-deception. Brian McLaughlin illustrates that such rationalizations in certain circumstances permit the phenomenon. When a person, who disbelieves &quot;p&quot;, intentionally tries to make himself believe or continue believing &quot;p&quot; by engaging in such activities, and, as a result unintentionally misleads himself into believing or continuing to believe &quot;p&quot; via biased thinking, he deceives himself in a way appropriate for self-deception. No deceitful intention is required for this.

===Psychology===
Self-deception calls into question the nature of the individual, specifically in a psychological context and the nature of &quot;self&quot;. Irrationality is the foundation from which the argued paradoxes of self-deception stem, and it is argued that not everyone has the &quot;special talents&quot; and capacities for self-deception. However, rationalization is influenced by myriad factors, including socialization, personal biases, fear, and cognitive repression. Such rationalization can be manipulated in both positive and negative fashions; convincing one to perceive a negative situation optimistically and vice versa. In contrast, rationalization alone cannot effectively clarify the dynamics of self-deception, as reason is just one adaptive form mental processes can take.

===Paradoxes===
The works of philosopher Alfred R. Mele have provided insight into some of the more prominent paradoxes regarding self-deception. Two of these paradoxes include the self-deceiver&#x27;s state of mind and the dynamics of self-deception, coined the &quot;static&quot; paradox and the &quot;dynamic/strategic&quot; paradox, respectively.

Mele formulates an example of the &quot;static&quot; paradox as the following:
If ever a person &quot;A&quot; deceives a person &quot;B&quot; into believing that something, &quot;p&quot;, is true, &quot;A&quot; knows or truly believes that &quot;p&quot; is false while causing &quot;B&quot; to believe that &quot;p&quot; is true. So when &quot;A&quot; deceives &quot;A&quot; (i.e., himself) into believing that &quot;p&quot; is true, he knows or truly believes that &quot;p&quot; is false while causing himself to believe that &quot;p&quot; is true. Thus, &quot;A&quot; must simultaneously believe that &quot;p&quot; is false and believe that &quot;p&quot; is true. But how is this possible?

Mele then describes the &quot;dynamic/strategy&quot; paradox:
In general, &quot;A&quot; cannot successfully employ a deceptive strategy against &quot;B&quot; if &quot;B&quot; knows &quot;A&quot;&#x27;s intention and plan. This seems plausible as well when &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the same person. A potential self-deceiver&#x27;s knowledge of his intention and strategy would seem typically to render them ineffective. On the other hand, the suggestion that self-deceivers typically successfully execute their self-deceptive strategies without knowing what they are up to may seem absurd; for an agent&#x27;s effective execution of his plans seems generally to depend on his cognizance of them and their goals. So how, in general, can an agent deceive himself by employing a self-deceptive strategy?

These models call into question how one can simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs (&quot;static&quot; paradox) and deceive oneself without rendering one&#x27;s intentions ineffective (&quot;dynamic/strategic&quot; paradox). Attempts at a resolution to these have created two schools of thought: one that maintains that paradigmatic cases of self-deception are intentional and one that denies the notion—&quot;intentionalists&quot; and &quot;non-intentionalists&quot;, respectively.

Intentionalists tend to agree that self-deception is intentional, but divide over whether it requires the holding of contradictory beliefs. This school of thought incorporates elements of temporal partitioning (extended over time to benefit the self-deceiver, increasing the chance of forgetting the deception altogether) and psychological partitioning (incorporating various aspects of the &quot;self&quot;).

Non-intentionalists, in contrast, tend to believe that cases of self-deception are not necessarily accidental, but motivated by desire, anxiety, or some other emotion regarding &quot;p&quot; or related to &quot;p&quot;. This notion distinguishes self-deception from misunderstanding. Furthermore, &quot;wishful thinking&quot; is distinguished from self-deception in that the self-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive belief or possess, without recognizing, greater counterevidence than wishful thinkers.

Numerous questions and debates remain in play with respect to the paradoxes of self-deception, and a consensual paradigm has yet to appear.

===Trivers&#x27; theory===
It has been theorized that humans are susceptible to self-deception because most people have emotional attachments to beliefs, which in some cases may be irrational. Some evolutionary biologists, such as Robert Trivers, have suggested that deception plays a significant role in human behavior, and more generally speaking in animal behavior. One deceives oneself to trust something that is not true as to better convince others of that &quot;truth&quot;. When a person convinces himself of this untrue thing, they better mask the signs of deception. Trivers, along with two colleagues (Daniel Kriegman and Malcolm Slavin), applied his theory of &quot;self-deception in the service of deception&quot; in order to explain how in his view Donald Trump was able to employ the &quot;big lie&quot; with such great success.

This notion is based on the following logic: deception is a fundamental aspect of communication in nature, both between and within species. It has evolved so that one can have an advantage over another. From alarm calls to mimicry, animals use deception to further their survival. Those who are better able to perceive deception are more likely to survive. As a result, self-deception behavior evolved to better mask deception from those who perceive it well or, as Trivers puts it &quot;hiding the truth from yourself to hide it more deeply from others.&quot; In humans, awareness of the fact that one is acting deceptively often leads to tell-tale signs of deception, such as nostrils flaring, clammy skin, quality and tone of voice, eye movement, or excessive blinking. Therefore, if self-deception enables an individual to believe its own distortions, it will not present such signs of deception, and will therefore appear to be telling the truth.

Self-deception can be used both to act greater or lesser than one actually is. For example, one can act overconfident to attract a mate or act under-confident to avoid a threat such as a predator. If an individual is capable of concealing their true feelings and intentions well, then it is more likely to successfully deceive others.

It may also be argued that the ability to deceive, or self-deceive, is not the selected trait but rather a by-product of a more primary trait called abstract thinking. Abstract thinking allows many evolutionary advantages such as more flexible, adaptive behaviors, leading to innovation. Since a lie is an abstraction, the mental process of creating it can only occur in animals with enough brain complexity to permit abstract thinking. Moreover, self-deception lowers cognitive cost; that is to say, if one has convinced oneself that that very thing is indeed true, it is less complicated for one to behave or think as that thing was untrue; the mind not thinking constantly of the true thing and then the false thing, but simply being convinced that the false thing is true.

====Evolutionary implications====
Because there is deceit, there exists a strong selection to recognize when deception occurs. As a result, self-deception behavior evolves so as to better hide the signs of deception from others. The presence of deception explains the existence of an innate ability to commit self-deception to hide the indications of deceptions. Humans deceive themselves in order to better deceive others and thus have an advantage over them. In the three decades since Trivers introduced his adaptive theory of self-deception, there has been an ongoing debate over the genetic basis of such a behavior.

The explanation of deception and self-deception as innate characteristics is perhaps true, but there are many other explanations for this pattern of behavior. It is possible that the ability to self-deceive is not innate, but a learned trait, acquired through experience. For example, a person could have been caught being deceitful by revealing their knowledge of information they were trying to hide. Their nostrils flared, indicating that they were lying to the other person, and thus did not get what they wanted. Next time, to better achieve success, the person will more actively deceive himself of having knowledge to better hide the signs of deception. Therefore, people could have the capacity to learn self-deception. However, simply because something is learned does not mean that it is not innate; what is learned and what is innate work in conjunction. This is outlined in many introductory textbooks in evolutionary psychology. For example, preparedness occurs in learning to explain why some behaviours are more easily learned than others. Evolutionary psychologists argue that there are learning mechanisms that allow learning to occur.

===Medicine===
Self-deception has a prominent role in several medical conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder.

==Examples==
Simple instances of self-deception include common occurrences such as: the alcoholic who is self-deceived in believing that his drinking is under control, the husband who is self-deceived in believing that his wife is not having an affair, the jealous colleague who is self-deceived in believing that her colleague&#x27;s greater professional success is due to ruthless ambition.

An example of self-deception is provided by Robert Trivers and Huey P. Newton published in the form of an analysis of the role of flight crew self-deception in the crash of Air Florida Flight 90.

Self-deception is not exclusive to humans and has been observed in nonhuman animals like the slender crayfish (Cherax dispar). Angilletta et al. demonstrated that weak crayfish often signal as if they are stronger, ignoring their actual strength to escalate aggression. They proposed two conditions for self-deception: dishonest individuals must use the same signals as honest ones, and both must escalate aggression based on the signaled quality rather than actual ability. Šekrst argues that such behavior implies belief and demonstrates self-deception at Mitchell&#x27;s third level, where intentionality is present without requiring an understanding of others’ beliefs.

==Criticisms==
The claim that not being conscious about deception would decrease the body language signs of lying is criticized for being incompatible with the unconscious nature of body language as in body language giving away non-conscious processes, as well as for not being able to account for why evolutionary selection for lying would allow a body language that gives away lying to exist instead of simply selecting for lack of such signals.

The notion that non-conscious deception would be less costly than conscious deception is subject to criticism, citing that a non-conscious lie followed by a process of creating a conscious confabulation would amount to more, not fewer, brain processes than simply making up a conscious lie.

The concept of self-deception is criticized for being able to classify any criticism of the notion of self-deception as being self-deception in itself, removing its falsifiability and therefore making it unscientific, and also for being an obstacle to science in general by being able to classify anything as self-deception in a way that confirms itself in a way that is not self-correcting.

The assumption that individuals who derive pleasure from hurting others would self-deceive into believing that their victims were not hurt is criticized for contradicting its own premise, since if the individual did enjoy knowing that the victim was hurt such self-deception would reduce and not increase the pleasure.

<doc id="357005" wikidata="Q214867" url="?curid=357005" title="National Gallery of Art">
<text>The National Gallery of Art is an art museum in Washington, D.C., United States, located on the National Mall, between 3rd and 9th Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW. Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the United States Congress. Andrew W. Mellon donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by Paul Mellon, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Lessing J. Rosenwald, Samuel Henry Kress, Rush Harrison Kress, Peter Arrell Browne Widener, Joseph E. Widener, and Chester Dale. The Gallery&#x27;s collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas and the largest mobile created by Alexander Calder.

The Gallery&#x27;s campus includes the original neoclassical West Building designed by John Russell Pope, which is linked underground to the modernist East Building, designed by I. M. Pei, and is next to the Sculpture Garden. The Gallery often presents temporary special exhibitions spanning the world and the history of art. It is one of the largest museums in North America. 
Attendance rose to nearly 3.3 million visitors in 2022, making it third on the list of most-visited museums in the United States. Of the top three art museums in the United States by annual visitors, it is the only one that has no admission fee.

==History==

===Origins===

Andrew W. Mellon, Pittsburgh banker and Treasury Secretary from 1921 until 1932, began gathering a private collection of old master paintings and sculptures during World War I. During the late 1920s, Mellon decided to direct his collecting efforts towards the establishment of a new national gallery for the United States.

In 1930, partly for tax reasons, Mellon formed the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, which was to be the legal owner of works intended for the gallery. In 1930–1931, the Trust made its first major acquisition, 21 paintings from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg as part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, including such masterpieces as Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Alba Madonna,&quot; Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus with a Mirror&quot;, and Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot;.

In 1929 Mellon had initiated contact with the recently appointed Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Greeley Abbot. Mellon was appointed in 1931 as a Commissioner of the Institution&#x27;s National Gallery of Art. When the director of the Gallery retired, Mellon asked Abbot not to appoint a successor, as he proposed to endow a new building with funds for expansion of the collections.

However, Mellon&#x27;s trial for tax evasion, centering on the Trust and the Hermitage paintings, caused the plan to be modified. In 1935, Mellon announced in &quot;The Washington Star&quot; his intention to establish a new gallery for old masters, separate from the Smithsonian. When asked by Abbot, he explained that the project was in the hands of the Trust and that its decisions were partly dependent on &quot;the attitude of the Government towards the gift&quot;.

In January 1937, Mellon formally offered to create the new Gallery. On his birthday, 24 March 1937, an Act of Congress accepted the collection and building funds (provided through the Trust), and approved the construction of a museum on the National Mall.

The new gallery was to be effectively self-governing, not controlled by the Smithsonian, but took the old name &quot;National Gallery of Art&quot; while the Smithsonian&#x27;s gallery would be renamed the &quot;National Collection of Fine Arts&quot; (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum).

===Construction and later history===
The museum stands on the former site of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, where in 1881 a disgruntled office seeker, Charles Guiteau, shot President James Garfield (see James A. Garfield assassination). The station was demolished in 1908 because it did not conform to the McMillan Plan for the Mall. In 1918, temporary war buildings were constructed on the site; these were demolished by 1921 to construct the foundation of the George Washington Memorial Building, which was never completed. The site was then reassigned to the new National Gallery of Art.

Designed by architect John Russell Pope, the new structure was completed and accepted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on behalf of the American people on March 17, 1941. At the time of its inception it was the largest marble structure in the world. Neither Mellon nor Pope lived to see the museum completed; both died in late August 1937, only two months after excavation had begun.

As anticipated by Mellon, the creation of the National Gallery encouraged the donation of other substantial art collections by a number of private donors. Founding benefactors included such individuals as Paul Mellon, Samuel H. Kress, Rush H. Kress, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Chester Dale, Joseph Widener, Lessing J. Rosenwald and Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch.

The Gallery&#x27;s East Building was constructed in the 1970s on much of the remaining land left over from the original congressional action. Andrew Mellon&#x27;s children, Paul Mellon and Ailsa Mellon Bruce, funded the building. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the contemporary structure was completed in 1978 and was opened on June 1 of that year by President Jimmy Carter. The new building was built to house the Museum&#x27;s collection of modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, as well as study and research centers and offices. The design received a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1981.

The final addition to the complex is the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. Completed and opened to the public on May 23, 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting a number of large pieces from the Museum&#x27;s contemporary sculpture collection.

In 2011, an extensive refurbishment and renovation of the French galleries were undertaken. As part of the celebration of the reopening of this wing, organist Alexander Frey performed 4 sold-out recitals of music of France in one weekend in the French Gallery.

==Operations==
The National Gallery of Art is supported through a private-public partnership. The United States federal government provides funds, through annual appropriations, to support the museum&#x27;s operations and maintenance. All artwork, as well as special programs, are provided through private donations and funds. The museum is not part of the Smithsonian Institution.

Noted directors of the National Gallery have included David E. Finley, Jr. (1938–1956), John Walker (1956–1968), and J. Carter Brown (1968–1993). Earl A. &quot;Rusty&quot; Powell III was named director in 1993. In March 2019 he was succeeded by Kaywin Feldman, past director and president of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The museum hired Evelyn Carmen Ramos, the first woman and the first person of color to be the chief curatorial and conservation officer, in 2021.

The president of the museum is billionaire businessman Mitchell Rales and its chairperson is Sharon Rockefeller.

Entry to both buildings of the National Gallery of Art is free of charge. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. – 5 p.m. It is closed on December 25 and January 1.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Gallery was largely closed to the public. However, visitors were able to schedule appointments to access the west building in small numbers.

=== Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts ===
The Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA), the National Gallery of Art&#x27;s research institute, was founded in 1979. The Center offers visiting professorships, a fellowship program, and undergraduate internship opportunities, as well as a publication program.

The first dean of CASVA, architectural historian Henry A. Millon, was appointed in 1980 . He was succeeded by Elizabeth Cropper in 2000. Steven Nelson became the third dean of CASVA in 2020.

==Architecture ==

The museum comprises two buildings: the West Building (1941) and the East Building (1978), linked by an underground passage. The West Building, composed of pink Tennessee marble, was designed in 1937 by architect John Russell Pope in a neoclassical style (as is Pope&#x27;s other notable building in Washington, D.C., the Jefferson Memorial). Designed in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the Pantheon in Rome. Extending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine. Bright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.
The West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the medieval period through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists. Highlights of the collection include paintings by Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Leonardo da Vinci.

In contrast, the design of the East Building, by architect I. M. Pei, is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one contains public galleries, and the other houses a library, offices, and a study center. The triangles establish a motif that is echoed throughout the building, realized in every dimension.

The East Building&#x27;s central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning . The atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.

However, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below. In 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels. The renovation was completed in 2016.

The East Building focuses on modern and contemporary art, with a collection including works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Calder, a 1977 mural by Robert Motherwell and works by many other artists. The East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA). Among the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of Barnett Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Stations of the Cross&quot; series of 14 black and white paintings (1958–66). Newman painted them after he had recovered from a heart attack; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement. The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.

The two buildings are connected by a walkway beneath 4th street, called &quot;the Concourse&quot; on the museum&#x27;s map. In 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist Leo Villareal to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation.&quot;Multiverse&quot; is one of Villareal&#x27;s largest and most complex light sculpture by light count, featuring approximately 41,000 computer-programmed LED nodes that run through channels along the entire -long space. The concourse also includes the food court and a gift shop.

The final element of the National Gallery of Art complex, the Sculpture Garden was completed in 1999 after more than 30 years of planning. To the west of the West Building, on the opposite side of Seventh Street, the Sculpture Garden was designed by landscape architect Laurie Olin as an outdoor gallery for monumental modern sculpture.

The Sculpture Garden contains plantings of Native American species of canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials. A circular reflecting pool and fountain form the center of its design, which arching pathways of granite and crushed stone complement. (The pool becomes an ice-skating rink during the winter.) The sculptures exhibited in the surrounding landscaped area include pieces by Marc Chagall, David Smith, Mark Di Suvero, Roy Lichtenstein, Sol LeWitt, Tony Smith, Roxy Paine, Joan Miró, Louise Bourgeois, and Hector Guimard.

===Renovations===
The NGA&#x27;s West Building was renovated from 2007 to 2009. Although some galleries closed for periods of time, others remained open.

After congressional testimony that the East Building suffered from &quot;systematic structural failures&quot;, NGA adopted a Master Renovations Plan in 1999. This plan established the timeline for closing the building, and planned for the renovation of the electronic security systems, elevators, and HVAC. Space between the ceilings of existing galleries and the building&#x27;s skylights (which was never completed when the building was constructed in 1978) would be renovated into two, high, hexagonal Tower Galleries. The galleries would have a combined of space and will be lit by skylights. A rooftop sculpture garden would also be added. NGA officials said that the Tower Galleries would probably house modern art, and the creation of a distinct &quot;Rothko Room&quot; was possible.

Beginning in 2011, NGA undertook an $85 million restoration of the East Building&#x27;s façade. The East Building is clad in thick pink marble panels. The panels are held about away from the wall by stainless steel anchors. Gravity holds the panel in the bottom anchors (which are placed at each corner), while &quot;button head&quot; anchors (stainless steel posts with large, flat heads) at the top corners keep the panel upright. Mortar was used on the gravity anchors to level the stones. Joints of flexible colored neoprene were placed between the panels. This system was designed to allow each panel to hang independent of its neighbors, and NGA officials say they are not aware of any other panel system like it.

However, many panels were accidentally mortared together. Seasonal heating and cooling of the façade, infiltration of moisture, and shrinkage of the building&#x27;s structural concrete by over time caused extensive damage to the façade. In 2005, regular maintenance showed that some panels were cracked or significantly damaged, while others leaned by more than out from the building (threatening to fall).

The NGA hired the structural engineering firm Robert Silman Associates to determine the cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved to the center of the top edge of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored silicone gaskets installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.

In March 2013, the National Gallery of Art announced a $68.4 million renovation to the East Building. This included $38.4 million to refurbish the interior mechanical plant of the structure, and $30 million to create new exhibition space. Because the angular interior space of the East Building made it impossible to close off galleries, the renovation required all but the atrium and offices to close by December 2013. The structure remained closed for three years. The architectural firm of Hartman-Cox oversaw both aspects of the renovation.

A group of benefactors — which included Victoria and Roger Sant, Mitchell and Emily Rales, and David Rubenstein — privately financed the renovation. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that the donation was one of the largest the NGA had received in a decade. NGA staff said that they would use the closure to conserve artwork, plan purchases, and develop exhibitions. Plans for renovating conservation, construction, exhibition prep, groundskeeping, office, storage, and other internal facilities were also ready, but would not be implemented for many years.

==Collection==
The NGA&#x27;s collection galleries and Sculpture Garden display European and American paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photographs, and decorative arts. Paintings in the permanent collection date from the Middle Ages to the present. The Italian Renaissance collection includes two panels from Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maesta&quot;, the tondo of the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; by Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi, a Botticelli work on the same subject, Giorgione&#x27;s &quot;Allendale Nativity&quot;, Giovanni Bellini&#x27;s &quot;The Feast of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Ginevra de&#x27; Benci&quot; (the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas) and groups of works by Titian and Raphael.

The collections include paintings by many European masters, including a version of &quot;Saint Martin and the Beggar,&quot; by El Greco, and works by Matthias Grünewald, Cranach the Elder, Rogier van der Weyden, Albrecht Dürer, Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, Francisco Goya, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and Eugène Delacroix, among others. The collection of sculpture and decorative arts includes such works as the &quot;Chalice&quot; of Abbot Suger of St-Denis and a collection of work by Auguste Rodin and Edgar Degas. Other highlights of the permanent collection include the second of the two original sets of Thomas Cole&#x27;s series of paintings titled &quot;The Voyage of Life&quot;, (the first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York) and the original version of &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot; by John Singleton Copley (two other versions are in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Detroit Institute of Arts).

The National Gallery&#x27;s print collection comprises 75,000 prints, in addition to rare illustrated books. It includes collections of works by Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, William Blake, Mary Cassatt, Edvard Munch, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. The collection began with 400 prints donated by five collectors in 1941. In 1942, Joseph E. Widener donated his entire collection of nearly 2,000 works. In 1943, Lessing Rosenwald donated his collection of 8,000 old master and modern prints; between 1943 and 1979, he donated almost 14,000 more works. In 2008, Dave and Reba White Williams donated their collection of more than 5,200 American prints.

In 2013, the NGA purchased from a private French collection Gerard van Honthorst&#x27;s 1623 painting, &quot;The Concert&quot;, which had not been publicly viewed since 1795. After initially displaying the &quot;The Concert&quot; in a special installation in the West Building, the NGA moved the painting to a permanent display in the museum&#x27;s Dutch and Flemish galleries. Art experts estimated the sale price of &quot;The Concert&quot; at $20 million, though the NGA did not reveal the amount that it had paid.

<doc id="357012" wikidata="Q1465319" url="?curid=357012" title="Mayor of Los Angeles">
<text>The mayor of Los Angeles is the head of the executive branch of the government of Los Angeles and the chief executive of Los Angeles. The office is officially nonpartisan, a change made in the 1909 charter; previously, both the elections and the office were partisan.

Forty-two men and one woman have been mayor since 1850, when California became a state following the American conquest of California. Between 1781 and the conquest, Californios, or native-born residents of the Mexican territory, served as &quot;alcalde&quot;, equivalent to &quot;mayor&quot;. The current mayor is Karen Bass, who was elected on November 17, 2022, and took office on December 12, 2022.

== History ==
The office of &quot;Alcalde&quot;, the Mayor of El Pueblo de la Reina de los Ángeles, was established in 1781 and elected annually without the right to reelection for two years. In 1841, the office of &quot;alcalde&quot; was abolished, instead being replaced by two &quot;Jueces de Paz&quot; (Justice of the peace). In 1844, the office of &quot;alcalde&quot; was restored but kept the two officials. When California was conquered and Los Angeles came under the United States, the office name was changed to Mayor.

== Powers ==
Los Angeles has a council form of government, giving the mayor the position of chief executive of the city. The mayor appoints general managers and commissioners, removes officials from city posts, and proposes a yearly budget. Most of the mayor&#x27;s appointments and proposals are subject to approval by the City Council. The mayor also has the power to veto or approve certain City Council actions, though the City Council can override the Mayor&#x27;s veto with a two-thirds vote.

The organization of the mayor&#x27;s office changes with each new administration, but is almost always governed by a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, director of communications, and several deputy mayors. Each mayor organizes their office into different offices, usually containing the Los Angeles Housing Team, Los Angeles Business Team, International Trade Office, Mayor&#x27;s Volunteer Corps, and Office of Immigrant Affairs, among other divisions.

The mayor has an office in the Los Angeles City Hall and resides at the mayor&#x27;s mansion, Getty House, located in Windsor Square. As of 2020, the mayor received a salary of $248,141.

==Succession==
The mayor is subject to recall by registered voters if at least 15 percent of eligible voters sign a recall petition within 120 days of the first day of circulation. If the petition is successful, a special election is held asking whether the incumbent should be removed and who among a list of candidates should replace the incumbent. If the recall is successful, the replacement candidate with the majority of votes succeeds the ousted incumbent. If no replacement candidate receives a majority of the votes, a special runoff election is held between the top two candidates.

If the mayor resigns, the City Charter gives the Los Angeles City Council the power to appoint an interim mayor through the end of the term and/or the power to call a special election.

== Elections ==
The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms, and is officially nonpartisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.

The mayor is elected in a citywide election and follows a two-round system. The first round of the election is called the primary election, with the candidate receiving a majority of the vote in the primary is elected outright. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two candidates advance to a runoff election, called the general election. The city charter allows for write-in candidates for the primary election, but not for the runoff in the general election. 

Elections for mayor were held in odd-numbered years from 1909 until 2017. In October 2014, the Los Angeles City Council recommended consolidating city elections with gubernatorial and presidential elections in even-numbered years in an effort to increase turnout. On March 3, 2015, voters passed a charter amendment to extend the term of the mayor elected in 2017 to five and a half years. From 2022 and onward, mayoral elections will be consolidated with the statewide gubernatorial elections held every four years.

The most recent election was held in November 2022. Politician Karen Bass defeated businessman Rick Caruso.
