<text>James Parrott (August 2, 1897 – May 10, 1939) was an American actor and film director; and the younger brother of film comedian Charley Chase.

==Biography==
===Early years===
James Gibbons Parrott was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Charles and Blanche Thompson Parrott. In 1903, his father died from a heart attack, leaving the family in bad financial shape, which forced them to move in with a relative. Charley Jr. quit school, so he could go to work, in order to support his mother and brother. Eventually the call of the stage beckoned him, and Charley Jr. left home at age 16 to travel the vaudeville circuit as a singer and comedic performer. 

James was forced to leave school at a young age, in order to earn money to support the family. His first job was as a bellboy at the age of 10.Two years later, he was a driver of a horse-drawn carriage. He later became a prop man when his brother Charley was a director at Fox. 

Later, Charley&#x27;s connections in the film industry helped his younger brother to become established in movies, and he would appear during the 1920s in a series of relatively successful comedies for producer Hal Roach. He was billed first as &quot;Paul Parrott&quot;, then &quot;Jimmie Parrott&quot;. Approximately 75 comedies were produced from 1921 to 1923, with titles continuing to be released through Pathé until 1926. Frequent co-stars included Marie Mosquini, Jobyna Ralston, Eddie Baker, and Sunshine Sammy.

Parrott is probably best known as a comedy director. As &quot;James Parrott&quot;, he specialized in the two-reel misadventures of Laurel and Hardy, including &quot;Helpmates&quot; (1931) and the Oscar-winning classic &quot;The Music Box&quot; (1932).

===Later years===
During the 1930s Parrott had acquired serious drinking and drug problems (his diet medications were actually addictive amphetamines) and although still able to direct quality shorts, he had developed a reputation as unreliable. By the mid-1930s his work was spotty: Stan Laurel used him sporadically to contribute gags to the Laurel and Hardy features, and he would direct an &quot;Our Gang&quot; short in 1934, plus several acceptable entries in Thelma Todd–Patsy Kelly series.

===Death===
By 1937, Parrott was accepting any jobs that came his way. He could no longer be counted on to direct or write, and relied on his brother to support him financially. There was a brief marriage to Ruby Ellen McCoy in 1937, but as his various addictions worsened, so did his state of mind.

James Parrott died in 1939. His brother Charley was guilt-ridden; he had refused to help James financially until he overcame his substance-abuse problems. Parrott&#x27;s death at 41 was attributed to a heart attack, but former Hal Roach associates maintained he committed suicide. Chase drank heavily to cope with his loss, and died the following year. Both brothers are interred at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

===Spouses=== 
*Clara Miller m. 1921-?
*Ruby Ellen McCoy m. 1937-1939

The Sons of the Desert&#x27;s &quot;Twice Two&quot; tent (St Neots, UK), researching James Gibbons Parrott, discovered that he married Clara Miller in 1921. However, there is scant information about her: no date of birth, only that she was a housewife, with no available photograph. The tent traced them living together in Beverly Hills, but the trail runs cold by 1930. With lack of evidence, one can only speculate what happened next to the couple; thus far there is no evidence of divorce papers.
This is a piece of evidence showing James Parrott and his wife Clara Miller. In 1922 they were living together in Los Angeles, where James Parrott had a successful career as an actor. Clara Miller was registered here as a housewife. It is the only file located thus far with James and Clara after their wedding in 1921.

<text>Oracle Park is a ballpark in the SoMa district of San Francisco, California. Since 2000, it has been the home of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). The stadium stands along San Francisco Bay; the section of the bay beyond Oracle Park&#x27;s right field wall is unofficially known as McCovey Cove, in honor of former Giants player Willie McCovey. Previously named Pacific Bell Park, SBC Park, and AT&amp;T Park, the stadium&#x27;s current name was purchased by Oracle Corporation in 2019.

Oracle Park has also hosted professional and college football games. The stadium was the home of the annual college postseason bowl game now known as the Redbox Bowl from its inaugural playing in 2002 until 2013, and also served as the temporary home for the California Golden Bears football team in 2011. Professionally, it was the home of the San Francisco Demons of the XFL and the California Redwoods of the United Football League.

Public transit access to the stadium is provided within San Francisco by Muni Metro or Muni Bus, from the Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley via Caltrain, and from parts of the Bay Area across the water via various ferries of San Francisco Bay. The Muni 2nd and King Station is directly outside the ballpark, the 4th and King Caltrain station is 1.5 blocks from the stadium, and the Oracle Park ferry terminal is outside the eastern edge of the ballpark beyond the center field bleachers.

==History==
===Design and construction===
Originally designed to be a 42,000-seat stadium, there were slight modifications before the final design was complete. When the ballpark was brought to the ballot box in the fall of 1996 for voter approval, the stadium was 15° clockwise from its current position. The center-field scoreboard was atop the right-field wall, with the Giants Pavilion Building being in two separate buildings.
Groundbreaking on the ballpark began on December 11, 1997, in the industrial waterfront area of San Francisco known as China Basin in the up-and-coming neighborhoods of South Beach and Mission Bay. The stadium cost $357 million to build and supplanted the Giants&#x27; former home, Candlestick Park, a multi-use stadium in southeastern San Francisco that was also home to the NFL&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers until 2014, when they relocated to Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara. A team of engineers from UC Davis was consulted in the design process of the park, resulting in wind levels that are approximately half those at Candlestick. But due to Oracle Park&#x27;s location at San Francisco Bay, cold fog and temperatures in summer months are still not unusual at Giants games, despite reduced wind levels.

When it opened on March 31, 2000, the ballpark was the first MLB ballpark built without public funds since the completion of Dodger Stadium in 1962. However, the Giants did receive a $10 million tax abatement from the city and $80 million for upgrades to the local infrastructure (including a connection to the Muni Metro). The Giants have a 66-year lease on the ballpark site, paying $1.2 million in rent annually to the San Francisco Port Commission. The park opened with a seating capacity of 40,800, but this has increased over time as seats have been added. In April 2010, the stadium became the first MLB ballpark to receive LEED Silver Certification for Existing Buildings, Operations and Maintenance.

Following the 2019 season, the organization began the process of relocating the bullpens from the first and third base foul lines to behind the outfield walls in center and right-centerfield. The motivation was two-fold: to address player safety issues that had arisen over the years by having the bullpen mounds in the field of play, and to slightly alter the dimensions of the park to perhaps increase, if ever-so-slightly, the potential for home runs in certain areas of the outfield, most notably in right-center field, affectionately known as Triples Alley (a design feature meant as an homage to the centerfield depth of the Giants former home in New York, The Polo Grounds). Prior to these modifications, multiple players both home and away had experienced various levels of injury sustained by tripping over the bullpen mounds while chasing foul balls. Most notably, former Giants outfield prospect Mac Williamson sustained a concussion during such a play that significantly altered his season.

===Naming rights===

On April 3, 1996, Pacific Bell, a telephone company serving California based in San Francisco, purchased the naming rights for the planned ballpark for $50 million for 24 years. The stadium was named Pacific Bell Park, or Pac Bell Park for short.

Just days before the sponsorship was announced, SBC Communications had announced their intention to acquire Pacific Bell&#x27;s parent company, Pacific Telesis, a deal which closed in April 1997. SBC eventually stopped using the Pacific Bell name for marketing, and reached an agreement with the Giants to change the stadium&#x27;s name to SBC Park on January 1, 2004.

After SBC bought AT&amp;T Corporation on November 18, 2005, the name of the merged company became AT&amp;T Inc. As a result, in 2006 the stadium was given its third name in six years: AT&amp;T Park.

On January 9, 2019, it was reported that AT&amp;T had given the Giants the option of ending the naming deal a year early, if the team could quickly find a new partner. The Giants and Oracle Corporation came to a rapid agreement, with the old AT&amp;T Park signs being replaced with temporary Oracle Park banners on January 10.

===2020 renovations===
The Giants renovated the center field section of Oracle Park between October 2019 and June 2020. The bullpens were moved from foul territory into center field, so the Giants decided to make their garden smaller to fit the bullpens behind the center-field wall. With this renovation, the dimensions of the park have slightly shrunk. Left-center was trimmed down from 404 feet to 399 feet, right-center (known as Triples Alley) was trimmed down from 421 feet to 415 feet (to represent the San Francisco area code), and dead-center was trimmed down from 399 feet to 391 feet, making it the second shortest dead-center field distance in MLB, behind only Fenway Park in Boston. With this renovation, approximately 650 bleacher seats had to be removed, so the two terraces could be built for fans to watch the relief pitchers warm-up from up close. The center field wall shortened from eight feet to seven feet, but after the Giants first exhibition of the 2020 season, the dead-center field part of the wall (covering the garden) was raised from seven feet to ten feet to improve visibility to the hitter.

Despite having the unique moniker of the least home-run friendly field over several seasons prior to the renovations, it is believed that these renovations were made to increase home run output from the Giants. The MLB has seen a surge in home run production in recent years, and the Giants consistently ranked well towards the bottom in this category in large part because of Oracle Park&#x27;s extreme advantage to pitchers. This hurt the run production of Giants players and also discouraged power hitters from wanting to play for the Giants. From 2017 to 2019, one of the common criticisms of the Giants was their lack of offensive output and unwillingness to adjust to a home run-heavy offense. However, the Giants significantly improved in 2020, the first year the dimensions were moved in. Things would trend upward with a massive bounce-back season in 2021; several Giants such as Brandon Belt and Mike Yastrzemski fueled the offense with more home runs, especially to a shortened triple&#x27;s alley (which was infamous for turning what would be a long HR in several ballparks into deep 420-foot+ flyouts, killing several promising San Francisco scoring opportunities in the past). Oracle Park still ranks towards the bottom of the home run category, but this designation is not as consistent anymore.

During the 2023–24 offseason, the Giants installed new programmable LED lighting technology providing full color spectrum capabilities and motion lighting effects for Giants home runs, wins and other special occasions. Oracle Park became the first MLB ballpark to have spotlights, in the form of 12 advanced moving light features. Speaker upgrades were also done with the addition of subwoofers, allowing a more immersive audio experience.

==Features==

The stadium contains 68 luxury suites, 5,200 club seats on the club level, and an additional 1,500 club seats at the field level behind home plate.

On the facing of the upper deck along the left-field line are the retired numbers of Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Carl Hubbell, Monte Irvin, Will Clark, Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Juan Marichal, Orlando Cepeda, Jackie Robinson, Willie McCovey, and Gaylord Perry, as well as the retired uniforms, denoted &quot;NY&quot;, of Christy Mathewson and John McGraw who played or managed in the pre-number era. These two pre-number–era retired uniforms are among only six such retired uniforms in all of the Major Leagues.

Oracle Park has a reputation of being a pitcher&#x27;s park and the most pitcher-friendly ballpark in the National League, because the depth of the outfield limits home runs, according to ESPN. ESPN&#x27;s MLB Park Factors lists Oracle Park as having the fewest home runs per game 6 out of the past 7 years, the one exception coming in 2013, when it was the 3rd lowest.

===Right field and McCovey Cove===

The most prominent feature of the ballpark is the right-field wall, which is high in honor of former Giants Willie Mays, who wore number 24. Because of the proximity to the San Francisco Bay, the right-field foul pole is only from home plate, the shortest in the NL [only AL Fenway Park&#x27;s is shorter, at ]. The wall is made of brick, with fenced-off archways opening to the Cove beyond, above which are several rows of arcade seating. The fence angles quickly away from home plate; right-center field extended out to from home plate (changed with the 2020 renovations to 415 feet). Atop the fence are four fountain pillars. Jets of water burst from the four pillars at the end of the National Anthem, as well as when the Giants hit a home run or win a game.

The right field area was designed to resemble the Polo Grounds. This deep corner of the ballpark has been dubbed &quot;Death Valley&quot; and &quot;Triples Alley&quot;. Like its Polo Grounds counterpart, it is very difficult to hit a home run to this area, and a batted ball that finds its way into this corner often results in a triple. It is . Triples Alley is also infamous for bad bounces, most notably when Ichiro Suzuki hit the first-ever inside-the-park home run in an All-Star Game in 2007, by lining the ball off one of the archways and sideways past the outfielders. Nate Schierholtz performed the same feat in the 2009 season as a pinch hitter. Aubrey Huff did it again in the 2010 season, as did Conor Gillaspie in 2011. Ángel Pagán ended a game in May 2013 with a two-run walk-off (extra-inning, come-from-behind) inside-the-park home run, the first of its kind at the then-named AT&amp;T Park.

Beyond right field is China Basin, a section of San Francisco Bay, which is dubbed McCovey Cove after famed Giants first baseman and left-handed slugger Willie McCovey, and into which a number of home runs have been hit on the fly. As of September 15, 2024, 105 &quot;splash hits&quot; have been knocked into the Cove by Giants players since the park opened; 35 of those were hit by Barry Bonds, who remains the only player to record two splash hits in the same game. The most recent splash hit occurred on September 15, 2024, by Heliot Ramos. Ramos became the first right-handed batter to record a &quot;splash hit&quot;, as all 104 previous hits were done by left-handed batters. These hits are tallied on an electronic counter on the right field wall. Opponents have hit the water on the fly 54 times; Todd Hundley of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the first visitor to do so on June 30, 2000. Curtis Granderson, Luis Gonzalez, Cliff Floyd, and Max Muncy are the only visiting players to do so twice. Carlos Delgado and Adam LaRoche have performed the feat thrice. Michael Harris II is the most recent visiting player to record a splash hit, doing so on August 14, 2024. On June 27, 2010, David Ortiz became the first American League player to hit a splash hit. Since then, the only other AL players who have are Mitch Moreland, Adam Dunn, Rougned Odor, and Shin-Soo Choo.

Behind the scoreboard in center field is a pier where ferries let fans 
off at the park. On game days, fans take to the water of McCovey Cove in boats often with fishing nets in the hope of collecting a home run ball. Just beyond the wall, behind the King Street ballpark, is a public waterfront promenade. Across the cove from the ballpark are McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring monuments to past Giants legends.

===Rusty, the Coke bottle, and the glove===
When the park opened in 2000, taking residence on the right field wall was Rusty the Mechanical Man, a two-dimensional, robotic baseball player that stood tall and weighed tons. The Santa Clarita-based firm Technifex engineered, fabricated and programmed Rusty to appear after major plays during games as a fully animated giant 1920s-era tin toy. After technical problems arose with Rusty, it was removed from the wall, though the enclosure that housed him remained for years. In 2008, the enclosure was removed to make way for luxury boxes.

Behind the left field bleachers is &quot;The Coca-Cola Fan Lot&quot;. The ballpark features an long Coca-Cola bottle with playground slides that light up with every Giants home run, and a miniature version of the stadium. Bubbles originally accompanied the bottle, but never worked as intended and were removed. Directly to the bottle&#x27;s right from home plate is another oversized representation of a ballpark stalwart, the &quot;Giant 1927 Old-Time Four-Fingered Baseball Glove&quot;—this particular one is made of steel and fiberglass, which is behind the sign. Behind and farther to the left is &quot;The Little Giants Park&quot;, a miniature baseball diamond.

To the right of the glove sculpture is a large plaza area for functions and parties to be held during games. It is also the site of &quot;Orlando&#x27;s&quot;, the concessions stand of Giants great Orlando Cepeda. Right-center field features a retired San Francisco cable car numbered 44 (retired cable car #4, formerly #504) in honor of Giants great Willie McCovey. Originally, the cable car had a label that stated &quot;No Dodgers Fans Allowed&quot;, as well as one end of the car numbered 24 in honor of Willie Mays and the other end numbered 44 in honor of Willie McCovey. The foghorn—a feature introduced at Candlestick Park by the current Giants ownership group – was transferred to Oracle and hung underneath the scoreboard. It blows when a Giants player hits a home run or at the conclusion of a Giants win.

===@Café===

Located behind the centerfield bleachers, the ballpark features the @Café, a social media café, which opened in the 2013 season. The cafe serves Peet&#x27;s Coffee and features large screens that show off fans&#x27; social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which are curated by the Giants organization.

The cafe replaced a team-themed Build-A-Bear Workshop store, where fans could build their own stuffed Giants&#x27; mascot, Lou Seal, or create other Giants-themed stuffed animals.

===Scoreboards===

In addition to the automated scoreboards, which now include a new HD videoboard by Mitsubishi, the park has a manually-operated scoreboard on the right field wall, which displays all the scores of Major League Baseball games being played elsewhere. The manual scoreboards are operated by three employees, whose work on game days starts at least two hours before the first pitch. A members-only bar, Gotham Club, is located behind the manual scoreboard, complete with a bowling alley and pool tables. Former players and VIPs are the only patrons of this exclusive area. Five other ballparks also use hand-operated out-of-town scoreboards: Coors Field, Fenway Park, Minute Maid Park, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and Wrigley Field.

===Wireless internet===
Starting in 2004, the Giants installed 122 wireless internet access points, covering all concourses and seating areas, creating one of the largest public hotspots in the world at the time.

===San Francisco Giants Wall of Fame===

On September 23, 2008, the Giants Wall of Fame was unveiled on the King Street side of the ballpark, as part of the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Giants&#x27; move to San Francisco. 48 retired players were inducted, based on longevity and achievement. Eligibility requirements for players to be on the Wall are either a minimum of three seasons with three MLB All-Star selections in every season, five years as a San Francisco Giant with an MLB All-Star Game selection, nine seasons played with the team, or any player with three World Series rings as a Giant. Rich Aurilia and Shawn Estes were added in 2010. Jason Schmidt and Marvin Benard were added in 2011, and Barry Bonds was added in 2017.

===Statues===

Outside the ballpark are six statues, five of which are dedicated to San Francisco Giants all-time greats.

The Willie Mays statue is located in front of the ballpark entrance at 24 Willie Mays Plaza and is surrounded with 24 palm trees, in honor of his number 24 uniform, retired by the Giants. It was dedicated at noon on March 31, 2000, prior to the opening of the ballpark and was commissioned by Giants Managing Partner Peter Magowan.

Another statue was dedicated to Willie McCovey in 2003, and is located at McCovey Point across McCovey Cove. Around the statue are a number of plaques that celebrate the winners of the Willie Mac Award. The statue is located at China Basin Park next to the Barry Bonds Junior Giants Field, a T-ball park. Also located on the sea wall promenade are plaques showing the Opening Day roster of every Giants team from 1958 through 1999. Giants fans who contributed funds to China Basin Park had their own tiles with their own inscriptions set into the wall.

A third statue, dedicated in 2005, honors former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal, and is located outside the ballpark at the Lefty O&#x27;Doul Gate entrance.

The fourth and only non-human statue is located at the park&#x27;s ferry plaza behind center field, also known as Seals Plaza. A statue of a seal bobbing a baseball on its nose honors the memory of the San Francisco Seals, the minor league baseball club that played before the arrival of the Giants in 1958.

On September 6, 2008, during a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, a fifth statue depicting Giants great Orlando Cepeda was dedicated at the corner of 2nd Street and King Street, next to the ballpark. A sixth statue, dedicated on August 13, 2016, honors former Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry in the same location. All five player statues were created by sculptor William Behrends of North Carolina.

===Left field Chevron banner and ground rule issues===

One feature of the ballpark is the long-running Chevron advertisement located in left field, featuring an outline of the company&#x27;s claymation Chevron Cars. The top &#x27;roofs&#x27; of the cars (along with a dog and a surfboard hanging out a car window) are extended out, rendering it several inches higher than the wall base, creating a ground rules issue. Several instances where potential over-the-wall catches to take away home runs were thwarted have occurred because of the advertisement&#x27;s top dimensions. One notable example of this occurred during Game 3 of the 2016 NLDS against the Chicago Cubs. Kris Bryant hit a ball well into left field, with Giants left fielder Gregor Blanco attempting a catch. The ball landed on the roof of one of the cars, past the wall, and out of his reach, rendering it a home run and tying the game in the top of the ninth inning (though the Giants would win the game in extra innings for their only win in the series).

==Notable events==
===2000s===
The opening series took place April 11–13, 2000, against the Los Angeles Dodgers (the team the Giants faced in their final series at Candlestick Park), and the Giants were swept in three games. In the first game of that series, the Giants lost 6–5, highlighted by three home runs from the Dodgers&#x27; Kevin Elster. On May 1, 2000, Barry Bonds became the first player to hit a &quot;splash hit&quot; home run into McCovey Cove.

In just its first few years of existence, the ballpark saw its share of historic events primarily due to veteran Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. On April 17, 2001, Bonds hit his 500th career home run at then-Pacific Bell Park. Later that year, he set the single season home run record when he hit home runs number 71, 72, and 73 over the weekend of October 5 to close the season. On August 9, 2002, Bonds hit his 600th career home run at the park. On April 12, 2004, Bonds hit career home run 660 at SBC Park to tie Willie Mays for third on the all-time list and on the next night, he hit number 661 to move into sole possession of third place. On September 17, 2004, Bonds hit his 700th career home run at the park to become just the third member of baseball&#x27;s 700 club. On May 28, 2006, Bonds hit his 715th home run at the park to pass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list. On August 7, 2007, Bonds hit his 756th home run, breaking Hank Aaron&#x27;s record.

The park hosted games three through five of the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels, which the Giants lost four games to three. It also hosted the 2007 MLB All-Star Game, which the American League won 5–4 over the National League.

On July 10, 2009, the Giants&#x27; Jonathan Sánchez pitched the first no-hitter.

===2010s===
On October 27 and 28, 2010, the Giants hosted the first two games of the World Series, beating the Texas Rangers in both games. They ultimately went on to win the series four games to one, their first championship since the team moved to San Francisco in 1958, though the clinching game was played at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington rather than at Oracle Park.

On June 13, 2012, Matt Cain threw the 22nd perfect game in MLB history—and first in Giants history—against the Houston Astros.

Oracle Park hosted Games 1 and 2 of the 2012 World Series on October 24 and 25. The Giants beat the Detroit Tigers twice, 8–3 and 2–0 respectively. The Giants would go on to win the 2012 World Series in a four-game sweep at Comerica Park.

The stadium hosted of the semifinal and final rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic on March 17–19.

On July 23, 2013, due to a previous rain-out in Cincinnati, Oracle Park served as the &quot;home&quot; venue of the Cincinnati Reds for the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants. Giants manager Bruce Bochy won his 1,500th career game.

On June 25, 2014, Tim Lincecum pitched the 3rd no-hitter at Oracle Park against the San Diego Padres in a 4–0 win. It was his 2nd no-hitter of his career, with both of them coming against the Padres.

Oracle Park hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2014 World Series on October 24, 25 and 26. The Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 2 out of the 3 games played at Oracle Park, losing Game 3, 3–2, before winning Games 4 and 5, 11–4 and 5–0 respectively. They ultimately went on to win the series in seven games, with the clinching game played at Kauffman Stadium rather than at Oracle Park. As of 2019, the Giants have not hosted a World Series clincher at Oracle Park, but they did host two at Candlestick Park: the first being in , which was won by the New York Yankees, and the second in , which the Oakland Athletics won in a four-game sweep.

On June 15, 2015, the Giants set a record for most consecutive home losses at Oracle Park at nine straight games with a 5–1 loss to the Seattle Mariners. This losing streak was the Giants&#x27; longest since an 11-game home loss streak at the Polo Grounds in New York in 1940.

From October 1, 2010, to July 18, 2017, Oracle Park recorded 530 consecutive sellouts, the second longest in Major League history behind Fenway Park&#x27;s 794 consecutive sellouts from 2003 to 2013.

==Non-baseball events==
Giants Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Giants created and headed by longtime team executive Pat Gallagher, brings non-baseball events to Oracle Park on days when the Giants do not play. Prominent among these has been the usage of the stadium for football. It has also hosted a range of other sporting and musical events.

===Football===
The park was home to the XFL&#x27;s San Francisco Demons in 2001, the East–West Shrine Game (until 2006), and the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009.

From 2002 to 2013, it was also home to college football&#x27;s Redbox Bowl when the game was known as the San Francisco Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Fight Hunger Bowl. In 2011, Oracle Park became the temporary home football stadium for the California Golden Bears while Cal&#x27;s on-campus stadium, California Memorial Stadium, underwent renovation.

Oracle Park also hosted its first high school football game in 2011, the Central Coast Section Division III football championship game between long-time San Francisco rivals St. Ignatius College Preparatory and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory.

In January 2019, it was reported that the Oakland Raiders had considered temporarily moving to Oracle Park for the 2019 NFL season, as an interim measure before construction of a stadium in their new home city of Las Vegas was complete for 2020. However, the 49ers refused to waive their territorial rights, and the Raiders would ultimately reach an agreement with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority to return to the Oakland Coliseum for the 2019 season with a provision for the 2020 season should construction of Allegiant Stadium be delayed.

===Soccer===
On February 10, 2006, the U.S. men&#x27;s soccer team defeated Japan 3–2 at Oracle in a friendly.

A match of the 2011 World Football Challenge between Manchester City and Club America was held at Oracle, drawing a crowd of 11,250.

On March 17, 2012, the Houston Dynamo defeated the San Jose Earthquakes 1–0 in a regular season Major League Soccer match at Oracle.

On July 31, 2013, Everton defeated Juventus 6–5 on penalties after ending regulation tied 1–1 as part of the 2013 International Champions Cup.

===Rugby===
The stadium hosted the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens from July 20 to 22.

===Monster Jam===
Monster Jam attended the venue for four years in a row from 2004 to 2007. The tracks were usually wet due to the shows being held in the winter, of which rainfall is common on the west coast around those times. Monster Jam returned for the first time in 17 years in January 2024.

===Other events===
The stadium hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 2003 to 2010. Supercross returned for the first time in 14 years in January 2024.

The Mavericks big-wave surfing contest is broadcast live on the giant video display at Oracle Park when the event is held. In 2006, the park hosted ICER AIR the first stadium big-air ski and snowboard competition to be held in the United States.

San Francisco Opera partnered with Giants Enterprises to do three broadcasts, most recently &quot;Tosca&quot;, in June and September 2009.

In summer 2010, the park hosted an audition stop for the 2011 (10th) season of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

In October 2013, rapper Kanye West rented out the stadium and the scoreboard for a private event, which turned out to be an elaborate marriage proposal to his girlfriend, reality personality Kim Kardashian.

Starting in 2015, the stadium began hosting commencement exercises for San Francisco State University.

During the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race 30&quot;, the park was the first location visited by teams after they arrived in San Francisco, with teams having to find a clue next to the Willie Mays Statue and then kayaking for baseballs in McCovey Cove.

American singer-songwriter and actress Lady Gaga headlined Oracle Park on two occasions, in August 2017 on her Joanne World Tour, and once again in September 2022 during The Chromatica Ball. The latter concert became the highest grossing show in the stadium&#x27;s history.

Korean female group BLACKPINK headlined Oracle Park on August 22, 2023, for their Born Pink World Tour making them the first female Korean group to sell out an MLB Stadium.

Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira will perform in the stadium on June 30, 2025 as part of her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour. She will be the first Latin act and Latin Female act to headline a concert.

<doc id="361266" wikidata="Q1529899" url="?curid=361266" title="List of major power outages">
<text>This is a list of notable wide-scale power outages. To be included, the power outage must conform to of the following criteria:
* The outage must not be planned by the service provider.
* The outage must affect at least 1,000 people.
* The outage must last at least one hour.
* There must be at least 1,000,000 person-hours of disruption.

For example:
* 1,000 people affected for 1,000 hours (42 days) or more would be included; fewer than 1,000 people would not be, regardless of duration.
* One million people affected for a minimum of one hour would be included; if the duration were less than one hour, it would not, regardless of number of people.
* 10,000 people affected for 100 hours, or 100,000 for 10 hours would be included.
== Largest ==
== Longest ==
This method is a formula that multiplies the number of hours by the population affected, and does not reflect the nominal time in hours that the outages lasted.
== Chronology ==
=== 1960s ===
==== 1965 ====
* November 9—United States and Canada—The Northeast blackout of 1965 affected portions of seven northeastern U.S. states and Ontario. Most radio and television stations within the area lost power or lost teletype communications, so people within the blackout area relied on broadcasts from other areas to learn information about the blackout.

==== 1969 ====
* August 5—United States—A 50-mile (80 km) stretch of Florida&#x27;s Gold Coast was hit with a general power failure after an explosion at the Cutler Ridge facility. The outage affected more than 2 million people, and created a vast traffic jam. Miami and Fort Lauderdale downtown areas were offline for almost two hours, with other areas dark for much longer periods.

=== 1970s ===
==== 1971 ====
* February 7—United States—On that evening, power in parts of the New York City borough of Manhattan was lost for over four hours. The power outage was originally thought to have been caused by an explosion at Con Ed&#x27;s Waterside power facility on 40th Street and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, but the cause was later suspected to be a result of a fault in a transformer at a substation on 13th Street. New York City television and FM radio stations that transmit from the Empire State Building were off the air. AM radio stations were largely unaffected, as most of their transmitters were located in either Northern New Jersey (e.g. WABC (AM)) or on High Island (e.g. WCBS (AM)) in the Bronx, which was not affected by the blackout. However, several Manhattan AM station studios were affected due to insufficient power backups. Several lines of the IND and IRT subway lines were affected, stranding passengers. At Grand Central Terminal power in the building was lost, but power on the tracks was retained because it ran on direct current. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; was also affected when the blackout caused their printing facility to halt operations.

==== 1976 ====
* July 4—United States—A major power failure affected most of Utah and parts of Wyoming for 1.5 to 6 hours.

==== 1977 ====
* May 10—Romania—A nationwide blackout that lasted 5 hours caused US$1 billion losses, larger than the Vrancea earthquake on March 4. Subsequent investigations showed it was caused by human error.
* May 17—United States—Parts of South Florida were blacked out after a malfunctioning relay caused the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Miami to go offline.
* July 13–14 —United States—In New York City, 9 million people were affected by a power outage. It was a result of a transmission failure due to a lightning strike on power lines. A second lightning strike caused the loss of two more overhead power lines, and the last power connection between New York City and the Northwest. The power outage resulted in high instances of looting occurring over 26 hours.
* September 20—Canada—A power outage covered almost the entire province of Quebec, affecting two million people, after a failure at the Montagnais Substation along a series of 735 kV transmission lines connecting to the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador. Power was restored to scattered rural areas within an hour and service was brought back to parts of Montreal and Quebec City within two hours; it took several hours to fully restore power.

==== 1978 ====
* December 19—France—A power line overload caused a 4 hour outage in the French mainland.

=== 1980s ===

==== 1981 ====
* January 8—United States—Prisoners on a work assignment burning trash and debris at the Utah State Prison in Draper, accidentally caused a major power failure when something they were burning exploded, causing a fireball that shorted out transmission lines above them. 1.5 million people lost power, in almost all of Utah, as well as parts of southeastern Idaho and southwestern Wyoming.

==== 1982 ====
* December 22—United States—A transmission tower near Tracy, California collapsed onto an adjacent tower bringing down two 500-kV lines and a pair of 230-kV lines that passed underneath the 500-kV right of way. Total loss of 12,530 MW affected approximately five million people on the west coast.

==== 1983 ====
* December 27—Sweden—Two-thirds of the country&#x27;s network was shut down when a single component in a switching station failed, causing a short circuit in a transformer. This affected about 4.5million people in the more densely populated southern half.

====1985====
* May 17—United States—Most of South Florida was blacked out after a brush fire in the Everglades damaged overhead transmission lines. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and the Florida Keys lost power for about 3.5 hours. About 4.5 million people were affected.

====1987====
* October 16—United Kingdom—The Great Storm of 1987 interrupted the High-Voltage Cross-Channel Link between the UK and France. The storm caused a domino effect of power outages throughout South East England.

==== 1989 ====
* March 13—Canada—The March 1989 geomagnetic storm caused the Hydro-Québec power failure which left seven million people in Quebec without power for over nine hours.
* October 17—United States—The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake knocked out power to about 1.4 million customers in Northern California, mainly due to damaged electrical substations.

=== 1990s ===
==== 1991 ====
* July 7—United States and Canada—A powerful wind storm affected a large portion of central North America and caused power outages for about one million customers from Iowa to Ontario.

==== 1992 ====
* August 24—United States—As Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern Florida Keys it downed 17 miles (27 km) of power lines, breaking the wooden poles they were strung on, along a path that was in four feet (122 cm) of water, stretching from the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant southward to the upper Keys. The shallow depth prevented the use of large construction barge cranes for rebuilding the power pylons but the water was too deep for land-based construction vehicles. As a result, the Upper and Middle Keys were largely without power for several months as the Middle Keys Electric Co-op only had generating capacity for 10% of its demand. The power lines heading north to Miami were restored much more quickly, as they were strung along the side of US Highway 1 on dry land. Key West power was in the process of decommissioning an end-of-life oil-fired plant and was able to restore 75% generating capacity for the lower keys in one day as there was no storm damage that far south. Key West power was in the process of converting to sourcing 100% of its electricity from the Turkey Point facility.

==== 1995 ====
*October 4—United States and Canada—Hurricane Opal, which killed at least 59 people, knocked out power to over two million customers across eastern and southern North America.

==== 1996 ====
* July 2–3—United States, Canada and Mexico—Two million people lost power due to a transmission line overheating (the temperature was around 38 °C/100 °F) in Idaho and a 230-kV line between Montana and Idaho tripping. Some customers were without power for minutes, while others were without for hours.
* August 10—United States and Mexico—the Western Intertie buckled under the high summer heat of the 1996 Western North America blackouts, causing a cascading power failure affecting nine western U.S. states and parts of Mexico. Four million people were affected. Power was out in some locations for four days.
* November 19—United States—A severe ice storm affected the region around Spokane, Washington and Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho causing power outages lasting up to two weeks.

==== 1998 ====
* January—United States and Canada—The North American Ice Storm of 1998 caused prolonged blackouts in northeastern North America, particularly in Quebec, where many transmission towers were destroyed by ice. Over 3.5 million customers in total lost power during the event.
* January 3—Philippines—A broken power line caused by a falling Meralco utility post in Laguna led to a power interruption that affected the entire island of Luzon for almost 7 hours.
* February 19–March 27—New Zealand—The 1998 Auckland power crisis resulted in the entire Central Business District of Auckland being without power for several weeks, after a line failure caused a chain reaction leading to the failure of three other lines.
* May 31—United States and Canada—A powerful wind storm caused a power outage for nearly two million customers across much of central North America.
* September 7—United States—A series of widespread derechos in the Northeast (the Labor Day Derechos) caused a power outage for hundreds of thousands of customers for several days.
* December 8—United States—In the San Francisco area, over 350,000 customers (buildings) or 940,000 people were affected by an outage caused when the Pacific Gas and Electric Company placed a San Mateo sub-station online at 8:17 am PST, while the station was still grounded following maintenance. This drew so much power from the transmission lines on the San Francisco Peninsula that 25 other sub-stations in the city automatically and immediately shut down. Power was not fully restored until almost 4:00 pm PST the same day. Economic costs were estimated in tens of millions of dollars.

==== 1999 ====
* March 11–June 22—Brazil—The 1999 Southern Brazil blackout was a widespread power outage (the largest ever at the time) that involved São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul, affecting an estimated 75 to 97 million people and lasting 103 days. A chain reaction was started when a lightning strike occurred at 22h 16m at an electricity substation in Bauru, São Paulo State, causing most of the 440 kV circuits at the substation to trip. With few routes for the power to flow from the generating stations via the 440 kV system (a very important system to São Paulo, carrying electricity generated by the Paraná River) a lot of generators automatically shut down because they did not have any load. The world&#x27;s biggest power plant at the time, Itaipu, tried to support the load that was no longer being supplied by the 440 kV power plants, but the 750 kV AC lines and the 600 kV DC lines that connected the plant to the rest of the system could not take the load and tripped too. In Rio, the military police placed 1,200 men in the streets to avoid looting. In São Paulo, traffic authorities announced they closed the city&#x27;s tunnels to prevent robberies. More than 60,000 people were on Rio&#x27;s subway when lights went out. At midnight, power began returning to some areas, with fully power restored on June 22.
* July 5—United States and Canada—the Boundary Waters–Canadian derecho cut power to over 600,000 homes in Quebec with additional outages in New England and in the Upper Great Lakes region.
* July 29—Taiwan—The  326 transmission tower collapsed due to a landslide, disconnecting around 8.46 million electricity consumers.
* December 26–28—France—Cyclone Lothar and Martin left 3.4 million customers without electricity, and forced Électricité de France to acquire all the available portable power generators in Europe, with some even brought in from Canada. These storms brought a fourth of France&#x27;s high-tension transmission lines down and 300 high-voltage transmission pylons were toppled. It was described as one of the greatest energy disruptions ever experienced by a modern developed country.

=== 2000s ===

==== 2000 ====
* May 9—Portugal—A major power outage left the entire southern half of the country, including Lisbon, without power for a few hours. The blackout occurred shortly after 10 pm local time. The &quot;apagão&quot; (translated as &quot;super outage&quot;), suddenly plunged Lisbon in complete darkness. Stalled commuter trains and traffic light failures wreaked some havoc in the streets. Security was immediately reinforced in the city, but no rise in criminal activity was registered. Energias de Portugal, the main electricity operator, later reported that the blackout was due to the electrocution of a stork, which landed &quot;on the wrong place at the wrong time&quot;.
* United States—During the 12-month California electricity crisis of 2000–01, there were regular power failures due to energy shortages.
* October 20—Philippines—A massive power outage affected most of Luzon including Metro Manila, caused by system failures in the transmission lines of the National Power Corporation in Pangasinan and Bulacan; electricity was fully restored 16 hours later.

==== 2001 ====
* January 2—India—A fault in the transmission system in the state of Uttar Pradesh led to cascading failure throughout North India.
* May 20-August 28—Iran—A problem at a power substation caused a major blackout. Outages were reported in Tehran and at least six provincial capitals: Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Kermanshah, Qazvin, and Hamadan.

==== 2002 ====
* January 30—United States—A major ice storm hit Kansas City, Missouri, knocking trees into power lines and blowing up transformers throughout the city. The outage affected more than 270,000 people.
* March 12—Indonesia—A power failure affected 13 million people in South Sumatra and Lampung.
* July 13—Azerbaijan—Baku and nearly the entirety of the country experienced a blackout due to unknown causes.
* April 30—United States—Nearly all of JEA&#x27;s 355,000 customers in Jacksonville, Florida, lost power.

==== 2003 ====
* July 22—United States—A severe wind storm disrupted power to over 300,000 customers in the Memphis, Tennessee, metropolitan area.
* August 14–16—United States and Canada—The Northeast blackout of 2003, a wide-area power failure in the northeastern US and central Canada, affected over 55 million people, 14 days fully restored.
* September 2—Malaysia—The 2003 southern Malaysia blackout resulted when a power failure affected five states (out of 13), including the capital Kuala Lumpur, for five hours, starting at 10:00 am local time.
* September 23—Denmark and Sweden—A power failure affected five million people in east Denmark and southern Sweden.
* September 28—Italy—The 2003 Italy blackout affected the entire country except Sardinia, cutting service to more than 56 million people.

==== 2004 ====
* July 12—Greece—Two power plants in Lavrio and Megalopolis shut down due to malfunction within 12 hours of each other during a period of high demand due to a heat wave. That led to a cascading failure causing the collapse of the entire Southern (Power) System, affecting several million people in southern Greece.

==== 2005 ====
* Malaysia—The 2005 Malaysia electricity blackout crisis caused electricity to fail in many states in Peninsular Malaysia, including Perak, Penang, Kedah, and Perlis. This was due to a fault of the main cable transmission line grid near Serendah, Selangor.
* January—Brazil—A cyber attack disrupted power service in three cities north of Rio de Janeiro, affecting tens of thousands of people.
* May 25–August 3—Russia—The 2005 Moscow power blackouts ten-week-long power outage affected more than two million people in central Russia. The blackout was due to a cascading failure of the power grid started by a transformer failure. Some lines of the Moscow Metro lost power, stranding people in trains, 10 weeks fully power restored.
* August 29—United States—Hurricane Katrina caused widespread power outages throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Exact totals are difficult to define, especially in Louisiana parishes which became unoccupied for months. Power was also disrupted to 1.3 million customers when it passed over Florida several days earlier. In total, around 2.6million people across the US were left without power as a result of the storm.

==== 2006 ====
* August 1—Canada—In the Laurentians of Québec, a large number (146,000, at its peak in the evening) of households were left without electricity for a whole day, and some for up to a week, due to intense thunderstorms that rolled through southern Quebec, including the greater Montreal area. Over 450,000 customers in total were affected.
* August 2—Canada—Nearly a quarter million customers of Hydro One lost power after severe thunderstorms that included tornadoes and damaging wind ripped through southern and eastern Ontario.
*August 14—Japan—A floating crane hit and broke a transmission line across the Edo River, interrupting power to 1,391,000 customers in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, including Tokyo, Yokohama, and part of Kawasaki and Ichikawa. Power was restored to all but 15,000 customers within an hour. Full restoration was completed four hours and 42 minutes after the start of the incident.
* November 4—Europe—On that night, over 15 million households across the main parts of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal were left without power after a cascading breakdown of the 2006 European blackout. Power grids of several other nations (Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Greece, and Morocco) experienced minor local outages. The root cause was an overload triggered by the German electricity company E.ON switching off an electricity line over the river Ems to allow the cruise ship &quot;Norwegian Pearl&quot; to pass through safely. The impact of this disconnection on the security of the network had not been properly assessed, and resulted in the European transmission grid splitting into three independent parts for a period of two hours. The imbalance between generation and demand in each section resulted in the power outages for consumers.
* December 14—United States and Canada—The Hanukkah Eve windstorm of 2006 caused widespread damage to the power grid throughout Washington and into parts of Oregon, British Columbia, and Idaho; in some cases, blackouts in the affected area lasted longer than a week.

Power was restored to the entire region around 11:00 am.
* November 10–20—Brazil and Paraguay—Starting at 10:13 pm Brasília official time, the 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout was caused by the failure of transmission lines from Itaipu Dam, the world&#x27;s second-largest hydroelectric dam, affecting over 80 million customers. The failure was caused by a major thunder storm which affected a key transmission line to southeastern Brazil, causing all 20 turbines at the plant to shut down due to the abrupt fall of power demand. Four of Brazil&#x27;s most densely populated states entirely lost power (including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) with 14 more states being partly affected. The entire country of Paraguay experienced the power failure. It took about seven hours for the system to fully recover. This is regarded as one of the largest blackouts in history, taking 10 days for power to be fully restored.

<text>This is a list of the 356 heavy rail passenger stations in and around London, England (340 being within the boundary of Greater London) where London area ticketing applies. United Kingdom railway stations are grouped into one of a number of categories, ranging from A—national hub to F—small unstaffed bare platform. Many of the principal central London stations are managed by Network Rail and together form a London station group. Most other stations are managed by the train operating company that provides the majority of services at the station. The London Underground is the manager of some stations that are also served by heavy rail services.

== Scope ==
Greater London is divided into 6 fare zones (with the exception of Stratford International, which is not in any fare zones), with Zone 1 being the central area and Zones 2–6 forming concentric rings around it. London zonal pricing is applied to journeys between stations wholly within Zones 1–6.

The list includes National Rail stations within London fare zones 1–6, plus Stratford International. It does not include stations exclusively served by the London Underground, Tramlink and Docklands Light Railway.

There are a number of stations designated as Zones 7, 8 or 9. These zones are totally outside Greater London where London area rail ticketing doesn&#x27;t apply, and are treated differently compared to stations within Zones 1–6, therefore they are excluded from the scope of this article.

<text>Gesang der Jünglinge (literally &quot;Song of the Youths&quot;) is an electronic music work by Karlheinz Stockhausen. It was realized in 1955–56 at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk studio in Cologne and is Work Number 8 in the composer&#x27;s catalog. The vocal parts were supplied by 12-year-old Josef Protschka. It is exactly 13 minutes, 14 seconds long.

The work, normally described as &quot;the first masterpiece of electronic music&quot; and &quot;an opus, in the most emphatic sense of the term&quot;, is significant in that it seamlessly integrates electronic sounds with the human voice by means of matching voice resonances with pitch and creating sounds of phonemes electronically. In this way, for the first time ever it successfully brought together the two opposing worlds of the purely electronically generated German &quot;elektronische Musik&quot; and the French &quot;musique concrète&quot;, which transforms recordings of acoustical events. &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; is also noted for its early use of spatiality; it was originally in five-channel sound, which was later reduced to just four channels (mixed to monaural and later to stereo for commercial recording release).

==History==
In the autumn of 1954, Stockhausen conceived the idea of composing a mass for electronic sounds and voices. According to his official biographer, Stockhausen regarded this mass as a sacred work written from personal conviction, and asked his mentor, the director of the WDR electronic studio Herbert Eimert, to write to the Diocesan office of the Archbishop of Cologne for permission to have the work performed in the Cologne Cathedral. Stockhausen was bitterly disappointed when the request was refused on grounds that loudspeakers had no place in church. Although there is no doubt about Stockhausen&#x27;s ambition to create an electronic mass, nor that he was frustrated by the lack of assurance that a suitable sacred venue or worship service would be sanctioned by the church, it is equally certain that &quot;he never made an official request to the General Vicariate of the Archdiocese of Cologne and, therefore, never could have received an official response from them, whatever the result might have been&quot;. Furthermore, there is no evidence at all that Eimert, who was a Protestant, ever broached the subject even informally with Johannes Overath, the responsible official in the Cologne archdiocese at the time (as well as a member of the Broadcasting Council from 2 March 1955), so that the version of the story presented by Kurtz cannot be sustained on the basis of contemporary records.

==Materials and form==
There are three basic types of material used: (1) electronically generated sine tones, (2) electronically generated pulses (clicks), and (3) filtered white noise. To these is added the recorded voice of a boy soprano, which incorporates elements of all three types: vowels are harmonic spectra, which may be conceived as based on sine tones; fricatives and sibilants are like filtered noises; plosives resemble impulses. Each of these may be composed along a scale running from discrete events to massed &quot;complexes&quot; structured statistically. The last category occurs in Stockhausen&#x27;s electronic music for the first time in &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;, and originates in the course of studies Stockhausen took between 1954 and 1956 with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn.

The text of &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; is from a Biblical story in the Book of Daniel where Nebuchadnezzar throws Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into a fiery furnace but miraculously they are unharmed and begin to sing praises to God. This text is presented in a carefully devised scale of seven degrees of comprehensibility, an idea which also came from Werner Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s seminars.

==Influence on popular music==
Key aspects of the arrangement of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, the final track of The Beatles&#x27; 1966 studio album &quot;Revolver,&quot; were inspired by &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is credited as a Lennon–McCartney song, but was written primarily by John Lennon with major contributions to the arrangement by Paul McCartney. The track included looped tape effects. For the track, McCartney supplied a bag of -inch audio tape loops he had made at home after listening to &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;. The Beatles would continue to use similar efforts with &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, a track produced in 1968 for &quot;The White Album&quot; that also made use of sound collage.

<doc id="361276" wikidata="Q1506941" url="?curid=361276" title="George Baker (British actor)">
<text>George Morris Baker, MBE (1 April 19317 October 2011) was an English actor and writer. He was best known for portraying Tiberius in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, and Inspector Wexford in &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;.

==Early life==
Baker was born in Varna, Bulgaria. His father was an English businessman and honorary vice consul and his mother an Irish Red Cross nurse who moved to Bulgaria to help fight cholera.

He attended Lancing College, Sussex; he then appeared as an actor in repertory theatre and at the Old Vic.

==Career==
===Early film stardom===
Baker&#x27;s first film was &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1953). He made his name in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), and his first starring role was in &quot;The Ship That Died of Shame&quot; (1955) with Richard Attenborough.

Baker also starred as a leading man in &quot;The Woman for Joe&quot; (1955) opposite Diane Cilento; &quot;The Feminine Touch&quot; (1956), playing a handsome doctor in a film about nurses; &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot; (1956), playing a heroic soldier, with Robert Shaw and Stanley Baker in support; and &quot;The Extra Day&quot; (1956), a comedy. The same year he appeared in the West End in Agatha Christie&#x27;s play &quot;Towards Zero&quot;.

Baker was also the lead in &quot;These Dangerous Years&quot; (1957), an attempt to make a film star of Frankie Vaughan. He was a doctor again in &quot;No Time for Tears&quot; (1957) and played a royalist swashbuckling hero of the English Civil War in &quot;The Moonraker&quot; (1958). He supported Diana Dors in &quot;Tread Softly Stranger&quot; (1958).

Baker&#x27;s later films included &quot;Lancelot and Guinevere&quot; (1963) and &quot;Curse of the Fly&quot; (1965).

===Television work===
Over time, Baker became better known as a television actor. He had the heroic lead in &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; (1964), played security chief Thallon in &quot;Undermind&quot; (1965), and was the second (to Guy Doleman) of many actors to portray the role of &quot;Number Two&quot; in the series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, appearing in the series&#x27; first episode. He portrayed the character of George King in Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Bone Grinder&quot; (1968), a metaphor for the decline of the British Empire and the rise of American power in the post-war world.

He appeared in his own TV comedy series &quot;Bowler&quot;. He was also in the first episode of &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, playing a company boss interviewing the show&#x27;s hapless main character.

In the acclaimed 1976 drama serial, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Baker played the emperor Tiberius Caesar. George R.R. Martin, author of the book series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, which was later adapted into TV&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, has stated that the historical Tiberius and Baker&#x27;s performance in particular were part of the inspiration for his character Stannis Baratheon. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Get Some In!&quot;.

In 1977, he starred as Inspector Roderick Alleyn in the &quot;Ngaio Marsh Theatre&quot;; four adaptations of the crime and mystery novels of Ngaio Marsh with New Zealand settings, in a production for New Zealand television. From 1987 to 2000, he played Inspector Reg Wexford in numerous television adaptations of mysteries by Ruth Rendell and this is probably the role for which he became best known. In 1993, following the death of his second wife, he married the actress Louie Ramsay, who played Mrs Wexford in the same television series.

He also appeared in &quot;The Baron&quot;, &quot;Survivors&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot; in Series 1&#x27;s &quot;You Gotta Have Friends&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (as brewery owner Cecil Newton), in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Full Circle&quot; and as twin brothers in a 2005 episode of Midsomer Murders titled &quot;The House in the Woods&quot;.

Baker also appeared in the British comedy television series &quot;The Goodies&quot;&#x27; episode &quot;Tower of London&quot; as the &quot;Chief Beefeater&quot;, as well as in the sitcom &quot;No Job for a Lady&quot;, and he is popularly known for playing Captain Benson, the James Bond ally in the film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and for playing Sir Hilary Bray, a heraldry expert, in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. Later, when Bond, played by George Lazenby, impersonates Bray to gain access to Blofeld, Baker&#x27;s voice was dubbed in place of Lazenby&#x27;s to provide the accent. Baker also played an (uncredited) NASA engineer in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

Ian Fleming considered Baker to be the ideal candidate to play James Bond in the films but the role went to Sean Connery because Baker had prior commitments.

He played a character called &quot;Jamus Bondus&quot; in an episode of the 1970s farcical sitcom &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;.

Baker&#x27;s first theatre work was in repertory at Deal, Kent. His major stage credits include a season with the Old Vic company (1959–61), where he played Bolingbroke in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Jack in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and Warwick in &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. In 1965 he started his own touring company, Candida Plays, based at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He was Claudius in Buzz Goodbody&#x27;s celebrated, modern-dress &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1975.

In 1980 Baker wrote &quot;Fatal Spring&quot;, a play for television dealing with lives of poets Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves; this appeared on BBC 2 on 7 November 1980. It won him a United Nations peace award. His other writing credits included four of the &quot;Wexford&quot; screenplays.

Baker was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1995 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a photo shoot on board a boat at Port Solent on the Hampshire coast. He has also appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

==MBE==
In 2007, Baker was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his charitable work helping establish a youth club in his home village.

==Personal life==
Baker&#x27;s third wife, Louie Ramsay, who died earlier in 2011, played his onscreen wife Dora in &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;. Baker was survived by five daughters (four from his first marriage, one from his second to Sally Home).

His granddaughter Kim Sherwood is a writer; her debut novel, &quot;Testament&quot;, was inspired by her paternal grandmother&#x27;s experience of the Holocaust as well as her grief over Baker&#x27;s death. Sherwood was selected in 2021 to write a trilogy of &quot;James Bond&quot; books, the franchise of which Baker participated in several of its film adaptations, becoming the first woman to do so.

==Death==
Baker died on 7 October 2011 at the age of 80. He died of pneumonia, after a stroke.

<text>Curt Ernst Carl Schumacher, better known as Kurt Schumacher (13 October 1895 – 20 August 1952), was a German politician and resistance fighter against the Nazis. He was chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany from 1946 and the first Leader of the Opposition in the West German Bundestag in 1949; he served in both positions until his death. 

Upon Adolf Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power, he was imprisoned for ten years in various Nazi concentration camps. After World War II, Schumacher was one of the founding fathers of postwar German democracy. Throughout his life, he opposed reactionary and revolutionary forces, including the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He described the KPD as &quot;red-painted Nazis&quot;.

== Early life and career ==

Schumacher was born in Kulm in West Prussia (now Chełmno in Poland), the son of a small businessman who was a member of the liberal German Free-minded Party and deputy in the municipal assembly. The young man was a brilliant student, but when the First World War broke out in 1914, he immediately abandoned his studies and joined the German Army. In December, at Bielawy west of Łowicz in Poland, he was so badly wounded that his right arm had to be amputated. After contracting dysentery, he was finally discharged from the army and was decorated with the Iron Cross Second class. Schumacher returned to his law and political science in Halle, Leipzig and Berlin from which he graduated in 1919.

Inspired by Eduard Bernstein, Schumacher became a dedicated socialist and in 1918 joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He led ex-servicemen in forming workers&#x27; and soldiers councils in Berlin during the revolutionary days following the fall of the German Empire but opposed attempts by revolutionary left-wing groups to seize power. In 1920, the SPD sent him to Stuttgart to edit the party&#x27;s newspaper there, the &quot;Schwäbische Tagwacht&quot;.

Schumacher was elected to the state legislature, the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg Landtag in 1924. He transferred to the local republican organisation &quot;Schwabenland&quot; in the newly founded organisation to defend Germany&#x27;s parliamentary democracy, the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Schumacher became chairman of the Stuttgart Branch of Reichsbanner.

In 1928, he became the SPD leader in the state of Württemberg. To oppose the emerging Nazi Party, Schumacher helped organise socialist militias to oppose them. In 1930, he was elected to the national legislature, the Reichstag. In August 1932, he was elected to the SPD party leadership group (Parteivorstand). At 38, he was youngest SPD member of the Reichstag.

== Nazi regime ==
Schumacher was staunchly anti-Nazi. In a Reichstag speech on 23 February 1932, he excoriated Nazism as &quot;a continuous appeal to the inner swine in human beings&quot; and stated the movement had been uniquely successful in &quot;ceaselessly mobilizing human stupidity&quot;. Schumacher was arrested in July 1933, two weeks before the SPD was banned, and was severely beaten in prison. Schumacher was given the opportunity to sign a declaration in which he renounced any political activity if released, but unlike Fritz Bauer and seven other political prisoners, he refused to sign it. He spent the next ten years in Nazi concentration camps at Heuberg, Kuhberg, Flossenbürg, and Dachau. The camps were initially intended for exploitation of those deemed by the Nazis to be undesirable people, such as Jews, socialists, communists, and criminals. Beginning in 1940, the prison camps were overcrowded with transports from the eastern front, leading to disease outbreaks and starvation. Under Action 14f13, beginning in 1941, the Nazis summarily murdered prisoners they deemed unfit for work, but Schumacher and some other disabled veterans were spared after they proved with their war medals that they had been disabled in service of Germany during World War I. The conditions in the camps continued to worsen and by 1943, nearly half of the prisoners died, in particular in Neuengamme of 106,000 inmates almost half died.

In 1943, when Schumacher was near death, his brother-in-law succeeded in persuading a Nazi official to have him released into his custody. Schumacher was re-arrested in late 1944 and was in Neuengamme when the British arrived in April 1945.

== Postwar ==
Schumacher wanted to lead the SPD and bring Germany to socialism. By May 1945, he was already reorganising the SPD in Hanover without the permission of the occupation authorities. He soon found himself in a battle with Otto Grotewohl, the leader of the SPD in the Soviet Zone of Occupation, who argued the SPD should merge with the KPD to form a united socialist party. Grotewohl had initially opposed the idea, but was persuaded that the rise of the Nazis would have never happened had the left presented a unified front.

Schumacher was as ardently anti-Communist as he was anti-Nazi, and rejected the proposal. As it turned out, when the eastern SPD merged with the KPD to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, that party became, for all intents and purposes, the KPD under a new name. The few recalcitrants from the SPD half of the merger were branded &quot;agents of Schumacher&quot; and shunted aside.

In August 1946, Schumacher called an SPD convention in Hanover, which elected him as the Western leader of the party. In January 1946, the British and the Americans allowed the SPD to reform itself as a national party with Schumacher as leader. As the only SPD leader who had spent the whole Nazi period in Germany without collaborating, he had enormous prestige. He was certain that he had earned the right to lead the new Germany. However, Schumacher met his match in Konrad Adenauer, the former mayor of Cologne, whom the Americans, not wanting to see socialism of any kind in Germany, were grooming for leadership. Adenauer united most of the prewar German conservatives into a new party, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). Schumacher campaigned throughout 1948 and 1949 for a united socialist Germany and particularly for the nationalisation of heavy industry, whose owners he blamed for funding the Nazis&#x27; rise to power. When the occupying powers opposed his ideas, he denounced them. Adenauer opposed socialism on principle and also argued that the quickest way to get the Allies to restore self-government to Germany was to co-operate with them.

Schumacher wanted a new constitution with a strong national presidency, a post that he was confident he would win. The first draft of the 1949 &quot;Grundgesetz&quot; provided for a federal system with a weak national government, as was favoured both by the Allies and the CDU. Schumacher refused to give way and eventually, the Allies, keen to get the new German state functioning in the face of the Soviet challenge, acceded to some of Schumacher&#x27;s demands. The new federal government would be dominant over the states, although the president would have limited powers.

Despite his speeches against Nazism, Schumacher had a mixed record on the denazification program:&quot;Like his CDU rival, Schumacher spoke out against the sweeping nature of the Allied denazification program and the shortcomings of the Allied war crimes trials. He realized the need to incorporate &#x27;small Nazis&#x27; - especially former members of the Hitler Youth - into the state, going as far as to demand inclusion of members of the Waffen-SS. He also supported Adenauer&#x27;s Law 131&#x27; from 1951, which granted pensions and voting rights to former NSDAP bureaucrats, policemen, and other officials. He even protested the execution of the last major Nazi war criminals in Landsberg in 1951.&quot;

== 1949 federal election ==

The Federal Republic&#x27;s first national elections were held in August 1949. Schumacher was convinced he would win, and most observers agreed with him. But Adenauer&#x27;s new CDU had several advantages over the SPD. Much of the SPD&#x27;s prewar power base was now part of the Soviet Zone, and the most conservative parts of prewar Germany, such as Bavaria and the Rhineland, were in the new Federal Republic of Germany. In addition, the American and the French occupying powers favoured Adenauer and did all they could to assist his campaign though the British remained neutral.

Further, the onset of the Cold War, particularly the behaviour of the Soviets and the German communists in the Soviet Zone, produced an antisocialist reaction in Germany as elsewhere. The SPD could very plausibly have won an election in 1945, but the tide had turned against it by 1949. That came even as the SPD became increasingly critical of the new East German government. Schumacher was especially critical and once called the communists &quot;red-painted fascists&quot;. Schumacher attempted a heavy distinction in the public consciousness between his vision of &quot;democratic socialism&quot; and the realities in East Germany but still found his party partially damaged by association.

Another factor was the recovery of the German economy, mainly because of the currency reform of the CDU&#x27;s Ludwig Erhard. Matters were further complicated by Schumacher&#x27;s declining health. In September 1948, he had one of his legs amputated. 

Although Schumacher&#x27;s SPD won the most seats of any single party in the election (though the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, together won more seats), the CDU was able to form a centre-right coalition government with the Free Democratic Party, the Christian Social Union, and the German Party. Adenauer was elected chancellor, a shock for Schumacher. He refused to co-operate in parliamentary matters and denounced the CDU as agents of the capitalists and foreign powers.

Schumacher opposed the emerging new organisations of European co-operation: the Council of Europe, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Defence Community. He saw them as devices to strengthen capitalism and to extend Allied control over Germany. That stand aroused the opposition of the other Western European socialist parties, and eventually, the SPD overruled him and sent delegates to the Council of Europe.

== Death and legacy ==

During the remainder of Adenauer&#x27;s first term in office, Schumacher continued to oppose his government, but the rapid rise in German prosperity, the intensification of the Cold War and Adenauer&#x27;s success in gaining Germany&#x27;s acceptance in the international community all worked to undermine Schumacher&#x27;s position. The SPD began to have serious doubts about going into another election with Schumacher as leader, particularly after he had a stroke in December 1951. They were spared having to deal with this dilemma when Schumacher died suddenly in August 1952.

Schumacher had formulated the preamble of SPD program for the party convention in Dortmund in September 1952. He wrote: &quot;Only a Germany, supported by civic consciousness and social justice, can be successful in fending off totalitarian tendencies.&quot;

<doc id="361278" wikidata="Q544706" url="?curid=361278" title="Bruegel (think tank)">
<text>Bruegel is a think tank devoted to policy research on economic issues. Based in Brussels, it launched its operations in 2005 and currently conducts research in five different focus areas with the aim of improving economic debate and policy-making.

Bruegel was recognised as the best international economics think tank worldwide (non-US) and the second best think tank worldwide (US and non-US), according to the 2020 Global Go To Think Tank Report.

It has a governance and funding model based on memberships from Member States of the European Union, international corporations, and other institutions.

==History==
Bruegel&#x27;s name is a tribute to Pieter Bruegel, the 16th-century painter whose work epitomises unvarnished and innovative depictions of life in Europe. It also stands for the &quot;Brussels European and Global Economic Laboratory&quot;, even though Bruegel does not consider its name to be an acronym. The think tank was initially co-founded by the economists Jean Pisani-Ferry and Nicolas Véron in 2002. It was officially endorsed by former French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 40th anniversary of the Elysée Treaty in January 2003.

Former European Commissioner Mario Monti was instrumental in Bruegel&#x27;s creation and became its first chairman in early 2005, following the think tank&#x27;s legal creation as an International Non-Profit Association under Belgian law and its first board election in 2004.

The board was successively chaired by Mario Monti (2005–08), Leszek Balcerowicz (2008–12), Jean Claude Trichet (2012–2020) and Erkki Liikanen (2020–present). Jean Pisani-Ferry was Bruegel&#x27;s director from January 2005 to April 2013 before being succeeded in his role by Guntram Wolff. Jeromin Zettelmeyer became the new director of Bruegel in September 2022.

Bruegel moved to its current premises, on Rue de la Charité/Liefdadigheidsstraat 33 in central Brussels, in April 2005.

==Research programme==
Bruegel&#x27;s research is divided into five broad research areas: Banking and capital markets, Digital economy, labour markets, skills and health, Global economy and trade policy, Energy and climate policy, and Macroeconomic policy and governance. The research programme is reviewed every three years while the research priorities are developed on a yearly basis in the autumn by the board after discussions with Bruegel scholars, members and other stakeholders.

== Publications and events ==
Bruegel&#x27;s scholars regularly publish their research on Bruegel&#x27;s website. In 2023, the lively Bruegel blog format was retired, and it was upgraded to become the new Analysis section. Bruegel also releases more in-depth research in the form of policy briefs, working papers, essays and blueprints. Bruegel fellows have presented research testimonies at the European Parliament, the US Congress and various national parliaments. Bruegel also introduced a new First Glance section, where researchers can write real-time insights into emerging economic issues.

Bruegel also hosts events which gather experts, the public and various stakeholders for in-depth discussion on a range of policy issues. The events are often livestreamed with the video and audio recordings on Bruegel&#x27;s website. In 2023, Bruegel hosted 81 events throughout the year and released 53 episodes of the podcast &quot;The Sound of Economics&quot;, which amassed 181,910 listens across all platforms. This is in addition to publishing 56 Long reads (2 books, 1 essay, 21 working papers, 22 policy briefs, 10 reports for the European Parliament), 86 Short reads (36 Analyses, 8 Blog posts, 42 First glances) and 15 Datasets.

==Governance and funding==
Bruegel is a non-profit international association under Belgian law (AISBL), governed by its statutes and its bylaws. Bruegel&#x27;s highest decision making forum is the General Assembly consisting of Bruegel&#x27;s members. It ratifies the board and elects six of its members directly.

The board decides on strategy, adopts the research programme and budget and appoints the director and the deputy director each for a period of three years renewable twice. Bruegel&#x27;s board is elected for a three-year term by its members and consists of 11 individuals with backgrounds in government, business, academia and civil society. As of June 2024, its members were Erkki Liikanen (chairman), Riccardo Barbieri Hermitte, Agnès Bénassy-Quéré, Markus K. Brunnermeier, Paula Conthe, Alexandra Dimitrijevic, Caroline de Gruyter, Monika Marcinkowska, Isabelle Mateos y Lago, Simone Mori and Tom Scholar. The board decides on Bruegel&#x27;s research agenda, a process that is conducted on a yearly basis and includes in-depth consultation of all members. It also appoints the director and deputy director, and oversees Bruegel&#x27;s financial management and budget. However, under Bruegel&#x27;s statute and bylaws, neither the board nor the members can interfere in research results and publication decisions‚ the responsibility for which remains with the director and individual scholars.

Bruegel&#x27;s former chairs Leszek Balcerowicz and Jean Claude Trichet are honorary chairmen of Bruegel. Mario Monti is the founding chairman of Bruegel.

The director – currently Jeromin Zettelmeyer – is responsible for the executive management of Bruegel, with the assistance of a management team which as of 2024 included Stephane Asse&#x27;e, Emanuela Dimonte, Katja Knežević and Scarlett Varga. They organise the board meetings, as well as preparing the research programme, the annual work plan, budget and the annual report. They then present them to the board. The director (and deputy director when that position is activated) are responsible for the editorial direction of the think tank and they exercise editorial oversight of publications and control the quality of output. Bruegel takes no institutional standpoint and publications reflect the views of the authors only. Bruegel&#x27;s Scientific Council advises on research and provides regular academic appraisals of published papers.

Bruegel is supported by a wide array of members which contribute the bulk of its financial resources. The majority of its resources comes from state and corporate members.

As of June 2024, Bruegel&#x27;s membership consisted of three categories. State members are Member States of the European Union, which join on a voluntary basis, including Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands. The United Kingdom also holds membership. Corporate members are international corporations and firms, many of which are headquartered in the European Union. Institutional members include national and international public financial institutions as well as central banks.

==Awards and recognition==

In 2012, the University of Pennsylvania ranked Bruegel 8th out of 600 different think tanks in a report called &quot;The Global Go To Think Tanks Rankings and associated trends report&quot;

Transparify has repeatedly awarded Bruegel five stars out of five for transparency, including in 2018. &quot;Prospect Magazine&quot; Awarded Bruegel the European Economic Think Tank of the Year in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019.

The 2020 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report, published by the University of Pennsylvania, ranked Bruegel as such:

* #1 Top Think Tanks in Western Europe
* #1 Top International Economics Policy Think Tanks
* #2 Top Think Tanks Worldwide (US and Non-US)  
* #2 Think Tanks with Outstanding Policy-Oriented Research Programs  
* #2 Best Quality Assurance and Integrity Policies and Procedures
* #2 Best Institutional Collaboration Involving Two or More Think Tanks
* #4 Think Tanks with the Most Significant Impact on Public Policy
* #5 Best Managed Think Tanks
* #5 Think Tanks with the Best Use of the Internet
* #5 Best Use of Media (Print or Electronic)

== Operations ==

Bruegel&#x27;s research team is composed of senior fellows, non-resident fellows, research fellows and affiliate fellows as well as a team or research assistants.

Bruegel&#x27;s professional staff is responsible for the organisation&#x27;s outreach, developing stakeholder relationships and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations.

== Evaluation ==
Bruegel regularly asks an ad hoc task force to review the impact and relevance of its work. The most recent analysis was conducted in 2022 and was co-chaired by Peter Praet and Elsa Fornero. This and previous reports have been posted online by Bruegel. The scientific assessment component of such reviews is provided by Bruegel&#x27;s scientific council composed of eight individuals and chaired by Arnoud Boot.

<text>Sons of the Desert is a 1933 American pre-Code comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy. Directed by William A. Seiter, it was released in the United States on December 29, 1933. In the United Kingdom, the film was originally released under the title Fraternally Yours.

In 2012, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, members of the fraternal lodge called Sons of the Desert, attend a California meeting where it is mandated that all members must attend the upcoming national convention in Chicago. While Oliver is eager to honor the oath, Stan is apprehensive about his wife Betty&#x27;s reaction. Despite initial reluctance, Stan succumbs to Oliver&#x27;s persuasion. However, their plans are thwarted by their wives&#x27; conflicting agendas.

Lottie, Oliver&#x27;s wife, vehemently opposes the trip as she has organized a mountain retreat. Resorting to deception, Oliver feigns illness to avoid Lottie&#x27;s plans. Stan orchestrates a ruse involving a faux doctor&#x27;s recommendation for a Honolulu voyage, enabling them to attend the convention without their wives&#x27; knowledge. At the convention, the catchy tune &quot;Honolulu Baby&quot; is performed, adding a jovial atmosphere to their escapade.

Meanwhile, their wives, unaware of the deception, become concerned when a ship returning from Honolulu sinks in a typhoon. As they investigate the fate of the survivors, Stan and Oliver return home to an empty house, only to discover their wives&#x27; suspicions upon their return. To evade confrontation, the duo hides in the attic, but their secret is jeopardized when their wives stumble upon footage of the convention --- and of both Boys clearly recognizable in a parade --- in a cinema newsreel.

Facing mounting pressure, Oliver attempts to maintain the illusion of a shipwreck survival, but his fabricated story quickly unravels under Betty&#x27;s scrutiny. Stan, on the other hand, decides to confess, prompting a mix of relief and anger from Betty and Lottie, respectively. While Betty welcomes Stan&#x27;s honesty, Lottie unleashes her fury on Oliver, culminating in a altercation.

Stan&#x27;s frightened confession allows Betty&#x27;s pride, in her earlier bet with Lottie that she had the more honest of the two husbands, to triumph over her best friend, which for her has become far more important, so she greatly spoils him upon returning home.
Whereas Oliver endures Lottie&#x27;s wrath not only now for attending the convention, and lying, but for being the cause of her ignominy in front of her neighbour.

Stan returns to Oliver&#x27;s front door and enquires of a black-eyed Oliver, surrounded by smashed crockery, how it went with him. He begins to serenade &quot;Honolulu Baby,&quot; but is hit on the back of his retreating head by a distantly-thrown, well-aimed saucepan, leaving Oliver to face the aftermath of his wife&#x27;s fury.

==Cast==

== Production notes ==
The fraternal organization seen in the film is styled to resemble the Shriners, known formerly as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, which is a club exclusive only to master masons of Freemasonry. Oliver Hardy was a freemason and Stan Laurel was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

==Similar films==
* &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot; is a partial remake of 1928&#x27;s &quot;We Faw Down&quot;.
* Another Laurel and Hardy short film called &quot;Be Big!&quot; has a storyline similar to this feature. Stan and Ollie are invited to a party with a club that the two attend. However, they are about to take their wives on holiday for the weekend. Ollie pretends to be ill and persuades the wives go ahead, saying Stan will stay to look after him and they will arrive at the holiday location the next day. They get changed into their uniforms, which causes problems such as Stan putting on Ollie&#x27;s boots by mistake. In contrast to &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;, in &quot;Be Big&quot;, Stan is initially unaware of the party at their club until Ollie fills him in, and then tells him his sick act was a charade.

==Legacy==
The international Laurel and Hardy society The Sons of the Desert takes its name from this feature film.

The title was also used as the name of a country group, as well as that of the Danish comedy quartet &quot;Ørkenens sønner&quot; (1991–present), the literal translation of the movie&#x27;s title. The comedy group uses the basic theme of a fraternal organization, and their stage costumes are identical to the ones used in the movie&#x27;s organization. Even their theme song is a translation of the one from the movie. Though adult themed, their gags and jokes resemble the ones seen at the movie&#x27;s Chicago party.

<text>Moorgate () is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station on Moorgate in the City of London. Main line railway services for Hertford, Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage are operated by Great Northern, while the London Underground station is served by the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and Northern lines.

The station was opened as Moorgate Street in 1865 by the Metropolitan Railway. In 1900, the City &amp; South London Railway added the station to its network, and the Great Northern &amp; City Railway began serving the station in 1904. In 1975, the Northern City Line platforms were the site of the Moorgate tube crash – at the time, the worst peacetime accident in the history of the London Underground – in which 43 people were killed. Thameslink branch services were withdrawn in the early 21st century, and a new ticket hall was built connected to the newly opened Elizabeth line at in 2021, with through access to the rest of Liverpool Street Underground station.

==Location and station layout==

The station has entrances on both Moorgate itself and Moorfields, which runs parallel. The public entrances from the street give access to all the train services at the station, there are three distinct levels.

The Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan underground lines use platforms 1 and 2, which are through platforms. For terminating trains at busy times, there are platforms 3 and 4 which are west-facing bays. Adjacent to these are platforms 5 and 6 of the former Thameslink service from via St Pancras. These are disused following the closure of the Moorgate branch from Farringdon junction as part of the Thameslink Programme and are now used for storage.

The Northern line of the Underground uses platforms 7 and 8, which are in a deep-level tube section of the station. National Rail services on the Northern City Line use platforms 9 and 10, which are terminal platforms. Train services run via the East Coast Main Line to Welwyn Garden City, Hertford North and Stevenage. Because of this, Moorgate is part of the London station group and accepts tickets marked &quot;London Terminals&quot;.

London Buses routes 21, 43, 76, 100, 141 and 153 serve the station.

==History==
===1861–1950===

The station was opened as Moorgate Street by the Metropolitan Railway as the first eastwards extension from the original terminus at . Parliamentary power had been obtained to build a station at Moorgate in 1861, two years before the initial section, and it was completed on 23 December 1865. Increased traffic from other companies, including goods traffic from the Great Northern Railway, led to the line between King&#x27;s Cross and Moorgate being widened to four tracks; the route was called the &quot;City Widened Lines&quot; and included a new tunnel at Clerkenwell which was lower than the original. The Widened Lines were open from Moorgate to Farringdon on 1 July 1866, and to King&#x27;s Cross on 17 February 1868. Suburban services from the Midland Railway ran via Kentish Town and the Great Northern Railway ran via King&#x27;s Cross. In 1874, director of the Metropolitan, Edward Watkin, described Moorgate Street as &quot;your great terminus&quot; and recommended a 100-bedroom hotel should be built on top of the station.

The now Northern line platforms were originally part of an extension of the City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) beyond towards , forming the northern terminus of its services from south of the River Thames. An act for the extension had been authorised in 1893 and included an eastern diversion of the original line underneath the Thames. The new station opened on 25 February 1900. The line was extended to Angel on 17 November the following year.

The Northern City Line to Moorgate was opened by the Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) on 14 February 1904 offering a service to . It had an escalator connection to the other Moorgate platforms. The route was constructed in tube tunnels, but they were constructed at a diameter capable of accommodating main-line trains (in contrast to the majority of London tube tunnels which are much smaller). The line was the first to use automatic signalling throughout its length without any moving parts. Though a popular route, it went into decline after the Metropolitan Railway purchased the route on 1 July 1913. Consequently, the planned through services to the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s main line were never implemented.

The CS&amp;LR line (taken over by the Underground Group in 1913) closed services between Moorgate and on 9 August 1922 in order to widen tunnels to . The section from Moorgate to Clapham Common was worked on during the night while daytime services remained running, but closed completely on 28 November 1923 following a roof collapse at Newington Causeway the day before. Services to Euston opened on 20 April 1924, along with a connection to and stations further north. Services to Clapham Common resumed on 1 December. The station was renamed from Moorgate Street to Moorgate on 24 October that year.

===1950 – present===
British Rail services to Moorgate were initially steam-operated. A commemorative service ran on 6 June 1971 from Moorgate to the depot at Neasden, powered by a 0-6-0 tank locomotive. Steam was replaced by Cravens-built diesel multiple units and British Rail Class 31 locomotives class hauling non-corridor stock which remained in operation until 1976, when it was replaced with British Rail Class 313 electrics.

The Northern City Line connection for Moorgate to Finsbury Park tube was closed beyond Drayton Park on 5 October 1964 to allow work on the Victoria line. The line never re-opened fully, but instead the line was connected to the Finsbury Park British Rail station, in order to provide a connection for suburban services into Moorgate. The new service opened on 1 September 1968.

Moorgate station was completely modernised at platform level and street level in the 1960s, and the Widened Lines part of the station was extended to six platforms. The realignment of the platforms enabled about of the line to Barbican to be straightened and moved south to facilitate development of the Barbican Estate.
British Rail (Eastern Region) took over control of the Northern City Line from London Underground in 1975, as part of the Great Northern lines suburban electrification. The Highbury Branch of the Northern line was terminated. Services from Finsbury Park to Moorgate were diverted to the Northern City Line from the City Widened Lines the following year. The City Widened Lines were renamed the Moorgate line when overhead electrification was installed in 1982, allowing the Midland City Line service to run from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to Moorgate. This later formed a branch of the Thameslink route.

The Moorgate Thameslink branch was reduced to peak hours services only in 2003, and closed permanently on 20 March 2009 as part of the Thameslink Programme upgrades. The closure was required in order to lengthen the platforms at Farringdon to take the longer trains, which could only be done southward in the direction of Moorgate as there was too steep a gradient to the north.

Under Crossrail works, the western ticket hall of the Elizabeth line station at was constructed just east of Moorgate station. This linked the Northern line platforms at Moorgate to the Central line at Liverpool Street via the Elizabeth line platforms spanning the two.

The refurbished entrance on Moorfields opened on 5 July 2021. Upon opening, this provided step-free access to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan line platforms, and later to the Northern line and Elizabeth line when the new line opened on 24 May 2022.

==Accidents and incidents==

On 13 September 1905, a train derailed at the station. There were two injuries.

On 28 February 1975, 43 people were killed and 74 seriously injured in the Moorgate tube crash, when a southbound Northern City Line train crashed into the end of the dead-end tunnel beyond the platform. The accident caused the most fatalities on the Underground during peacetime and has been considered the worst ever on the system. The cause was the unexplained failure of the driver to stop or even slow down at the platform, causing the train to run at speed into the dead-end tunnel, colliding with the buffers and then with the wall. Services were immediately suspended, resuming on 1 March from Drayton Park to Old Street only. The wreckage was not fully cleared until 6 March and the station fully re-opened four days later.

==Infrastructure==
Trains using the deep level Northern City Line platforms (9 and 10) are supplied with 750 V DC current via the third rail, overseen by York Electrical Control Room. The signalling is track circuit block, colour light signals with TPWS, the tripcock mechanisms having been removed in May 2022, controlled by York Rail Operating Centre.

The former subsurface Thameslink bay platforms (5 and 6) were equipped with 25 kilovolt alternating current overhead line equipment, overseen by York Electrical Control Room. Signalling was track circuit block, multiple aspect colour light signals, controlled by West Hampstead PSB.

South of the Northern City platform 10 is a Greathead tunnelling shield. The shield was used to dig part of a very short planned extension south to Lothbury, quickly abandoned.

<doc id="361286" wikidata="Q5649469" url="?curid=361286" title="Hanover bars">
<text>Hanover bars, in one of the PAL television video formats, are an undesirable visual artifact in the reception of a television image. The name refers to the city of Hannover, in which the PAL system developer Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH was located.

The PAL system encodes color as &quot;YUV&quot;. The &quot;U&quot; (corresponding to &quot;B-Y&quot;) and &quot;V&quot; (corresponding to &quot;R-Y&quot;) signals carry the color information for a picture, with the phase of the &quot;V&quot; signal reversed (i.e. shifted through 180 degrees) on alternate lines (hence the name PAL, or &quot;phase alternate line&quot;). This is done to cancel minor phase errors in the reception process. However, if gross errors occur, complementary errors from the &quot;V&quot; signal carry into the &quot;U&quot; signal, and thus visible stripes occur.

Later PAL systems introduced alterations to ensure that Hanover bars do not occur, introducing a &quot;swinging burst&quot; to the color synchronization. Other PAL systems may handle this problem differently.

== Suppression of Hanover bars ==
To suppress Hanover bars, PAL color decoders use a delay line that repeats the chroma information from each previous line and blends it with the current line. This causes phase errors to cancel out, at the cost of vertical color resolution, and in early designs, also a loss of color saturation proportional to the phase error.

<text>Paloma Pedrero (born 3 July 1957 in Madrid) is a Spanish actress, theatre director and playwright.

==Life==
Spanish playwright Paloma Pedrero studied Sociology at Madrid&#x27;s Universidad Complutense before becoming involved in the reestablishment of Madrid&#x27;s theater scene following the death of Franco as a member of the &quot;Cachivache&quot; theater group. Her first play, &quot;La llamada de Lauren&quot;, in which she also played the role of Rosa, was staged in 1985.

Since then she has written much more material, acted both on the stage and on television, and directed productions of her own works. She has also cultivated a prolific career as a conference speaker and essayist.

Paloma Pedrero won the 1987 Premio Tirso de Molina for &quot;Invierno de luna alegre&quot;.

==Work==
Pedrero&#x27;s plays are, for the most part, short quasi-comedies that explore questions of identity, the subversion of gender roles, and the nature of individual freedom in postmodern society, based around a neorealist model.

Her typical plot is structured simply (many works have only one scene) and the timeframe is seldom of any extended duration. The scenes dramatized are ones of daily life and the characters are reasonably familiar; they are, Pedrero writes in her monograph &quot;Sobre mi teatro&quot;, &quot;historias que nacen de mi experiencia en algunos casos y de la observación en otros&quot; (&quot;stories that arise from my own experiences in some cases and from observation on others&quot;). This succinct, extremely focused writing style and realistic treatment of plot structure are exemplified by the series of one-act plays that make up &quot;Noches de amor efímero&quot;; each dramatizes a brief nighttime encounter between a man and a woman as a result of which their lives are profoundly changed. The action takes place in real time over the course of the few minutes that each play takes to stage.

Pedrero&#x27;s settings are everyday locations, predominantly urban and always familiar, whether the apartment of &quot;La llamada de Lauren&quot;, the metro station of &quot;Solos esta noche&quot; or the park of &quot;La noche que ilumina&quot;. &quot;Busco, generalmente, escenarios simples&quot; (&quot;I generally look for simple settings&quot;), writes Pedrero, &quot;me gusta la calle, los parques, los bares, los metros, las habitaciones del hotel, las estaciones... escenarios teatrales que no necesitan de grandes aparatos ni parafenalias&quot; (&quot;I like the street, parks, bars, the metro, hotel rooms, stations... dramatic settings that don&#x27;t need complex apparatus or paraphernalia&quot;). Though settings often have important symbolic impact within each play (for instance, the enclosed, limited space of the apartment in &quot;La llamada de Lauren&quot; is starkly contrasted with the freedom of the carnival going on in the street outside) they are inevitably handled in a realist aesthetic.

<doc id="361299" wikidata="Q39330" url="?curid=361299" title="Yorkshire Terrier">
<text>The Yorkshire Terrier, also known as a Yorkie, is a British breed of toy dog of terrier type. It is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog breeds, with a weight of no more than . It originated in the nineteenth century in the English county of Yorkshire, after which it is named. The coat is tan on the head and dark steel-grey on the body; no other colour is accepted by either The Kennel Club or the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

It is a playful and energetic dog, usually kept as a companion dog. It has contributed to the development of other breeds including the Silky Terrier, and also to cross-breeds such as the Yorkipoo.

==History==

The Yorkshire Terrier originated in Yorkshire. In the mid-nineteenth century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and brought with them several varieties of terrier dogs. Breeding of the Yorkshire terrier was &quot;principally accomplished by the people – mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills – in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.&quot; In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.

Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886,

The breed originates from two distinct dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known. The Paisley Terrier, a smaller version of the Skye Terrier that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the Maltese was used as well. &quot;They were all originally bred from Scotch Terriers (meaning dogs from Scotland, not today&#x27;s Scottish Terrier) and shown as such the name Yorkshire Terrier was given to them on account of their being improved so much in Yorkshire.&quot;

Yorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called &quot;Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers&quot;. Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that &quot;the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd&quot; in lumping together these different types. In the early days of the breed, &quot;almost anything in the shape of a Terrier having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs, with tail docked and ears trimmed, was received and admired as a Yorkshire Terrier&quot;. But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley-type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named Huddersfield Ben, owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Ben===

Huddersfield Ben was a Yorkshire Terrier whose portrait was painted by George Earl and in 1891 an authority on the breed wrote, &quot;Huddersfield Ben was the best stud dog of his breed during his lifetime, and one of the most remarkable dogs of any pet breed that ever lived; and most of the show specimens of the present day have one or more crosses of his blood in their pedigree.&quot; A show winner, Huddersfield Ben, through his puppies, helped define the Yorkshire Terrier breed. He is still referred to as &quot;father of the breed&quot;.

===In North America===
The Yorkshire Terrier was introduced in North America in 1872 and the first Yorkshire Terrier was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. During the Victorian era, the Yorkshire Terrier was a popular pet, and show dog in England, and as Americans embraced Victorian customs, so too did they embrace the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed&#x27;s popularity dipped in the 1940s, when the percentage of small breed dogs registered fell to an all-time low of 18% of total registrations. Smoky, a Yorkshire Terrier and famous war dog from World War II, is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the breed. The AKC ranked the Yorkshire Terrier as the 6th most popular purebred in the United States in 2012 and 2013.

==Coat==
For adult Yorkshire Terriers, The American Kennel Club places importance on coat colour, quality, and texture. According to The Kennel Club (UK), the hair must be glossy, fine, straight, and silky. Traditionally the coat is grown out very long and is parted down the middle of the back, but &quot;must never impede movement.&quot;. The hair of the Yorkshire Terrier can be used to determine content of metals in the dog organism.
From the back of the neck to the base of the tail, the coat should be a dark grey to a black colour, and the hair on the tail should be a darker black. On the head, high chest and legs, the hair should be a bright, rich tan, darker at the roots than in the middle, that shades into a lighter tan at the tips, but not for all dogs. Also, in adult dogs there should be no black hairs intermingled with any of the tan-coloured fur. The fine, straight, silky coat is considered hypoallergenic.
Adult Yorkshire Terriers whose coat colours deviate from the standard, or that have woolly or extra fine coats, are still Yorkshire Terriers. The only difference is that it is not recommended to intentionally breed atypical Yorkshire Terriers. In addition, care may be more difficult for &quot;woolly&quot; or &quot;cottony&quot; textured coats, or coats that are overly fine. Coats may vary in colour. For example, a mature Yorkie may have a silver-blue with light brown, while another might have a black and creamy colour.

The long coat on the Yorkshire Terrier requires regular brushing.

===Hypoallergenic coats===
The typical fine, straight, and silky Yorkshire Terrier coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic. In comparison with many other breeds, Yorkies do not shed to the same degree, losing small amounts when bathed or brushed. The dog&#x27;s dander and saliva typically trigger allergic reactions. Allergists recognise that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that &quot;the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.&quot; The Yorkshire Terrier coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken, or just said to not shed. Although neither of those statements agree with what biologists, veterinarians, and allergists know about dog fur, allergists &quot;think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another&quot;.

===Other colours===

The Yorkshire Terrier is a tan dog with a blue saddle. Particolours exist, although they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black-blue and tan. The white is caused by the recessive piebald gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive. Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce pheomelanin, others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they produce brown eumelanin instead of black eumelanin. The standard prescribes clearly defined fur-colours, and non-standard colours may indicate crossbreeding with other breeds or in rare cases even health problems. The AKC registration form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is stated to be neither new, desirable, nor exotic.

Mismatched Yorkshire Terriers should not be crossed with the Biewer Terrier, a new breed that originated in Germany. Although the AKC will not deny registration of a Yorkshire Terrier on colour alone, meaning that particolours are now registerable with the AKC, the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America has a directive that &quot;any solid colour or combination of colours other than black and tan&quot; for adult dogs is a disqualification, and &quot;dogs of solid colour, unusual combination of colours, and particolours should be disqualified.&quot;

===Puppy coats===
It may take three or more years for the coat to reach its final colour. The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour. P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog&#x27;s coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, &quot;and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner&quot; since the adult dog&#x27;s colour cannot be exactly predicted.

=== Coat care ===
Owners may trim the hair short for easier care. For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed. The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily (a bristle brush for short and shaved coat and a pin brush for long coat). In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in rice paper, tissue paper or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is &quot;well greased&quot; with coconut oil, the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog&#x27;s feet are &quot;carefully kept in stockings&quot;.

==Temperament==

The ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or &quot;personality&quot; has been described by the Kennel Club as having a &quot;carriage very upright conveying an important air&quot;.

Yorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;.

==Health==
Health issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include bronchitis, lymphangiectasia, portosystemic shunt, cataracts, and keratitis sicca. Additionally, Yorkies often have a delicate digestive system, with vomiting or diarrhoea resulting from consumption of foods outside of a regular diet. The relatively small size of the Yorkshire Terrier means that it usually has a poor tolerance for anaesthesia. Additionally, a toy dog such as the Yorkie is more likely to be injured by falls, other dogs, and owner clumsiness.

The Yorkshire Terrier has an above average life expectancy. A 2013 study in the UK of patient records found the breed to have a life expectancy of 13 years, higher than the average. A similar 2022 study in the UK found the breed to have a life expectancy of 12 and a half years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A study in Japan based on pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 14.3 years, above the average life expectancy. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 13 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

Colour dilution alopecia, a form of alopecia associated with blue colour coats is common in the Yorkshire Terrier.


Health conditions that can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, include distichiasis, hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of dens, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, luxating patella, portosystemic shunt, retinal dysplasia, and bladder stones. The following are other health conditions that affect the breed:

* Distichiae, eyelashes arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the meibomian gland at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies. Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, corneal abrasions or corneal ulcers, and scarring. Treatment options may include manual removal, electrolysis, or surgery.
* Hypoplasia of dens is a non-formation of the pivot point of the second cervical vertebra, which leads to spinal cord damage. Onset of the condition may occur at any age, producing signs ranging from neck pain to quadriplegia.
* Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, which causes the top of the femur (thigh bone) to degenerate, occurs in Yorkies in certain lines. The condition appears to result from insufficient circulation to the area around the hip joint. As the blood supply is reduced, the bone in the head of the femur collapses and dies and the cartilage coating around it becomes cracked and deformed. Usually the disease appears when the Yorkie is young (between five and eight months of age); signs are pain, limping or lameness. The standard treatment is surgery to remove the affected part of the bone. Following surgery, muscles hold the femur in place and fibrous tissue forms in the area of removal to prevent bone rubbing on bone. Although the affected leg will be slightly shorter than prior to surgery, the Yorkie may regain almost normal use.
* Luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps) are another common defect considered to be genetic in Yorkies, although it may also be caused by an accidental fall. Weak ligaments and tendons in the knee or malformed (too shallow) patellar grooves, allow the patella to slip out of its groove sideways. This causes the leg to &#x27;lock up&#x27; with the foot held off the ground. A dog with this problem may experience frequent pain and lameness, or may be bothered by it only on occasion. Over time, the patellar ridges can become worn down, making the groove even more shallow and causing the dog to become increasingly lame. Surgery is the main treatment option available for luxating patellas, although it is not necessary for every dog with the condition. The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.
* Portosystemic shunt, a congenital malformation of the portal vein (which brings blood to the liver for cleansing), is also common in Yorkies. In this condition some of the dog&#x27;s blood bypasses the liver and the &quot;dirty&quot; blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other organs with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, behavioral abnormalities, seizures (especially after a meal) and blindness, which could lead to a coma and death. Often, the shunt can be treated with surgery.

*Tracheal collapse, caused by a progressive weakening of the walls of the trachea, occurs in many toy breeds, especially very tiny Yorkies. As a result of genetics, the walls of the trachea can be flaccid, a condition that becomes more severe with age. Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, a disorder that causes production of excess steroid hormone by the adrenal glands, can also weaken cartilage and lead to tracheal collapse. There is a possibility that physical strain on the neck might cause or contribute to trachea collapse. Since this is usually caused by an energetic Yorkie pulling against his collar, many veterinarians recommend use of a harness for leashed walks. An occasional &quot;goose honking&quot; cough, especially on exertion or excitement, is usually the first sign of this condition. Over time, the cough may become almost constant in the Yorkie&#x27;s later life. Breathing through the obstruction of a collapsed (or partially collapsed) trachea for many years can result in complications, including chronic lung disease. The coughing can be countered with cough suppressants and bronchodilators. If the collapse is advanced and unresponsive to medication, sometimes surgery can repair the trachea.

A UK study found the Yorkshire Terrier to be 6.79 times more likely to acquire impaired hepatic perfusion compared to other dogs.

===Hypoglycaemia===
Low blood sugar in puppies, or transient juvenile hypoglycaemia, is caused by fasting (too much time between meals). In rare cases, hypoglycaemia may continue to be a problem in mature, usually very small, Yorkies. It is often seen in Yorkie puppies at 5 to 16 weeks of age. Very tiny Yorkie puppies are especially predisposed to hypoglycaemia because a lack of muscle mass makes it difficult to store glucose and regulate blood sugar. Factors such as stress, fatigue, a cold environment, poor nutrition, and a change in diet or feeding schedule may bring on hypoglycaemia. Low blood sugar can also be the result of a bacterial infection, parasite or portosystemic liver shunt. Hypoglycaemia causes the puppy to become drowsy, listless (glassy-eyed), shaky, uncpoglycaemic attack, the puppy usually has very pale or grey gums. The puppy also may not eat unless force-fed. Hypoglycaemia and dehydration seem to go hand-in-hand, and force-feeding or injecting fluids may also be necessary. Additionally, a hypoglycaemic Yorkie may have a lower than normal body temperature and, in extreme cases, may have a seizure or go into a coma. A dog showing symptoms should be given sugar in the form of corn syrup or Nutri-Cal and be treated by a veterinarian immediately, as prolonged or recurring attacks of hypoglycaemia can permanently damage the dog&#x27;s brain. In severe cases, it can be fatal.

The Yorkshire Terrier is one of the more commonly affected breeds for progressive rod-cone degeneration. An autosomal recessive mutation in the PRCD gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.
===Docking and Cropping===

Traditionally, the Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s tail is docked to a medium length. Opposition to this practice began very early in the history of the breed; Hugh Dalziel, writing about Yorkshire Terriers in 1878, declared that &quot;There is no reason for mutilating pet dogs, and perfect ears and tails should be bred, not clipped into shape with scissors.&quot; AKC and Canadian Kennel Club still require the Yorkie&#x27;s tail be docked in order to compete at its events. The majority of the rest of the world has adopted a &quot;no docking/no cropping&quot; rule.

==Related breeds and derived breeds==
The Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds, such as the Skye Terrier and the now-extinct Paisley Terrier. In its turn, other breeds have been created from the Yorkshire Terrier, such as the Silky Terrier. Demand for unusual pets has resulted in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent. Some of these such portmanteau-named crosses can be found on the list of dog crossbreeds.
The Biewer Terrier, bred from blue, white and gold puppies named Schneeflocke and Schneeflöckchen von Friedheck, owned by Mr. and Mrs. Biewer in Germany, was once considered a variation of the Yorkshire Terrier but has since been recognised as a separate breed by many kennel clubs, including the AKC.

==Notable Yorkshire Terriers==

* In 1997, Champion Ozmilion Mystification became the first Yorkie to win Best in Show at Crufts, the world&#x27;s largest annual dog show.
* Sylvia, a matchbox-sized Yorkshire Terrier owned by Arthur Marples of Blackburn, England, was the smallest dog in recorded history. The dog died in 1945 when she was two years old, at which point she stood tall at the shoulder, measured from nose tip to tail, and weighed .
* Smoky, a war dog and hero of World War II, was owned by William Wynne of Cleveland, Ohio. Wynne adopted Smoky while he was serving with the 5th Air Force in the Pacific.
* Pasha, Tricia Nixon Cox&#x27;s pet Yorkie, lived in the White House during Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency.

==Notes==
:1.The Japanese study reviewed cemetery data which is unlikely to have any records of still-births and altricial deaths whilst a veterinary clinic likely would have data on these.

<doc id="361302" wikidata="Q800753" url="?curid=361302" title="Fenchurch Street railway station">
<text>Fenchurch Street railway station, also known as London Fenchurch Street, is a central London railway terminus in the southeastern corner of the City of London. It takes its name from its proximity to Fenchurch Street, a key thoroughfare in the City. The station and all trains are operated by c2c. Services run on lines built by the London and Blackwall Railway (L&amp;BR) and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) are to destinations in east London and south Essex, including , , , Southend and .

The station opened in 1841 to serve the L&amp;BR and was rebuilt in 1854 when the LTSR, a joint venture between the L&amp;BR and the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), began operating. The ECR also operated trains out of Fenchurch Street to relieve congestion at its other London terminus at . In 1862 the Great Eastern Railway was created by amalgamating various East Anglian railway companies (including the ECR) and it shared the station with the LTSR until 1912, when the latter was bought by the Midland Railway. The station came under ownership of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921, and was shared by LNER and London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) services until nationalisation in 1948. The line from the station was electrified in 1961, and closed for seven weeks in 1994.

Fenchurch Street is one of the smallest railway terminals in London in terms of platforms, but one of the most intensively operated. It is the only London terminal with no direct interchange with the London Underground. Plans to connect it stalled in the early 1980s because of the lack of progress on the Jubilee line, but it is within of both the station on the London Underground and the station on the Docklands Light Railway.

==Location==

The station frontage is on Fenchurch Place, adjacent to Fenchurch Street in the City of London. The station has two entrances: one on Fenchurch Place and another on Cooper&#x27;s Row, near Tower Hill. It has four platforms arranged on two islands elevated on a viaduct. The station has been Grade II listed since 1972 and the conference venue One America Square is built adjacent to it. Following rail privatisation in 1994, the station was run by Network Rail. Since 1996, the station has been served by c2c (which was sold by National Express to Trenitalia in 2017) who have a franchise to run services until 2029.

Fenchurch Street is in the central London Travelcard zone 1 like other terminal stations in the city, but it does not have a direct link to the London Underground. The nearest stations on the London Underground network are Tower Hill about to the southeast and Aldgate around to the northeast.

==History==

===London and Blackwall Railway===
The area around Fenchurch Street is one of the oldest inhabited parts of London; the name &quot;Fenchurch&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;faenum&quot; (hay) and refers to hay markets in the area. The station was the first to be granted permission by the Corporation of London to be constructed inside the City of London, following several refusals against other railway companies.

The original building, designed by William Tite opened on 20 July 1841, serving the London and Blackwall Railway (L&amp;BR), replacing a nearby terminus at Minories that had opened in July 1840. It had two platforms connected via a stairway to the booking hall. Steam locomotives did not use the station until 1849 because before this time trains were dragged uphill from to Minories, and ran to Fenchurch Street via their own momentum. The reverse journey eastwards required a manual push from railway staff. William Marshall&#x27;s railway bookstall established at the station in 1841 was the first to be opened in the City of London.

===Eastern Counties Railway and London, Tilbury and Southend Railway===

Following the opening of the London and Blackwall Extension Railway on 2 April 1849, services operated from Fenchurch Street to Bow &amp; Bromley. Some were extended to where an interchange existed with the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) from .

On 26 September 1850, the East and West India Docks and Birmingham Junction Railway (renamed the North London Railway (NLR) on 1 January 1853) started operating a service from into Fenchurch Street and the L&amp;BR withdrew its service, closing the line between Gas Factory Junction and Bow &amp; Bromley. The station had two heavily used platforms and a double track line from Stepney onwards. Following a reduced income at Blackwall (the South Eastern Railway had opened a direct line from to London), LBR shareholders voted to align with the ECR and jointly construct the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) from Tilbury to Forest Gate Junction. Services would split at , one service to Bishopsgate and the other to Fenchurch Street along the reopened line via Bow &amp; Bromley (although the station did not reopen). To accommodate this service a third line was built between Stepney and Fenchurch Street which was enlarged at this time. The new service commenced on 13 April 1854 using ECR locomotives and stock.

To accommodate the changes, the station was enlarged to designs by George Berkley incorporating a by trussed-arch vaulted roof. Two platforms were added at the same time as was a circulating area for L&amp;BR and LTSR traffic. The NLR, wanting its own London terminus instead of co-sharing Fenchurch Street, extended its railway towards the new Broad Street station in 1865.

The railway through Stratford was unable to cope with the extra services, so the LTSR planned to build a more direct line from to Gas Factory Junction. The third track from Stepney to Fenchurch Street opened in 1856, followed by the direct line from Barking in 1858. LTSR services were diverted from Stratford and a spur was opened at Abbey Mills Junction (east of Bromley) which allowed services to and from to operate directly from Fenchurch Street instead of via Stratford. On 22 August 1856, the line to Loughton was opened, and Fenchurch Street became the usual terminus for its trains, being much more convenient for is City commuters than Bishopsgate.

===Great Eastern Railway===

By the 1860s, railways in East Anglia were in financial difficulties, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate they could not obtain government consent until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased there was a need to improve signalling and, in 1869, the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gas Factory Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations. In the 1870s the flat awning over the station main&#x27;s entrance was replaced with the current zig-zag canopy.

The station&#x27;s track layout was rearranged in 1883 with platform extensions, a fifth platform for use by the Blackwall services and a new gantry signal box (which lasted until the 1935 re-modelling). The GER used the station as an alternative to Liverpool Street station during the late-19th and early-20th centuries for former ECR routes. The GER took over operation of the NLR shuttle from Bow in 1869, which it operated until April 1892 when the second Bow Road railway station opened along with a passenger foot connection to the NLR station. Subsequent services into Fenchurch Street were operated by the GER and the LTSR, and three years later the viaduct from Stepney to Fenchurch Street was widened to accommodate a fourth track.

Despite this, overcrowding of LTSR services was still occurring and this persisted until 1902 when the opening of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway offered an alternative route.

In 1903, the GER built the Fairlop Loop, a short connecting line between and Woodford from where services ran to Liverpool Street and around 36 trains a day ran to Fenchurch Street. In 1912, the Midland Railway (MR) bought and took over operation of the LTSR services.

===London, Midland and Scottish Railway===
After the Railways Act 1921 the country&#x27;s railways were grouped into four companies, with effect from 1 January 1923. At Fenchurch Street, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) took over operations of the MR, whilst GER services were taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Direct trains to were usually routed via Bromley at off-peak hours and a peak shuttle service operated from Custom House to Gallions. Passengers for the branch changed at . The Blackwall and North Greenwich passenger services were scheduled for closure on 30 June 1926 but the general strike brought that forward to 3 May.

The station was rebuilt in 1935 to address overcrowding and provide better accommodation for Southend line services. When the former ECR lines transferred to the Underground&#x27;s Central line in 1948, the station was served solely by the former LTSR services.

===Nationalisation and beyond===
Following nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948, the station transferred under British Railways to the Eastern Region although the old LTSR network west of Gasworks Junction was controlled by the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949, the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.

British Railways electrified the former LTSR line in 1959. Electric services began on 6 November 1961 and a full electric timetable was introduced on 18 June the following year. In the 1980s, the station roof was dismantled and high-rise office blocks were built above the station leaving the 1854 facade intact.

Fenchurch Street station suffered a negative reputation under public ownership. By the end of the 1980s, the former LTSR line was carrying over 50,000 passengers a day on a 50-year old infrastructure. The persistent overcrowding and uncleanliness on trains led to it being dubbed &quot;the misery line&quot;. In 1989 Sir Robert Reid called the service from Fenchurch Street &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot;, while Teresa Gorman, Member of Parliament for Billericay, subsequently called it &quot;one of the disgraces of our public railway service for many years&quot;. Between 1982 and 1992, the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail&#x27;s three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation.

In July 1994, shortly before rail privatisation, the station closed for seven weeks for an £83 million project to replace signals, track and electrification works. It was the first significant closure of a London terminal station, albeit planned and temporary.

The development of Lakeside Shopping Centre, near Chafford Hundred and Thurrock, increased demand for services from the station. In 2013, Network Rail announced a £3.4m upgrade creating a third exit on Cooper&#x27;s Row to make connections with Tower Hill easier.

In 2019, a planning application was submitted to the City of London (planning authority) for permission to revamp the station building.

===Underground===

In the 1970s, Fenchurch Street was considered to be an integral part of the proposed Fleet line (now called the Jubilee line), which would have given the station an Underground connection. An extension from the end of the track terminus at Charing Cross to Fenchurch Street via Aldwych and Ludgate Circus would have seen the line cross the River Thames and continue southeastwards towards Surrey Docks and . A revised route, approved in 1980, would have seen the line follow a more northerly route to Woolwich Arsenal and Beckton.

Mott, Hay and Anderson and Sir William Halcrow and Partners began constructing the line to Charing Cross, but did not finish the project until 1979. Rising costs and high inflation led to London Transport abandoning the eastwards extension via Fenchurch Street in 1981. The line was completed in 1999, using a different route via the Greenwich Peninsula to , crossing the LTSR line from Fenchurch Street at . This has altered demand for Fenchurch Street, with passengers from Essex changing there instead.

==Services==

Services from Fenchurch Street run towards East London and south Essex, including , , (for Lakeside Shopping Centre), (for the Gravesend–Tilbury Ferry and cruise services) , and . As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:

During peak periods services are increased up to 20 trains per hour. Most peak services have 12 cars.

Although the station&#x27;s capacity is small compared to other London terminals, it has a high footfall, averaging around 16 million passengers annually. A report in 2001 showed approximately 3,000 people commuted daily from Castle Point to the city via Fenchurch Street, while a 2013 report said it was the busiest station on the LTSR route, with 46,000 daily peak-time passengers.

== Future ==
There have been proposals to move the station 380 yards to the east to allow the station to expand to 6 platforms, (up from the current 4) and would be built partly on the site of Tower Gateway DLR station, which would likely be permanently closed.

The new station could be built with direct interchange with Tower Hill tube station, which could also have a replacement DLR station for Tower Gateway as Transport for London have looked into closing Tower Gateway and constructing a replacement on the Bank branch to increase capacity.

==Incidents==
*On 1 August 1859, two trains collided head-on at low speed when an arriving North Woolwich service passed a signal at danger and struck a stationary Tilbury Riverside service. No-one was injured.
*On 28 November 1860, a track defect caused the first four carriages of a departing train to Benfleet to derail at low speed. No-one was injured.
*On 24 June 1872, a service arriving from collided with the buffer stops at the platform end, resulting in injury to three passengers.
*On 17 August 1872, two people were injured when their train collided with an empty train being shunted out of a siding.
*On 4 May 1893 a bricklayer, described at the time as &quot;deaf and dumb&quot;, who was working on lineside alterations on the Blackwall line, near the station, was stuck by a train as he crossed the line, after not hearing shouted warnings. He later died from his injuries.
*On 2 September 1903, 11 passengers and a crew member were injured when a train hit the buffers as it arrived from .
*On 9 March 1908, a point cleaner working near the station was injured. A Board of Trade enquiry criticised the lack of look-outs for railway workers.
*On 3 February 1912, approximately 86 people were injured when a train hit the buffer stops as it arrived from . An estimated 860 passengers were aboard at the time. Driver error and excessive speed were blamed.
*On 26 January 1927, 10 people were injured on a train to Westcliff in a head-on collision and subsequent derailment caused by defects in the signal detection and signals.

==Goods depots==

A number of goods depots were established near Fenchurch Street owing to the station&#x27;s proximity to the City of London. This table lists the depots connected to the line between the station and Christian Street Junction just east of :
==Cultural references==
The poet John Betjeman passed through the station on day-trips to Southend, and described it as a &quot;delightful hidden old terminus&quot;.

The first documented murder on the British rail network occurred on 9 July 1864, when Franz Muller murdered Thomas Briggs shortly after a train left the station en route to .

Fenchurch Street is one of four railway stations on the standard UK &quot;Monopoly&quot; board, alongside Liverpool Street, Marylebone and King&#x27;s Cross. All are former LNER terminal stations.

The 2005 football hooliganism film &quot;Green Street&quot; used the station to represent Manchester Piccadilly.

In the Douglas Adams novel &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, Fenchurch was so-named because she was conceived at the station.

<doc id="361308" wikidata="Q1478750" url="?curid=361308" title="Health and Safety Executive">
<text>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is a British public body responsible for the encouragement, regulation and enforcement of workplace health, safety and welfare. It has additionally adopted a research role into occupational risks in the United Kingdom. It is a non-departmental public body with its headquarters in Bootle, England. In Northern Ireland, these duties lie with the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland. The HSE was created by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and has since absorbed earlier regulatory bodies such as the Factory Inspectorate and the Railway Inspectorate though the Railway Inspectorate was transferred to the Office of Rail and Road in April 2006. The HSE is sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions. As part of its work, HSE investigates industrial accidents, small and large, including major incidents such as the explosion and fire at Buncefield in 2005. Though it formerly reported to the Health and Safety Commission, on 1 April 2008, the two bodies merged.

==Functions==
The Executive&#x27;s duties are to:
*Assist and encourage persons concerned with matters relevant to the operation of the objectives of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.
*Make arrangements for and encourage research and publication, training, and information in connection with its work.
*Make arrangements for securing government departments, employers, employees, their respective representative organisations, and other persons are provided with an information and advisory service and are kept informed of, and adequately advised on such matters.
*Propose health and safety regulations.

The Executive is further obliged to keep the Secretary of State informed of its plans and ensure alignment with the policies of the Secretary of State, giving effect to any directions given to it. The Secretary of State can give directions to the Executive.

The Railway Inspectorate was transferred to HSE in 1990. On 1 April 2006, the Executive ceased to have responsibility for railway safety, when the Railway Inspectorate was transferred to the Office of Rail Regulation (now the Office of Rail and Road).

The Executive is responsible for the Employment Medical Advisory Service, which operates as part of its Field Operations Directorate.

==Structure and responsibilities==
Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of health and safety legislation in shops, offices, and other parts of the service sector.

Agencies belonging to the HSE include

===Health and Safety Executive, Science Division===

Based in Buxton, Derbyshire, the Health and Safety Executive Science Division (HSL- Health &amp; Safety Laboratory) employs over 350 people including scientists, engineers, psychologists, social scientists, health professionals, and technical specialists.

It was established in 1921 under the Safety in Mines Research Board to carry out large-scale tests related to mining hazards. Following the formation of the HSE, in 1975 the facilities became a Safety Engineering Laboratory and an Explosion and Flame Research Laboratory, operating as part of the Research Laboratories Service Division of the HSE. In 1995 the HSL was formed, including the Buxton site and laboratories in Sheffield. In 2004 the Sheffield activities moved to Buxton, and the University of Sheffield took over the Sheffield laboratory site.

It now operates as an agency carrying out scientific research and investigations (e.g. on the Buncefield fire) for the HSE, other government agencies and the private sector.

===HM Inspectorate of Mines===
HM Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for the correct implementation and inspection of safe working procedures within all UK mine workings. It is based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

=== Offshore Safety Division ===
The Offshore Safety Division (OSD) was established as a division within HSE in April 1991. This was in response to recommendations of the Cullen Inquiry into the Piper Alpha disaster on 6 July 1988. At the time of the disaster, the Department of Energy (DEn) was responsible for both production and offshore safety; this was perceived as entailing a conflict of interests. Dr Tony Barrell, Director of HSE&#x27;s Technology and Air Pollution Division was appointed Chief Executive of OSD, having previously been seconded to the DEn to lead the transfer of responsibilities. At the same time, Ministerial oversight was transferred from the DEn to the Department of Employment. The Offshore Safety Act 1992 made the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and its subsidiary Regulations relevant statutory provisions of the Health and Safety at work etc., Act 1974.
The OSD&#x27;s initial responsibilities included the establishment of the Safety Case Regulations; a thorough review of existing safety legislation and the move towards a goal setting regulatory regime.
OSD became part of the HSE&#x27;s new Hazardous Installations Directorate in 1999; it became part of the new Energy Division in 2013.

===OSHCR (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register)===
The HSE currently administers the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register (OSHCR), a central register of registered safety consultants within the United Kingdom. The intention of the HSE is to pass responsibility of operating the register to the relevant trade &amp; professional bodies once the register is up and running.

===Building Safety Regulator===
The HSE currently administers the Building Safety Regulator (BSR), a regulator of safety standards in buildings.

==Criticism==

Some of the criticism of HSE has been that its procedures are inadequate to protect safety. For example, the public enquiry by Lord Gill into the Stockline Plastics factory explosion criticised the HSE for &quot;inadequate appreciation of the risks associated with buried LPG pipework…and a failure properly to carry out check visits&quot;. However, most criticism of the HSE is that their regulations are over-broad, suffocating, and part of a nanny state. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has claimed that the HSE is part of a &quot;compensation culture,&quot; that it is undemocratic and unaccountable, and that its rules are costing jobs.

However, the HSE denies this, saying that much of the criticism is misplaced because it relates to matters outside the HSE&#x27;s remit. The HSE also responded to criticism by publishing a &quot;Myth of the Month&quot; section on its website between 2007 and 2010, which it described as &quot;exposing the various myths about &#x27;health and safety&#x27;&quot;. This has become a political issue in the UK. The Lord Young report, published in October 2010, recommended various reforms aiming &quot;to free businesses from unnecessary bureaucratic burdens and the fear of having to pay out unjustified damages claims and legal fees.&quot;

*Agriculture
*Air transport
*Armed forces

<doc id="361320" wikidata="Q1073822" url="?curid=361320" title="Taipa">
<text>Taipa (, ; , ) is an area in Macau, connected to Coloane through the area known as Cotai, which is largely built from reclaimed land. Located on the northern half of the island, Taipa&#x27;s population is mostly suburban. Administratively, the boundaries of the traditional civil parish Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Carmo are mostly coterminous with that of the former Taipa Island, except for a portion of the parish that lies on the island of Hengqin (Montanha), housing the campus of the University of Macau.

== Geography ==
Taipa is south of the Macau Peninsula and east of the island of Hengqin, which forms a part of the adjacent Chinese city of Zhuhai. The Macau International Airport, University of Macau, Macau Jockey Club and Macau Stadium are all located in Taipa.
* Area: 
* Population: 112,051+ (2021)


Taipa&#x27;s geography is dominated by the presence of two hills to the east and west that tower over central Taipa. The (, &quot;Colina da Taipa Grande&quot;) lies to the east, and (, &quot;Colina da Taipa Pequena&quot;) the west. This is because originally Taipa consisted of two islands with a hilly terrain - Greater Taipa and Lesser Taipa. As a result of siltation and land reclamation, by the mid-20th century central Taipa had formed, which is largely made up of flat terrain, turning Taipa into one island.

Initially, Taipa was connected to Coloane only by the () causeway, opened in 1969, but starting in the 1990s, land reclamation efforts created a new area, Cotai, and which is home to mega-resorts, casinos, and convention and exhibition centres, and has turned Taipa, Cotai and Coloane all into one island. Taipa is connected to the Macau Peninsula by the Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge, Friendship Bridge and the Sai Van Bridge.

Taipa is an urbanised, suburban area primarily home to housing, with several housing complexes, which are mostly upscale. As a new town of Macau, Taipa has better city planning than the Macau Peninsula, with wide streets set around a grid system, however Macau has historically centred around the peninsula and some choose to live on the Macau Peninsula because most famous schools are there.

In 2015 the body of the director general of Macao Customs Service, Lai Minhua, was found in the district.

== History ==

Originally an island pair on the southern end of the Praia Grande, Taipa was first settled by Hokkien-speaking fishermen around 800 years ago. Most Chinese settlement of Taipa occurred during the Southern Song dynasty. In 1847, encouraged by the governorship of João Maria Ferreira do Amaral, who sought to expand Portugal&#x27;s influence over Macau and affirm its sovereignty, Lesser Taipa was annexed by the Portuguese, constructing Taipa Fortress upon the command of Pedro Jose da Silva Loureiro to combat marine outlaws and protect Macau against the attack of pirates. By 1851, Portugal had also annexed Greater Taipa. These annexations formed part of a wider project by Portugal to turn Macau into a fully-fledged colony and expanding the colony&#x27;s area to include Taipa, Ilha Verde, Coloane and portions of Hengqin (Montanha). The annexation also aimed to resolve the problem of the divided harbour on the Peninsula and provide land, water supply and protection for the port.

Taipa&#x27;s main industry historically was fishing, with a prominent harbour where fishermen congregated. In 1923, Taipa saw its first firecracker factory open, which encouraged a boom in the firecracker industry in Taipa, especially as colonial officials limited firecracker factories on the Peninsula because of safety concerns following an accident in 1925 that killed 100 people. Many firecracker factories opened, which encouraged people to flock to the island. By 1969, as the Portuguese colonial government sought to improve Macau&#x27;s infrastructure, a causeway (&quot;Estrada do Istmo&quot;) opened connecting Taipa to Coloane, and in 1974 Taipa got its first connection to the Macau Peninsula, the Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge, named after the city&#x27;s governor between 1966 and 1974. Taipa&#x27;s population, like Coloane, began to expand significantly as better infrastructure was built, increasing from originally 3,000 residents. By the mid-1980s, the firecracker industry in Taipa had declined and the last factory closed in 1984. Starting in the 1990s, Taipa&#x27;s old village developed as a tourist destination as its Portuguese architecture attracted tourists and further infrastructure was constructed on the island, including the opening of the Macau International Airport in 1995.

== The names of Taipa ==
In Cantonese, Taipa has been known by many names over time, including (&quot;Lung Waan&quot;, meaning &quot;Dragon Ring&quot;), (&quot;Gai Geng&quot;, &quot;Chicken&#x27;s neck&quot;), (&quot;Taam Jai&quot;, &quot;Pool&quot;), and (&quot;Lung Tau Waan&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s-Head Ring&quot;).

The Portuguese name &quot;Taipa&quot; comes from the Chinese pronunciation of in Min Nan /&quot;&quot;/ (similar to &quot;tiamp-a&quot;) then became &quot;Taipa&quot;. The Putonghua pinyin for is &quot;dàngzǎi&quot;, and this is how the island is referred to in Mandarin. Both the character and the alternative form 凼 mean cesspit, but are obsolete in modern Chinese, and only used in relation to Taipa and the Macau-Taipa Bridge ( &quot;àodàng dàqiáo&quot;). The character 氹, or 凼 (often used in mainland Chinese texts), is often missing from mobile phone and computer input systems.

Another origin of the name, according to local legend, comes from an exchange between early Portuguese settlers on Taipa and the local Chinese. The Portuguese asked the Chinese the name (&quot;nome&quot; in Portuguese) of the place. The Chinese settlers were local grocery shopkeepers and spoke no Portuguese, but took the Portuguese &quot;nome&quot; for the Chinese , &quot;sticky rice&quot;, which is pronounced similar to &quot;nome&quot; in Cantonese. Thinking the Portuguese settlers were asking if they sold sticky rice, the Chinese responded with &quot;&quot;, pronounced &quot;daai ba&quot; in Cantonese, meaning &quot;a lot.&quot; The Portuguese, hearing the response, took this to be the name of the place. There is, however, no historical evidence to support this story. &quot;Taipa&quot; is also what the Portuguese call the clay-mud, rammed into moulds, used to build mud houses in Portugal in times gone by, in recent times referred to as Rammed Earth.

<text>Coloane (Chinese: 路環, Portuguese: &quot;Coloane&quot;) is the southernmost area in Macau, connected to Taipa through the area known as Cotai, which is largely built from reclaimed land. Known as “&quot;Lou Wan&quot;” in Cantonese, Coloane forms the southern part of Macau. Its population consists of several settlements dotted around the parish, such as Vila de Coloane (Coloane Village), Hac Sa, Ká-Hó, and Cheoc Van. Administratively, the boundaries of the traditional civil parish () of São Francisco Xavier are coterminous with that of Coloane.

==Etymology==
Coloane was historically known in Cantonese as &quot;Gau Ou Saan&quot; (九澳山 &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Nine-inlet Mountain&quot; or transcribed in Portuguese as Ká-Hó) and &quot;Yim Jou Waan&quot; (鹽灶灣, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Salt-stove Bay&quot;). The Portuguese name of &quot;Coloane&quot; is derived from the Cantonese pronunciation of &quot;Gwo Lou Waan&quot; (過路環, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Passing-road Ring&quot;).

==Geography==
Coloane has an area of , is long and is from the Macau Peninsula. The narrowest part of Coloane is . The highest points in Macau are eastern and central Coloane, with the highest point being the Coloane Alto (, Portuguese: &quot;Alto de Coloane&quot;).

Before land reclamation works started beginning in the 1990s, Coloane was a former island, separated from Taipa by the bay of Seac Pai Van, which from 1969 was crossed by a causeway, the Estrada do Istmo, connecting Coloane to Taipa. However by the early 2000s, extensive land reclamation physically connected the two islands and a new area called Cotai, intended primarily for entertainment and leisure purposes, was built between Taipa and Coloane, now home to the Cotai Strip and several other casino projects.

The northern shore of the parish is deep, and is the site of the Macau Deepwater Port.

The eastern Hac Sa Beach (, Portuguese: &quot;Baía de Hác Sá&quot;) and the southern Cheoc Van Bay (, Portuguese: &quot;Baía de Cheoc Van&quot;) are popular swimming beaches and overlook the South China Sea.

==History==
From the Song dynasty onwards and until the Portuguese annexation of Coloane in 1864, Coloane largely served as a sea salt farm for China. The annexation of Coloane in the 1860s came as Portugal sought to expand its influence over Macau and affirm its sovereignty, turning the city into a fully-fledged colony and expanding its area to include Taipa, Ilha Verde, Coloane and portions of Hengqin (Montanha). Due to Coloane’s sparse habitation, mountainous terrain, and geographical isolation yet close adjacency to the flourishing trade on the Macau Peninsula, from the Ming Dynasty, it had also become a refuge of piracy, which resulted in Coloane’s fishermen having competition from both smugglers and pirates. According to historians, most pirates were likely fishermen seeking to make money. As such, the annexation by Portugal also sought to dislodge the pirates who had been using Coloane as a refuge and disrupt Macau’s trade.

Despite the annexation, Coloane remained largely deserted, and its Portuguese sovereignty remained disputed as late as 1912 by the local government in Guangdong, which wanted property owners in Coloane not to be forced to pay taxes to the Macau colonial government. Despite several anti-piracy efforts, Coloane remained a base of piracy until an incident in July 1910 where a group of 18 Chinese children were kidnapped by a band of pirates, requesting a ransom amount of 35,000 Macanese patacas. In what became the last battle fought by Portuguese troops in Macau, all 310 pirates active in the Coloane area were captured or fled after a 10-day battle, which saw Coloane bombed as a result and some of its inhabitants incarcerated and charged with helping pirates.

Many of the pirates that fled were caught either by the colonial Macau government, the British colonial government in Hong Kong, or the Qing government in China. Most faced the death penalty by decapitation.

For many years, July 13 has served as a local holiday in Coloane, celebrating the victory over the pirates, with a statue in front of the Church of St. Francis Xavier (in Largo Eduardo Marques) commemorating the event.

Locally famous for its rural character, the island started to become more populated after the Estrada do Istmo causeway connecting Coloane with Taipa was completed in 1969, and became to become rapidly developed and populated starting in the 1990s, following the beginning of land reclamation works that created the area of Cotai and developed new towns such as Seac Pai Van.

==Coloane Village==
Coloane Village (Portuguese: &quot;Vila de Coloane&quot;; ), located on the southwestern coast of Coloane, is the main settlement in the area.

The village centers on Eduardo Marques Square, which is a rectangle paved in cobblestones that are black, white and yellow, laid out in a wavy pattern reminiscent of the sea. The square faces a seaside promenade that traces the channel dividing Macau from the mainland Chinese hills on Hengqin (Montanha). At the eastern end of the square stands the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier, built in 1928.

A Tam Kung Temple is located at the southern end of Avenida de Cinco de Outubro (十月初五馬路).

== Lai Chi Vun Village ==

Lai Chi Vun Village (Portuguese: &quot;Vila de Lai Chi Vun&quot;; ) is a small settlement located directly north of Coloane Village. The route to the village, the Estrada de Lai Chi Vun, begins at the intersection of Estrada de Seac Pai Van and Estrada do Campo in the north and ends at Largo do Cais in the south. The towering banyan tree at the northern end of the marks the northern entrance to the village, whose name is associated with its abundance in lychee trees in the past and its bowl-shaped bay.

The shipyards that once lay beyond the village are nowadays left in disuse. The single-storey business premises of Veng Lok Shipyard and of Association of Shipbuilders of Macau-Taipa-Coloane are located inside the small courtyard to the right of the road atop the hill. All the way down the road to the western side is the one-storey office building of the Customs office of Coloane in Portuguese architectural style.

Coloane Pier, which was once the only entry and exit point of Coloane, is located along the waterfront facing Largo do Cais the southern end of the road.

The Lai Chi Vun shipyards are currently being evaluated to determine whether they meet the Macau SAR’s legal definition of cultural relics. The site is potentially significant because Macau&#x27;s shipbuilding industry began at the shipyards and because of the formation of a historical village near the area.

<text>Rubik&#x27;s Magic, like the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, is a mechanical puzzle invented by Ernő Rubik and first manufactured by Matchbox in the mid-1980s.

The puzzle consists of eight black square tiles (changed to red squares with goldish rings in 1997) arranged in a 2 × 4 rectangle; diagonal grooves on the tiles hold wires that connect them, allowing them to be folded onto each other and unfolded again in two perpendicular directions (assuming that no other connections restrict the movement) in a manner similar to a Jacob&#x27;s ladder toy. The front side of the puzzle shows, in the initial state, three separate, rainbow-colored rings; the back side consists of a scrambled picture of three interconnected rings. The goal of the game is to fold the puzzle into a heart-like shape and unscramble the picture on the back side, thus interconnecting the rings.

Numerous ways to accomplish this exist, and experienced players can transform the puzzle from its initial into the solved state in less than 2 seconds. Other challenges for Rubik&#x27;s Magic include reproducing given shapes (which are often three-dimensional), sometimes with certain tiles required to be in certain positions and/or orientations.

==History==
Rubik&#x27;s Magic was first manufactured by Matchbox in 1986. Professor Rubik holds both a Hungarian patent (HU 1211/85, issued 19 March 1985) and a US patent (US 4,685,680, issued 11 August 1987) on the mechanism of Rubik&#x27;s Magic. 

In 1987, &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Magic: Master Edition&quot; was published by Matchbox; it consisted of 12 silver tiles arranged in a 2 × 6 rectangle, showing 5 interlinked rings that had to be unlinked by transforming the puzzle into a shape reminiscent of a W. Around the same time, Matchbox also produced &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Magic Create the Cube&quot;, a &quot;Level Two&quot; version of &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Magic&quot;, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube. It did not have as wide a release, and is rare to find.

In 1996, the original version of Rubik&#x27;s Magic was re-released by Oddzon, this time with yellow rings on a red background; other versions (for example, a variant of the original with silver tiles instead of black ones) were also produced, and there also was a strategy game based on Rubik&#x27;s Magic. An unlicensed 2 × 8 version was also produced, with spheres printed on its tiles instead of rings. Custom versions as large as 2 × 12 have been built using kits available from Oddzon.

== Details ==
It can be seen that the total number of 2 × 4 rectangles that can possibly be created using Rubik&#x27;s Magic is only thirty-two; these can be created from eight distinct chains. The easiest way to classify chains is by the means of the middle tile of the puzzle&#x27;s finished form (the only tile that has segments of all three rings) and the tile next to it featuring a yellow/orange ring segment (the indicator tile).

Every chain either has the middle tile on the outside (O) or the inside (I) of the chain; if it is arranged so that the indicator tile is to the right of the middle tile, then the position of the ring segment on the indicator tile can either be the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL), or lower right (LR) corner. The position and orientation of the remaining tiles are then determined by the middle and indicator tiles, and eight distinct chains (OUL to ILR) are obtained, although the naming convention is not standardized.

Similarly, the 2 × 4 rectangle forms of them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 to the chain&#x27;s name, depending on whether the number of tiles to the right of the middle tile before the folding edge, a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.
The cube now is rainbow and has silver rings. A game rule for this one is you can match the silver rings and color squares, which can make it more complicated.
A similar classification can also be obtained for the heart-shaped forms of the puzzle, of which 64 exist.

==Analysis==

One question when analyzing Rubik&#x27;s Magic concerns its state space: What is the set of configurations that can be reached from the initial state? This question is harder to answer than for Rubik&#x27;s Cube, because the set of operations on Rubik&#x27;s Magic does not form a mathematical group.

The basic operation (move) consists of transferring a hinge between two tiles T1 and T2, from one pair of edges (E11 of T1 and E21 on T2) to another pair E12 and E22.
Here, edges E11 and E12 are adjacent on tile T1,
and so are edges E21 and E22 on tile T2 but in opposite order. See the figure below for an example, where E11 is the East edge of the yellow tile, E21 is the West edge of the red tile, and both E21 and E22 are the North edges.
In order to carry out such a move, the hinge being moved cannot cross another hinge. Thus, the two hinges on a tile can take up one of five relative positions (see figure below). The positions are encoded as a number in the range from -2 to +2, called the &quot;wrap&quot;. The difference between wrap -2 and wrap +2 is the order of the neighboring tiles (which one is on top). The total wrap of a configuration is calculated as the &quot;alternating sum&quot; of the wraps of the individual tiles in the chain.

The total wrap is invariant under a move. Thus, one can calculate the number of theoretically possible shapes of the chain (disregarding the patterns on the individual tiles) as 1351.

Furthermore, the other tiles in the chain will have to move through space appropriately to allow the folding and unfolding needed to carry out a move. This limits the practically reachable number of configurations further. That number also depends on how much stretching of the wires you tolerate.

== Records ==

The world record for a single solve of the Magic is 0.69 seconds, set by Yuxuan Wang. Yuxuan Wang also holds the record for an average of five solves - 0.76 seconds set at the Beijing Summer Open 2011 competition. Due to the World Cube Association no longer recognizing Rubik&#x27;s Magic as an official event in 2012, Yuxuan Wang holds the permanent world record for this puzzle.

==Rubik&#x27;s Magic: Master Edition==
Rubik&#x27;s Magic: Master Edition (most commonly known as Master Magic) was manufactured by Matchbox in 1987. It is a modification from the Rubik&#x27;s Magic, with 12 tiles instead of the original&#x27;s 8. The puzzle has 12 panels interconnected with nylon wires in a 2 × 6 rectangular shape, measuring approximately 4.25 inches (10.5 cm) by 13 inches (32 cm). The goal of the game is the same as for Rubik&#x27;s Magic, which is to fold the puzzle from a 2 × 6 rectangular shape into a W-like shape with a certain tile arrangement. Initially, the front side shows a set of 5 linked rings. Once solved, the puzzle takes the shape of the letter W, and shows 5 unlinked rings on the back side of the previous initial state.

As a puzzle, the Master Edition is actually simpler than the original Rubik&#x27;s Magic. With more hinges, the player can work on one part, mostly ignoring the other parts. The minimal solution involves 16 quarter-turn moves. There are multiple solutions. The puzzle was an official World Cube Association (WCA) event from 2003 to 2012.

<text>Aegean Macedonia (&quot;;&quot; ) is a term describing the region of Macedonia in Northern Greece. It is currently mainly used in the Republic of North Macedonia, including in the irredentist context of a United Macedonia. The term is also used in Bulgaria as the more common synonym for Greek Macedonia, without the connotations it has in the Republic of North Macedonia. The term has no circulation in Greece, since &quot;Aegean&quot; usually refers to the Greek islands or to strictly Greek coastal areas with direct access to the Aegean Sea. Although Greek Macedonia does have its coastline along the northern Aegean, the province is more than anything else dominated by its high mountain ranges and broad, grassy plains, rather than by its coastline (with the exception of the Chalkidiki peninsula, which is a popular holiday destination in the southernmost part of central Macedonia and noted for its beaches).

==Origins of the term==

The origins of the term seem to be rooted in the 1910s; most of its early appearances were in the writings of Bulgarian authors. Since the mid-1940s the term has appeared on maps circulated first in Yugoslavia and especially after 1991 in the independent Republic of Macedonia where ethnic Macedonians have envisioned Greek Macedonia (referred to as &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot;) as part of a &quot;Greater Macedonia&quot;, and is regarded as a non-recognition of current European borders, including the legitimacy of Greek sovereignty over the area. 

During the Greek Civil War, the Greek government referred to the usage as a &quot;new term&quot; only recently introduced by Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia, implying that it considered it part of the Yugoslav campaign of laying claim to Greek Macedonia.

Tito&#x27;s war-time representative to Yugoslav Macedonia, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, is credited with promoting the usage of the regional names of the Macedonian region for irredentist purposes. On August 26, 1946, the Belgrade newspaper &quot;Borba&quot; published an article under the title &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot;, it was also published in Skopje&#x27;s &#x27; with a map of Yugoslav territorial claims against Greece. A month later, on September 22, the premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Vlahov (speech in &#x27;, on September 26, 1946), announced, &quot;We openly declare that Greece has no rights whatsoever over Aegean Macedonia...&quot;. Vlahov then went on to publish, &quot;The Problems of Aegean Macedonia&quot;, Belgrade, June 1947.

==Post-WWII==

By 1950, the term &#x27;Aegean Macedonians&#x27; had been officially adopted by the Macedonian refugees in Skopje who began publishing the newspaper &quot;The Voice of the Aegeans&quot;; it is later found amongst diaspora communities.

In Greece, the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia, were acknowledged as Slavomacedonians. A native of the region, former exile communist, teacher of Greek in Tashkent and local historian, Pavlos Koufis, says in &quot;Laografika Florinas kai Kastorias&quot; (Folklore of Florina and Kastoria), that, 

“[During its Panhellenic Meeting in September 1942, the KKE mentioned that it recognises the equality of the ethnic minorities in Greece] the KKE (Communist Party of Greece) recognised that the Slavophone population was ethnic minority of Slavomacedonians]. This was a term, which the inhabitants of the region accepted with relief. [Because] Slavomacedonians = Slavs+Macedoninas. The first section of the term determined their origin and classified them in the great family of the Slavic peoples.”
The name &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot; contains on the one hand a reference to a geographical area which, since Homeric times, is historically associated with the Greeks (the Aegean), but, as expressed above, there is also the experience that it is used by irredentist organizations in the Republic of North Macedonia and beyond who support a United Macedonia, contrary to the desires of the people living in the area.
Writing in 1953, Lazar Mojsov seems surprised that the Greeks find the term &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot; insulting, and uses it frequently, noting that &quot;...Politis (former Greek minister of external affairs) didn&#x27;t miss the opportunity to attack even the very term &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot;, stating that it was &quot;coined by the communist propagandists&quot;.

The term is currently used by some scholars, mostly contextualised, along with the sister terms Vardar Macedonia (describing the part of Macedonia region in which the Republic of North Macedonia inhabits) and Pirin Macedonia (describing the part of Macedonia region in which the Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria inhabits). The area of the Macedonian region that is part of Albania and Kosovo is often excluded. The term is used more frequently by ethnic Macedonians and has irredentist connotations.

<text>Gregorio Martínez Sierra (6 May 1881 – 1 October 1947) was a Spanish writer, poet, dramatist, and theatre director, a key figure in the revival of the Spanish theatrical avant-garde in the early twentieth century.

==Work as a poet and playwright==
Martínez Sierra&#x27;s literary career began at the age of 17 with the publication of &quot;El poema del trabajo&quot; (&#x27;The Poem of Work&#x27;, 1898), a volume of poetry in the modernist style. His subsequent books of poetry included &quot;Diálogos fantásticos&quot; (&#x27;Fantastic Dialogues&#x27;, 1899), &quot;Flores de escarcha&quot; (&#x27;Frost Flowers&#x27;, 1900) and &quot;La casa de primavera&quot; (&#x27;The House of Spring&#x27;, 1907).

As a playwright, Martínez Sierra was one of the few progressive dramatists whose productions achieved any measure of commercial success at the time of their composition. His major works include &quot;La sombra del padre&quot; (&#x27;Shadow of the Father&#x27;, 1909), &quot;Primavera en otoño&quot; (&#x27;Spring in Autumn&#x27;, 1911), &quot;Sólo para mujeres&quot; (&#x27;For Women Only&#x27;, 1913), &quot;Mamá&quot; (&#x27;Mama&#x27;, 1913) and &quot;El reino de Dios&quot; (&#x27;The Kingdom of God&#x27;, 1916). (&#x27;Cradle Song&#x27;, 1911), which has been called his &quot;masterpiece&quot;, was popular across the Spanish-speaking world, and an English-language adaptation transferred to Broadway in 1927. Several of Martínez Sierra&#x27;s plays were adapted into films, including (as &quot;Cradle Song&quot;, dir. Mitchell Leisen, 1933).

The deft handling of female characters in Martínez Sierra&#x27;s works has been attributed to the collaboration of his wife, the writer María Lejárraga. Since the publication of her memoir &quot;Gregorio y yo&quot; (&#x27;Gregorio and I&#x27;, 1953), her authorship of many of his plays has been increasingly recognised by scholars.

==Work as a publisher and director==
Martínez Sierra&#x27;s influence was largely as a publisher and director. Through his publishing house, Renacimiento (&#x27;Rebirth&#x27;), he translated the work of William Shakespeare, Maurice Maeterlinck and Santiago Rusiñol, and introduced the work of European playwrights including George Bernard Shaw and Luigi Pirandello to Spain. The authorship of the translations published under Gregorio&#x27;s name belongs undoubtedly to his wife, María Lejárraga, who was fluent in several languages (French, English, Italian, Catalan, Portuguese) and she had published translations under her own name before, after and during her attachment to him.

In 1917 he was appointed Director of Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Eslava and remained there until 1925, transforming the venue into Spain&#x27;s first Art Theatre. Amongst a series of Spanish and foreign playwrights whose work he produced &quot;in a new, forward-looking style&quot;, it was at Martínez Sierra&#x27;s invitation that Federico García Lorca created and staged, at the Eslava, his first play, &quot;El maleficio de la mariposa&quot; (&#x27;The Curse of the Butterfly&#x27;), in 1920.

<text>British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BAT) is a British multinational company that manufactures and sells cigarettes, tobacco and other nicotine products including electronic cigarettes. The company, established in 1902, is headquartered in London, England. As of 2023, it is the second-largest tobacco company in the world based on net sales.

BAT has operations in around 180 countries and its cigarette brands include Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans. Its brands also include Vuse e-cigarettes, Glo heated tobacco, and Velo nicotine pouches.

BAT has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. BAT plc ordinary shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares.

==History==

===1902 to 2000===

The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom&#x27;s Imperial Tobacco Company and the United States&#x27; American Tobacco Company agreed to form a joint venture, the &quot;British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.&quot; The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other&#x27;s domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became company chairman supported by Hugo Cunliffe-Owen (later Chairman) and Albert Jeffress (later Deputy Chairman); then business was begun in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.

In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco. Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Lawsonville, in North Carolina&#x27;s Rockingham County, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week. Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT&#x27;s principal Chinese partner after its success with the &quot;Ruby Queen&quot; cigarette brand.

In 1911, the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.

At its peak in 1937, BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company&#x27;s assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1949 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic.

In 1976 the Group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, &quot;B.A.T. Industries&quot;. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT&#x27;s portfolio.

In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International, which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory in 2003 after an &quot;exceptional request&quot; from the British government.

===2000 to present===
In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris&#x27; attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.

In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A., Italy&#x27;s state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI&#x27;s local brands and BAT&#x27;s international brands.

In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.

In July 2004, the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown &amp; Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown &amp; Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share.
In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global research and development operation, and some financial functions, continue on the site.

Then in 2008, BAT acquired Turkey&#x27;s state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.

In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Group.

BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia&#x27;s Bentoel Group in 2009 before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.

In May 2011, BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Colombia S.A.S. (Protabaco).

In October 2015, BAT acquired the Croatian tobacco company TDR d.o.o. Brands and Factory in Kanfanar.

In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 per cent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world&#x27;s biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal. The deal was completed in July 2017.

In April 2017, the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.

In March 2021, the company bought a stake of close to 20% in the Canada-based cannabis producer OrganiGram for about £126 million as part of a diversification strategy.

In May 2023, the company&#x27;s chief executive, Jack Bowles, resigned with immediate effect. He was replaced by Tadeu Marroco, who had been finance director for four years.

On 14 September 2023, the company announced the sale of BAT Russia to a consortium led by local management. BAT Russia changed its name to the International Tobacco Marketing Services Group.

==Operations==
The company offers an extensive range of brands:

===Current===
Global brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. BAT does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

Local brands owned by British American Tobacco include: Benson &amp; Hedges, John Players Gold Leaf, Dunhill, Lucky Strike, Hollywood, Derby (Bangladesh), State Express 555 (Vietnam), Belmont (Colombia, Chile, Nicaragua and Venezuela), Jockey Club (Argentina), Stradbroke (Australia), Hollywood, Derby, Free, Minister and Plaza (Brazil), du Maurier (Canada), Prince (Denmark), North State (Finland), HB (Germany), Sopianae (Hungary), Wills (India), Ardath, Bentoel, and Tali Jagat (Indonesia), Carrolls, Carrolls Kings, Grand Parade, Black Allen (Germany), Sweet Afton, Major (Ireland), Boots, Alas (Mexico), Gold Leaf (Bangladesh, Pakistan), Jan III Sobieski (Poland), Yava Gold (Russia), Courtleigh, Peter Styvesant (South Africa), Kent, Pall Mall, Perilly&#x27;s, Peter Stuyvesant, and Rothmans (Malaysia), Parisienne (Switzerland), Kent and Maltepe (Turkey), Xon, Astra and Karvon (Uzbekistan), Craven A (Vietnam and Jamaica) as well as BAT snus, Holiday, Freedom and Park Drive (New Zealand), Royals (UK and Malta), Embassy (Kenya), Viceroy, Newport, Lucky Strike in Dominican Republic and Delta in El Salvador.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would manufacture Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.

===Former===
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl&#x27;s, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field&#x27;s and its divisions in 1982. It purchased the United Kingdom retail chain Argos in 1979. The company sold Kohl&#x27;s grocery stores to A&amp;P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl&#x27;s department stores and two Marshall Field&#x27;s divisions, The Crescent and Frederick &amp; Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field&#x27;s, as well as Allied Stores&#x27; Stern&#x27;s and Pomeroy&#x27;s divisions. In 1990, Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) purchased Marshall Field&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s purchased Ivey&#x27;s (another Marshall Field&#x27;s division), Investcorp S.A. purchased Saks Fifth Avenue, and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).

The Group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984), Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged its financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.

=== Corporate affairs ===
The company&#x27;s board is chaired by Luc Jobin, appointed in 2021. It&#x27;s non-executive board members are Holly Keller Koeppel, Kandy Anand, Karen Guerra, Murray Kessler, Véronique Laury, Darrell Thomas and Serpil Timuray.

==Other affiliates==

British American Tobacco Ghana Limited is a public limited company operated by British American in Ghana. The company is listed () on the stock index of the Ghana Stock Exchange, the GSE All-Share Index. It was formed in 1999 out of a merger between the Pioneer Tobacco Company and Meridian Tobacco.

==Sponsorships==
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the &quot;Wills World Cup&quot; and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.

BAT previously sponsored the London Symphony Orchestra.

Furthermore, BAT established The British American Tobacco Internship programme which is designed to help new graduates gain experience in their chosen field of study in a dynamic global organization.

===Formula One===

In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).

In 2005, a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.

In 2004, BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.

In 2019, McLaren signed a multi-year partnership deal with BAT through its transformation agenda &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, bringing the company back into Formula 1 for the first time since Honda succeeded BAR. This was also the second tobacco related deal signed since Formula 1 banned tobacco advertising in 2006.
In late 2019, BAT and McLaren announced the signing of an enhanced partnership deal that saw BAT become a principal partner of McLaren with increased branding position. McLaren advertises BAT&#x27;s New Category product brands Vuse (previously Vype) &amp; Velo (previously Lyft) on their F1 and IndyCar cars. Vuse also partnered with the McLaren F1 Team to race bespoke liveries designed by emerging artists for the 2021 to 2023 Abu Dhabi Grands Prix. In April 2024, McLaren announced a partnership extension with BAT, which includes the partnership being extended to the McLaren Formula E Team.

==Controversies==

=== Ignoring the cancer risks of cigarettes ===
As far back as 1958, BAT had information that cigarettes cause cancer. Three senior BAT scientists – H.R. Bentley, D.G.I. Felton, and W.W. Reid – travelled to the United States that year and talked to dozens of experts inside and outside of the tobacco industry. According to industry documents, all but one of those consulted believed a connection between cigarettes and cancer had been proved.

===Smoking bans===
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries. In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of &quot;extremist views&quot; from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to &quot;prepare to fight a hurricane&quot;.

=== Nigerian lawsuit ===
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria sought $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. It also sought $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies&#x27; advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments filed similar petitions. The government withdrew its lawsuit in February 2008.

===Marketing practices===
In 2008, the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT&#x27;s own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were &#x27;disappointing&#x27;. In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.

In September 2001, BAT invested US$7.1 million in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT&#x27;s Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.

British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.

British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU&#x27;s register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT&#x27;s hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.

===Canadian class action lawsuit===
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson &amp; Hedges, were the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US$21.6 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.

On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.

===Australian lawsuit===
In 2012, British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris International and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court of Australia, they argued that the Commonwealth&#x27;s plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies&#x27; intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.

=== HMRC fine for oversupply ===
In November 2014, Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) fined BAT £650,000 after it determined that the company glutted the Belgian market with tobacco products with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013–2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as &quot;unjustified&quot;.

===Bribery and threats in Africa===
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO&#x27;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.

In 2017, it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries. One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country&#x27;s constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya &quot;quash in its entirety&quot; anti-smoking legislation.

The Serious Fraud Office opened a &#x27;formal investigation&#x27; in August 2017 based on the dossier of evidence supplied by former employee and whistleblower Paul Hopkins. The formal investigation is based on claims by Hopkins that BAT had paid bribes to government officials in Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations in the African market which is the only market showing growth. BAT responded by classifying Hopkins as &quot;a rogue former employee&quot;. BAT Chief Executive Nico Durante said BAT operated in 200 countries and he could not give a 100% guarantee that everything was being done by the book.

In January 2021, the Serious Fraud Office closed its investigation into corruption at BAT after concluding that the evidence gathered “did not meet the evidential test for prosecution as defined in the Code for Crown Prosecutors”.

On 14 September 2021, in a report published by the NGO STOP, the NGO accused British American Tobacco of having distributed more than $600,000 in the form of cash, cars or campaign donations to dozens of politicians, legislators, civil servants, journalists and employees of competing companies between 2008 and 2013.

In November 2012, the Zimbabwean government arrested several people for spying on factories owned by local tobacco companies, including Pacific Cigarette Company (PCC). BAT&#x27;s involvement was suspected but not proven. Later that month, President Robert Mugabe accused BAT of spying and hijacking PCC trucks to &quot;kill competition&quot;. In September 2021, a BBC Panorama investigation found evidence that BAT had enlisted Forensic Security Services, a South African Security firm, to sabotage and surveil factories owned by competitors, including PCC. After the spies were arrested, BAT negotiated a bribe so that the government would release them from jail.

===Pakistani lobbying efforts===
In April 2015, medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. The group released photos showing Barton attending a meeting on 13 March in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to veto plans requiring large health warnings on cigarette packets. This activity was deemed contrary to Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT&#x27;s behalf.

=== Tobacco marketing in unstable nations and conflict zones ===
In August 2017, former employee and whistleblower Paul Hopkins released internal documents to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a British newspaper, claiming British American Tobacco actively made efforts to market and sell its products in unstable, deeply impoverished nations and conflict zones, including Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Iraq. Leaked PowerPoint presentations from 2011 included details of strategies to continue selling black-market cigarettes &quot;in black paper bags&quot; in parts of Somalia controlled by the fundamentalist Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab, plans to develop &quot;a consumer relevant brand portfolio&quot; and &quot;sustainable... volume growth&quot; in South Sudan just two days before the nation gained independence, and the active marketing and growth of the Kent cigarette brand in Iraq and Syria, despite &quot;volatile markets&quot; in the middle of the Iraq War and Syrian Civil War, respectively.

In February 2021, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Network (OCCRP) published an investigation according to which trafficking of BAT cigarettes had helped finance jihadist and separatist groups in northern Mali using, among other mechanisms, a system of oversupplying the country with tobacco. This has allowed billions of cigarettes to be smuggled out of the country.

In April 2023, a subsidiary admitted that it had sold cigarettes to North Korea. This act is a violation of the existing sanctions imposed by the US against North Korea. Based on the investigations of US authorities, the activity spanned for ten years—from 2007 to 2017. Because of this breach, BAT is obligated to pay $635m (£512m) and interests to US authorities. Attorney General Matthew Olsen, Department of Justice&#x27;s assistant described the settlement fee as DOJ&#x27;s first and largest single North Korean sanctions penalty.

<doc id="361348" wikidata="Q1144512" url="?curid=361348" title="Curia Hostilia">
<text>The Curia Hostilia was one of the original senate houses or &quot;curiae&quot; of the Roman Republic. It was believed to have begun as a temple where the warring tribes laid down their arms during the reign of Romulus (r. c. 771–717 BC). During the early monarchy, the temple was used by senators acting as a council to the king. Tullus Hostilius (r. 673–641 BC) was believed to have replaced the original structure after fire destroyed the converted temple. It may have held historic significance as the location of an Etruscan mundus and altar. The Lapis Niger, a series of large black marble slabs, was placed over the altar (known as the Volcanal) where a series of monuments was found opposite the Rostra. This curia was enlarged in 80 BC by Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his renovations of the comitium. That building burned down in 52 BC when the supporters of the murdered Publius Clodius Pulcher used it as a pyre to cremate his body.

==History==

There has been a meeting house for the people of Rome through most of Rome&#x27;s history. This one likely began as a temple.

===Architecture and layout===
There may have been a small shrine to the god Vulcan from the earliest period, a stone altar with a marble stele inscribed with a dedication from a Latin king. An honorary column was also among the tightly packed items. This spot was separated from the rest of the comitium with a low rising concrete fence to keep pedestrians from walking atop it.

The Curia Hostilia architecture had changed a number of times, but maintained its original form even after a number of refurbishments. The structure was where all of Rome&#x27;s early political life centered. It is said that the public was always allowed to stroll into the Curia Hostilia to listen to the senators debate.

Relatively little is known about the Curia Hostilia. One feature of the Curia that is mentioned in almost all sources is the &quot;Tabula Valeria&quot;, a painting on the exterior of the Curia&#x27;s western wall. It depicted the victory of Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla over Hiero and the Carthaginians in 263 BC. Pliny says that the painting was the first such picture in Rome.

Another detail that most sources agree on is that the Curia Hostilia was located on the north side of the comitium. It is believed that the circular set of stairs of the Comitium, which also doubled as seating for citizens listening to speakers at the Rostra, led up to the Curia&#x27;s entrance. With regard to the Curia&#x27;s location, Stambaugh writes, &quot;[T]he Curia Hostilia was built on rising ground so as to dominate the whole space of the Forum Romanum&quot;. Given its prominent place in the Forum, it seems that the Curia Hostilia was a symbol of the strength of the Roman Republic.

The original Etruscan Temple was probably used as the meeting place of the separate tribes of the seven hills. It may have had only two columns and an open portico. It is believed the temple was converted by bricking up the front portico creating an anteroom. There may have been a balcony created above this space with an opening for public viewing but little is known about how this addition may have looked like. It is believed the exterior may well have looked almost exactly the same as the Curia Julia as the classic lines of the simple structure match the lines of the Etruscan Temple.

===Destruction by fire===
The building was destroyed in 52 BC after the makeshift funeral fire (with benches from the curia) for Publius Clodius Pulcher ignited the structure, burning it to the ground. It was replaced with the Curia Cornelia, located in almost the same space. This structure was in turn replaced by the Curia Julia started by Julius Caesar and finished by Emperor Augustus.

<doc id="361349" wikidata="Q984041" url="?curid=361349" title="William Henry Sykes">
<text>Colonel William Henry Sykes, FRS (25 January 1790 – 16 June 1872) was an English naturalist who served with the British military in India and was specifically known for his work with the Indian Army as a politician, Indologist and ornithologist. One of the pioneers of the Victorian statistical movement, a founder of the Royal Statistical Society, he conducted surveys and examined the efficiency of army operation. Returning from service in India, he became a director of the East India Company and a member of parliament representing Aberdeen.

==Life and career==
Sykes was born near Bradford in Yorkshire. His father was Samuel Sykes of Friezing Hall, and they belonged to the family of Sykeses of Yorkshire. He joined military service as a cadet in 1803 and obtained a commission on 1 May 1804 with the Honourable East India Company. Joining the Bombay Army, he was to lieutenancy on 12 October 1805. He saw action at the siege of Bhurtpur under Lord Lake in 1805. He commanded a regiment at the battles of Kirkee and Poonah and was involved in the capture of hill forts. By 1810 he could speak Hindi and Marathi languages. He became a captain on 25 January 1819 and travelled for four years across Europe from 1820. He returned to India in October 1824 and was appointed by Mountstuart Elphinstone as a statistical reporter to the Bombay government. He then collected statistical and natural history researches, and completed a census of the population of the Deccan, producing two voluminous statistical reports, and a complete natural history report illustrated with drawings. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Hay of Renistoun, in 1824. He was promoted to the rank of major on 8 September 1826 and to lieutenant-colonel on 9 April 1831. In December 1829 the post of statistical reporter was abolished, but he took leave from military duty and continued to work on his statistical surveys. He completed this in January 1831 and left for Europe on furlough. He retired from active service with the rank of colonel on 18 June 1833, and in September 1835 he became a Royal Commissioner in Lunacy, a post he held till 1845. On account of his knowledge of Indian matters, he was made a director of the East India Company in 1840. In 1867 he was elected chairman of the court of directors of the East India Company.
In 1847 he tried to contest for the Member of Parliament seat for Aberdeen but failed. In 1857 he contested again, representing the liberal interest against John Farley Leith, and was elected. He continued to hold the seat for several terms. He was elected president of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1858. He was also a member of the Society of Arts and the Royal British Association.

Sykes was elected Lord Rector of Marischal College, Aberdeen (whose founder, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, was an ancestor of his wife) in 1854. He took a special interest in libraries and information accessibility, seeking university libraries to remain open for longer and supporting the role of public libraries. He noted that England was lagging behind Europe in the size of public libraries noting that the per-capita availability of books in London was 22 books for 100 persons while Paris had 160 for 100, Florence 317 per 100; Dresden 490 per 100; Munich 780; and Copenhagen 467 per 100. He also noted that Munich had 17 public libraries. In his installation talk as Lord Rector, he also claimed that he could help establish a commission in the Indian Army for the best students of mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, Biblical criticism and classics if they had expertise in military drawing, and geology apart from good conduct. He was a founder member, in 1835, and president of the Royal Statistical Society, 1863–1965; he was the eleventh holder of that post but the first not to be a peer or baronet. He also became an Honorary Metropolitan Commissioner in September 1835. Despite suffering from bronchitis he attended all parliament sessions and died in Kensington, London, aged 82.

==Contributions==
As a &quot;Statistical Reporter&quot; he travelled across the Deccan region, collecting data on populations apart from collecting natural history specimens. Some of statistical research contributions included the computations of the cost of maintenance per soldier. He calculated for instance that the French army had a much lower cost than that of the British army, which according to him allowed the French to maintain two soldiers for the cost of one &quot;English&quot; soldier. He also worked out that native Indian soldiers were healthier than their European counterparts and that it was possible to provide pension and insurance to Indian soldiers with a very low premium although this was never implemented.

Sykes was a pioneer meteorologist in India, taking regular temperature and atmospheric pressure readings; he noticed regular patterns in diurnal pressure variations and noted that the range was greatest in winter, while the least difference occurred during the monsoons.

Sykes&#x27; collections of animals resulted in the publications of catalogues of birds and mammals from the Deccan region, many of which were published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society&quot;. His discoveries included fifty-six birds new to science, including the Indian pond heron. Sykes also studied the fish of the area, and wrote papers on the quails and hemipodes of India. His list of birds of the Deccan contained almost 236 species. He was an authority on the natural history of the Deccan region and he corresponded with many other naturalists. He used his influence during his position at the East India Company and Charles Darwin wrote to him to influence decisions in favour of including Edward Blyth on an expedition to China. Sykes&#x27;s lark (&quot;Galerida deva&quot;) of peninsular India is named after him. In addition, a race of blue-headed wagtail (&quot;Motacilla flava beema&quot;) was given the common name Sykes&#x27;s wagtail in &quot;British Birds&quot; (1907).

Sykes wrote extensively on Buddhism and its antiquity. In an 1842 paper published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society, he contended that the Brahmins were likely not native to India and that Pali was older than Sanskrit. He believed that, rather than Brahmanism, it was Buddhism that had reigned supreme in India&#x27;s ancient past. Referring to the recently translated travelogue of Faxian, Sykes paid tribute to &quot;the literature of that remarkable people—the Chinese&quot; that thankfully existed to illuminate India&#x27;s past. He hoped that, &quot;by proper means, applied in a cautious, kindly and forbearing spirit, such farther changes may be effected as will raise the intellectual standard of the Hindus, improve their moral and social condition, and assist to promote their eternal welfare.&quot; In 1856, the citizens of Bombay presented Sykes with a medal for his advocacy in favour of a native system of education.

Sykes also wrote on the Taiping Rebellion holding the British Government guilty of unjustifiable aggression towards China. He also held the British responsible for precipitating the 1857 rebellion by being insensitive to local customs, citing the earlier case of the Vellore mutiny. In a commentary to the British media which had suggested that the mutineers were using greased cartridges, one of the immediate causes of the uprising, against the British he pointed out that they were all using &#x27;Brown Bess&#x27; and conventional musket ammunition. He was one of the founding members of the Asiatic Society of Bombay.

==Legacy==
*The Sykes&#x27; monkey &quot;Cercopithecus albogularis&quot; was named after him.
*The bird Sykes&#x27;s nightjar or the Sindh nightjar &quot;Caprimulgus mahrattensis&quot; was named after him.
*The bird Sykes&#x27;s warbler &quot;Iduna rama&quot; was named after him.

<doc id="361353" wikidata="Q3492303" url="?curid=361353" title="Southern Airways">
<text>Southern Airways was a local service carrier, a scheduled airline certificated by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board, in the United States, from its founding by Frank Hulse in 1949 until 1979, when it merged with North Central Airlines to become Republic Airlines. Southern&#x27;s corporate headquarters were in Atlanta, with operations headquartered at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, near Atlanta.

Following a merger with North Central Airlines in 1979, Southern became Republic Airlines, which in turn was merged into Northwest Airlines in 1986. Northwest Airlines was then merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010.

==History==
As a local-service airline, Southern Airways covered the south-central U.S. In 1955, their network spanned from Memphis south to New Orleans and east to Charlotte and Jacksonville. In August 1953, Southern flew to 29 airports and in August 1967 to 50.

Like other local-service airlines, Southern was subsidized; in 1962, its operating &quot;revenues&quot; of $14.0 million included $5.35 million &quot;Pub. serv. rev.&quot;

In May 1968, Southern&#x27;s routes extended from Tri-Cities in Tennessee south to New Orleans and Jacksonville, and east from Baton Rouge and Monroe, Louisiana, to the coast at Myrtle Beach and Charleston. Later in 1968, a route sprouted northward: three weekday Douglas DC-9-10s from Columbus, Georgia (CSG) nonstop to Washington Dulles and on to New York LaGuardia. These flights originated at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida (VPS) and also stopped at Dothan, Alabama.

Like most local-service airlines, Southern flew only Douglas DC-3s for the first few years. In 1961, they began adding 22 40-passenger, secondhand Martin 4-0-4s acquired from Eastern Air Lines, newer aircraft that were pressurised and had a rear ventral stairway. The last scheduled DC-3 flight was in 1967.

Southern&#x27;s first 65–75-passenger Douglas DC-9 series 10s arrived in 1967 followed by 85–95-passenger McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series 30s in 1969. The last scheduled flight by a Martin was on 20 April 1978 from Atlanta to Gadsden, Alabama, and back.

Some DC-9s were bought new and some used; the used jets included DC-9-14s from Delta Air Lines and Eastern Air Lines. Both airlines had purchased these aircraft new from Douglas. Unlike other local-service airlines, Southern did not operate turboprops (such as the Convair 580 and Fairchild F-27 used by other local-service airlines) during the 1960s and 1970s, but by the time of the merger with North Central, Southern had replaced their Martin 4-0-4s with several 19-passenger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner &quot;Metro II&quot;s.

===1970s===

By 1971, Southern was flying to New York City and Chicago and south to Orlando and Miami. U.S. government regulation did not allow Southern to fly nonstop from New York or Washington, DC, to Atlanta, so Southern had nonstops to Columbus, Georgia, then on to Dothan, Alabama; Mobile, Alabama; Panama City, Florida, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; and/or Gulfport/Biloxi, Mississippi. Many flights made five or six intermediate stops en route.

With more DC-9s, many routes once served with propeller aircraft were served with jets that linked small cities to Atlanta and Memphis:

*Columbus, Georgia, to Washington, DC continuing to New York City.
*Meridian, Mississippi, to Birmingham, Alabama; Columbus, Mississippi; and Laurel/Hattiesburg, Mississippi
*Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbus, Mississippi
*Muscle Shoals/Florence, Alabama, to Memphis, Tennessee, and Huntsville/Decatur, Alabama, with continuing eastbound service to Atlanta
*Greenville, Mississippi, to Memphis and Monroe, Louisiana, with continuing southbound service to Baton Rouge and New Orleans
*Columbia, South Carolina, to Greenville/Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina
*Albany, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia; Valdosta, Georgia; Dothan, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia

One DC-9-14 aircraft operated a &quot;milk run&quot; multistop routing from Miami to Orlando, Tallahassee, Panama City, Eglin AFB, Mobile, Gulfport, New Orleans, Birmingham, Atlanta, Huntsville, Memphis, St Louis, and Chicago Midway. Time en route was 14 hours and 32 minutes.

By the mid-1970s, Southern&#x27;s system had expanded to St. Louis, Detroit, Ft. Lauderdale, and Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, Southern&#x27;s only international destination. In 1978 Southern expanded westward from Memphis to Wichita and Denver.

Southern Airways called itself the &quot;Route of the Aristocrats&quot; and they used the slogan &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Second Class on Southern&quot; in their television commercials. They were famous for their promotional shot glasses: for a time, differently designed shot glasses were issued each year. Original Southern shot glasses are valued by collectors of airline memorabilia.

During the early 1970s, before strict airport security was implemented across the United States, several airlines experienced hijackings. Southern Airways Flight 49, a DC-9 en route from Memphis to Miami was hijacked on November 10, 1972, during a stop in Birmingham. The three hijackers boarded the plane armed with handguns and hand grenades. At gunpoint, the hijackers took the airplane, the plane&#x27;s crew of four, and 27 passengers, to nine American cities, Toronto, and eventually to Havana, Cuba. During the long flight, the hijackers threatened to crash the plane into the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, nuclear facilities, insisted on talking with President Richard Nixon, and demanded a ransom of $10 million. Southern Airways was only able to come up with $2 million. Eventually, the pilot talked the hijackers into settling for the $2 million when the plane landed in Chattanooga for refueling. Upon landing in Havana, the Cuban authorities arrested the hijackers, and after a brief delay, sent the plane, passengers, and crew back to the United States. The hijackers and $2 million stayed in Cuba.

Southern Airways accounted for the $2 million by debiting it to an account entitled &quot;Hijacking Payment&quot;. This account was reported as a type of receivable under &quot;other assets&quot; on Southern&#x27;s balance sheet. The company maintained that they would be able to collect the cash from the Cuban government, so a receivable existed. Southern Airways was repaid $2 million by the Cuban government, which was attempting to improve relations with the United States.

===Difficulties and merger===
By the late 1970s, Southern Airways began to experience difficulties. Two fatal accidents (Southern Airways Flight 932, November 14, 1970, and Southern Airways Flight 242, April 4, 1977) had put negative impact on the airline&#x27;s once excellent safety record. Improved highways including the interstate freeway system coupled with an increased willingness of passengers to drive to airports farther away for more convenient flights or lower air fares made many of Southern&#x27;s routes obsolete. With dramatic increases in the price of jet fuel in the 1970s, many of Southern&#x27;s routes were no longer cost effective.

On July 1, 1979, Southern merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines and the &quot;Route of the Aristocrats&quot; came to an end. Republic acquired Hughes Airwest before being acquired in 1986 by Northwest Airlines, which continued to operate many flights from the former Southern hub in Memphis. Northwest merged into Delta Air Lines in 2008.

<doc id="361354" wikidata="Q4851891" url="?curid=361354" title="Ballot access">
<text>Ballot access are rules and procedures regulating the right to candidacy, the conditions under which a candidate, political party, or ballot measure is entitled to appear on voters&#x27; ballots in elections in the United States. 

The jurisprudence of the right to candidacy and right to create a political party are less clear than voting rights in the United States. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has established in multiple cases that the federal constitution does not recognize a fundamental right to candidacy, and that state governments have a legitimate government interest in blocking &quot;frivolous or fraudulent candidacies&quot;. As election processes are decentralized by Article I, Section 4, of the United States Constitution, ballot access laws are established and enforced by the states. As a result, ballot access processes may vary from one state to another. 

State access requirements for candidates generally pertain to personal qualities of a candidate, such as: minimum age, residency, and citizenship. Additionally, many states require prospective candidates to collect a specified number of qualified voters&#x27; signatures on petitions of support and mandate the payment of filing fees before granting access; ballot measures are similarly regulated (as is the wording and format of petitions as well). Each state also regulates how political parties qualify for automatic ballot access, and how those minor parties that do not can. Fundamental to democracy, topics related to ballot access are the subject of considerable debate in the United States. 

In order to get on the ballot, a candidate, political party, or ballot measure must meet various requirements. The Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution states that &quot;the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof.&quot; Consequently, each state may design its own unique criteria for ballot access. The United States is one of the few nations that do not have uniform national laws on ballot access.
==Arguments==
The primary argument put forward by States for restricting ballot access has been the presumption that setting ballot access criteria too low would result in numerous candidates on the ballot, splitting the votes of similar minded voters. Example: With plurality voting, also known as first-past-the-post, the candidate with the most votes wins, even if the candidate does not have a majority of the votes. Suppose 55% Belief A and 45% Belief B vote in a district. If two candidates appeal to A, but only one appeals to B, the votes of A could split between the two A candidates, say 25% vote for one and 30% for the other, giving the B candidate the office although 55% preferred to see an A candidate in the office. However, proponents of ballot access reform say that reasonably easy access to the ballot does not lead to a glut of candidates, even where many candidates do appear on the ballot. The 1880s reform movement that led to officially designed secret ballots, such as the Australian ballot, had some salutary effects, but it also gave the government control over who could be on the ballot. As historian Peter Argersinger has pointed out, the reform that empowered officials to regulate access onto the ballot, also carried the danger that this power would be abused by officialdom and that legislatures controlled by established political parties, would enact restrictive ballot access laws to ensure re-election of their party&#x27;s candidates.

Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the 1880s ballot reform movement, John Henry Wigmore, suggested that &quot;ten signatures&quot; might be an appropriate requirement for nomination to the official ballot for a legislative office. In the 20th century, ballot access laws imposing signature requirements far more restrictive than Wigmore had envisioned were enacted by many state legislatures; in many cases, the two major parties wrote the laws such that the burdens created by these new ballot access requirements (usually in the form of difficult signature-gathering nominating petition drives) fell on alternative candidates, but not on major party candidates. Proponents of more open ballot access argue that restricting ballot access has the effect of unjustly restricting the choices available to voters, and typically disadvantages third party candidates and other candidates who are not affiliated with the established parties.

President George H. W. Bush signed the Copenhagen Document of the Helsinki Accords that states in part:

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has criticized the United States for its ballot access laws. In 1996, United States delegates responded to the criticism by saying that unfair ballot access &quot;could be remedied through existing appeal and regulatory structures and did not represent a breach of the Copenhagen commitments.&quot; The OSCE published a report on the 2004 United States election, which among other things, noted restrictive ballot access laws.

==Ballot access laws by state==

Ballot access laws in the United States vary widely from state to state:
* Alabama: Although not required to, major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent candidates are granted ballot access through a petition process and minor political party candidates are nominated by convention along with a petition process; one must collect 3% of the total votes cast in the last election for the specific race or 3% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election for statewide ballot access. The figure for 2016 and 2018 statewide ballot access is 35,412 valid signatures. Be aware that the validity of signatures generally means that 20–30% more signatures will need to be collected to ensure that the goal is achieved. To retain ballot access in the following election, a party has to poll 20% in a statewide race.

* Arizona: To gain ballot access, a new political party must gather signatures on a county–by–county basis, achieving over 20,000 valid signatures (i.e. from registered voters). Once this has been achieved the party must run a candidate for Governor or President who garners at least 5% of the vote to maintain ballot access for an additional two years, maintain at least 1% of registered voters registered with their party, or gather approximately the same number of signatures again every two years. The Democratic, Libertarian, and Republican parties have ballot access by voter registrations. In 2008, the Arizona Green Party gathered enough signatures to gain ballot access.
* California: 
** Any office, all electionsPer section 5100 of the California Election Code, ballot access requires one of two conditions to be met:If at the last preceding gubernatorial election there was polled for any one of the party&#x27;s candidates for any office voted on throughout the state, at least 2 percent of the entire vote of the state;If on or before the 135th day before any primary election, it appears to the Secretary of State, as a result of examining and totaling the statement of voters and their political affiliations transmitted to him or her by the county elections officials, that voters equal in number to at least 1 percent of the entire vote of the state at the last preceding gubernatorial election have declared their intention to affiliate with that party.
** Governor, primary elections Under legislation signed into law in 2019, candidates for Governor of California must publicly release personal tax returns for the previous five years in order to be listed on the primary election ballot in that state; write-in candidates are exempt from this requirement. As initially enacted, the law also applied to candidates for President of the United States; this provision was later held to be unconstitutional by the courts. 
* Colorado allows candidates to be placed on the ballot either through political party assemblies, or by collecting the required number of valid signatures as specified in Colorado Revised Statutes 1-4-801 and 1-4-802 for major- and minor-party candidates respectively. The major parties are parties whose gubernatorial candidates received at least 10% of the vote in the most recent general election. The relevant county, state house, state senate, judicial district, congressional district, and state assembly place all the candidates who receive 30% or more of the assembly vote on the primary ballot; a candidate who receives less than 10% of an assembly vote is ineligible to try the signature route for the same primary ballot. Candidates may choose to bypass the assembly route altogether in favor of collecting signatures. The required number of valid signatures per congressional district for statewide candidates ranges from 500 for State Board of Education and University of Colorado Regent to 1,500 for governor and US Senate. For other offices, the signature requirement is based on the lesser of a specified number of signatures and a specified percentage of the vote for that seat in the previous election – the primary if one was held for the major party and the general election otherwise and for minor-party candidates.
*Georgia In 2016 Georgia required a third-party presidential candidate to produce 7,500 signatures of registered voters to gain ballot access. The 7,500 number was imposed by Federal District Court Judge Richard Story in a March 17, 2016, ruling against the state that their requirement of signatures equaling at least 1% of the total number of registered and eligible voters in the most recent presidential election was an unconstitutionally high barrier. The number would have been about 50,334. On April 13, 2016, the Georgia secretary of state appealed the decision without seeking a stay until the state legislature acts to change the requirement. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine reported in October 2022 that the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a case that would have challenged the ballot access laws of Georgia, which were reported as some of the most onerous in the nation that have kept any third party off the ballot for nearly sixty years from 2022 prior: 
*Illinois: The threshold barrier to ballot access in Illinois is collecting an adequate number of voters&#x27; signatures on nominating petitions. Illinois distinguishes between &quot;Established Parties&quot; (i.e., the Democratic Party and Republican Party, although other parties may achieve Established Party status on a county-by-county basis), &quot;New Parties&quot;, and Independent Candidates. The signature requirements are lower for Established Parties than New Parties or Independent Candidates. The petitions must be circulated no more than 90 days prior to the filing deadline. (New for 2022 only: Due to COVID-related census information delays, the Illinois General Assembly pushed back the 2022 Illinois Primary Election and truncated the petition circulation period to 60 days.) Candidates in Illinois must also file a notarized Statement of Candidacy and, for non-federal offices, a Statement of Economic Interests. Candidates may also, but are not legally required to, submit a Code of Fair Campaign Practices pledge and a Loyalty Oath. The Loyalty Oath requirement was ruled unconstitutional in 1972.
** Statewide Offices: Established Party candidates must submit between 5,000 and 10,000 signatures. New Parties &amp; Independents must submit at least the lesser of 25,000 signatures or 1% of the number of voters who cast a ballot in the preceding general election. Statewide offices in Illinois include the Governor, Lt. Governor, Comptroller, Treasurer, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, and United States Senator. (New for 2022 only: Statewide candidates of Established parties require 3,250–6,500 valid signatures.)
** Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives: Established Party candidates must submit at least 0.5% of the primary voters in the candidate&#x27;s party in the congressional district. New Party &amp; Independents must submit at least 5% of the number of voters who cast a ballot in the preceding general election. (New for 2022 only: Congressional candidates of Established parties require only 1/3 of their typical valid signature requirement.)
** Senator in the Illinois General Assembly: Established Party candidates must submit between 1,000 and 3,000 signatures from voters in the Illinois Senate district. New Party &amp; Independents must submit signatures from at least 5% of the number of voters who cast a ballot in Illinois Senate district the preceding general election. (New for 2022 only: State Senate candidates of Established parties require 650–2,000 valid signatures.)
** Representative in the Illinois General Assembly: Established Party candidates must submit between 1,000 and 3,000 signatures from voters in the Illinois House district. New Party &amp; Independents must submit signatures from at least 5% of the number of voters who cast a ballot in Illinois House district the preceding general election. (New for 2022 only: State Representative candidates of Established parties require 400–1,000 valid signatures.) 
*Kentucky uses a three-tier system for ballot access, using the results of the previous presidential election as the gauge. If a party&#x27;s presidential candidate achieves less than 2% of the popular vote within the state, that organization is a &quot;political group&quot;. If the candidate receives 2% or more, but less than 20% of the popular vote in Kentucky, that organization is a &quot;political organization&quot;. Parties whose candidate for president achieves at least 20% of the popular vote are considered &quot;political parties&quot;. Taxpayer-funded primaries are achieved as a &quot;political party&quot;. Automatic ballot access is obtained as a &quot;political organization&quot; or &quot;political party&quot;, and these levels require only 2 signatures for a candidate to run for any partisan office. There is no mechanism for placing an entire party on the ballot in Kentucky, other than achieving &quot;political organization&quot; or &quot;political party&quot; status. Candidates of &quot;political groups&quot; and independent candidates must collect a minimum of between 25 and 5000 signatures to run for any particular partisan office. Filing fees apply equitably to all levels. Traditionally, the state only tracked voter registration affiliation as Democratic (D), Republican (R), or Other (O). Beginning 1 January 2006, Kentucky law provides for County Clerks to track the voter registration of Constitution (C), Green (G), Libertarian (L), Reform (F), and Socialist Workers (S), as well as independent (I); though a number of County Clerks have not been complying with this regulation.
*Louisiana is one of the easiest states to get on the ballot. Anyone may obtain a spot on the ballot by either paying a qualifying fee, or submitting petition signatures. For independent candidates for President (or non-recognized parties) the fee is $500 or 5000 signatures, with at least 500 from each Congressional district. Recognized Parties simply file their slate of Electors – their access is automatic, no fee or signatures required. For statewide office, the signature requirement is the same as that for president, but the fees are $750 for Governor and $600 for all other statewide offices. District and local office fees range from $40 or 50 signatures for a small town office, to $600 or 1000 signatures for US House. All signatures for district offices must come from within that district. If the office is for a political party committee, the signatures must be from people affiliated with that party. For Presidential Preference Primaries, the fee is $750 or 1000 signatures affiliated with that party from each Congressional district.(pdf) Present Louisiana law only allows for Presidential Primaries if a party has more than 40,000 registered voters statewide. Currently, this only applies to the Democratic and Republican Parties. Louisiana law changed in 2004 under efforts from the Libertarian Party of Louisiana to relax rules in place at that time for recognizing political parties in the state. There are now two methods to gain official recognition. Method A allows a party to be recognized if it pays a $1000 fee AND has 1000 or more voters registered under its label. To retain recognition, it must field a candidate at least once in any four-year period in a statewide election – with no requirement on performance in the election. Statewide election slots include Presidential Elector, Governor, Senator, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Comm. of Insurance, and Commissioner of Agriculture. To date, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have used this method to attain and retain official party recognition. Method B allows a party to be recognized if one of its candidates in a statewide race or for Presidential Elector achieves 5% of the vote. To retain recognition, it must repeat the 5% tally for statewide office or Presidential Elector at least once in any four-year period. To date, the Reform Party has used this method to gain and retain official party recognition. Due to their size, parties recognized by these methods are exempt from certain laws governing public elections of political committee offices and from certain financial reporting requirements until their membership reaches 5% of registered voters statewide. Recognized political parties in Louisiana are allowed to have their party name appear alongside their candidates on the ballot, and for their party to be offered as a specific choice on voter registration cards. Non-recognized parties appear as OTHER, and the party name must be written in on the registration card. Non-affiliated voters are listed as N for No Party. In the 2008 and 2010 Congressional elections, Louisiana experimented with closed primaries for House and Senate. Under this system, recognized parties participated in semi-closed primaries before the general election. Only one candidate from each party was allowed on the General Election ballot; there was no limit for OTHER or NONE. An attempt to pass a law differentiating &quot;minor&quot; parties similar to the rule for Presidential Primaries was defeated but made irrelevant by Louisiana reverting to its &quot;Jungle Primary&quot; system where all candidates, regardless of number from any party, all compete together on the same ballot. If no one achieves a majority, a general election is held as a run-off between the top two, also regardless of party affiliation.
* Maryland: Party certifications are done for each gubernatorial cycle (e.g. 2006–2010). If the number of registered voters to a political party is less than 1%, then 10,000 petition signatures must be gathered for that party to be considered certified. A party must be certified before voters can register under that party. A party can also be certified for a two-year term if their &quot;top of the ticket&quot; candidate receives more than 1% of the vote.
* Michigan: Major party candidates for Congress, governor, state legislature, countywide offices, and township offices are chosen through a primary system. A candidate can appear on the ballot by filing petition signatures; candidates for certain offices may file a $100 filing fee in lieu of filing petition signatures. All minor-party candidates, as well as major-party candidates for certain statewide offices, are chosen by a convention. Candidates running for nonpartisan offices (including judgeships, school boards, and most city offices) can appear on the ballot via petitions, as can candidates running for partisan offices without party affiliation.
* Minnesota: Major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent and minor political party candidates are nominated by a petition process; 2,000 signatures for a statewide election, or 500 for a state legislative election. Candidates have a two-week period to collect nominating petition signatures. Independent candidates may select a brief political party designation in lieu of independent.
* Missouri exempts parties from needing to gather signatures if they attain 2% of the vote in a statewide election.
* New York &quot;&quot;
:To be recognized, a political party must gain 50,000 votes in the most recent gubernatorial election. (There are, as of 2019, eight such parties. Three of these have primarily resorted to electoral fusion and usually only nominate candidates already on either the Democratic or Republican lines.) This allows for primary elections and allows statewide candidates to be exempted from having to petition. Any other candidate must file petitions. For statewide candidates, 15,000 signatures are required, and there must be at least 100 signatures from each of at least 1/2 of the congressional districts in the state (27 as of 2014). All state legislature and congressional candidates must file petitions regardless of party nominations, except in special elections. Village and town elections have less restrictive ballot access rules.
* North Carolina″s law pertaining to ballot access is codified in N.C.G.S Chapter 163 Elections and Election Law:
**New Political Parties: According to N.C.G.S. §163-96(a)(2) for a new political party to gain access to the election ballot they must obtain signatures on a petition equal to at least 2% of the total number of votes cast for Governor in the most recent election by no later than 12:00 noon on the first day of June before the election in which the party wishes to participate. In addition, at least 200 signatures must come from at least four separate US Congressional Districts each within the state. To qualify for the 2010 or 2012 election ballot a new political party must gather at least 85,379 signatures within approximately a 3.5 year time span, averaging at least 67 signatures every day for three and half years straight counting weekdays and holidays.
**Political Party Retention Requirement: According to N.C.G.S. §163-96(a)(1) in order for a political party to remain certified for the election ballot after obtaining access to the ballot, or to remain recognized by the State of North Carolina, that party must successfully garner at least 2% of the total vote cast for Governor for its candidate. If a party&#x27;s candidate for Governor fails to receive at least 2% of the vote, that party loses ballot access (N.C.G.S. §163-97) and must begin the petitioning process over again, and the voter affiliation of all registered voters affiliated with that party is changed to unaffiliated (N.C.G.S. §163-97.1).
**Statewide Unaffiliated Requirements: According to N.C.G.S. §163-122(a)(1) in order for an unaffiliated candidate to qualify for the election ballot for a statewide office, the candidate must obtain signatures on a petition equal to at least 2% of the total number of votes caste for Governor in the most recent election by 12:00 noon on the last Friday in June before the election in which the candidate wishes to participate. In addition, at least 200 signatures must come from at least four separate US Congressional Districts each within the state. To qualify for the 2010 or 2012 election ballot unaffiliated statewide candidates must obtain at least 85,379 signatures.
**District Unaffiliated Requirements: According to N.C.G.S. §163-122(a)(2–3) in order for an unaffiliated candidate to qualify for the election ballot for a district office, the candidate must obtain signatures on a petition equal to at least 4% of the total number of registered voters within the district that the candidate is running for election in as of January 1 of the election year in which the candidate desires to appear on the election ballot. Signatures must be turned in by 12:00 noon on the last Friday in June before the election in which the candidate wishes to participate. District candidates effectively cannot start petitioning for ballot access until after January 1 of the election year they are running for election, giving them just under half a year to obtain signatures for ballot access. To qualify for the 2010 election ballot unaffiliated US Congressional candidates are required to obtain as many as 22,544 signatures and an average of 18,719 signatures required for access to the 2010 election ballot.
* North Dakota requires 7,000 petition signatures to create a new political party and nominate a slate of candidates for office. Independent candidates need 1,000 for a statewide office or 300 for a state legislative office. The independent nominating petition process does not allow for candidates to appear on the ballot with a political party designation, in lieu of independent, except for presidential elections.
* Ohio: Late in 2006, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated Ohio&#x27;s law for ballot access for new political parties in a suit brought by the Libertarian Party of Ohio. After the November elections, the outgoing Secretary of State and Attorney General requested an extension to file an appeal to the US Supreme Court so that the decision to appeal could be made by the newly elected Secretary of State and Attorney General. The new Secretary of State did not appeal, but instead asserted her authority as Chief Election Officer of Ohio to issue new ballot access rules. In July 2008, a US District Court invalidated the Secretary of State&#x27;s rules and placed the Libertarian Party on the ballot. Three other parties subsequently sued and were placed on the ballot by the Court or by the Secretary of State.
* Oklahoma: A party is defined either as a group that polled 10% for the office at the top of the ticket in the last election (i.e., president or governor), or that submits a petition signed by voters equal to 5% of the last vote cast for the office at the top of the ticket. An independent presidential candidate, or the presidential candidate of an unqualified party, may get on the ballot with a petition of 3% of the last presidential vote. Oklahoma is the only state in the nation in which an independent presidential candidate, or the presidential candidate of a new or previously unqualified party, needs support from more than 2% of the last vote cast to get on the ballot. An initiative was circulated in 2007 to lower the ballot access rules for political parties.
* Pennsylvania: A new party or independent candidate may gain ballot access for one election as a &quot;political body&quot; by collecting petition signatures equal to 2% of the vote for the highest vote-getter in the most recent election in the jurisdiction. A political body that wins 2% of the vote obtained by the highest vote-getter statewide in the same election is recognized statewide as a &quot;political party&quot; for two years. A political party with a voter enrollment equal to less than 15% of the state&#x27;s total partisan enrollment is classified as a &quot;minor political party,&quot; which has automatic ballot access in special elections but must otherwise collect the same number of signatures as political bodies. Political parties not relegated to &quot;minor&quot; status qualify to participate in primary elections. Candidates may gain access to primary election ballots by collecting a set number of petition signatures for each office, generally significantly fewer than required for political bodies and minor political parties.
* South Dakota: For a registered political party in a statewide election they must collect petition signatures equal to 1% of the vote for that political party in the preceding election for state governor. An independent candidate must collect petition signatures equal to 1% of the total votes for state governor, and a new political party must collect 250 petition signatures. In state legislative elections, a registered political party needs to collect 50 signatures and an independent candidate must collect 1% of the total votes cast for state governor in the preceding election in their respective district.
* Tennessee: A candidate seeking a House or Senate seat at the state or national level must gather 25 signatures from registered voters to be put on the ballot for any elected office. Presidential candidates seeking to represent an officially recognized party must either be named as candidates by the Tennessee Secretary of State or gather 2,500 signatures from registered voters, and an independent candidate for president must gather 275 signatures and put forward a full slate of eleven candidates who have agreed to serve as electors. To be recognized as a party and have its candidates listed on the ballot under that party&#x27;s name, a political party must gather signatures equal to or in excess of 2.5% of the total number of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election (about 45,000 signatures based on the election held in 2006). A third party to be officially recognized was the American Party in 1968; none of its candidates received 5% of the statewide vote in 1970 or 1972 and it was then subject to decertification as an official party after the 1972 election. In 2012, a state court ruled that the Green Party of Tennessee and the Constitution Party of Tennessee would join the Republican and Democratic Parties on the ballot beginning with the November 6, 2012 election.
* Texas: For a registered political party in a statewide election to gain ballot access, they must either: obtain 5% of the vote in any statewide election; or collect petition signatures equal to 1% of the total votes cast in the preceding election for governor, and must do so by January 2 of the year in which such statewide election is held. An independent candidate for any statewide office must collect petition signatures equal to 1% of the total votes cast for governor, and must do so beginning the day after primary elections are held and complete collection within 60 days thereafter (if runoff elections are held, the window is shortened to beginning the day after runoff elections are held and completed within 30 days thereafter). The petition signature cannot be from anyone who voted in either primary (including runoff), and voters cannot sign multiple petitions (they must sign a petition for one party or candidate only).
* Virginia: A candidate for any statewide or local office must be qualified to vote for as well as hold the office they are running for, must have been &quot;a resident of the county, city or town which he offers at the time of filing&quot;, a resident of the district, if it is an election for a specific district, and a resident of Virginia for one year before the election. For any office the candidate must obtain signatures of at least 125 registered voters for the area where they are running for office (except in communities of fewer than 3,500 people, where the number is lower), and if they are running as a candidate from a political party where partisan elections are permitted, must pay a fee of 2% of their yearly salary (no fee is required for persons not running as a candidate for a primary of a political party). Petitions, along with additional paperwork, must be filed between about four and five months before the election, subject to additional requirements for candidates for a primary election. 1,000 signatures are required for a US House race and 10,000 for a statewide race (i.e. US president, US Senate, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or Attorney General), including 400 from each Congressional district. Nominees of a political party that &quot;at either of the two preceding statewide general elections, received at least 10 percent of the total vote cast for any statewide office filled in that election&quot; are exempt from needing to gather signatures.

===Constitutional dimensions of ballot access laws===
The Constitution has limited the states&#x27; discretion to determine their own ballot access laws:
* the right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment (when the restrictions involve a discriminatory classification of voters, candidates, or political parties);
* rights of political association under the First Amendment (especially when the restrictions burden the rights of political parties and other political associations, but also when they infringe on the rights of a candidate or a voter not to associate with a political party);
* rights of free expression under the First Amendment;
* rights of voters (which the Supreme Court has said are &quot;inextricably intertwined&quot; with the rights of candidates);
* property interests and liberty interests in candidacy;
* other rights to &quot;due process of law&quot;
* the right to petition the government (this argument is sometimes raised to allege that signature-gathering requirements, or the rules implementing them, are unfairly restrictive);
* freedom of the press (which historically included the right to print ballots containing the name of the candidate of one&#x27;s choosing);
* the right to a &quot;republican form of government,&quot; which is guaranteed to each state (although this clause has been held not to be enforceable in court by individual citizens).

The US Supreme Court precedent on ballot access laws cases has been conflicting. In &quot;Williams v. Rhodes&quot; (1969) the court struck down Ohio&#x27;s ballot access laws on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. During the 1970s the Supreme Court upheld strict ballot access laws, with a &#x27;compelling State interest&#x27; being the &quot;preservation of the integrity of the electoral process and regulating the number of candidates on the ballot to avoid voter confusion.&quot;

The Supreme Court did strike down provisions in a ballot access law in &quot;Anderson v. Celebrezze&quot;, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), but most of the subsequent court rulings in the 1980s–2000s continued to uphold ballot access laws in both primary and general elections. Among the most notable of these cases from the 1970s–1990s:
* &quot;Bullock v. Carter,&quot; 405 U.S. 134 (1972)
* &quot;Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party,&quot; 440 U.S. 173 (1979)
* &quot;U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,&quot; 514 U.S. 779 (1995)
* &quot;Lubin v. Panish,&quot; 415 U.S. 709 (1974)
* &quot;Norman v. Reed,&quot; 502 U.S. 279 (1992).

The Supreme Court has not expressly ruled on the maximum level of restrictions that can be imposed on an otherwise qualified candidate or political party seeking ballot access. As a result, lower courts have often reached difficult conclusions about whether a particular ballot access rule is unconstitutional.

Requiring an otherwise eligible candidate or political party to obtain signatures greater than 5% of the eligible voters in the previous election may be unconstitutional. This is based on &quot;Jenness v. Fortson,&quot; 403 U.S. 431 (1971); the court upheld a restrictive ballot access law with this 5% signature requirement, whereas the &quot;Williams v. Rhodes&quot; (1969) had involved a 15% signature requirement. Most State ballot access requirements, even the more restrictive ones, are less than 5%, and the Supreme Court has generally refused to hear ballot access cases that involved an Independent or minor party candidate challenging a ballot access law that requires less than 5%.

===International human rights law and ballot access===
International agreements that have the status of treaties of the US are part of the supreme law of the land, under Article VI of the United States Constitution:
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 25
* Copenhagen Document, ¶¶6–8, Annex I to 1990 Charter of Paris

Another source of international human rights law derives from universally accepted norms that have found expression in resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly. Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not binding under US law the way a treaty is, this type of norm is recognized as a source of international law in such treaties as the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to which the US is a party:
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art. 21

==Write-in status versus ballot access==
Depending on the office and the state, it may be possible for a voter to cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot. It is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office. In some cases, write-in votes are simply not counted. Having one&#x27;s name printed on the ballot confers an enormous advantage over candidates who are not on the ballot. The US Supreme Court has noted that write-in status is not a substitute for being on the ballot.

The two most notable cases of write-in candidates actually winning are the elections of Lisa Murkowski in 2010 and Strom Thurmond in 1954, both to the United States Senate. Other cases include the election of Charlotte Burks to the Tennessee State Senate seat of her late husband, Tommy Burks, murdered by his only opponent on the ballot; and the write-in primary victories in the re-election campaign of Mayor Anthony A. Williams of the District of Columbia. All of these cases involved unique political circumstances, a popular and well–known candidate, and a highly organized and well–funded write-in education campaign.

==Other obstacles facing third parties==

The growth of any third political party in the United States faces extremely challenging obstacles, among them restrictive ballot access. Other obstacles often cited as barriers to third-party growth include:
* Requirement hurdle of a number of signatures (often in the many thousands) required prior to placing a third-party candidate on the ballot (a requirement often waived entirely for other parties, in the US, such as the Democratic and Republican parties);
* Campaign funding reimbursement for any political party that gets at least 5% of the vote—implemented in many states &quot;to help smaller parties&quot;—typically helps the two biggest parties;
* Laws intended to fight corporate donations, with loopholes that require teams of lawyers to navigate the laws;
* The role of corporate money in propping up the two established parties;
* The allegedly related general reluctance of news organizations to cover minor political party campaigns;
* Moderate voters being divided between the major parties, or registered independent, so that both major primaries are hostile to moderate or independent candidates;
* Politically motivated gerrymandering of election districts by those in power, to reduce or eliminate political competition (two-party proponents would argue that the minority party in that district should just nominate a more centrist candidate relative to that district);
* Plurality voting scaring voters from credibly considering more than two major parties, as opponents of one would have to unite behind the other to have the most effective chance of winning (see Duverger&#x27;s law);
* The extended history and reputations of the two established parties, with both existing for over 150 years and being entrenched in the minds of the public;
* The absence of proportional representation;
* The 15% poll requirement by the non-government entity Commission on Presidential Debates;
* The public view that third parties have no chance of beating the worse of evils, and are therefore a wasted vote;
* Campaign costs of convincing interested voters that the party nominee has a chance of winning, and regaining that trust after an election where the third party got the third-most votes or split the vote between two similar candidates so that the most disliked candidate won (i.e. &quot;spoiling&quot; the election; this is less of a problem with Condorcet voting and range voting).

==Justification of strict ballot access laws by two party supporters==

Strict ballot access laws are not required for a two–party system, as can be seen by the experience of the United Kingdom. However, the following arguments are put forth about the need for strict ballot access laws in the United States:
* With plurality voting, allowing third candidates on the ballot could split the vote of a majority and throw the race to a candidate not favored by the majority. Allowing only two candidates on the ballot ensures that at least the worst one is never elected.
* If a third party could get enough votes to win an election, then voters who would support the nominee could infiltrate one of the two parties by registering as members, and force a win in that party&#x27;s primary. However, pulling this off would take considerable coordination on the part of the supporting voters, especially if half of them preferred to infiltrate the other major party or remain independent. It would also depend on the rules of the major party for how people may become candidates in their primary, and on which registered members may vote in the primary.
* There is a &quot;one person one vote mandate&quot;. If voters could vote in a primary for one candidate, and then sign a petition for another candidate, this would violate that mandate. Some voters might sign a petition for the candidate they want, and then vote in the primary for the candidate who would be easier to beat. Since primary votes are anonymous, and a party therefore cannot remove that voter&#x27;s vote after it is cast, the only remedy is to strike the voter&#x27;s signature on the petition. As for signatures not counting if a voter later votes in a primary, that could be reformed since the political party would know in advance about the signatures if they are filed in time.
* &quot;Sore loser laws&quot;, where a candidate who loses in a primary may not then run as an independent candidate in that same election, stem from contract laws. Similar–minded candidates run in the same primary with the contract that the losers will drop out of the race and support the winner so that they do not split the votes of similar–minded voters and cause the other party&#x27;s nominee to win with 40% of the vote. The need for primaries is primarily because of plurality voting, whose rules state that the candidate receiving the most votes wins, even if not a majority.
* Strict ballot access laws make it difficult for extremists to get on the ballot, since few people would want to sign their petition.

<text>In information theory and statistics, negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality. The concept and phrase &quot;negative entropy&quot; was introduced by Erwin Schrödinger in his 1944 popular-science book &quot;What is Life?&quot; Later, French physicist Léon Brillouin shortened the phrase to &quot;néguentropie&quot; (negentropy). In 1974, Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed replacing the term &quot;negentropy&quot; with syntropy. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician Luigi Fantappiè, who tried to construct a unified theory of biology and physics. Buckminster Fuller tried to popularize this usage, but &quot;negentropy&quot; remains common.

In a note to &quot;What is Life?&quot; Schrödinger explained his use of this phrase.
==Information theory==

In information theory and statistics, negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality. Out of all distributions with a given mean and variance, the normal or Gaussian distribution is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes if and only if the signal is Gaussian.

Negentropy is defined as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the differential entropy of the Gaussian density with the same mean and variance as formula_3 and formula_4 is the differential entropy of formula_3:

:formula_6

Negentropy is used in statistics and signal processing. It is related to network entropy, which is used in independent component analysis.

The negentropy of a distribution is equal to the Kullback–Leibler divergence between formula_3 and a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance as formula_3 (see &quot;&quot; for a proof). In particular, it is always nonnegative.

==Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs&#x27; free energy==

There is a physical quantity closely linked to free energy (free enthalpy), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, Willard Gibbs created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to free enthalpy. On the diagram one can see the quantity called capacity for entropy. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume. In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by Massieu for the isothermal process (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and by then Planck for the isothermal-isobaric process. More recently, the Massieu–Planck thermodynamic potential, known also as &quot;free entropy&quot;, has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of statistical mechanics, applied among the others in molecular biology and thermodynamic non-equilibrium processes.

:: formula_9

::where:
::formula_10 is entropy
::formula_11 is negentropy (Gibbs &quot;capacity for entropy&quot;)
::formula_12 is the Massieu potential
::formula_13 is the partition function
::formula_14 the Boltzmann constant

In particular, mathematically the negentropy (the negative entropy function, in physics interpreted as free entropy) is the convex conjugate of LogSumExp (in physics interpreted as the free energy).

==Brillouin&#x27;s negentropy principle of information==
In 1953, Léon Brillouin derived a general equation stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least formula_15 energy. This is the same energy as the work Leó Szilárd&#x27;s engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book, he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.

<doc id="361359" wikidata="Q731997" url="?curid=361359" title="Promagistrate">
<text>In ancient Rome, a promagistrate () was a person who was granted the power via &quot;prorogation&quot; to act in place of an ordinary magistrate in the field. This was normally &quot;pro consule&quot; or &quot;pro praetore&quot;, that is, in place of a consul or praetor, respectively. This was an expedient development, starting in 327 BC and becoming regular by 241 BC, that was meant to allow consuls and praetors to continue their activities in the field without disruption.

Prorogation created an official with no civilian authority or responsibility in Rome and allowed commanders to retain their position indefinitely, weakening the time-limited check that Romans had over their commanders. Prorogation, by allowing veteran commanders to stay rather than being rotated out for someone with little experience, also helped increase the chances of victory. In the late Republic, politics, often motivated by the ambitions of individuals, decided whose commands were extended. 

Sometimes men who held no elected public office – that is, private citizens (&quot;privati&quot;) – were given &quot;imperium&quot; and prorogued, as justified by perceived military emergencies. In the late republic, this was most exemplified by Pompey, who held a series of promagisterial commands before ever holding a magistracy or even joining the senate. With the acquisition of provinces outside of Italy and the expansion of the &quot;quaestiones perpetuae&quot; (permanent courts), it became normal for the provincial governors to be promagistrates. By the late republic, practically all governors were dispatched , regardless of their last urban magistracy.

The titles &quot;proconsul&quot; and &quot;propraetor&quot; are not used by Livy or literary sources of the republican era. Those Romans did not view a promagistracy as a formal office in the republic but rather as an administrative expedient.

== Legal effect ==

A &quot;provincia&quot; was originally a task (e.g., war with Carthage) assigned to someone, sometimes with geographic boundaries; when such territories were formally annexed, the fixed geographical entity became a &quot;province&quot; in modern terms, but in the early and middle Republic, the &quot;task&quot; was most often a military command within a defined theatre of operations with unclear geographic boundaries.

Prorogation did not create a new commander or even class of general. It merely allowed a magistrate to continue performing duties beyond the expiration of the magistracy. While Livy implies that prorogation extended a magistrate&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot;, this is contradicted in that &quot;imperium&quot; was not time-limited. Cicero, for example, possessed &quot;imperium&quot; even after his governorship of Cilicia expired.

Because &quot;imperium&quot; did not expire, prorogation was simply an extension or reassignment of a commander&#x27;s possession of a &quot;provincia&quot;, something feasible by senatorial decree. Previously, a &quot;provincia&quot; expired with a magistracy; prorogation severed the old tightly-linked connection between magistrate and &quot;provincia&quot;. While normally someone in the theatre or province was prorogued, one could also be prorogued by assigning a someone still possessing &quot;imperium&quot; to new &quot;provincia&quot; (as was the case with two &quot;imperatores&quot; during the Catilinarian conspiracy).

While modern scholars often suppose that prorogation was intended originally to ensure that an experienced commander with hands-on knowledge of the local situation could conclude a successful campaign, in practice the extension of command was subject to &quot;unsteady ad-hoc politics&quot;. And &quot;unusual political influence&quot; was required for prorogations of longer than one year. 

A Roman governor had the right, and was normally expected, to remain in his province until his successor arrived, even when he had not been prorogued. According to the &quot;lex Cornelia de maiestate&quot;, passed following Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship, a governor was then required to give up his province within 30 days. A prorogued magistrate could not exercise his &quot;imperium&quot; within Rome.

The nature of promagisterial &quot;imperium&quot; is also complicated by its relation to the celebrating of a triumph as awarded by the Senate. Before a commander could enter the city limits (&quot;pomerium&quot;) for his triumph, he had to lay aside arms formally and ritually, that is, he had to re-enter society as a civilian. There are several early instances, however, of a commander celebrating a triumph during his two- or three-year term; it is possible that the triumph was held at the completion of his assignment and before he returned to the field with prorogued &quot;imperium&quot;.

== History ==

=== Emergence ===
The literary sources of Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus name a number of commanders in the early republic as proconsuls or propraetors. Modern historians believe the use of these titles is largely anachronistic and also self-contradictory, as Livy notes that the first promagisterial appointment was in 327 BC. In the republic after 367 BC, only three types magistrates held &quot;imperium&quot;: dictators, consuls, and praetors. At first, the appointment of &quot;dictatores&quot; and &quot;magistri equitum&quot; filled the need for additional military commanders. 

The first recorded prorogation and promagistrate was that of the consul Quintus Publilius Philo in 327 BC. The senate ordered Philo, whose consulship was about to expire, to continue to perform his military duties as he was on the verge of capturing Palaepolis (modern day Naples) and completing his &quot;provincia&quot; (assigned task). It &quot;probably seemed imprudent to send a new consul to take over a command that would be completed within days&quot;. Livy reports that legislation was then moved by the tribunes that &quot;when [Quintus Publilius&#x27; term expired] he should continue to manage the campaign &quot;pro consule&quot; until he should bring the war with the Greeks to an end&quot;. This innovation permitted Philo to hold the military authority and responsibility of a magistrate while not actually being one. The Romans did not seem to be too bothered by the legal innovation which occurred, as Philo&#x27;s success was rewarded with a triumph even though his consulship had expired.

In the following decades, it became regular practice to prorogue consuls and prorogation of praetors started in 241 BC. During the Second and Third Samnite Wars (326–290 BC), prorogation became a regular administrative practice that allowed continuity of military command without violating the principle of annual magistracies, or increasing the number of magistrates who held &quot;imperium&quot;. In 307, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus became the second magistrate to have his command prorogued. But in the years 296–95, several prorogations are recorded at once, including four promagistrates who were granted &quot;imperium&quot; while they were private citizens (&quot;privati&quot;). Territorial expansion and increasing militarization drove a recognition that the &quot;emergencies&quot; had become a continual state of affairs, and a regular system of allotting commands developed. 

In this early period, prorogued assignments, like the dictatorship, originated as special military commands, they may at first have been limited in practice to about six months, or the length of the campaigning season.

=== During the Punic Wars ===

Commanders were often prorogued during the First Punic War (264–241 BC). During the Second Punic War, Rome started to assign private citizens both &quot;imperium&quot; (military authority) and assign them to &quot;provincia&quot; (here meaning military tasks). These &quot;privati cum imperio&quot; were unable to triumph, probably due to their lack of an official magistracy. The legal authority for this emerged directly from the sovereign powers of the Roman assemblies who were then able &quot;to select any man[,] whether or not he had ever been elected to office[,] and make him the commander of any &quot;provincia&quot; they wished&quot;. These &quot;privati cum imperio&quot; had titles &quot;pro consule&quot; or &quot;pro praetore&quot;, in place of regular magistrates.

The first instance may have been in 215 BC after the losses at Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae when Marcus Claudius Marcellus was elected suffect consul in the place of Lucius Postumius Albinus, deceased. However, he was forced to resign when the augurs detected flaws in his election; even so, the people passed laws to invest him with &quot;imperium&quot; and assigned him to take a consular army regardless. Some scholars and argue instead that Marcellus&#x27; just-completed praetorship meant he was just prorogued.

The clearest instance is in the assignment of Publius Cornelius Scipio (later &quot;Africanus&quot;) to Spain in 211 BC before he had held any magistracy. After the deaths of his father and uncle in Spain, no consul or praetor wanted to take up the province. The people invested Scipio with the command and the necessary &quot;imperium&quot; and &quot;auspicium militiae&quot; regardless. After Scipio&#x27;s victory in 206 BC, two more &quot;privati cum imperio&quot; were dispatched to the peninsula, which continued under such command until the creation of two new praetors in 197 BC made it possible to send annual magistrates. Generally, prorogation became almost the norm for the &quot;provinciae&quot; of Sicily, Sardinia, Hispania, and the naval fleets due to the lack of sufficient annual magistrates.

The expansion of promagistracies shattering the connection between military command and magisterial office, allowing any aristocrat so empowered by law the power to exercise military authority without any official status within the city&#x27;s normal civilian government. Another impact of this wartime expedience was separating &quot;magisterial precedence&quot; from the magistracy itself, creating something akin to a military rank, evident in the jockeying of magistrates over the specific status of their prorogation: eg, desire to attain the more prestigious &quot;pro consule&quot; status. The close of the wartime crisis and the return of annual governors also dampened the length of prorogations, allowing the senate to regain more granular control over provincial assignments. 

At the beginning, there were two distinct forms of prorogation – per T. Corey Brennan&#x27;s &quot;Praetorship in the Roman republic&quot; – a &quot;prorogatio&quot; before the people to determine whether a provincial command should be extended and a &quot;propagatio&quot; from the senate in other cases. But by the 190s BC, the senate stopped submitting decisions on prorogation of permanent &quot;provinciae&quot; to the people for ratification and eventually all extensions of &quot;imperium&quot; were called &quot;prorogatio&quot;. After this point, the term &quot;prorogatio&quot; became a misnomer, since no &quot;rogatio&quot; (consultation of the people) was involved. This likely emerged because the decision of &quot;whether&quot; to send commanders had been replaced to the question of &quot;who&quot; should be sent, and therefore became a routine staffing decision.

===In the late republic===
The promagistrates take on a new importance with the annexation of Macedonia and the Roman province of Africa in 146 BC. The number of praetors was not increased even though the two new territories were organized as praetorian provinces. For the first time since the 170s, it became impossible for sitting magistrates to govern all the permanent praetorian &quot;provinciae&quot;, which now numbered eight. This point marks the beginning of the era of the so-called &quot;Roman governor&quot;, a post for which there is no single word in the Republic. Promagistracies became fully institutionalised, and even the &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; was sometimes prorogued. Due to the lack of replacement magistrates, governors with established territorial provinces had their tenures increased. The addition of the wealthy Asian province in 133 BC as a bequest of Attalus III put further pressure on the system, again without increasing the number of praetorships:

In one major administrative development for which the career of Marius offers the clearest evidence, praetors now needed to remain in Rome to preside over increased activity in the criminal courts; only after their term were praetors regularly assigned to a province as proconsul or propraetor. The scale of Roman military commitments in annexed territories during the late republic required regular prorogation, since the number of magistrates and ex-magistrates who were both able commanders and willing to accept provincial governorships did not increase proportionally. Emergency grants of &quot;imperium&quot; in the field during the Social War (91–87 BC) made the granting of extra-magisterial command routine. When Sulla assumed the dictatorship in late 82 BC, the territorial provinces alone numbered ten, with possibly six permanent courts to be presided over in the city.

The rise of &quot;popularis&quot; political tactics from the time of Gaius Marius forward also coincided with the creation of &quot;super &quot;provinciae&quot;&quot;, &quot;massive commands in which multiple permanent provinces were incorporated into a single consular provincial assignment&quot; with &quot;proportionately larger military and financial resources&quot;. Pompey, for example, declined a province after his consulship in 70 BC until he was able to convince a friendly tribune to create an enormous command against the pirates in consequence of the in 67 BC and, then, a similarly vast eastern command during the Third Mithridatic War the next year. These super-provinces were traditional in the sense that they were meant to defeat some particular enemy, but the scale of the campaign and the concentration of power under a single commander was unprecedented. The fixed multi-year terms of those campaigns also were unheard of in the earlier Republic; their length detracted from the Senate&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; powers to assign provinces and control the ambition of its members by splitting both the proceeds and glory of single campaigns between multiple commanders.

== Types ==
=== Proconsul ===


=== Propraetor ===

A propraetor was a form of promagistrate, as the name implies, acting in place of a praetor. Initially, praetors who were prorogued continued to act &quot;pro praetore&quot; after their terms, but through the second century, prorogued praetors started to be titled the more prestigious &quot;pro consule&quot; instead. After the time of Sulla, all governors were prorogued &quot;pro consule&quot;. One of the few exceptions to this rule was a senatorial snub against Octavian in 43 BC when he was vested with &quot;imperium&quot; and prorogued &quot;pro praetore&quot;, putting him lower in status than all other promagistrates.

If a governor died in office, it was normal for his quaestor to assume command &quot;pro praetore&quot;. It also became normal for legates during the late republic to be titled &quot;pro praetore&quot; if they were themselves vested with &quot;imperium&quot;. Pompey, for example, received such legates during the campaign against the pirates in consequence of the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot;. During the imperial period, the legates of the emperor were titled &quot;pro praetore&quot;, consistent with late republican practice; the quaestors and legates of the public provinces were by this period similarly granted praetorian &quot;imperium&quot; and likewise titled &quot;pro praetore&quot;.

=== Proquaestor ===

A proquaestor was a person who took up the administrative duties normally adopted by a quaestor. This was normally done in the absence of a questor, usually by death or resignation. In such cases, a governor normally named a member of his staff: for example, Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella named Gaius Verres to serve &quot;pro quaestore&quot; in 80 BC. At other times, ex-quaestors were sent or kept as proquaestor to act as someone&#x27;s quaestor. But more extraordinarily, in the absence of sufficient governors or to complete some specific task, an ex-quaestor could be sent as a governor with the title &quot;pro quaestor pro praetore&quot;. For example, Marcus Porcius Cato was dispatched to Cyprus &quot;pro quaestore pro praetore&quot; to handle the annexation of the island.

=== Procurator ===
The title &quot;procurator&quot; is not related to prorogation and is not a promagistracy. Procurators were originally agents of rich men, later of the emperor, who acted on his patron&#x27;s behalf with regard to financial matters.

<text>A regional airline is a general classification of airline which typically operates scheduled passenger air service, using regional aircraft, between communities lacking sufficient demand or infrastructure to attract mainline flights. In North America, most regional airlines are classified as &quot;fee-for-departure&quot; carriers, operating their revenue flights as codeshare services contracted by one or more major airline partners. A number of regional airlines, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, were classified as commuter airlines in the Official Airline Guide (OAG).

==History==
=== Background ===

Decades before the advent of jet airliners and high-speed, long-range air service, commercial aviation was structured similarly to rail transport networks. In this era, technological limitations on air navigation and propeller-driven aircraft performance imposed strict constraints on the potential length of each flight; some routes covered less than .

As such, airlines structured their services along point-to-point routes with many stops between the originating and terminating air terminals. This system of air transportation effectively forced most airlines to be &quot;regional&quot; in nature, but the lack of distinction among carriers soon began to change with the 1929 launch of Transcontinental Air Transport (T-A-T) in the United States. T-A-T&#x27;s transcontinental &quot;Lindbergh Line&quot; became America&#x27;s first contiguous coast-to-coast air service, and it ushered in a new era of major airlines expanding to operate networks with large footprints. The development of long-range aircraft operated by flag carriers like British Overseas Airways Corporation and Trans-Canada Airlines further normalized the capability of &quot;far and wide&quot; air travel among the traveling public.

===Shifting definition===
&quot;Regional airline&quot; is a flexible term whose meaning has changed substantially over time. What it means today is different than how it has been used in the past. For instance, in the United States, around 1960, the term “regional carrier” denoted the smaller eight of the 12 largest carriers, then known as trunk carriers (or trunk airlines or simply trunks). At the time the four biggest airlines in the United States were known as the Big Four, comprising American, United, TWA and Eastern Air Lines. The other eight trunk carriers were Braniff, Capital, Continental, Delta, National, Northeast, Northwest and Western. Since, at the time, none of these eight had a network approaching the scale of the Big Four, they were known as the regional carriers. This was despite the existence, at the time, of 13 smaller United States scheduled carriers known as local service carriers whose service was arguably far more regional than the “regional” trunks.

So when reading historical sources, it’s important to understand that the term &quot;regional airline&quot; has migrated greatly over time. Sometimes the term has been stretched beyond the point of utility. For instance, in a 1983 article about PBA, Provincetown-Boston Airlines, both Air New England and Air Florida are described as regional airlines. At the time, Air New England was a recently-failed turboprop operator in the northeast USA, while Air Florida was a jet carrier flying from Florida to the northeast, to Latin America and Europe. The two airlines had little in common.

=== Early growth ===
As flag carriers grew to fill the demand of long-range passenger traffic, new and small airlines found niches flying between short and under-served routes to-and-from major airports and more rural destinations. Through the 1960s and 1970s, war surplus designs (notably, the Douglas DC-3) were replaced by higher-performance turboprop or jet-powered designs like the Fokker F27 Friendship and BAC One-Eleven. This extended the range of the regionals dramatically, causing a wave of consolidations between the now overlapping airlines.

In the United States, regional airlines were an important building block of today&#x27;s passenger air system. The U.S. Government encouraged the forming of regional airlines to provide services from smaller communities to larger towns, where air passengers could connect to a larger network.

The original regional airlines (then known as &quot;Local service carriers&quot;) sanctioned by the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1943 to 1950 include:
* Allegheny Airlines
* Arizona Airways
* Bonanza Air Lines
* Central Airlines
* Challenger Airlines
* Empire Air Lines
* Florida Airways
* Lake Central Airlines
* Mid-West Airlines
* Mohawk Airlines
* Monarch Air Lines (merged with Arizona and Challenger to create Frontier in 1950)
* North Central Airlines
* Ozark Airlines
* Parks Air Lines
* Piedmont Airlines
* Pioneer Air Lines
* Southern Airways
* Southwest Airways (renamed Pacific Air Lines in 1958)
* Trans-Texas Airways
* West Coast Airlines
* Wiggins Airways
A history and study of regional airlines was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1994 under the title &quot;Commuter Airlines of the United States&quot;, by R.E.G. Davies and I. E. Quastler.

=== Deregulation era ===
Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the US federal government has continued support of the regional airline sector to ensure many of the smaller and more isolated rural communities remain connected to air services. This is encouraged with the Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to smaller U.S. communities and suburban centers, aiming to maintain year-round service.

Although regional airlines in the United States are often viewed as small, not particularly lucrative &quot;no name&quot; subsidiaries of the mainline airlines, in terms of revenue, many would be designated major airline carrier status based on the only actual definition of &quot;major airline,&quot; in the United States, the definition from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This definition is based solely on annual revenue and not on any other criterion such as average aircraft seating capacity, pilot pay, or number of aircraft in the fleet. It is common in the U.S. to incorrectly associate aircraft size with the Department of Transportation&#x27;s designation of major, national, and regional airline. The only corollary is the Regional Airline Association, an industry trade group, defines &quot;regional airlines&quot; generally as &quot;...operat(ing) short and medium haul scheduled airline service connecting smaller communities with larger cities and connecting hubs. The airlines&#x27; fleet primarily consists of 19 to 68 seat turboprops and 30 to 100 seat regional jets.&quot; To be clear there is no distinction in the Department of Transportation definition of major, national and regional airlines by aircraft size. The definition is based on revenue. The clash of definitions has led to confusion in the media and the public.

=== 1990s–2000s ===
Beginning around 1985, a number of trends have become apparent. Regional aircraft are getting larger, faster, and are flying longer ranges. Additionally, the vast majority of regionals within the United States with more than ten aircraft within their fleet, have lost their individual identities and now serve only as feeders, to Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, or United Airlines major hubs. Regional aircraft in the US have been getting slightly more comfortable with the addition of better ergonomically designed aircraft cabins, and the addition of varying travel classes aboard these aircraft. From small, less than 50-seat &quot;single-class cabin&quot; turboprop, to turbofan regional jet equipment, present day regional airlines provide aircraft such as the higher capacity CRJ700, CRJ900, CRJ1000 series of aircraft and the somewhat larger fuselage Embraer E-Jets. Some of these newer aircraft are capable of flying longer distances with comfort levels that rival and surpass the regional airline equipment of the past.

In the early 1990s, much more advanced turboprop-powered, fuel efficient, and passenger friendly DC-3 type replacement projects such as the 19 passenger Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector and the 34 seat Dornier 328 were undertaken, but met little financial success, partly due to economic downturn in the airline industry resulting from the outbreak of hostilities when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many of the regional airlines operating turboprop equipment such as Delta&#x27;s regional sister Comair airlines in the United States set the course for bypassing entirely the regional turboprops as they became the first to transition to an all-jet regional jet fleet. To a lesser extent in Europe and the United Kingdom this transition, to notably the Embraer or Canadair designs, was well advanced by the late 1990s. This evolution towards jet equipment, brought the independent regional airlines into direct competition with the major airlines, forcing additional consolidation.

To improve on their market penetration, larger airline holding companies rely on operators of smaller aircraft to provide service or added frequency service to some airports. Such airlines, often operating in code-share arrangements with mainline airlines, often completely repaint their aircraft fleet in the mainline airline&#x27;s sub-brand livery. For example, United Express regional airline partner CommutAir branded its entire fleet as United Express. On the other hand, regional airline Gulfstream International Airlines did not brand their aircraft. When Colgan Air was still operating, they branded a handful of aircraft as Colgan Air, but most were branded as Continental Connection, US Airways Express or United Express, with whom it had contractual agreements.

==Business model==
21st century regional airlines are commonly organized in one of two ways.

=== Independent model ===
Operating as an independent airline under their own brand, mostly providing service to small and isolated towns, for whom the airline is the only reasonable link to a larger town. Examples of this are PenAir, which links the remote Aleutian Islands to Anchorage, Alaska, and Mokulele Airlines, which operates in the Hawaiian islands.

=== Fee-for-departure (contract) model ===
As an affiliated airline, contracting with a major airline, operating under their brand name (for example, Endeavor Air operates flights under the Delta Connection brand name for Delta Air Lines), and filling two roles: delivering passengers to the major airline&#x27;s hubs from surrounding towns, and increasing frequency of service on mainline routes during times when demand does not warrant use of large aircraft, known as &quot;commuter flights&quot;.

One of the first independently owned and managed airlines in the world that rebranded its aircraft to match a larger airline&#x27;s brand was Air Alpes of France. During 1974, Air Alpes painted its newly delivered short range regional jets in the livery of Air France.
 NLM&#x27;s KLM style branding does however pre-date the Air France efforts though by a number of years.

The success of the &quot;rebranding&quot; or &quot;pseudo branding&quot; of a much smaller airline into the name recognition of a much larger one soon became clear as passenger numbers soared at Air Alpes, and it was soon decided to paint other aircraft such as the Fokker F-27 into full Air France colours as well.

Many airline passengers find sub-branding very confusing, while many other airline passengers are content to think they are on a mainline or flagship airline&#x27;s aircraft, while in actuality they are far from it. Sub-branding is pretty consistent throughout the airline industry of the United States, with all the regional airlines, mainline airlines, and the regional airline holding companies, as well as the mainline airlines holding companies participating.

== Industry ==

===Labor relations===
On Feb 12th, 2010, a year after the crash of Colgan flight 3407, &quot;Frontline&quot; premiered its WGA Award-winning exposé on the industry entitled &quot;Flying Cheap&quot;. In the program, reporter Miles O&#x27;Brien questioned how the impact of low salaries are having on pilot psyches and how safe this could be for the flying public. When asked to respond to the question, Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association, told &quot;Frontline&quot; that, &quot;...there are many other people who earn less money than that and work more days in these communities that can afford it and do it and do it responsibly.&quot;

===Future===
The Small Aircraft Transportation System outlined a new vision for regional mobility, based on services built out of small general aviation aircraft and VLJs (very light jets) with advanced automation. This vision failed to materialize due to its primary focus on rural mobility and a lack of clear and viable business case.
With the introduction of air taxi services and very light jets, city pair links to smaller communities lacking regional connections could become more common. This opportunities could become commercially viable with advanced air mobility and the introduction of electric aircraft.

In some parts of the world, regional airlines face competition from high-speed rail and also coach (bus) services with airlines sometimes replacing feeder services through air rail alliances and contracts with bus companies (e.g., Landline between Philadelphia International Airport and Atlantic City International Airport).

===North America===

In North America, regional airlines are operated primarily to bring passengers to the major hubs, where they will connect for longer-distance flights on the national airlines also known as flagship carriers. The smallest regional carriers have become known as feeder airlines. The separate corporate structure allows the company to operate under different pay schedules, typically paying much less than their mainline owners.

Many large North American airlines, have established operational relationships with one or more regional airline companies. Their aircraft often use the aircraft livery for the company they are operating flights for. These airlines can be subsidiaries of the major airline or fly under a code sharing agreement or operating through capacity purchase agreements, with the mainline parent company financing the aircraft for the regional airline, and then placing the aircraft with the regional for very little cost. An example would be Envoy Air, which is fully owned by American Airlines Group and does business as American Eagle.

Many of these large regional airlines have joined the lobbying group Regional Airline Association. This association lobbies purely for the financial interest of the corporate bodies it constitutes, not the employees of those airlines.

==== Canada ====
In Canada there are a number of regional airlines. Some of them focus on Canadian Arctic and First Nations communities, while others operate regional flights on behalf of a larger carrier, similar to their American counterparts. Some of these airlines and brands include:
* Air Canada Express operated by Jazz
* Air Creebec
* Air Tindi
* Bearskin Airlines
* Canadian North
* Pacific Coastal Airlines
* Pascan Aviation
* Perimeter Aviation
* Porter Airlines
* Wasaya Airways
* WestJet Encore (operating for WestJet)

==== United States ====
The trend of branding regional airlines to match the mainline airlines, has led to just three major sub-brands in the United States: American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express. They are the post-deregulation survivors of the multiple bankruptcies and mergers of the major, legacy, mainline airlines.

These regional brands are a form of a virtual airline, with the regional airline paid to staff, operate and maintain aircraft used on flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by a partner mainline airline. This practice allows the mainline carrier to use outsourced labor at smaller stations, to reduce costs. In 2011, 61% of all advertised flights for American, Delta, United and US Airways were operated by their regional brands. This figure was only 40% in 2000.

=====Regional airlines=====
The formerly small regional airlines have grown substantially, through mergers or by the use of a holding company, as pioneered by AMR Corporation in 1982. AMR created the AMR Eagle Holding Corporation which unified its wholly owned American Eagle Airlines and Executive Airlines under one division, but still maintained the regional airlines&#x27; operating certificates and personnel separate from each other and American Airlines.

The most significant regional airlines in the United States, are:

Mainline carrier-owned
* Alaska Air Group
** Horizon Air
*American Airlines Group
** Envoy Air
** Piedmont Airlines
** PSA Airlines
*Delta Air Lines
** Endeavor Air

Independent contractors
* Air Wisconsin
* CommuteAir
* GoJet Airlines
* Mesa Airlines
* Republic Airways
* SkyWest Airlines
=====Smaller commuter airlines=====
The evolution and chronological history of the commuter side of the regional airline industry can be defined by a number of dates prior to the end of the era of airline regulation by the Civil Aeronautics Board of the United States. Among these significant dates are:

: 1967 – CAB makes exemption for airlines, starting with the local service carrier Allegheny Airlines; to suspend operating a route with large aircraft due to a lack of passenger traffic to do so profitably, provided the airline operating the CAB awarded route substitutes its operation with other equipment and maintains responsibility the route is served. As such this &quot;exemption&quot; allowed the development of the Allegheny Commuter System and the subcontracting of Henson Airlines to fulfill Allegheny&#x27;s CAB route award obligations.
: 1969 and before – aircraft falling below the weight of were considered small aircraft and thus, not subject to the certification requirements of the CAB.
: 1969 and after – the CAB officially defined airlines with aircraft of no more than of maximum gross weight as commuter airlines
: 1972 – relaxations of the CAB regulations permitted commuter aircraft to carry 30 passengers and a payload of .
: 1977 – Official list of U.S. Commuter Airlines in the year prior to airline deregulation
: 1978 – during the sunset of the CAB regulation the size of commuters were permitted to grow to 60 passengers and of freight.
: 1978 and onwards the airline industry was officially deregulated by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978
: 1981 – the United States governmental lobbying body of this industry, known as the Commuter Airline Association, changes its name to the Regional Airline Association.

List of Commuter Airlines in 1977 Prior to Airline Deregulation:

* Air Carolina
* Air Midwest
* Air New England
* Air Wisconsin

Some of the lesser known smaller brands used by the regional airlines and their parent companies were:

* PWExpress, a regional airline brand of the regional airline named Pacific Wings, IATA code (LW) which is owned by Pacific Air Holdings company
* New Mexico Airlines, a regional airline brand of Pacific Wings, which is owned by Pacific Air Holdings company
* Nantucket Airlines, a brand operated by regional airline Cape Air which is wholly owned by the regional airline holding company Hyannis Air Service.
* Ravn Connect, a commuter /air taxi brand operated by the regional airlines owned by the HoTH parent company in association with Corvus Airlines which operates under the Ravn Alaska marketing brand and is also owned by HoTH.

=== Europe ===

European regional airlines serve the intra-continental sector in Europe. They connect cities to major airports and to other cities, avoiding the need for passengers to make transfers.

For example, BA CityFlyer a regional subsidiary of British Airways uses the basic &quot;Chatham Dockyard Union Flag&quot; livery of its parent company and flies between domestic and European cities.

Some of Europe&#x27;s regional airlines are subsidiaries of national air carriers, though there remains a strong entrepreneurial sector of independents. They are based on business models ranging from the traditional full service airline to low cost carriers. Innovations include one where the passenger is required to join a membership club before being allowed to fly.

Some examples of European regional airlines include:

*Air Dolomiti
*Air France Hop
*Air Nostrum
* Alitalia CityLiner
* Aurigny
*BA CityFlyer
* Blue Islands
*CityJet
* Eastern Airways
*KLM Cityhopper
*Loganair
*Lufthansa CityLine
*TAP Express
*Twin Jet

=== Asia ===
;India
India has many regional carriers operating currently. Some of these operate under the government&#x27;s UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme).

* Alliance Air, a former subsidiary of India&#x27;s former state-owned flag carrier, Air India.
Note:- Alliance Air is still a state-owned airline, whereas Air India is private. 
* Star Air
* Fly91
* FlyBig
* IndiaOne Air
;Thailand
*Bangkok Airways has won World&#x27;s Best Regional Airline from Skytrax three years in a row in 2015, 2016 and 2017
*Thai Smile

=== Australia ===
Australia has an association for regional airline, the Regional Aviation of Australia. More than 2 million passengers and 23 million kg of cargo are involved each year.
* Airnorth
* Alliance Airlines
* FlyPelican
* Fly Tiwi
* King Island Airlines
* Par Avion
* QantasLink, the regional arm of Qantas
* Rex Airlines, the largest regional airline outside of Qantas, servicing routes in several states and territories.
* Sharp Airlines
* Skytrans Airlines
* Virgin Australia Regional Airlines

==Former regional airlines==
Post airline deregulation, airlines sought added market share and to do this they sought partnerships with regional and small airlines to feed traffic into the airline hub.

Initially these tie ups tended to use small 15 -19 seat aircraft, which did not have a reputation of passenger comfort, or safe reliable operations, by small often under capitalized tiny airline operators.

To create a common tie and what appeared to be seamless to the air traveler, major carriers marketed in advertising and soon had much smaller airlines paint their small and what was often described as puddle-jumper aircraft, in the image and branding colors of the much larger mainline partner. This was to give the appearance of reliability. Over time these regional aircraft grew in size as airline hubs expanded and competition dwindled among the major carriers.

Below is a list of many of the regional brands that evolved when regional airlines were advertised to look like the major airlines.

=== Marketing brands with regional-type aircraft ===

<text>The Swiss franc, or simply the franc, is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It is also legal tender in the Italian exclave of Campione d&#x27;Italia which is surrounded by Swiss territory. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) issues banknotes and the federal mint Swissmint issues coins.

It is also designated through currency signs &quot;Fr.&quot; (in German language), &quot;fr.&quot; (in French, Italian, Romansh languages), as well as in any other language, or internationally as &quot;CHF&quot; which stands for Franc. This acronym also serves as the ISO 4217 currency code, used by banks and financial institutions.

The smaller denomination, a hundredth of a franc, is a (Rp.) in German, (c.) in French, (ct.) in Italian, and (rp.) in Romansh.

The official symbols &quot;Fr.&quot; (German symbol) and &quot;fr.&quot; (Latin languages) are widely used by businesses and advertisers, also for the English language. According to &quot;Art. 1 SR/RS 941.101&quot; of the federal law collection the internationally official abbreviation – besides the national languages – however is &quot;CHF&quot;, also in English; respective guides also request to use the ISO 4217 code. The use of &quot;SFr.&quot; for &quot;Swiss Franc&quot; and &quot;fr.sv.&quot; are outdated. As previously indicated Latinate &quot;CH&quot; stands for ; given the different languages used in Switzerland, Latin is used for language-neutral inscriptions on its coins.

==History==

===Before the Helvetic Republic===

Before 1798, about 75 entities were making coins in Switzerland, including the 25 cantons and half-cantons, 16 cities, and abbeys, resulting in about 860 different coins in circulation, with different values, denominations and monetary systems. However, the origins of a majority of these currencies can be traced to either the French livre tournois (the predecessor of the French franc) or the South German gulden of the 17th century. The new Swiss currencies emerged in the 18th century after Swiss cantons did not follow the pace of depreciations which occurred in France and Germany. However, they mostly existed only in small change as they were little more than community currency, current in one canton but not in the other, and foreign coins like French francs and kronenthalers were more recognized as currency all over Switzerland.

A high-level summary of existing currencies at the end of the 18th century is shown below, including their equivalents in terms of the French écu of 26.67 g fine silver, the South German kronenthaler of 25.71 g fine silver, and Swiss francs of 4.5 g fine silver.

The livre of Bern and most western Swiss cantons like Basel, Aargau, Fribourg, Vaud, Valais, Lausanne, Neuchâtel and Solothurn originated from the French livre tournois.
* The livre was divided into 20 sols, 10 batzen or 40 kreuzer.
* After 1690, 30 Bern batzen equated to either 
** a German Reichsthaler (25.984 g fine silver) worth 2 gulden or 120 kreuzer, or
** a French Louis d&#x27;Argent, equivalent to the Spanish dollar (24.93 g fine silver), worth 3 livres tournois or 60 sols.
* After 1726, the French écu (&quot;laubthaler&quot;) of  g fine silver was valued at 4 livres or 40 batzen (vs 6 livres tournois in France).
* After 1815, the German kronenthaler (&quot;Brabant thaler&quot;) of  g fine silver was valued at 3.9 livres or 39 batzen (in Neuchâtel, 4.1 livres).
* This livre or of écu was the model for the frank of the Helvetic Republic of 1798–1847.
* Currencies identical to this standard include the Berne thaler, Basel thaler, Fribourg gulden, Neuchâtel gulden, Solothurn thaler and Valais thaler.

Geneva had its own currency, the , with florins equal to the &quot;livre courant&quot;. After 1641, the Spanish dollar was worth florins or 3 livres. Afterwards, the écu was valued at florins or livres, while the kronenthaler was valued at florins or livres. See also Geneva thaler and Geneva genevoise.

Many currencies of central and eastern Switzerland originated from the South German gulden. It was divided into 40 schilling or 60 kreuzer, and the thaler was worth 2 gulden. After 1690, this gulden was worth a Reichsthaler specie, or 12.992 g fine silver. After 1730, the different guilders of Southern Germany and Switzerland fragmented under varying rates of depreciation. The South German gulden, worth a Cologne mark (233.856 g) of fine silver, also applied to the Swiss cantons of St. Gallen, Appenzell, Schaffhausen and Thurgau. The French écu was valued at 2.8 gulden, while the kronenthaler was valued at 2.7 gulden. See St. Gallen thaler.

The cantons of Zurich, Schwyz and Glarus, however, maintained a stronger gulden worth a Cologne mark of fine silver. The French écu was valued at gulden, while the kronenthaler was valued at gulden; see Zürich thaler and Schwyz gulden. On the other hand, the central Swiss cantons of Luzern, Uri, Zug and Unterwalden maintained a weaker gulden vs the South German gulden. The French écu was valued at 3 gulden, while the kronenthaler was valued at gulden (see Luzern gulden).

===Helvetic Republic to Regeneration, 1798–1847===
In 1798, the Helvetic Republic introduced the &quot;franc&quot; or &quot;frank&quot;, modelled on the Bern livre worth the écu, subdivided into 10 &quot;batzen&quot; or 100 &quot;rappen (centimes)&quot;. It contained grams of fine silver and was initially worth livres tournois or 1.48 French francs.

This franc was issued until the end of the Helvetic Republic in 1803, but served as the model for the currencies of several cantons in the Mediation period (1803–1814). These 19 cantonal currencies were the Appenzell frank, Argovia frank, Basel frank, Berne frank, Fribourg frank, Geneva franc, Glarus frank, Graubünden frank, Luzern frank, St. Gallen frank, Schaffhausen frank, Schwyz frank, Solothurn frank, Thurgau frank, Ticino franco, Unterwalden frank, Uri frank, Vaud franc, and Zürich frank.
After 1815, the restored Swiss Confederacy attempted to simplify the system of currencies once again. As of 1820, a total of 8,000 distinct coins were current in Switzerland: those issued by cantons, cities, abbeys, and principalities or lordships, mixed with surviving coins of the Helvetic Republic and the pre-1798 Helvetic Republic. In 1825, the cantons of Bern, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Aargau, and Vaud formed a monetary &quot;concordate&quot;, issuing standardised coins, the so-called &quot;Konkordanzbatzen&quot;, still carrying the coat of arms of the issuing canton, but interchangeable and identical in value. The reverse side of the coin displayed a Swiss cross with the letter C in the center.

===Franc of the Swiss Confederation, 1850–present===
The &quot;Konkordanzbatzen&quot; among the Swiss cantons agreeing on an exclusive issue of currency in francs and batzen failed to replace the over 8,000 different coins and notes in circulation. Despite introduction of the first Swiss franc, the South German kronenthaler became the more desirable coin to use in the 19th century, and it was still quoted in pre-1798 currency equivalents. Furthermore, less than 15% of Swiss money in circulation was in local currency, since French and German gold and silver trade coins proved to be more desirable means of exchange. A final problem was that the first Swiss franc was based on the French écu which was being phased out by France in the 19th century.

To solve this problem, the new Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848 specified that the federal government would be the only entity allowed to issue money in Switzerland. This was followed two years later by the first Federal Coinage Act, passed by the Federal Assembly on 7 May 1850, which introduced the franc as the monetary unit of Switzerland.

The Swiss franc was introduced at par with the French franc, at 4.5 g fine silver or g = 0.29032 g fine gold (ratio 15.5). The currencies of the Swiss cantons were converted to Swiss francs by first restating their equivalents in German kronenthaler (&quot;écu brabant&quot;) of grams fine silver, and then to Swiss francs at the rate of 7 &quot;écu brabant&quot; = 40 Swiss francs. The first franc worth th the French écu was converted at 1.4597 Swiss francs.
In 1865, France, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland formed the Latin Monetary Union, in which they agreed to value their national currencies to a standard of 4.5 grams of fine silver or 0.290322 grams fine gold, equivalent to US$1 = CHF 5.1826 until 1934. Even after the monetary union faded away in the 1920s and officially ended in 1927, the Swiss franc remained on that standard until 27 September 1936, when it suffered its sole devaluation during the Great Depression. Following the devaluations of the British pound, U.S. dollar and French franc, the Swiss franc was devalued 30% to 0.20322 grams fine gold, equivalent to US$1 = CHF 4.37295. In 1945, Switzerland joined the Bretton Woods system with its exchange rate to the dollar fixed until 1970.

The Swiss franc has historically been considered a safe-haven currency, with a legal requirement that a minimum of 40% be backed by gold reserves. However, this link to gold, which dated from the 1920s, was terminated on 1 May 2000 following a referendum, making the franc fiat money. By March 2005, following a gold-selling program, the Swiss National Bank held 1,290 tonnes of gold in reserves, which equated to 20% of its assets.

In November 2014, the referendum on the &quot;Swiss Gold Initiative&quot;, which proposed a restoration of 20% gold backing for the Swiss franc, was voted down.

====2011–2014: Big movements and capping====
The onset of the Greek sovereign debt crisis resulted in a strong appreciation in the value of the Swiss franc, past US$1.10 (CHF 0.91 per USD) in March 2011, to US$1.20 (CHF 0.833 per USD) in June 2011, and to US$1.30 (CHF 0.769 per USD) in August 2011. This prompted the Swiss National Bank to boost the franc&#x27;s liquidity to try to counter its &quot;massive overvaluation&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; argued that its Big Mac Index in July 2011 indicated an overvaluation of 98% over the dollar, and cited Swiss companies releasing profit warnings and threatening to move operations out of the country due to the strength of the franc. Demand for francs and franc-denominated assets was so strong that nominal short-term Swiss interest rates became negative.

On 6 September 2011, the day after the franc traded at 1.11 CHF/€ and appeared headed to parity with the euro, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 CHF to the euro (&#x27;capping&#x27; the franc&#x27;s appreciation), saying &quot;the value of the franc is a threat to the economy&quot;, and that it was &quot;prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities&quot;. In response to this announcement the franc fell against the euro from 1.11 to 1.20 CHF, against the U.S. dollar from 0.787 to 0.856 CHF, and against all 16 of the most active currencies on the same day. It was the largest plunge of the franc ever against the euro.

The intervention stunned currency traders, since the franc had long been regarded as a safe haven. The SNB had previously set an exchange rate target in 1978 against the Deutsche mark and maintained it, although at the cost of high inflation. Until mid-January 2015, the franc continued to trade below the target level set by the SNB, though the ceiling was broken at least once on 5 April 2012, albeit briefly.

====End of capping====
On 18 December 2014, the Swiss central bank introduced a negative interest rate on bank deposits to support its CHF ceiling. However, with the euro declining in value over the following weeks, in a move dubbed &quot;Francogeddon&quot; for its effect on markets, the Swiss National Bank abandoned the ceiling on 15 January 2015, and the franc promptly increased in value compared with the euro by 30%, although this only lasted a few minutes before part of the increase was reversed. The move was not announced in advance and resulted in &quot;turmoil&quot; in stock and currency markets. By the close of trading that day, the franc was up 23% against the euro and 21% against the US dollar. The full daily appreciation of the franc was equivalent to $31,000 per single futures contract: more than the market had moved collectively in the previous thousand days. The key CHF interest rate was also lowered from −0.25% to −0.75%, meaning depositors would be paying an increased fee to keep their funds in a Swiss bank account. This devaluation of the euro against the franc was expected to hurt Switzerland&#x27;s large export industry. The Swatch Group, for example, saw its shares drop 15% (in Swiss franc terms) with the announcements so that the share price may have increased on that day in terms of other major currencies.

The large and unexpected jump caused major losses for some currency traders. Alpari, a Russian-owned spread betting firm established in the UK, temporarily declared insolvency before announcing its desire to be acquired (and later denied rumours of an acquisition) by FXCM. FXCM was bailed out by its parent company. Saxo Bank of Denmark reported losses on 19 January 2015. New Zealand foreign exchange broker Global Brokers NZ announced it &quot;could no longer meet New Zealand regulators&#x27; minimum capital requirements&quot; and terminated its business.

==Coins==
===Coins before the Helvetic Republic===
Coins before 1700 were based on either the French livre tournois system (in Louis d&#x27;Argent, Louis d&#x27;Or and fractions) or the South German gulden system (in Reichsthalers, florins and fractions). After 1700 Swiss cantonal currencies diverged from the value of the French and German units. However, they mostly existed only in small change as they were a mere community currency, current in one canton but not in the other, and foreign coins like French francs and Brabant dollars were more recognized as currency all over Switzerland.

===Coins of the Helvetic Republic===

Between 1798 and 1803, billon coins were issued in denominations of 1 centime, batzen, and 1 batzen. Silver coins were issued for 10, 20 and 40 batzen (also denominated 4 francs), matching with French coins worth , and 1 écu. Gold 16- and 32-franc coins were issued in 1800, also matching with French coins worth 24 and 48 livres tournois.

===Coins of the Swiss Confederation===
In 1850, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 centime, 2 centimes, 5 centimes, 10 centimes 20 centimes, franc, 1 franc, 2 francs, and 5 francs. The 1 centime and 2 centime coins were struck in bronze; the 5 centimes, 10 centime and 20 centime in billon (with 5% to 15% silver content); and the franc, 1 franc, 2 franc and 5 franc in .900 fine silver. Between 1860 and 1863, .800 fine silver was used, before the standard used in France of .835 fineness was adopted for all silver coins except the 5 francs (which remained .900 fineness) in 1875. In 1879, billon was replaced by cupronickel in the 5 centime and 10 centime coins and by nickel in the 20 centime piece. Gold coins in denominations of 10, 20, and 100 francs, known as Vreneli, circulated until 1936.

Both world wars only had a small effect on the Swiss coinage, with brass and zinc coins temporarily being issued. In 1931, the mass of the 5 franc coin was reduced from 25 grams to 15, with the silver content reduced to .835 fineness. The next year, nickel replaced cupronickel in the 5 centime and 10 centime coins.

In the late 1960s, the prices of internationally traded commodities rose significantly. A silver coin&#x27;s metal value exceeded its monetary value, and many were being sent abroad for melting, which prompted the federal government to make this practice illegal. The statute was of little effect, and the melting of francs only subsided when the collectible value of the remaining francs again exceeded their material value.

The 1 centime coin was still produced until 2006, albeit in ever decreasing quantities, but its importance declined. Those who could justify the use of 1 centime coins for monetary purposes could obtain them at face value; any other user (such as collectors) had to pay an additional four centimes per coin to cover the production costs, which had exceeded the actual face value of the coin for many years. The coin fell into disuse in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but was only officially fully withdrawn from circulation and declared to be no longer legal tender on 1 January 2007. The long-forgotten 2 centime coin, not minted since 1974, was demonetized on 1 January 1978.

The designs of the coins have changed very little since 1879. Among the notable changes were new designs for the 5 francs coins in 1888, 1922, 1924 (minor), and 1931 (mostly just a size reduction). A new design for the bronze coins was used from 1948. Coins depicting a ring of stars (such as the 1 franc coin seen beside this paragraph) were altered from 22 stars to 23 stars in 1983; since the stars represent the Swiss cantons, the design was updated when in 1979 Jura seceded from the Canton of Bern and became the 23rd canton of the Swiss Confederation.
The 10 centime coins from 1879 onwards (except the years 1918–19 and 1932–1939) have had the same composition, size, and design to present and are still legal tender and found in circulation. For this, the coin entered the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest original currency in circulation.
All Swiss coins are language-neutral with respect to Switzerland&#x27;s four national languages, featuring only numerals, the abbreviation &quot;Fr.&quot; for franc, and the Latin phrases or (depending on the denomination) or the inscription &quot;Libertas&quot; (Roman goddess of liberty) on the small coins. The name of the artist is present on the coins with the standing Helvetia and the herder.

In addition to these general-circulation coins, numerous series of commemorative coins have been issued, as well as silver and gold coins. These coins are no longer legal tender, but can in theory be exchanged at face value at post offices, and at national and cantonal banks, although their metal or collectors&#x27; value equals or exceeds their face value.


==Banknotes==
In 1907, the Swiss National Bank took over the issuance of banknotes from the cantons and various banks. It introduced denominations of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 francs. Twenty-franc notes were introduced in 1911, followed by 5-franc notes in 1913. In 1914, the Federal Treasury issued paper money in denominations of 5, 10 and 20 francs. These notes were issued in three different versions: French, German and Italian. The State Loan Bank also issued 25-franc notes that year. In 1952, the national bank ceased issuing 5-franc notes but introduced 10-franc notes in 1955. In 1996, 200-franc notes were introduced whilst the 500-franc note was discontinued.

Nine series of banknotes have been printed by the Swiss National Bank, seven of which have been released for use by the general public, the fourth and seventh being reserved and never issued. The sixth series from 1976, designed by Ernst and , depicted persons from the world of science.
This series was recalled on 1 May 2000 and is no longer legal tender, but notes can still be exchanged for valid ones of the same face value at any National Bank branch or authorized agent, or mailed in by post to the National Bank in exchange for a bank account deposit. The exchange program originally was due to end on 30 April 2020, after which sixth-series notes would lose all value. As of 2016, 1.1 billion francs&#x27; worth of sixth-series notes had not yet been exchanged, even though they had not been legal tender for 16 years and only 4 more years remained to exchange them. To avoid having to expire such large amounts of money in 2020, the Federal Council (cabinet) and National Bank proposed in April 2017 to remove the time limit on exchanges for the sixth and future recalled series. As of 2020, this proposal was enacted, so old banknote series will not expire.

The seventh series was printed in 1984, but kept as a &quot;reserve series&quot;, ready to be used if, for example, wide counterfeiting of the current series suddenly happened. When the Swiss National Bank decided to develop new security features and to abandon the concept of a reserve series, the details of the seventh series were released and the printed notes were destroyed. 
The eighth series of banknotes was designed by around the theme of the arts and released starting in 1995. In addition to its new vertical design, this series was different from the previous one on several counts. Probably the most important difference from a practical point of view was that the seldom-used 500-franc note was replaced by a new 200-franc note; this new note has indeed proved more successful than the old 500-franc note. The base colours of the new notes were kept similar to the old ones, except that the 20-franc note was changed from blue to red to prevent a frequent confusion with the 100-franc note, and that the 10-franc note was changed from red to yellow. The size of the notes was changed as well, with all notes from the eighth series having the same height (74 mm), while the widths were changed as well, still increasing with the value of the notes. The new series contain many more security features than the previous ones; many of them are now visibly displayed and have been widely advertised, in contrast with the previous series for which most of the features were kept secret.

All banknotes are quadrilingual, displaying all information in the four national languages. With the eighth series, the banknotes depicting a Germanophone person have German and Romansch on the same side as the picture, whereas banknotes depicting a Francophone or an Italophone person have French and Italian on the same side as the picture. The reverse has the other two languages.

When the fifth series lost its validity at the end of April 2000, the banknotes that had not been exchanged represented a total value of 244.3 million Swiss francs; in accordance with Swiss law, this amount was transferred to the Swiss Fund for Emergency Losses in the Case of Non-insurable Natural Disasters.

In February 2005, a competition was announced for the design of the ninth series, then planned to be released around 2010 on the theme &quot;Switzerland open to the world&quot;. The results were announced in November 2005. The National Bank selected the designs of Swiss graphic designer Manuela Pfrunder as the basis of the new series. The first denomination to be issued was the 50-franc note on 12 April 2016. It was followed by the 20-franc note (17 May 2017), the 10-franc note (18 October 2017), the 200-franc note (15 August 2018), the 1000-franc note (5 March 2019), and the 100-franc note (12 September 2019).

All banknotes from the eighth series were withdrawn on 30 April 2021, but, like banknotes of the sixth series withdrawn in 2000, remain indefinitely redeemable at the Swiss National Bank.
==Circulation==

The Swiss franc is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and also legal tender in the Italian exclave of Campione d&#x27;Italia. Although not formally legal tender in the German exclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein (the sole legal currency is the euro), it is in wide daily use there; with many prices quoted in Swiss francs. The Swiss franc is the only version of the franc still issued in Europe.

As of March 2010, the total value of released Swiss coins and banknotes was 49.664 billion Swiss francs.
Combinations of up to 100 circulating Swiss coins (not including special or commemorative coins) are legal tender; banknotes are legal tender for any amount.

<text>In mathematics, a line bundle expresses the concept of a line that varies from point to point of a space. For example, a curve in the plane having a tangent line at each point determines a varying line: the &quot;tangent bundle&quot; is a way of organising these. More formally, in algebraic topology and differential topology, a line bundle is defined as a &quot;vector bundle&quot; of rank 1.

Line bundles are specified by choosing a one-dimensional vector space for each point of the space in a continuous manner. In topological applications, this vector space is usually real or complex. The two cases display fundamentally different behavior because of the different topological properties of real and complex vector spaces: If the origin is removed from the real line, then the result is the set of 1×1 invertible real matrices, which is homotopy-equivalent to a discrete two-point space by contracting the positive and negative reals each to a point; whereas removing the origin from the complex plane yields the 1×1 invertible complex matrices, which have the homotopy type of a circle.

From the perspective of homotopy theory, a real line bundle therefore behaves much the same as a fiber bundle with a two-point fiber, that is, like a double cover. A special case of this is the orientable double cover of a differentiable manifold, where the corresponding line bundle is the determinant bundle of the tangent bundle (see below). The Möbius strip corresponds to a double cover of the circle (the θ → 2θ mapping) and by changing the fiber, can also be viewed as having a two-point fiber, the unit interval as a fiber, or the real line.

Complex line bundles are closely related to circle bundles. There are some celebrated ones, for example the Hopf fibrations of spheres to spheres.

In algebraic geometry, an invertible sheaf (i.e., locally free sheaf of rank one) is often called a line bundle.

Every line bundle arises from a divisor under the following conditions:

:(I) If formula_1 is a reduced and irreducible scheme, then every line bundle comes from a divisor.
:(II) If formula_1 is a projective scheme then the same statement holds.

==The tautological bundle on projective space==

One of the most important line bundles in algebraic geometry is the tautological line bundle on projective space. The projectivization formula_3 of a vector space formula_4 over a field formula_5 is defined to be the quotient of formula_6 by the action of the multiplicative group formula_7. Each point of formula_3 therefore corresponds to a copy of formula_7, and these copies of formula_7 can be assembled into a formula_7-bundle over formula_3. But formula_7 differs from formula_5 only by a single point, and by adjoining that point to each fiber, we get a line bundle on formula_3. This line bundle is called the tautological line bundle. This line bundle is sometimes denoted formula_16 since it corresponds to the dual of the Serre twisting sheaf formula_17.

===Maps to projective space===
Suppose that formula_1 is a space and that formula_19 is a line bundle on formula_1. A global section of formula_19 is a function formula_22 such that if formula_23 is the natural projection, then formula_24. In a small neighborhood formula_25 in formula_1 in which formula_19 is trivial, the total space of the line bundle is the product of formula_25 and the underlying field formula_5, and the section formula_30 restricts to a function formula_31. However, the values of formula_30 depend on the choice of trivialization, and so they are determined only up to multiplication by a nowhere-vanishing function.

Global sections determine maps to projective spaces in the following way: Choosing formula_33 not all zero points in a fiber of formula_19 chooses a fiber of the tautological line bundle on formula_35, so choosing formula_33 non-simultaneously vanishing global sections of formula_19 determines a map from formula_1 into projective space formula_35. This map sends the fibers of formula_19 to the fibers of the dual of the tautological bundle. More specifically, suppose that formula_41 are global sections of formula_19. In a small neighborhood formula_25 in formula_1, these sections determine formula_5-valued functions on formula_25 whose values depend on the choice of trivialization. However, they are determined up to &quot;simultaneous&quot; multiplication by a non-zero function, so their ratios are well-defined. That is, over a point formula_47, the values formula_48are not well-defined because a change in trivialization will multiply them each by a non-zero constant λ. But it will multiply them by the &quot;same&quot; constant λ, so the homogeneous coordinates formula_49 are well-defined as long as the sections formula_50 do not simultaneously vanish at formula_47. Therefore, if the sections never simultaneously vanish, they determine a form formula_52 which gives a map from formula_1 to formula_35, and the pullback of the dual of the tautological bundle under this map is formula_19. In this way, projective space acquires a universal property.

The universal way to determine a map to projective space is to map to the projectivization of the vector space of all sections of formula_19. In the topological case, there is a non-vanishing section at every point which can be constructed using a bump function which vanishes outside a small neighborhood of the point. Because of this, the resulting map is defined everywhere. However, the codomain is usually far, far too big to be useful. The opposite is true in the algebraic and holomorphic settings. Here the space of global sections is often finite dimensional, but there may not be any non-vanishing global sections at a given point. (As in the case when this procedure constructs a Lefschetz pencil.) In fact, it is possible for a bundle to have no non-zero global sections at all; this is the case for the tautological line bundle. When the line bundle is sufficiently ample this construction verifies the Kodaira embedding theorem.

==Determinant bundles==

In general if formula_4 is a vector bundle on a space formula_1, with constant fibre dimension formula_59, the formula_59-th exterior power of formula_4 taken fibre-by-fibre is a line bundle, called the determinant line bundle. This construction is in particular applied to the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. The resulting determinant bundle is responsible for the phenomenon of tensor densities, in the sense that for an orientable manifold it has a nonvanishing global section, and its tensor powers with any real exponent may be defined and used to &#x27;twist&#x27; any vector bundle by tensor product.

The same construction (taking the top exterior power) applies to a finitely generated projective module formula_62 over a Noetherian domain and the resulting invertible module is called the determinant module of formula_62.

==Characteristic classes, universal bundles and classifying spaces==
The first Stiefel–Whitney class classifies smooth real line bundles; in particular, the collection of (equivalence classes of) real line bundles are in correspondence with elements of the first cohomology with formula_64 coefficients; this correspondence is in fact an isomorphism of abelian groups (the group operations being tensor product of line bundles and the usual addition on cohomology). Analogously, the first Chern class classifies smooth complex line bundles on a space, and the group of line bundles is isomorphic to the second cohomology class with integer coefficients. However, bundles can have equivalent smooth structures (and thus the same first Chern class) but different holomorphic structures. The Chern class statements are easily proven using the exponential sequence of sheaves on the manifold.

One can more generally view the classification problem from a homotopy-theoretic point of view. There is a universal bundle for real line bundles, and a universal bundle for complex line bundles. According to general theory about classifying spaces, the heuristic is to look for contractible spaces on which there are group actions of the respective groups formula_65 and formula_66, that are free actions. Those spaces can serve as the universal principal bundles, and the quotients for the actions as the classifying spaces formula_67. In these cases we can find those explicitly, in the infinite-dimensional analogues of real and complex projective space.

Therefore the classifying space formula_68 is of the homotopy type of formula_69, the real projective space given by an infinite sequence of homogeneous coordinates. It carries the universal real line bundle; in terms of homotopy theory that means that any real line bundle formula_19 on a CW complex formula_1 determines a &quot;classifying map&quot; from formula_1 to formula_69, making formula_19 a bundle isomorphic to the pullback of the universal bundle. This classifying map can be used to define the Stiefel-Whitney class of formula_19, in the first cohomology of formula_1 with formula_64 coefficients, from a standard class on formula_69.

In an analogous way, the complex projective space formula_79 carries a universal complex line bundle. In this case classifying maps give rise to the first Chern class of formula_1, in formula_81 (integral cohomology).

There is a further, analogous theory with quaternionic (real dimension four) line bundles. This gives rise to one of the Pontryagin classes, in real four-dimensional cohomology.

In this way foundational cases for the theory of characteristic classes depend only on line bundles. According to a general splitting principle this can determine the rest of the theory (if not explicitly).

There are theories of holomorphic line bundles on complex manifolds, and invertible sheaves in algebraic geometry, that work out a line bundle theory in those areas.

<text>The North Circular Road (officially the A406 and sometimes known as simply the North Circular) is a ring road around Central London. It runs from Chiswick in the west to Woolwich in the east via suburban north London, connecting various suburbs and other trunk roads in the region. 

Together with its counterpart, the South Circular Road, it mostly forms a ring road around central London, except for crossing of the River Thames, which is done by the Woolwich Ferry.

The road was constructed in the Interwar period to connect local industrial communities and by pass London. It was upgraded after World War II, and was at one point planned to become a motorway as part of the controversial and ultimately cancelled London Ringways scheme. In the early 1990s, the road was extended to bypass Barking and meet the A13 north of Woolwich, though without a direct link to the ferry.

The road&#x27;s design varies from six-lane dual carriageway to urban streets; the latter, although short, cause traffic congestion in London and are regularly featured on local traffic reports, particularly at Bounds Green. The uncertainty of development has caused urban decay and property blight along its route, and led to criticism over its poor pollution record. Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities close to the road.

==Route==
The North Circular Road forms the northern part of a ring-road around Central London. It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart, the South Circular Road, and consequently runs on more purpose-built road than urban streets, often coupled with demolition of existing houses and urban infrastructure. Although the route has alternative names at some points, it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes. 

The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield Road junction, the Golders Green Road/Brent Street junction, Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.

===Gunnersbury, Hanger Lane and Brent Cross===

The road begins in Gunnersbury at the Chiswick flyover (junction 1 of the M4), from which the South Circular Road (A205) heads south over Kew Bridge, and the A4 heads east towards Chiswick and west towards Brentford. The first section runs along Gunnersbury Avenue through Gunnersbury Park to Ealing Common, with a mix of single and dual carriageways, where it becomes Hanger Lane. 

The road crosses the Great Western Main Line west of Paddington to the Hanger Lane gyratory system, a large roundabout on top of the Western Avenue (the A40) with Hanger Lane tube station. This is one of the busiest junctions in London, used by 10,000 vehicles an hour.

The A406 runs on purpose-built road to the north of the Hanger Lane Gyratory, and is referred to as &quot;North Circular Road&quot; on street signs. The road is a six-lane dual carriageway that connects the industrial estates in the area, and passes beneath the West Coast Main Line near Stonebridge Park. Beyond this, there is a junction with IKEA and the Neasden temple to the southeast, and the road runs alongside open land south of the Welsh Harp Reservoir. 

Beyond the reservoir, there is a large interchange with the Edgware Road (A5) and junction 1 of the M1 motorway at Staples Corner, and a junction for the Brent Cross Shopping Centre at the Brent Cross Interchange (joining the A41 from Finchley). This section of the North Circular was used for filming the car chasing sequences in &quot;Withnail and I&quot;.
Northeast of Brent Cross, at Henlys Corner, the North Circular briefly shares carriageways with the A1, which joins it from the northwest and leaves it to the southeast to head into Central London. The junction complex also serves the Finchley Road and pedestrian traffic, and consequently is a major bottleneck on the route. 

Transport for London have invested in the junction, including a special hands-free pedestrian crossing for the local Jewish community, who can then cross the road on the Sabbath. The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards Friern Barnet and Muswell Hill. The road narrows to two-lane single carriageway to pass under the East Coast Main Line, and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green.

===Southgate, Woodford and Beckton===

Traffic on the North Circular Road must turn right from Telford Road into Bowes Road, which causes problems with heavy goods vehicles. The road continues past densely packed housing and business areas before widening at Green Lanes and assuming the North Circular Road name again. At Great Cambridge Interchange, its most northerly point, the A406 crosses Great Cambridge Road (A10). The disused Angel Road railway station is partially located beneath the flyover at Angel Road, in an area marked for redevelopment known as Meridian Water. This leads onto the Lea Valley Viaduct that provides a safe crossing of the River Lea&#x27;s flood plain. The viaduct is part of the original construction and was one of the first of its kind to be built using reinforced concrete.

After the viaduct the road becomes Southend Road, passing north of Walthamstow, and immediately before the Crooked Billet junction, the former site of Walthamstow Stadium. It continues eastward, cutting through a southern section of Epping Forest and meeting the Woodford New Road at Waterworks Corner, before an elevated junction with the M11 motorway and Southend Road heading to Gants Hill. The South Woodford to Barking Relief Road (the section between the M11 and A13) opened in 1987. Previously, the A406 extended along Southend Road and Woodford Avenue as far east as Gants Hill. The current route of the North Circular Road turns south, passing Eastern Avenue (A12) on a flyover at the Redbridge roundabout. It passes Romford Road (the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester) to the west of Ilford and London Road, Barking, and ends at a roundabout with the A13 Newham Way/Alfred&#x27;s Way in Beckton.

To reach the Woolwich Ferry, traffic must follow local roads to the ferry terminal – the A1020 Royal Docks Road, and the A117 named successively as Woolwich Manor Way, Albert Road and Pier Road. The Woolwich Ferry leads across the River Thames, connecting with the eastern end of the South Circular Road on the other side of the river. The junction with the A13 has been built to enable the North Circular to be continued across the junction to the Thames Gateway Bridge if and when it is built.

==History==
===Early history===
Proposals for a route avoiding Central London arose during the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. By 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had developed schemes for several new roads. This included what became the North Circular Road, which was designed to skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.

Actual construction of The North Circular Road was mostly started as an unemployment relief scheme following the First World War. Various manufacturing industries, including furniture production, had moved away from the East End in the early 20th century and started to be based in areas on the fringes of outer London development. As well as a general bypass of Central London, it would connect the communities of Edmonton, Tottenham and Walthamstow, and allow former munitions factories to be reused for industrial purposes. Further west, industrial work increased around Wembley to cater for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, while former military factories at Willesden, Hendon and Acton would also benefit from being connected by the North Circular Road. The land used for the route was mostly cheap, which encouraged further works and factories to be built by the road. Purpose-built sections were designed to dual carriageway standards, including a wide carriageway accompanied by verges.

The original route ran from Chiswick to Southgate, and was open to traffic by the 1930s. Although it mostly ran on newly built road, a section east of Southgate used existing streets. By the end of the decade, the area surrounding the Park Royal estate had become the largest industrial estate in the south of England, and the London Passenger Transport Board was receiving regular complaints about the excess traffic levels.

Due to laxer laws that allowed housing to be built on major roads, as London suburbs developed, residential properties were built on the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road had been designed with no speed limit, as was typically the case in the 1920s, but by 1951 a 30 mph speed limit was enforced along the route.

In 1946 the North Circular Road became a trunk road, funded from a national budget set by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) rather than a local one.

===London Ringways===

After reviewing traffic conditions in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned to increase the capacity of the North Circular Road, grade separating as many junctions as possible, particularly those connecting with important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London with the hope of easing traffic congestion in the central area. Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout the majority of its length by the late 1970s.

The Ringway projects were extremely unpopular and caused widespread protests, which led to the cancellation of the plans in 1972, particularly after the Westway had opened in the face of large-scale protest two years earlier. In 1974, the MOT scaled back plans to improve the North Circular Road, though by the end of the decade they had revised plans to improve the route to dual carriageway throughout without any property frontages. In 1979, the Ministry of Transport planned to improve the Great Cambridge Road Roundabout with a £17 million scheme that would have demolished over 100 houses and shops. This was cancelled and replaced with a straightforward underpass in 1983, costing £22.3 million.

===South Woodford to Barking Relief Road===
The section of the North Circular south of Charlie Brown&#x27;s Roundabout in South Woodford is the &quot;South Woodford to Barking Relief Road&quot;. Prior to its opening, the signposted North Circular route from the Waterworks Roundabout to the Woolwich Ferry was on local roads via Whipps Cross, Wanstead, Manor Park and Beckton. As well as delays for the ferry, traffic could also be held due to closure of bridges in the Royal Albert and King George V Docks. The road was originally planned to be a continuation of the M11, but the standard of road was decreased to a basic dual carriageway. It was proposed to be built in the 1980s concurrently with the controversial M11 link road.

===Henlys Corner and Bounds Green improvements===

The North Circular Road ceased to be a trunk road in 2000, when control of all roads inside Greater London passed to Transport for London (TfL). In 2004, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone promised limited improvements to the road, but received criticism for not approving earlier plans for widening the often heavily congested road at critical sections. In 2009, it was announced that major works between the Bounds Green Road and Green Lanes junctions would finally go ahead, having been proposed for over 90 years, and was completed the following year. The work improved the carriageway between these junctions, widening Telford Road to two lanes and improving all of the junctions along the route. Improvements were also made to walkways and cycle paths along this route. However, unlike elsewhere on the North Circular, the new junctions are not grade-separated and have been designed with environmental concerns in mind. The opened scheme is a reduced specification from 1960s plans, which projected this section of the North Circular to be dual carriageway.

In April 2011, after many years of proposals and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and it was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.

In July 2013, a task force set up by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that long sections of the North Circular (as well as the South Circular) should be put underground in road tunnels, freeing up space on the surface to provide public space, extensive cycle routes, and better links to existing communities currently severed by the road. Caroline Pidgeon, deputy chair of the London Assembly&#x27;s Transport Committee, responded, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make sense and it won&#x27;t add up – [there&#x27;s a] £30bn estimate, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll cost at least double that, and the reality is we&#x27;ll lose homes around these roads and so on.&quot;

==Environment and safety==

The North Circular Road has received regular criticism over its poor safety record and piecemeal improvement schemes due to a lack of funding since it opened to traffic. In 1989, Michael Portillo, then a Member of Parliament for Enfield Southgate, complained that 367 houses were scheduled for demolition as part of improvements to the North Circular in his constituency. Friends of the Earth have complained about rising costs and delays to junction and safety improvements. In 2003, environment cabinet member Terry Neville said that TfL&#x27;s proposed improvements for improving the North Circular were &quot;a sham&quot; and that the local council wanted a six-lane motorway to properly solve congestion.

The uncertainty over the future of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it, particularly around Bounds Green. Around 1972, approximately 400 homes on the road were compulsorily purchased by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled. The properties have suffered from a lack of long-term care. Since TfL took responsibility for the road, land for future schemes has been left dormant, resulting in urban decay with derelict properties. Compulsorily purchased properties were let out to various short-term tenants, which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor. Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road, particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital. Areas close to the road, such as the alleys behind properties on the Telford Road section, have suffered from fly tipping and anti-social behaviour.

In 2011, Enfield Borough Council proposed a North Circular Area Action Plan, which would regenerate the area immediately around Telford Road and Bowes Road, and encourage growth. This includes new pedestrian crossings and improved access to existing open spaces, including Arnos Park and Broomfield Park.

In 2002, the North Circular was rated as Britain&#x27;s noisiest road by the UK Noise Association. In 2013, the road was named in a BBC report as being the most polluted in London, including the highest surveyed levels of benzene and nitrogen dioxide. A report in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, referring to the North Circular, said &quot;if you want to pull back the lid of your convertible and drink in the fresh air, look elsewhere&quot;. In 2019, a BBC News report said that the section between Chiswick and Hanger Lane was the most congested in Britain.

==Junctions==
The North Circular Road has a wide variety of styles and standards of junctions connecting to other roads. These range from the complex, grade-separated design at Charlie Brown&#x27;s near Woodford, to at-grade junctions with traffic lights. The original road contained entirely at-grade junctions; many of these were improved and grade separated during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Current junctions===
===Former junctions===
==Public transport==
There are four bus routes that largely serve their routes on the North Circular Road:
*London Buses route 34: between Arnos Grove and South Chingford (Crooked Billet Roundabout)
*London Buses route 112: between North Ealing tube station and Finchley (Great North Road), serving Brent Cross Shopping Centre
*London Buses route 232: between Brent Park and Palmers Green (Green Lanes), serving Brent Cross Shopping Centre
*London Buses route SL1: between Arnos Grove and South Chingford (Crooked Billet Roundabout)

==Cultural references==
The North Circular Road is mentioned in the poet Louis MacNeice&#x27;s 1938 piece, &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;. In it, he describes the features along the road, including factories, prefabricated buildings, bungalows and petrol pumps &quot;like intransigent gangs of idols&quot;. Keith Moon played his first gig with The Who at a pub on the North Circular Road on 2 May 1964.

The original Ace Cafe was on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers knew they could make a quick getaway. IWG founder Mark Dixon&#x27;s first business on returning to Britain after an extended time abroad was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns. He grew the business into a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).

<doc id="361380" wikidata="Q735587" url="?curid=361380" title="President of the European Council">
<text>The president of the European Council is the person presiding over and driving forward the work of the European Council on the world stage. This institution comprises the college of heads of state or government of EU member states as well as the president of the European Commission, and provides political direction to the European Union (EU).

From 1975 to 2009, the chair of the European Council was an unofficial position (often referred to as the president-in-office) held by the head of state or government of the member state holding the semiannually rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union at any given time. However, since the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon, article 15 of Treaty on European Union states that the European Council appoints a full-time president for a two-and-a-half-year term, with the possibility of renewal once. Appointments, as well as the removal of incumbents, require a double majority support in the European Council.

On 19 November 2009, the European Council agreed that its first president under the Lisbon Treaty would be Herman Van Rompuy (European People&#x27;s Party), until then the Belgian prime minister. Van Rompuy took office when the Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 December 2009 with a term stretching until 31 May 2012. His term was later extended with a second period ending on 30 November 2014.

The second holder of the office was (until then) Polish prime minister Donald Tusk. He was originally elected to serve a term from 1 December 2014 to 31 May 2017, and was re-elected on 9 March 2017 to a second term running from 1 June 2017 until 30 November 2019.

On 2 July 2019 the European Council elected the until then Belgian prime minister Charles Michel as the successor to Donald Tusk as President of the European Council for the period from 1 December 2019 to 31 May 2022. He was re-elected in March 2022 for a second term for period from 1 June 2022 to 30 November 2024, when he was replaced by António Costa, from 1 December 2024.

==History==

The first meeting of all European Communities heads of state or government was held in 1961 as an informal summit, but only became formalised in 1974, when it was dubbed &quot;European Council&quot; by the then French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. With the establishment of the European Union in 1993, the presidency of the European Council was based on the presidency of the Council of the European Union, being hosted by the member state holding the Council presidency, rotating every six months. As the European Council is composed of national leaders, it was chaired by the head of state or government of the presidency state.

==Permanent post==
The European Constitution, drafted by the European Convention, outlined the &quot;president of the European Council&quot; as a longer term and full-time chairmanship. The Constitution was rejected by voters in two Member States during ratification but the changes envisaged to the European Council presidency were retained in the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009.

The first president was expected to define the role for future office holders, as there was no clear idea of how the post would evolve. One body of thought was that the president would stick to a quasi-administrative role, a standard bearer who would simply chair meetings and ensure the smooth running of the body and its policies. This would attract semi-retired leaders seeking a fitting climax to their career and would leave most work to the Commission rather than wield power within the institutions. However another opinion envisaged a more pro-active President within the Union and speaking for it abroad. The office would hence be quickly fashioned, according to promoters, into a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;president of Europe&quot; and, unlike the first model, would be seen on the world stage as speaking for the EU. Persons connected to this position would be more charismatic leaders. The appointment of Herman Van Rompuy indicated a desire to see the former style of president.

There were in any case a number of practical reasons for having the new style President The previous rotating presidency meant a new chair every second or third meeting. There was no choice as to who it would be. Incumbants had little time to devote to preparing meetings, as they had a national government to run (a growing problem as the number of members to negotiate with expanded with EU enlargement). And when representing the EU externally at G7 or G20 summits, they were often simultaneously representing their own country. Allowing the European Council to choose a full time, longer-term President who was not simultaneously a national head of government avoided these problems.

The Treaty of Lisbon does not define a nomination process for the president of the Council and initially several official and unofficial candidates were proposed. At the final European Council meeting on the treaty in Lisbon, on 19 November 2007, French president Nicolas Sarkozy set off public speculation on candidates by naming Tony Blair, Felipe González and Jean-Claude Juncker, and praising the three as worthy candidates with Blair in particular being a long time front runner for the post. However, he faced large scale opposition for being from a large state outside the eurozone and the Schengen Area as well as being a leader who entered the Iraq War which had split Europe. Minor opposition to other leaders such as Juncker also led to their rejection.

==First full-time president==
On 19 November 2009, Herman Van Rompuy, at that time Prime Minister of Belgium, was appointed the first full-time president of the European Council. The formal decision on the appointment was made after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force on 1 December 2009. The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, said that he had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels on the evening of 19 November 2009. Brown praised Van Rompuy as &quot;a consensus builder&quot; who had &quot;brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty&quot;. At a press conference after his appointment, Van Rompuy commented: &quot;Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations. A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation. I will consider everyone&#x27;s interests and sensitivities. Even if our unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth&quot;, he said, stressing the individuality of EU member states.

Van Rompuy&#x27;s first council meeting was an informal gathering in the Solvay Library in Leopold Park, rather than the more usual formal gathering in the Justus Lipsius building nearby. The meeting was called to reflect on long term structural economic problems facing Europe, but was overtaken by the Greek economic crisis.

==Duties and powers==

===Pre-2009===
The role of &quot;President-in-Office&quot; of the assembled European Council was performed by the head of state or government of the member state currently holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union. This presidency rotated every six months, meaning there was a new president of the European Council twice a year.

The role as President-in-Office was merely a &quot;primus inter pares&quot; role among other European heads of state or government. However, the president-in-office represented the European Council externally and reported to the European Parliament after its meetings as well as at the beginning and at the end of the presidency.

===Post-2009===

The president&#x27;s role is largely political, preparing the work of the European Council, organising and chairing its meetings, seeking to find consensus among its members and reporting to the European Parliament after each meeting; the president will also &quot;at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security&quot;. Some overlap between the roles of the president of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire. There is further concern over whether the president will have sufficient personnel and resources to fulfil the duties of the post effectively and that, in lacking a ministry, the president might become a &quot;play ball&quot; between EU leaders.

With the reorganisation of leading EU posts under the Lisbon Treaty, there was some criticism of each post&#x27;s vague responsibilities. Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The president of the European Commission speaks as the EU&#x27;s &quot;government&quot; while the new president of the European Council is a &quot;strategist&quot;. The High Representative specialises in &quot;bilateral relations&quot; while the European commissioner for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine. The president of the European Parliament meanwhile articulates the EU&#x27;s values.

The European Council president also extended his influence into financial policy, the most important area left to the rotating Council presidency, with the rotating presidency seeing a greater decrease in power than previously planned. Many of the changes introduced with the Lisbon Treaty need concretion through practical implementation by the current actors. The Spanish presidency unsuccessfully tried to challenge the European Council president&#x27;s prominent post during the first rotating presidency of 2010, while the second half of the year saw a Belgian rotating presidency marked by a weakened caretaker government which did not challenge Herman van Rompuy, himself a Belgian politician. The Belgian rotating presidency announced it was taking a &quot;backrow seat&quot; with regards to both the European Council president and the high representative, thus fuelling hopes as well as concerns for a more communitarian character in both the council and foreign policy.

==Privileges of office==
Formal negotiations on the salary and privileges of the permanent presidency began in April 2008 as part of the draft of the 2009 EU budget. The outcome was that the president should enjoy the same conditions as the president of the Commission, with a basic salary of 138% of the highest civil service grade: that would be €24,874.62 per month (not including family and other allowances).

The president receives a chauffeured car and around 20 dedicated staff members. He also has a housing allowance, rather than an official residence which was considered &quot;too symbolic&quot;. Likewise, the idea of a private jet was also rejected for being symbolic and, as one diplomat pointed out, a discrepancy in privileges between the European Council and Commission presidents may only fuel rivalry between the two.

The possibility of there being greater perks for the European Council president than Commission president prompted Parliament to threaten a rejection of the 2009 budget. It saw a large salary and extras as a symbolic signal that the post is intended to become more powerful, increasing intergovernmentalism at the Parliament&#x27;s expense. With some in the Council suggesting a staff of up to 60, one MEP has argued in 2008 that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought to drop the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that Parliament and Council will not interfere in each other&#x27;s budget.

==President&#x27;s office==

Although the European Council is, under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, a separate institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its President is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. The president does have, however, his own private office (&quot;cabinet&quot;) of close advisers. Van Rompuy chose as his first chief of staff (&quot;chef de cabinet&quot;) Baron Frans van Daele, formerly Belgian ambassador to, variously, the US, the UN, the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers. Upon his retirement in the autumn of 2012, Didier Seeuws, former Deputy Perm Rep of Belgium to the EU and former spokesman for Belgian PM Verhofstadt, replaced him. Also in his team were the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett and Van Rompuy&#x27;s long standing press officer Dirk De Backer.

==Democratic mandate==
=== Election ===
The president of the European Council is elected by its members through a reinforced qualified majority vote for a once-renewable term of two and a half years. Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) identifies his duties. It is the Heads of State or Government who vote for this office.

The lack of accountability to MEPs or national parliamentarians has also cast doubt as to whether national leaders will in practice stand behind the president on major issues. Under the rotational system, the presidents simply had the mandate of their member states, while the new permanent president is chosen by the members of the European Council.

There have been calls by some, such as former German interior minister and former head of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble, for direct elections to take place to give the President a mandate, this would strengthen the post within the European Council allowing for stronger leadership in addition to addressing the question of democratic legitimacy in the EU. However, this might cause conflict with Parliament&#x27;s democratic mandate or a potential mandate for the Commission (see section below). To give a mandate to the European Council&#x27;s president would signify a development of the Union&#x27;s governance towards a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system. 

===Relationship with Commission===

There had been disagreement and concern over competition between the former president of the European Council Van Rompuy and the former Commission president Barroso, due to the vague language of the treaty. Some clarifications saw Van Rompuy as the &quot;strategist&quot; and Barroso as a head of government. In terms of economic policy, Van Rompuy saw the European Council as dealing with overall strategy and the Commission as dealing with the implementation. Despite weekly breakfasts together, there was a certain extent of rivalry between the two yet-defined posts.

Although the president of the European Council may not hold a national office, such as a prime minister of a member state, there is no such restraint on European offices. For example, the president may be an MEP, or more significantly the Commission president (who already sits in the European Council). This would allow the European Council to concurrently appoint one person to the roles and powers of both president of the European Council and president of the European Commission, thus creating a single presidential position for the union as a whole.

Since the creation of the European Council presidency, former president Van Rompuy and former Commission President Barroso had begun to compete with each other as Van Rompuy had benefited from the general shift in power from the Commission to the European Council yet with Barroso still holding the real powers. At international summits they continued previous practice of both going at the same time. The complicated situation had renewed some calls to merge the posts, possibly at the end of Barroso&#x27;s term in 2014. However some member states had expected to oppose the creation of such a high-profile post.

If the posts are not to be combined, some believe that the dual-presidential system could lead to &quot;cohabitation&quot; and infighting between the two offices. While it is comparable to the French model, where there is a president (the European Council president) and prime minister (the Commission president), the Council president does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the Commission president, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. The European Council president has prestige, but lacks power. The Commission president has power, but lacks the prestige of the European Council president. Some believe this problem would be increased further if the Council president were to be strengthened by a democratic mandate, as mentioned above.

<doc id="361384" wikidata="Q351609" url="?curid=361384" title="Liquefied petroleum gas">
<text>Liquefied petroleum gas, also referred to as liquid petroleum gas (LPG or LP gas), is a fuel gas which contains a flammable mixture of hydrocarbon gases, specifically propane, &quot;n&quot;-butane and isobutane. It can sometimes contain some propylene, butylene, and isobutylene/isobutene.

LPG is used as a fuel gas in heating appliances, cooking equipment, and vehicles, and is used as an aerosol propellant and a refrigerant, replacing chlorofluorocarbons in an effort to reduce damage to the ozone layer. When specifically used as a vehicle fuel, it is often referred to as autogas or just as gas.

Varieties of LPG that are bought and sold include mixes that are mostly propane (), mostly butane (), and, most commonly, mixes including both propane and butane. In the northern hemisphere winter, the mixes contain more propane, while in summer, they contain more butane. In the United States, mainly two grades of LPG are sold: commercial propane and HD-5. These specifications are published by the Gas Processors Association (GPA) and the American Society of Testing and Materials. Propane/butane blends are also listed in these specifications.

Propylene, butylenes and various other hydrocarbons are usually also present in small concentrations such as , , and . HD-5 limits the amount of propylene that can be placed in LPG to 5% and is utilized as an autogas specification. A powerful odorant, ethanethiol, is added so that leaks can be detected easily. The internationally recognized European Standard is EN 589. In the United States, tetrahydrothiophene (thiophane) or amyl mercaptan are also approved odorants, although neither is currently being utilized.

LPG is prepared by refining petroleum or &quot;wet&quot; natural gas, and is almost entirely derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Walter O. Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very little sulfur emission. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for premium grade petrol (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5–0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71–0.77 kg/L for gasoline). As the density and vapor pressure of LPG (or its components) change significantly with temperature, this fact must be considered every time when the application is connected with safety or custody transfer operations, e.g. typical cuttoff level option for LPG reservoir is 85%.

Besides its use as an energy carrier, LPG is also a promising feedstock in the chemical industry for the synthesis of olefins such as ethylene and propylene.

As its boiling point is below room temperature, LPG will evaporate quickly at normal temperatures and pressures and is usually supplied in pressurized steel vessels. They are typically filled to 80–85% of their capacity to allow for thermal expansion of the contained liquid. The ratio of the densities of the liquid and vapor varies depending on composition, pressure, and temperature, but is typically around 250:1. The pressure at which LPG becomes liquid, called its vapour pressure, likewise varies depending on composition and temperature; for example, it is approximately for pure butane at , and approximately for pure propane at . LPG in its gaseous phase is still heavier than air, unlike natural gas, and thus will flow along floors and tend to settle in low spots, such as basements. There are two main dangers to this. The first is a possible explosion if the mixture of LPG and air is within the explosive limits and there is an ignition source. The second is suffocation due to LPG displacing air, causing a decrease in oxygen concentration.

A full LPG gas cylinder contains 86% liquid; the ullage volume will contain vapour at a pressure that varies with temperature.

==Uses==
LPG has a wide variety of uses in many different markets as an efficient fuel container in the agricultural, recreation, hospitality, industrial, construction, sailing and fishing sectors. It can serve as fuel for cooking, central heating and water heating and is a particularly cost-effective and efficient way to heat off-grid homes.

===Cooking===
LPG is used for cooking in many countries for economic reasons, for convenience or because it is the preferred fuel source.

In India, nearly 28.5 million metric tons of LPG were consumed in the 2023-24 financial year in the domestic sector, mainly for cooking. In 2016, the number of domestic connections was 215 million (i.e., one connection for every six people) with a circulation of more than 350 million LPG cylinders. Most of the LPG requirement is imported. Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on a major scale. LPG is subsidised by the Indian government for domestic users. An increase in LPG prices has been a politically sensitive matter in India as it potentially affects the middle class voting pattern.

LPG was once a standard cooking fuel in Hong Kong; however, the continued expansion of town gas to newer buildings has reduced LPG usage to less than 24% of residential units. However, other than electric, induction, or infrared stoves, LPG-fueled stoves are the only type available in most suburban villages and many public housing estates.

LPG is the most common cooking fuel in Brazilian urban areas, being used in virtually all households, with the exception of the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, which have a natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Since 2001, poor families receive a government grant (&quot;Vale Gás&quot;) used exclusively for the acquisition of LPG. Since 2003, this grant is part of the government&#x27;s main social welfare program (&quot;Bolsa Família&quot;). Also, since 2005, the national oil company Petrobras differentiates between LPG destined for cooking and LPG destined for other uses, establishing a lower price for the former. This is a result of a directive from the Brazilian federal government, but its discontinuation is currently being debated.

LPG is commonly used in North America for domestic cooking and outdoor grilling.

=== Rural heating ===
Predominantly in Europe and rural parts of many countries, LPG can provide an alternative to electric heating, heating oil, or kerosene. LPG is most often used in areas that do not have direct access to piped natural gas. In the UK about 200,000 households use LPG for heating.

LPG can be used as a power source for combined heat and power technologies (CHP). CHP is the process of generating both electrical power and useful heat from a single fuel source. This technology has allowed LPG to be used not just as fuel for heating and cooking, but also for decentralized generation of electricity.

LPG can be stored in a variety of manners. LPG, as with other fossil fuels, can be combined with renewable power sources to provide greater reliability while still achieving some reduction in CO2 emissions. However, as opposed to wind and solar renewable energy sources, LPG can be used as a standalone energy source without the prohibitive expense of electrical energy storage. In many climates, renewable sources such as solar and wind power would still require the construction, installation and maintenance of reliable baseload power sources such as LPG fueled generation to provide electrical power during the entire year. 100% wind/solar is possible, the caveat being that the expense of the additional generation capacity necessary to charge batteries plus the cost of battery electrical storage makes this option economically feasible in only a minority of situations.

===Motor fuel===

When LPG is used to fuel internal combustion engines, it is often referred to as autogas or auto propane. In some countries, it has been used since the 1940s as a petrol alternative for spark ignition engines. In some countries, there are additives in the liquid that extend engine life and the ratio of butane to propane is kept quite precise in fuel LPG. Two recent studies have examined LPG-fuel-oil fuel mixes and found that smoke emissions and fuel consumption are reduced but hydrocarbon emissions are increased. The studies were split on CO emissions, with one finding significant increases, and the other finding slight increases at low engine load but a considerable decrease at high engine load. Its advantage is that it is non-toxic, non-corrosive and free of tetraethyllead or any additives, and has a high octane rating (102–108 RON depending on local specifications). It burns more cleanly than petrol or fuel-oil and is especially free of the particulates present in the latter.

LPG has a lower energy density per liter than either petrol or fuel-oil, so the equivalent fuel consumption is higher. Many governments impose less tax on LPG than on petrol or fuel-oil, which helps offset the greater consumption of LPG than of petrol or fuel-oil. However, in many European countries, this tax break is often compensated by a much higher annual tax on cars using LPG than on cars using petrol or fuel-oil. Propane is the third most widely used motor fuel in the world. 2013 estimates are that over 24.9 million vehicles are fueled by propane gas worldwide. Over 25 million tonnes (over 9 billion US gallons) are used annually as a vehicle fuel.

Not all automobile engines are suitable for use with LPG as a fuel. LPG provides less upper cylinder lubrication than petrol or diesel, so LPG-fueled engines are more prone to valve wear if they are not suitably modified. Many modern common rail diesel engines respond well to LPG use as a supplementary fuel. This is where LPG is used as fuel as well as diesel. Systems are now available that integrate with OEM engine management systems.

Conversion kits can switch a vehicle dedicated to gasoline to using a dual system, in which both gasoline and LPG are used in the same vehicle.

In 2020, BW LPG successfully retrofitted a Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) with LPG propulsion technology, pioneering LPG&#x27;s application in large-scale maritime operations. LPG’s lowers emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter align with stricter standards set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), making LPG a viable transition option as the maritime industry transitions towards net zero carbon emissions. 

===Conversion to gasoline===
LPG can be converted into alkylate which is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional anti-knock properties and gives clean burning.

===Refrigeration===
LPG is instrumental in providing off-the-grid refrigeration, usually by means of a gas absorption refrigerator.

Blended from pure, dry propane (refrigerant designator R-290) and isobutane (R-600a) the blend &quot;R-290a&quot; has negligible ozone depletion potential, very low global warming potential and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22, R-134a and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.

Such substitution is widely prohibited or discouraged in motor vehicle air conditioning systems, on the grounds that using flammable hydrocarbons in systems originally designed to carry non-flammable refrigerant presents a significant risk of fire or explosion.

Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons. One particular test, conducted by a professor at the University of New South Wales, unintentionally tested the worst-case scenario of a sudden and complete refrigerant expulsion into the passenger compartment followed by subsequent ignition. He and several others in the car sustained minor burns to their face, ears, and hands, and several observers received lacerations from the burst glass of the front passenger window. No one was seriously injured.

=== Aerosol propellant ===
==Global production==
Global LPG production reached over 292 million metric tons per year (Mt/a) in 2015, while global LPG consumption to over 284 Mt/a. 62% of LPG is extracted from natural gas while the rest is produced by petroleum refineries from crude oil. 44% of global consumption is in the domestic sector. The U.S. is the leading producer and exporter of LPG.

==Security of supply==
Because of the natural gas and the oil-refining industry, Europe is almost self-sufficient in LPG. Europe&#x27;s security of supply is further safeguarded by:
* a wide range of sources, both inside and outside Europe;
* a flexible supply chain via water, rail and road with numerous routes and entry points into Europe.

According to 2010–12 estimates, proven world reserves of natural gas, from which most LPG is derived, stand at 300 trillion cubic meters (10,600 trillion cubic feet). Production continues to grow at an average annual rate of 2.2%.

==Comparison with natural gas==

LPG is composed mainly of propane and butane, while natural gas is composed of the lighter methane and ethane. LPG, vaporised and at atmospheric pressure, has a higher calorific value (46 MJ/m3 equivalent to 12.8 kWh/m3) than natural gas (methane) (38 MJ/m3 equivalent to 10.6 kWh/m3), which means that LPG cannot simply be substituted for natural gas. In order to allow the use of the same burner controls and to provide for similar combustion characteristics, LPG can be mixed with air to produce a synthetic natural gas (SNG) that can be easily substituted. LPG/air mixing ratios average 60/40, though this is widely variable based on the gases making up the LPG. The method for determining the mixing ratios is by calculating the Wobbe index of the mix. Gases having the same Wobbe index are held to be interchangeable.

LPG-based SNG is used in emergency backup systems for many public, industrial and military installations, and many utilities use LPG peak shaving plants in times of high demand to make up shortages in natural gas supplied to their distributions systems. LPG-SNG installations are also used during initial gas system introductions when the distribution infrastructure is in place before gas supplies can be connected. Developing markets in India and China (among others) use LPG-SNG systems to build up customer bases prior to expanding existing natural gas systems.

LPG-based SNG or natural gas with localized storage and piping distribution network to the households for catering to each cluster of 5000 domestic consumers can be planned under the initial phase of the city gas network system. This would eliminate the last mile LPG cylinders road transport which is a cause of traffic and safety hurdles in Indian cities. These localized natural gas networks are successfully operating in Japan with feasibility to get connected to wider networks in both villages and cities.

==Environmental effects==
Commercially available LPG is currently derived mainly from fossil fuels. Burning LPG releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. The reaction also produces some carbon monoxide. LPG does, however, release less per unit of energy than does coal or oil, but more than natural gas. It emits 81% of the per kWh produced by oil, 70% of that of coal, and less than 50% of that emitted by coal-generated electricity distributed via the grid. Being a mix of propane and butane, LPG emits less carbon per joule than butane but more carbon per joule than propane.

LPG burns more cleanly than higher molecular weight hydrocarbons because it releases less particulate matter.

As it is much less polluting than most traditional solid-fuel stoves, replacing cookstoves used in developing countries with LPG is one of the key strategies adopted to reduce household air pollution in the developing world.

==Fire/explosion risk and mitigation==
In a refinery or gas plant, LPG must be stored in pressure vessels. These containers are either cylindrical and horizontal (sometimes referred to as bullet tanks) or spherical (of the Horton sphere type). Typically, these vessels are designed and manufactured according to some code. In the United States, this code is governed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

LPG containers have pressure relief valves, such that when subjected to exterior heating sources, they will vent LPGs to the atmosphere or a flare stack.

If a tank is subjected to a fire of sufficient duration and intensity, it can undergo a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). This is typically a concern for large refineries and petrochemical plants that maintain very large containers. In general, tanks are designed so that the product will vent faster than pressure can build to dangerous levels.

One remedy that is utilized in industrial settings is to equip such containers with a measure to provide a fire-resistance rating. Large, spherical LPG containers may have up to a 15 cm steel wall thickness. They are equipped with an approved pressure relief valve. A large fire in the vicinity of the vessel will increase its temperature and pressure. The relief valve on the top is designed to vent off excess pressure in order to prevent the rupture of the container itself. Given a fire of sufficient duration and intensity, the pressure being generated by the boiling and expanding gas can exceed the ability of the valve to vent the excess. Alternatively, 
if, due to continued venting, the liquid level drops below the area being heated, the tank structure can be overheated and subsequently weakened in that area. If either occurs, the container may rupture violently, launching pieces of the vessel at high velocity, while the released products can ignite as well, potentially causing catastrophic damage to anything nearby, including other containers.

People can be exposed to LPG in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for LPG exposure in the workplace as 1000 ppm (1800 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1000 ppm (1800 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 2000 ppm, 10% of the lower explosive limit, LPG is considered immediately dangerous to life and health (due solely to safety considerations pertaining to risk of explosion).
