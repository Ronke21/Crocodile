<text>Prunus mume, or its common name Japanese plum, is a Chinese tree species of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;. Along with bamboo, the plant most intimately associated with art, literature and everyday life in China, where it was later introduced to the remaining Sinosphere (Korea, Vietnam, and Japan). Mei flowers, or &quot;meihua ()&quot;, in the later winter and early spring, during the spring festival (春節), symbolizing endurance as being the first to flower despite the cold and is one of the Three Friends of Winter. Also referred to by its flowers plum blossom or flowering plum. Although referred to as a plum in English, is classified in the &quot;Armeniaca&quot; section of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot; making this an apricot. In East Asian cuisine (Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cuisine), the fruit, known as &quot;meizi&quot; (), is used in juices, as a flavoring for alcohol, as a pickle, dried, and in sauces. It is also used in traditional medicine. &quot;Meihua&quot; is also appreciated for its characteristic fragrance, which uniquely identifies it from other apricots blossoms which do not exhibit this trait. 

&quot;Prunus mume&quot; should not be confused with the plum, &quot;Prunus salicina&quot;, a related species also grown in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, or the common apricot &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot;&quot;,&quot; which is closely related under the same section.

== Origin ==
&quot;Prunus mume&quot; originated in the region around the Yangtze River in southern China and was cultivated domestically for both its ornamental beauty and its fruit. It was later introduced to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It can be found in sparse forests, stream sides, forested slopes along trails, and mountains, sometimes at altitudes up to , and regions of cultivation.

== Description ==
&quot;Prunus mume&quot; is a deciduous tree that starts to flower in mid-winter, typically around January until late February in East Asia. It can grow to tall. The flowers are in diameter and have a strong fragrant scent. They have colors in varying shades of white, pink, and red. The leaves appear shortly after the petals fall, are oval-shaped with a pointed tip, and are 4–8 cm long and 2.5–5 cm wide. The fruit ripens in early summer, around June and July in East Asia, and coincides with the East Asian rainy season, the meiyu (, &quot;plum rain&quot;). The drupe is in diameter with a groove running from the stalk to the tip. The skin turns yellow, sometimes with a red blush, as it ripens, and the flesh becomes yellow. The tree is cultivated for its fruit and flowers.

== Names ==
Native to southern China, where it is known as &quot;mei&quot; (梅). The scientific name combines the Latin (“(European) plum tree”) and the obsolete Japanese pronunciation of 梅 (&quot;mume&quot;), which is ultimately likely derived from Middle Chinese. The plant is known by a number of different names in English, including &quot;flowering plum&quot; or &quot;plum blossoms&quot;, which are misnomers as &quot;P. mume&quot; is under the apricot section &quot;Armeniaca&quot;. Also a misnomer, &quot;Japanese apricot&quot;, is incorrectly used as the plant is native to China, is likely derived as the plant was introduced to the West by Siebold in Japan. 

The flower is known as the &quot;meihua&quot; () in Chinese, which came to be translated as &quot;plum blossom&quot; or sometimes as &quot;flowering plum&quot;. The term &quot;winter plum&quot; may be used too, specifically with regard to the depiction of the flower with its early blooming in Chinese painting. The character 梅 is a phono-semantic compound created by combining the semantic component (“tree”) with the phonetic component (literally meaning &quot;every,&quot; pronounced in Old Chinese, which was similar to for &quot;plum&quot;).

In Chinese, it is called &quot;mei&quot; () and the fruit is called &quot;meizi&quot; (). The Japanese name is &quot;ume&quot; (), while the Korean name is &quot;maesil&quot; (). The Japanese and Korean terms derive from Middle Chinese, in which the pronunciation is thought to have been &quot;muəi&quot;. The Vietnamese name is &quot;mai&quot; or &quot;mơ&quot; (although &quot;mai vàng&quot; refers to a different plant, &quot;Ochna integerrima&quot;, in southern Vietnam).

== Varieties ==

Ornamental tree varieties and cultivars of &quot;P. mume&quot; have been cultivated for planting in various gardens throughout East Asia, and for cut blossoming branches used in flower arrangements.

=== Chinese varieties ===
In China, there are over 300 recorded cultivars of &quot;Prunus mume&quot;. These are classified by phylogenetics (&quot;P. mume&quot; and two hybrids) in branches, type of branches in groups, and characteristics of flowers in several forms:
* Zhizhimei Lei () [Upright Mei Group], &quot;Prunus mume&quot; var. &quot;typica&quot;
** Pinzimei Xing () [Pleiocarpa Form]
** Jiangmei Xing () [Single Flowered Form]
** Gongfen Xing () [Pink Double Form]
** Yudie Xing () [Alboplena Form]
** Huangxiang Xing () [Flavescens Form]
** Lü&#x27;e Xing () [Green Calyx Form]
** Sajin Xing () [Versicolor Form]
** Zhusha Xing () [Cinnabar Purple Form]
* Chuizhimei Lei () [Pendulous Mei Group], &quot;Prunus mume&quot; var. &quot;pendula&quot;
** Fenhua Chuizhi Xing () [Pink Pendulous Form]
** Wubao Chuizhi Xing () [Versicolor Pendulous Form]
** Canxue Chuizhi Xing () [Albiflora Pendulous Form]
** Baibi Chuizhi Xing () [Viridiflora Pendulous Form]
** Guhong Chuizhi Xing () [Atropurpurea Pendulous Form]
* Longyoumei Lei () [Tortuous Dragon Group], &quot;Prunus mume&quot; var. &quot;tortuosa&quot;
* Xingmei Lei () [Apricot Mei Group], &quot;Prunus mume&quot; var. &quot;bungo&quot;
* Yinglimei Lei () [Blireiana Group], &quot;Prunus × blireana, Prunus cerasifera &#x27;Pissardii&#x27; × Prunus mume Alphandii&quot;

It is disputed whether &quot;Prunus zhengheensis&quot; () is a separate species or conspecific with &quot;Prunus mume&quot;. It is found in the Fujian province of China. It is only known from one county, Zhenghe. It is a tree tall, preferring to grow at above sea level. The yellow fruit is delectable and aside from its height, it is indistinguishable from &quot;P. mume&quot;.

=== Japanese varieties ===
In Japan, ornamental &quot;Prunus mume&quot; cultivars are classified into &quot;yabai&quot; (wild), &quot;hibai&quot; (red), and &quot;bungo&quot; (Bungo Province) types. The &quot;bungo&quot; trees are also grown for fruit and are hybrids between &quot;Prunus mume&quot; and apricot. The &quot;hibai&quot; trees have red heartwood and most of them have red flowers. The &quot;yabai&quot; trees are also used as grafting stock. Among yabai trees, Nankoume is a very popular variety in Japan, and whose fruits are mainly used for making Umeboshi.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary use ===
==== Beverage ====

In China, &quot;suanmeitang&quot; (; &quot;sour plum juice&quot;) is made from smoked plums, called &quot;wumei&quot; (). The plum juice is extracted by boiling smoked plums in water and sweetened with sugar to make &quot;suanmeitang&quot;. It ranges from light pinkish-orange to purplish black in colour and often has a smoky and slightly salty taste. It is traditionally flavoured with sweet osmanthus flowers, and is enjoyed chilled, usually in summer.

In Korea, both the flowers and the fruits are used to make tea. &quot;Maehwa-cha&quot; (; &quot;plum blossom tea&quot;) is made by infusing the flowers in hot water. &quot;Maesil-cha&quot; (; &quot;plum tea&quot;) is made by mixing water with &quot;maesil-cheong&quot; (plum syrup) and is served either hot or cold.

In Japan, a similar drink is made from green plums and tastes sweet and tangy, is considered a cold, refreshing drink, and is often enjoyed in the summer.

==== Condiment ====
A thick, sweet Chinese sauce called &quot;meijiang&quot; () or &quot;meizijiang&quot; (), usually translated as &quot;plum sauce&quot;, is also made from the plums, along with other ingredients such as sugar, vinegar, salt, ginger, chili, and garlic. Similar to duck sauce, it is used as a condiment for various Chinese dishes, including poultry dishes and egg rolls.

In Korea, &quot;maesil-cheong&quot; (, &quot;plum syrup&quot;), a syrup made by sugaring ripe plums, is used as a condiment and sugar substitute. It can be made by simply mixing plums and sugar together, and then leaving them for about 100 days. To make syrup, the ratio of sugar to plum should be at least 1:1 to prevent fermentation, by which the liquid may turn into plum wine. The plums can be removed after 100 days, and the syrup can be consumed right away, or mature for a year or more.

==== Flower pancake ====

In Korea, &quot;hwajeon&quot; (; &quot;flower pancake&quot;) can be made with plum blossoms. Called &quot;maehwa-jeon&quot; (; &quot;plum blossom pancake&quot;), the pancake dish is usually sweet, with honey as an ingredient.

==== Liquor ====

Plum liquor, also known as plum wine, is popular in both Japan and Korea, and is also produced in China. &quot;Umeshu&quot; (; &quot;plum wine&quot;) is a Japanese alcoholic drink made by steeping green plums in shōchū (clear liquor). It is sweet and smooth. A similar liquor in Korea, called &quot;maesil-ju&quot; (; &quot;plum wine&quot;), is marketed under various brand names, including Mae hwa soo, Matchsoon, and Seoljungmae. Both the Japanese and Korean varieties of plum liquor are available with whole plum fruits contained in the bottle. In China, plum wine is called &quot;méijiǔ&quot; ().

In Taiwan, a popular 1950s innovation over the Japanese-style plum wine is the &quot;wumeijiu&quot; (; &quot;smoked plum liquor&quot;), which is made by mixing two types of plum liquor, &quot;meijiu&quot; () made of &quot;P. mume&quot; and &quot;lijiu&quot; (), made of &quot;P. salicina&quot;, and oolong tea liquor.

In Vietnam, ripe plums are macerated in sticky rice liquor. The resulting liquor is called &quot;&quot;. A brand selling plum liquor is Sơn Tinh.

==== Pickled and preserved plums ====
In Chinese cuisine, plums pickled with vinegar and salt are called &quot;suanmeizi&quot; (; &quot;sour plum fruits&quot;), and have an intensely sour and salty flavour. They are generally made from unripe plum fruits. &quot;Huamei&quot; () are Chinese preserved plums and refer to Chinese plums pickled in sugar, salt, and herbs. There are two general varieties: a dried variety, and a wet (pickled) variety.

&quot;Umeboshi&quot; () are pickled and dried plums. They are a Japanese specialty. Pickled with coarse salt, they are quite salty and sour, and therefore eaten sparingly. They are often red in colour when purple shiso leaves are used. Plums used for making &quot;umeboshi&quot; are harvested in late May or early June, while they are ripe enough in yellow, and layered with much salt. They are weighed down with a heavy stone (or some more modern implement) until late August. They are then dried in the sun on bamboo mats for several days (they are returned to the salt at night). The flavonoid pigment in shiso leaves gives them their distinctive colour and a richer flavour. &quot;Umeboshi&quot; are generally eaten with rice as part of a bento (boxed lunch), although they may also be used in makizushi (rolled sushi). &quot;Umeboshi&quot; are also used as a popular filling for rice balls (onigiri) wrapped in nori. Makizushi made with plums may be made with either &quot;umeboshi&quot; or &quot;bainiku&quot; (&quot;umeboshi&quot; paste), often in conjunction with green shiso leaves. A byproduct of &quot;umeboshi&quot; production is &quot;umeboshi&quot; vinegar, a salty, sour condiment.

In Korea, there is &#x27;maesil-jangajji&#x27; which is similar to &#x27;umeboshi&#x27;. It is a common side dish in Korea.

A very similar variety of pickled plum, &#x27; or &#x27; is used in Vietnamese cuisine. The best fruit for this are from the forest around the Hương Pagoda in Hà Tây Province.

==== Chinese ====
The plum blossom, which is known as the &quot;meihua&quot; (), is one of the most beloved flowers in China and has been frequently depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries. The plum blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring. The blossoms are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, exuding an ethereal elegance, while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year. Therefore, the plum blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life. In Confucianism, the plum blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue. More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.

Because it blossoms in the cold winter, the plum blossom is regarded as one of the &quot;Three Friends of Winter&quot;, along with pine, and bamboo. The plum blossom is also regarded as one of the &quot;Four Gentlemen&quot; of flowers in Chinese art, together with the orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo. It is one of the &quot;Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot;, which consist of the orchid (spring), the lotus (summer), the chrysanthemum (autumn) and the plum blossom (winter). These groupings are seen repeatedly in the Chinese aesthetic of art, painting, literature, and garden design.

An example of the plum blossom&#x27;s literary significance is found in the life and work of poet Lin Bu () of the Song dynasty (960–1279). For much of his later life, Lin Bu lived in quiet reclusion on a cottage by West Lake in Hangzhou, China. According to stories, he loved plum blossoms and cranes so much that he considered the plum blossom of Solitary Hill at West Lake as his wife and the cranes of the lake as his children, thus he could live peacefully in solitude. One of his most famous poems is &quot;Little Plum Blossom of Hill Garden&quot; (). The Chinese text, as well as a translation, follows:
As with the literary culture amongst the educated of the time, Lin Bu&#x27;s poems were discussed in several Song dynasty era commentaries on poetry. Wang Junqing remarked after quoting the third and fourth line: &quot;&quot;This is from Lin Hejing&#x27;s [Lin Bu&#x27;s] plum blossom poem. Yet these lines might just as well be applied to the flowering apricot, peach, or pear.&quot;—a comparison of the flowers with the plum blossom to which the renowned Song dynasty poet Su Dongpo () replied, &quot;Well, yes, they might. But I&#x27;m afraid the flowers of those other trees wouldn&#x27;t presume to accept such praise.&quot;&quot; Plum blossoms inspired many people of the era.

Legend has it that once on the 7th day of the 1st lunar month, while Princess Shouyang (), daughter of Emperor Wu of Liu Song (), was resting under the eaves of Hanzhang Palace near the plum trees after wandering in the gardens, a plum blossom drifted down onto her fair face, leaving a floral imprint on her forehead that enhanced her beauty further. The court ladies were said to be so impressed that they started decorating their own foreheads with a small delicate plum blossom design. This is also the mythical origin of the floral fashion, &quot;meihua chuang&quot; (梅花妝; literally &quot;plum blossom makeup&quot;), that originated in the Southern Dynasties (420–589) and became popular amongst ladies in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties. The markings of plum blossom designs on the foreheads of court ladies were usually made with paintlike materials such as sorghum powder, gold powder, paper, jade, and other tint substances. Princess Shouyang is celebrated as the goddess of the plum blossom in Chinese culture.

During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the garden designer Ji Cheng wrote his definitive garden architecture monograph &quot;Yuanye&quot; and in it, he described the plum tree as the &quot;beautiful woman of the forest and moon&quot;. The appreciation of nature at night plays an important role in Chinese gardens. For this reason, there are classical pavilions for the tradition of viewing plum blossoms by the moonlight. The flowers are viewed and enjoyed by many as annual plum blossom festivals take place in the blooming seasons of the &quot;meihua&quot;. The festivals take place throughout China (for example, West Lake in Hangzhou and scenic spots near Zijin Mountain in Nanjing, amongst other places). Plum blossoms are often used as decoration during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and remain popular in the miniature gardening plants of the art of penjing. Branches of plum blossoms are often arranged in porcelain or ceramic vases, such as the meiping (literally &quot;plum vase&quot;). These vases can hold single branches of plum blossoms and have been traditionally used to display the blossoms in a home since the early Song dynasty (960–1279).

The Moy Yat lineage of Wing Chun kung fu uses a red plum flower blossom as its symbol. The plum blossoms are featured on one of the four flowers that appear on mahjong tile sets, where &quot;mei&quot; () is usually simply translated as &quot;plum&quot; in English.

It has been suggested that the Japanese practice of &quot;hanami&quot; may have originated from the Chinese custom of enjoying poetry and wine underneath plum blossom trees while viewing their flowers, that was replicated by Japanese elites. This is supported by the fact that &quot;hanami&quot; started in urban areas rather than rural areas, that Japanese people initially admired plum blossoms like the Chinese rather than cherry blossoms, and that classic Japanese poetry does not associate cherry blossoms with merriness.

The National Flower of the Republic of China (Taiwan) was officially designated as the plum blossom (&quot;Prunus Mei&quot;; ) by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China on July 21, 1964. The plum blossom is the symbol for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity during the harsh winter. The triple grouping of stamens (three stamens per petal) on the national emblem represents Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People, while the five petals symbolize the five branches of the government. It also serves as the logo of China Airlines, the national carrier of Taiwan (the Republic of China). The flower is featured on some New Taiwan dollar coins.

==== Korean ====
In Korea, the plum blossom is a symbol for spring. It is a popular flower motif, amongst other flowers, for Korean embroidery. Maebyong are plum vases derived from the Chinese meiping and are traditionally used to hold branches of plum blossoms in Korea. Korean ceramist Master Kim Se-yong incorporates the blossom into many of his openwork celadon vases.

Also, during Korean Empire period, the plum blossom became the imperial seal and royal official flower. Since ancient times, plum blossom has been filled with meaning and mystery. Plum blossoms bloom at the end of the winter, and because of this, they are called the herald of spring. They also symbolize perseverance because of how they can possibly bloom during the cold winter. Since they are considered the first flower of the year, they also represent purity and renewal. Plum flowers have five petals which are believed to carry 5 different blessings such as: wealth, health, virtue, peaceful and natural death.

==== Japanese ====
Plum blossoms are often mentioned in Japanese poetry as a symbol of spring, as well as elegance and purity. When used in haiku or renga, they are a &quot;kigo&quot; or season word for early spring. The blossoms are associated with the Japanese bush warbler and are depicted together on one of the twelve suits of hanafuda (Japanese playing cards). Plum blossoms were favored during the Nara period (710–794) until the emergence of the Heian period (794–1185), in which the cherry blossom was preferred.

Japanese tradition holds that the &quot;ume&quot; functions as a protective charm against evil, so the &quot;ume&quot; is traditionally planted in the northeast of the garden, the direction from which evil is believed to come. The eating of the pickled fruit for breakfast is also supposed to stave off misfortune.

The tradition of hanami was originally performed with plum blossoms rather than cherry blossoms as is common today. The specific custom of viewing plum blossoms in Japan is now called &quot;umemi&quot; (梅見, plum-viewing).

=== Southeast Asia ===
==== Vietnamese ====
In Vietnam, due to the beauty of the tree and its flowers, the word &quot;mai&quot; is used to name girls. The largest hospital in Hanoi is named Bạch Mai (white plum blossom), another hospital in Hanoi is named Mai Hương (&quot;the scent of plum&quot;), situated in Hồng Mai (pink plum blossom) street. Hoàng Mai (yellow plum blossom) is the name of a district in Hanoi. Bạch Mai is also a long and old street in Hanoi. All these places are located in the south part of Hanoi, where, in the past, many &quot;P. mume&quot; trees were grown.

<doc id="370866" wikidata="Q318209" url="?curid=370866" title="Shintaro Abe">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1982 to 1986. He was a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He was the father of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and part of the Satō–Kishi–Abe family.

==Early life and education==
Shintaro Abe was born on April 29, 1924, in Tokyo, the only son of politician and member of Parliament Kan Abe. He was raised in his father&#x27;s home prefecture of Yamaguchi from soon after his birth. His mother was an army general&#x27;s daughter.

== Personal life ==

Abe married Yoko Kishi, daughter of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in 1951. His second son, Shinzo Abe, served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2020. His third son, Nobuo Kishi, was adopted by his brother-in-law shortly after birth, won a House of Representatives seat in 2012 and was appointed Minister of Defense in 2020. He was from Yamaguchi Prefecture.

==Career==
After graduating from high school in 1944 during World War II, Abe entered a naval aviation school and volunteered to become a kamikaze pilot. The war ended before he could undergo the required training. In 1949 he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Tokyo, Shintaro Abe began his career as a political reporter for &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. He became a politician in 1957, when he started working as a legislative aide of his father in-law, the then-prime minister Nobusuke Kishi. He won his father&#x27;s seat in the House of Representatives in 1958.

He led a major LDP faction, the conservative Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai, whose reins he took from former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda in July 1986, and held a variety of ministerial and party posts, the former of which included Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of International Trade and Industry. Abe was named as Minister of International Trade and Industry in the cabinet of the then prime minister Zenkō Suzuki on November 30, 1981. During this period, he was seen as a young leader groomed for the future prime ministry. In November 1982, he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of the then-prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, replacing Yoshio Sakurauchi. His term lasted until 1986.

Abe was a top contender to succeed Nakasone as prime minister in 1987, until he stepped aside for Noboru Takeshita, head of a powerful rival faction. Then, he was given the post of secretary general of the party in 1987. In 1988, his chances of becoming prime minister some time in the near future were again thwarted when his name became associated with the Recruit-Cosmos insider-trading stock scandal, which brought down Takeshita and forced Abe to resign as the party&#x27;s secretary general in December 1988.

==Death==
Shintaro Abe was hospitalized in January 1991. He died at Tokyo&#x27;s Juntendo University Hospital on May 15, 1991, aged 67. The cause of death was liver failure.

==Honours==

<text>Meredith Louise Vieira (born December 30, 1953) is an American broadcast journalist and television personality. She is best known as the original moderator of the daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot; (1997–2006), the original host of the syndicated daytime version of the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (2002–2013), and as co-host of the NBC morning news program &quot;Today&quot; (2006–2011). , she hosts the syndicated weekday game show &quot;25 Words or Less&quot;.

Vieira has also been a contributor to &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;, and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and hosted the Lifetime television series &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; (1994–2005). From 2014 to 2016, she hosted her own syndicated daytime talk show, &quot;The Meredith Vieira Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Vieira was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and raised in nearby East Providence, the daughter of Mary Elsie (Rosa), a homemaker, and Edwin Vieira, a medical doctor, both first-generation Portuguese Americans. She is the youngest of four children, with three older brothers. All four of Vieira&#x27;s grandparents came from the Azores—three from Faial Island, one of the nine islands in the archipelago. The family name Vieira means &quot;scallop&quot; in Portuguese. They emigrated to New England in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, settling around Providence, Rhode Island. Vieira was raised in the Roman Catholic faith, but she has stated in recent interviews that she has &quot;spirituality, not a religion&quot;.

Vieira attended the Lincoln School, a Quaker all-girls school in Providence, graduating in 1971. She graduated with a degree in English from Tufts University in 1975.

==Career==

===Beginnings on radio and local TV (1975–1982)===
Vieira began her broadcasting career in 1975 as a news announcer for WORC radio in Worcester, Massachusetts, doing afternoon-drive news during the &quot;B. J. Dean Show&quot;. She began a career in television working as a local reporter and anchor at WJAR-TV in Providence, eventually making her way into the newsroom at WCBS-TV in New York City where she was an investigative reporter from 1979 to 1982.

===CBS News (1982–1993)===
Vieira first gained national recognition as a CBS reporter based in its Chicago bureau from 1982 to 1984. She later became a correspondent for nationwide news-magazine shows including &quot;West 57th&quot; (1985–89) and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (1989–91). Her final assignment at CBS was as co-anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; (1992–93).

===Move to ABC, &quot;Turning Point&quot;; &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot;; &quot;The View&quot; (1994–2006)===
Vieira moved to ABC initially as one of six regular correspondents for the news-magazine show &quot;Turning Point&quot; (1994–99), and was also the host of the Lifetime Network&#x27;s show &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot;, which debuted on January 3, 1995, and ran until August 28, 2004.

Vieira served as the original moderator and co-host of ABC&#x27;s daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot; from its debut on August 11, 1997, until June 9, 2006. As moderator, she was responsible for opening and closing each of the show&#x27;s live episodes, introducing &quot;Hot Topics,&quot; guiding conversations, and breaking to commercials. On her final episode of &quot;The View&quot;, Vieira&#x27;s co-hosts gave her a roast to commemorate her departure.

Vieira explained what led her to become &quot;The View&quot;&#x27;s moderator in an interview with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, by making the following statement:

In August 2006, Vieira told &quot;Time&quot; that she hasn&#x27;t watched &quot;The View&quot; since she left the show, except the episode when Star Jones announced she was leaving. She said it was &quot;very sad&quot; what&#x27;s happened to it: &quot;I&#x27;m proud of the work we did there, but it&#x27;s not a good time in the history of the show... It&#x27;s hard to watch. It sort of became a joke.&quot; On August 29, 2006, Vieira told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that she didn&#x27;t mean that &quot;The View&quot; was a joke. She said the interview was taken out of context. &quot;I felt that the media was turning [&quot;The View&quot;] into a joke, not that the show was a joke,&quot; she says. &quot;Time&quot; added a clarification to its website, saying &quot;[Vieira] assures &quot;Time&quot; that in no way were her comments meant to be insensitive or derogatory...&quot;

===&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (2002–2013)===
Vieira became the first host of the American syndicated version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; on September 16, 2002; prior to that, American audiences had known it as a primetime show on ABC hosted by Regis Philbin. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell (who would later succeed Vieira on &quot;The View&quot;) was originally offered to host the syndicated version, but rejected it almost immediately. Vieira won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host for her hosting duties on &quot;Millionaire&quot; (one in 2005, the other in 2009); as such, she is the second woman ever to win an Emmy Award in this category (after Betty White for &quot;Just Men!&quot; in 1983), and the first to win multiple times. In addition to hosting the show, Vieira also served as its co-executive producer, a title that she would hold from 2005 until her departure from the show.

ABC originally offered Vieira hosting duties on the syndicated &quot;Millionaire&quot; to sweeten one of her re-negotiations for &quot;The View&quot;. When the show was honored by GSN on its 2007 &quot;Gameshow Hall of Fame&quot; special, one of the show&#x27;s executive producers, Leigh Hampton, said that when the syndicated version was being developed, the production team felt that it was not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them. After O&#x27;Donnell declined the opportunity to host the syndicated version, Vieira was the one that the team settled on, because she had the above-mentioned qualities. On the special, Vieira herself gave the following explanation for why she decided to host the syndicated &quot;Millionaire&quot;:

Prior to hosting the syndicated version of &quot;Millionaire&quot;, Vieira was a celebrity contestant in a special tournament on the third season of the original primetime version, winning $250,000 for her selected charitable organization, the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund. Seven and three-quarter years later, she would even turn the tables on Philbin himself with her surprise appearance on the finale of the show&#x27;s 10th anniversary primetime revival on August 23, 2009—hosting its final segment while giving him the opportunity to answer one question in order to win $50,000 for his selected organization, Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx.

On January 10, 2013, Vieira announced that after eleven seasons with the syndicated &quot;Millionaire&quot;, throughout which she had hosted more than 1,800 episodes and offered a vast multitude of contestants a combined total of over $70,000,000, she would be leaving the show as part of an effort to focus on other projects in her career. She finalized taping of her last episodes with the show in November 2012.

===&quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The Meredith Vieira Show&quot; (2006–2016)===

Vieira accepted an offer to succeed Katie Couric as co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot; on April 6, 2006, the day after Couric announced that she would depart the show to become anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. The following day, Vieira announced on &quot;The View&quot; that she would be leaving the show to be co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot;, a role that &quot;The View&quot; co-host and ABC News journalist Barbara Walters had filled nearly four decades earlier during her tenure at NBC during the 1960s and 1970s. Vieira was replaced as the moderator of &quot;The View&quot; by Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Vieira hosted the show with Matt Lauer from September 13, 2006, through June 8, 2011, also becoming a contributing anchor for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;.

Vieira continued as host of &quot;Millionaire&quot; while appearing on &quot;Today&quot;. As part of her contract with &quot;Millionaire&quot;, Vieira agreed not to appear on &quot;Today&quot; during hours that would conflict with the airing of the game show on competing stations. As a result, she rarely appeared on the third or fourth hours of &quot;Today&quot;. Her first appearance during the third hour came on June 25, 2008, for &quot;&quot;Today&quot; Throws a Wedding&quot;. She also appeared during the entire third hour during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics and the Barack Obama inauguration on January 20, 2009.

Vieira announced on May 9, 2011, that she would depart as co-host in the following month but would remain with &quot;Today&quot; in the role of special correspondent. Her last appearance as regular co-host was on June 8; she returned to the show for the Halloween broadcast on October 31, 2011, and again as special co-host with Matt Lauer in London, United Kingdom for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. She has remained with NBC in a minimized role and became a contributor to &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and a correspondent on &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;. In January 2013, she filled in for Kathie Lee Gifford on the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot;, appearing alongside Hoda Kotb, and she reported the story &quot;Inconceivable&quot; on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;.

Vieira was one of the hosts for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 London Summer Olympics. She and co-host Matt Lauer were criticized for their NBC coverage of the opening ceremony. Vieira also provided some &quot;Today&quot; Olympics coverage during the games. Vieira co-hosted the opening ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics with Matt Lauer, and was slated to provide coverage during the two weeks of the games. On February 14, 2014, she became the first woman to solo anchor NBC&#x27;s Olympics prime time coverage, alternated with Lauer while covering for an ailing Bob Costas.

In July 2013, Vieira announced that she would begin hosting her own syndicated afternoon daytime talk show, &quot;The Meredith Vieira Show&quot;, starting in September 2014, produced by NBCUniversal Television Distribution. On January 4, 2016, it was announced that the show would be ending after two seasons. The talk show aired from September 8, 2014 to May 20, 2016 and ended with 290 episodes.

Vieira guest anchored &quot;Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot; for a few episodes in 2019, due to host Hoda Kotb being on maternity leave.

=== Other television work ===
In May 2018, Vieira co-hosted Royal Wedding Watch with Matt Baker, PBS&#x27;s weeklong coverage of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

=== &quot;25 Words or Less&quot; (2019–present) ===
Vieira returned to daytime TV in the fall of 2019 as host of the syndicated game show &quot;25 Words or Less&quot; from Fox Television Stations. Based on a board game, the show pairs contestants with celebrities in an effort to guess a list of five words using less than 25 words in total.

==Personal life==
Vieira married CBS News journalist Richard M. Cohen on June 14, 1986. They lived in Irvington, Westchester County, New York. Cohen had multiple sclerosis since he was 25 years old, and had two bouts of colon cancer, one in 1999 and one a year later. Her husband died on Christmas Eve 2024 at the age of 76 after living with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years.
Vieira and Cohen have three children; their younger son, Gabe Cohen, is a reporter for CNN based out of their Washington, D.C. bureau.

===Balancing family and career===
Vieira joined &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1989, following the birth of her first child. Don Hewitt, executive producer of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, allowed her to work part-time for two seasons so she could care for her child. After that, it was arranged that she would work full-time. But after two years, she became pregnant again and asked to continue the part-time arrangement. Hewitt declined her request, firing her, and deciding instead to hire someone who would work full-time. Her departure from the show garnered headlines, as a national debate started to take place about whether women could balance both family and career. She turned down opportunities to co-host ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot; when her children were young.

Vieira discusses her family and career decisions in the book &quot;Divided Lives: The Public and Private Struggles of Three Accomplished Women&quot; by Elsa Walsh.

<doc id="370874" wikidata="Q4114998" url="?curid=370874" title="Lévy flight">
<text>A Lévy flight is a random walk in which the step-lengths have a stable distribution, a probability distribution that is heavy-tailed. When defined as a walk in a space of dimension greater than one, the steps made are in isotropic random directions. Later researchers have extended the use of the term &quot;Lévy flight&quot; to also include cases where the random walk takes place on a discrete grid rather than on a continuous space.

The term &quot;Lévy flight&quot; was coined after Paul Lévy by Benoît Mandelbrot, who used this for one specific definition of the distribution of step sizes. He used the term Cauchy flight for the case where the distribution of step sizes is a Cauchy distribution, and Rayleigh flight for when the distribution is a normal distribution (which is not an example of a heavy-tailed probability distribution).

The particular case for which Mandelbrot used the term &quot;Lévy flight&quot; is defined by the survival function of the distribution of step-sizes, &quot;U&quot;, being

:formula_1

Here &quot;D&quot; is a parameter related to the fractal dimension and the distribution is a particular case of the Pareto distribution.

==Properties==

Lévy flights are, by construction, Markov processes. For general distributions of the step-size, satisfying the power-like condition, the distance from the origin of the random walk tends, after a large number of steps, to a stable distribution due to the generalized central limit theorem, enabling many processes to be modeled using Lévy flights.

The probability densities for particles undergoing a Levy flight can be modeled using a generalized version of the Fokker–Planck equation, which is usually used to model Brownian motion. The equation requires the use of fractional derivatives. For jump lengths which have a symmetric probability distribution, the equation takes a simple form in terms of the Riesz fractional derivative. In one dimension, the equation reads as 
:formula_2
where &quot;γ&quot; is a constant akin to the diffusion constant, &quot;α&quot; is the stability parameter and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is the potential. The Riesz derivative can be understood in terms of its Fourier Transform. 
:formula_3
This can be easily extended to multiple dimensions.

Another important property of the Lévy flight is that of diverging variances in all cases except that of &quot;α&quot; = 2, i.e. Brownian motion. In general, the θ fractional moment of the distribution diverges if &quot;α&quot; ≤ &quot;θ&quot;. Also,

: formula_4

The exponential scaling of the step lengths gives Lévy flights a scale invariant property, and they are used to model data that exhibits clustering.


==Applications==

The definition of a Lévy flight stems from the mathematics related to chaos theory and is useful in stochastic measurement and simulations for random or pseudo-random natural phenomena. Examples include earthquake data analysis, financial mathematics, cryptography, signals analysis as well as many applications in astronomy, biology, and physics.

It has been found that jumping between climate states observed in the paleoclimatic record can be described as a Lévy flight or an alpha-stable process 
Another application is the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis. When sharks and other ocean predators cannot find food, they abandon the Brownian motion, the random motion seen in swirling gas molecules, for the Lévy flight — a mix of long trajectories and short, random movements found in turbulent fluids. Researchers analyzed over 12 million movements recorded over 5,700 days in 55 data-logger-tagged animals from 14 ocean predator species in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including silky sharks, yellowfin tuna, blue marlin and swordfish. The data showed that Lévy flights interspersed with Brownian motion can describe the animals&#x27; hunting patterns. Birds and other animals (including humans) follow paths that have been modeled using Lévy flight (e.g. when searching for food). An example of an animal, specifically a beetle, that uses Lévy flight patterns is Pterostichus melanarius. When the beetles are hungry and food is scarce, they avoid searching for prey in locations that other individuals of &quot;P. melanarius&quot; have visited. This behavior is optimal for widely dispersed prey that may not always be fully consumed at one time, such as slugs. 

Additionally, biological flight can also apparently be mimicked by other models such as composite correlated random walks, which grow across scales to converge on optimal Lévy walks. Composite Brownian walks can be finely tuned to theoretically optimal Lévy walks but they are not as efficient as Lévy search across most landscapes types, suggesting selection pressure for Lévy walk characteristics is more likely than multi-scaled normal diffusive patterns.

Furthermore, it has been shown that Lévy walk appears in high-energy particle physics as well. Observations indicate that Lévy-processes occur in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Here, hadronic scattering and decays after a high-energy heavy-ion collision lead to power-law tailed spatial particle creation (hadron freeze-out from the quark-gluon plasma) distributions.

Efficient routing in a network can be performed by links having a Levy flight length distribution with specific values of alpha.

<text>A dialect continuum or dialect chain is a series of language varieties spoken across some geographical area such that neighboring varieties are mutually intelligible, but the differences accumulate over distance so that widely separated varieties may not be. This is a typical occurrence with widely spread languages and language families around the world, when these languages did not spread recently. Some prominent examples include the Indo-Aryan languages across large parts of India, varieties of Arabic across north Africa and southwest Asia, the Turkic languages, the varieties of Chinese, and parts of the Romance, Germanic and Slavic families in Europe. Terms used in older literature include dialect area (Leonard Bloomfield) and L-complex (Charles F. Hockett).

Dialect continua typically occur in long-settled agrarian populations, as innovations spread from their various points of origin as waves. In this situation, hierarchical classifications of varieties are impractical. Instead, dialectologists map variation of various language features across a dialect continuum, drawing lines called isoglosses between areas that differ with respect to some feature.

A variety within a dialect continuum may be developed and codified as a standard language, and then serve as an authority for part of the continuum, e.g. within a particular political unit or geographical area.
Since the early 20th century, the increasing dominance of nation-states and their standard languages has been steadily eliminating the nonstandard dialects that comprise dialect continua, making the boundaries ever more abrupt and well-defined.

== Dialect geography ==

Dialectologists record variation across a dialect continuum using maps of various features collected in a linguistic atlas, beginning with an atlas of German dialects by Georg Wenker (from 1888), based on a postal survey of schoolmasters. The influential &quot;Atlas linguistique de la France&quot; (1902–10) pioneered the use of a trained fieldworker. These atlases typically consist of &quot;display maps&quot;, each showing local forms of a particular item at the survey locations.

Secondary studies may include &quot;interpretive maps&quot;, showing the areal distribution of various variants. A common tool in these maps is an isogloss, a line separating areas where different variants of a particular feature predominate.

In a dialect continuum, isoglosses for different features are typically spread out, reflecting the gradual transition between varieties. A bundle of coinciding isoglosses indicates a stronger dialect boundary, as might occur at geographical obstacles or long-standing political boundaries. In other cases, intersecting isoglosses and more complex patterns are found.

== Relationship with standard varieties ==
Standard varieties may be developed and codified at one or more locations in a continuum until they have independent cultural status (autonomy), a process the German linguist Heinz Kloss called &quot;ausbau&quot;. Speakers of local varieties typically read and write a related standard variety, use it for official purposes, hear it on radio and television, and consider it the standard form of their speech, so that any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that variety. In such cases the local variety is said to be dependent on, or heteronomous with respect to, the standard variety.

A standard variety together with its dependent varieties is commonly considered a &quot;language&quot;, with the dependent varieties called &quot;dialects&quot; of the language, even if the standard is mutually intelligible with another standard from the same continuum. The Scandinavian languages, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, are often cited as examples. Conversely, a language defined in this way may include local varieties that are mutually unintelligible, such as the German dialects.

The choice of standard is often determined by a political boundary, which may cut across a dialect continuum.
As a result, speakers on either side of the boundary may use almost identical varieties, but treat them as dependent on different standards, and thus part of different &quot;languages&quot;.
The various local dialects then tend to be leveled towards their respective standard varieties, disrupting the previous dialect continuum.
Examples include the boundaries between Dutch and German, between Czech, Slovak and Polish, and between Belarusian and Ukrainian.

The choice may be a matter of national, regional or religious identity, and may be controversial.
Examples of controversies are regions such as the disputed territory of Kashmir, in which local Muslims usually regard their language as Urdu, the national standard of Pakistan, while Hindus regard the same speech as Hindi, an official standard of India. Even so, the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution contains a list of 22 scheduled languages and Urdu is among them.

During the time of the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia, a standard was developed from local varieties of Eastern South Slavic, within a continuum with Torlakian to the north and Bulgarian to the east. The standard was based on varieties that were most different from standard Bulgarian. Now known as Macedonian, it is the national standard of North Macedonia, but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.

==Europe==

Europe provides several examples of dialect continua, the largest of which involve the Germanic, Romance and Slavic branches of the Indo-European language family, the continent&#x27;s largest language branches.

The Romance area spanned much of the territory of the Roman Empire but was split into western and eastern portions by the Slav Migrations into the Balkans in the 7th and 8th centuries.

The Slavic area was in turn split by the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the 9th and 10th centuries.

=== Germanic languages ===
==== North Germanic continuum ====

The Norwegian, Danish and Swedish dialects comprise a classic example of a dialect continuum, encompassing Norway, Denmark, Sweden and coastal parts of Finland. The Continental North Germanic standard languages (Norwegian, Danish and Swedish) are close enough and intelligible enough for some to consider them to be dialects of the same language, but the Insular ones (Faroese and Icelandic) are not immediately intelligible to the other North Germanic speakers.

==== Continental West Germanic continuum ====

Historically, the Dutch, Frisian, Low Saxon and High German dialects formed a canonical dialect continuum, which has been gradually falling apart since the Late Middle Ages due to the pressures of modern education, standard languages, migration and weakening knowledge of the dialects.

The transition from German dialects to Dutch variants followed two basic routes: 
* From Central German to Southeastern Dutch (Limburgish) in the so-called Rhenish fan, an area corresponding largely to the modern Niederrhein in which gradual but geographically compact changes took place.
* From Low Saxon to Northwestern Dutch (Hollandic): This sub-continuum also included West Frisian dialects up until the 17th century, but faced external pressure from Standard Dutch and, after the collapse of the Hanseatic League, from Standard German which greatly influenced the vocabularies of these border dialects.

Though the internal dialect continua of both Dutch and German remain largely intact, the continuum which historically connected the Dutch, Frisian and German languages has largely disintegrated. Fragmentary areas of the Dutch-German border in which language change is more gradual than in other sections or a higher degree of mutual intelligibility is present still exist, such as the Aachen-Kerkrade area, but the historical chain in which dialects were only divided by minor isoglosses and negligible differences in vocabulary has seen a rapid and ever-increasing decline since the 1850s.

Standard Dutch was based on the dialects of the principal Brabantic and Hollandic cities. The written form of Standard German originated in the East Central German used at the chancery of the kingdom of Saxony, while the spoken form emerged later, based on North German pronunciations of the written standard. Being based on widely separated dialects, the Dutch and German standards do not show a high degree of mutual intelligibility when spoken and only partially so when written. One study concluded that, when concerning written language, Dutch speakers could translate 50.2% of the provided German words correctly, while the German subjects were able to translate 41.9% of the Dutch equivalents correctly. In terms of orthography, 22% of the vocabulary of Dutch and German is identical or near-identical.

==== Anglic continuum ====
The Germanic dialects spoken on the island of Great Britain comprise areal varieties of English in England and of Scots in Scotland. Those of large areas north and south of the border are often mutually intelligible. In contrast, the Orcadian dialect of Scots is very different from the dialects of English in southern England—but they are linked by a chain of intermediate varieties.

=== Romance languages ===
====Western Romance continuum====

The western continuum of Romance languages comprises, from West to East: in Portugal, Portuguese; in Spain, Galician, Leonese or Asturian, Castilian or Spanish, Aragonese and Catalan or Valencian; in France, Occitan, Franco-Provençal, standard French and Corsican which is closely related to Italian; in Italy, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Lombard, Emilian, Romagnol, Italian Gallo-Picene, Venetian, Friulian, Ladin; and in Switzerland, Lombard and Romansh. This continuum is sometimes presented as another example, but the major languages in the group (i.e. Portuguese, Spanish, French and Italian) have had separate standards for longer than the languages in the Continental West Germanic group, and so are not commonly classified as dialects of a common language.

Focusing instead on the local Romance lects that pre-existed the establishment of national or regional standard languages, all evidence and principles point to &quot;Romania continua&quot; as having been, and to varying extents in some areas still being, what Charles Hockett called an L-complex, i.e. an unbroken chain of local differentiation such that, in principle and with appropriate caveats, intelligibility (due to sharing of features) attenuates with distance. This is perhaps most evident today in Italy, where, especially in rural and small-town contexts, local Romance is still often employed at home and work, and geolinguistic distinctions are such that while native speakers from any two nearby towns can understand each other with ease, they can also spot from linguistic features that the other is from elsewhere.

In recent centuries, the intermediate dialects between the major Romance languages have been moving toward extinction, as their speakers have switched to varieties closer to the more prestigious national standards. That has been most notable in France, owing to the French government&#x27;s refusal to recognise minority languages, but it has occurred to some extent in all Western Romance speaking countries. Language change has also threatened the survival of stateless languages with existing literary standards, such as Occitan.

The Romance languages of Italy are a less arguable example of a dialect continuum. For many decades since Italy&#x27;s unification, the attitude of the French government towards the ethnolinguistic minorities was copied by the Italian government.

====Eastern Romance continuum====

The eastern Romance continuum is dominated by Romanian. Outside Romania and Moldova, across the other south-east European countries, various Romanian language groups are to be found: pockets of various Romanian and Aromanian subgroups survive throughout Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, Albania and Croatia (mostly in Istria).

=== Slavic languages ===

Conventionally, on the basis of extralinguistic features (such as writing systems or the former western frontier of the Soviet Union), the North Slavic continuum is split into East and West Slavic continua. From the perspective of linguistic features alone, only two Slavic (dialect) continua can be distinguished, namely North and South, separated from each other by a band of non-Slavic languages: Romanian, Hungarian and German.

==== North Slavic continuum ====

The North Slavic continuum covers the East Slavic and West Slavic languages. East Slavic includes Russian, Belarusian, Rusyn and Ukrainian; West Slavic languages of Czech, Polish, Slovak, Silesian, Kashubian, and Upper and Lower Sorbian. Eastern Slovak and Pannonian Rusyn stand out as sharing features with Slovak, Polish and Rusyn, thus serving as a transition between West and East Slavic languages.

==== South Slavic continuum ====
All South Slavic languages form a dialect continuum. It comprises, from West to East, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. Standard Slovene, Macedonian, and Bulgarian are each based on a distinct dialect, but the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard varieties of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language are all based on the same dialect, Shtokavian. 
Therefore, Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins communicate fluently with each other in their respective standardized varieties. In Croatia, native speakers of Shtokavian may struggle to understand distinct Kajkavian or Chakavian dialects, as might the speakers of the two with each other. Likewise in Serbia, the Torlakian dialect differs significantly from Standard Serbian. Serbian is a Western South Slavic standard, but Torlakian is largely transitional with the Eastern South Slavic languages (Bulgarian and Macedonian). Collectively, the Torlakian dialects with Macedonian and Bulgarian share many grammatical features that set them apart from all other Slavic languages, such as the complete loss of its grammatical case systems and adoption of features more commonly found among analytic languages.

The barrier between &quot;East South Slavic&quot; and &quot;West South Slavic&quot; is historical and natural, caused primarily by a one-time geographical distance between speakers. The two varieties started diverging early on () and evolved separately ever since without major mutual influence, as evidenced by distinguishable Old Slavonic, while the western dialect of common Old Slavic was still spoken across the modern Serbo-Croatian area in the 12th and early 13th centuries. An intermediate dialect linking western and eastern variations inevitably came into existence over time – Torlakian – spoken across a wide radius on which the tripoint of Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Serbia is relatively pivotal.

=== Uralic languages ===

The other major language family in Europe besides Indo-European are the Uralic languages. The Sami languages, sometimes mistaken for a single language, are a dialect continuum, albeit with some disconnections like between North, Skolt and Inari Sami. The Baltic-Finnic languages spoken around the Gulf of Finland form a dialect continuum. Thus, although Finnish and Estonian are considered as separate languages, there is no definite linguistic border or isogloss that separates them. This is now more difficult to recognize because many of the intervening languages have declined or become extinct.

=== Goidelic continuum ===

The Goidelic languages consist of Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. Prior to the 19th and 20th centuries, the continuum existed throughout Ireland, the Isle of Man and Scotland. Many intermediate dialects have become extinct or have died out leaving major gaps between languages such as in the islands of Rathlin, Arran or Kintyre and also in the Irish counties of Antrim, Londonderry and Down.

The current Goidelic speaking areas of Ireland are also separated by extinct dialects but remain mutually intelligible.

==Middle East==

===Arabic===

Arabic is a standard case of diglossia. The standard written language, Modern Standard Arabic, is based on the Classical Arabic of the Qur&#x27;an, while the modern vernacular dialects (or languages) branched from ancient Arabic dialects, from North Western Africa through Egypt, Sudan, and the Fertile Crescent to the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq. The dialects use different analogues from the Arabic language inventory and have been influenced by different substrate and superstrate languages. Adjacent dialects are mutually understandable to a large extent, but those from distant regions are more difficult to be understood.

The difference between the written standard and the vernaculars is apparent also in the written language, and children have to be taught Modern Standard Arabic in school to be able to read it.

===Aramaic===
All modern Aramaic languages descend from a dialect continuum that historically existed through the Aramaization of the Levant (other than the original Aramaic-speaking parts) and Mesopotamia and before the Islamicization of the Levant and Mesopotamia. Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, including distinct varieties spoken by both Jews and Christians, is a dialect continuum although greatly disrupted by population displacement during the twentieth century.

=== Persian ===

The varieties of the Persian language, including Tajiki and Dari, form a dialect continuum. The divergence of Tajik was accelerated by the shift from the Perso-Arabic alphabet to a Cyrillic one under Soviet rule. Western dialects of Persian show greater influence from Arabic and Oghuz Turkic languages, but Dari and Tajik tend to preserve many classical features in grammar and vocabulary. Also the Tat language, a dialect of Persian, is spoken in Azerbaijan.

=== Turkic ===

Turkic languages are best described as a dialect continuum. Geographically this continuum starts at the Balkans in the west with Balkan Turkish, includes Turkish in Turkey and Azerbaijani language in Azerbaijan, extends into Iran with Azeri and Khalaj, into Iraq with Turkmen, across Central Asia to include Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, to southern Regions of Tajikistan and into Afghanistan. In the south, the continuum starts in northern Afghanistan, northward to Chuvashia. In the east it extends to the Republic of Tuva, the Xinjiang autonomous region in Western China with the Uyghur language and into Mongolia with Khoton. The entire territory is inhabited by Turkic speaking peoples. There are three varieties of Turkic geographically outside the continuum: Chuvash, Yakut and Dolgan. They have been geographically separated from the other Turkic languages for an extensive period of time, and Chuvash language stands out as the most divergent from other Turkic languages.

There are also Gagauz speakers in Moldavia and Urum speakers in Georgia.

The Turkic continuum makes internal genetic classification of the languages problematic. Chuvash, Khalaj and Yakut are generally classified as significantly distinct, but the remaining Turkic languages are quite similar, with a high degree of mutual intelligibility between not only geographically adjacent varieties but also among some varieties some distance apart. Structurally, the Turkic languages are very close to one another, and they share basic features such as SOV word order, vowel harmony and agglutination.

== Indo-Aryan languages ==

Many of the Indo-Aryan languages of the Indian subcontinent form a dialect continuum. What is called &quot;Hindi&quot; in India is frequently Standard Hindi, the Sanskritized register of the colloquial Hindustani spoken in the Delhi area, the other register being Urdu. However, the term Hindi is also used for the different dialects from Bihar to Rajasthan and, more widely, some of the Eastern and Northern dialects are sometimes grouped under Hindi. The Indo-Aryan Prakrits also gave rise to languages like Gujarati, Assamese, Maithili, Bengali, Odia, Nepali, Marathi, Konkani and Punjabi.

== Chinese ==

Chinese consists of hundreds of mutually unintelligible local varieties.
The differences are similar to those within the Romance languages, which are similarly descended from a language spread by imperial expansion over substrate languages 2000 years ago.
Unlike Europe, however, Chinese political unity was restored in the late 6th century and has persisted (with interludes of division) until the present day.
There are no equivalents of the local standard literary languages that developed in the numerous independent states of Europe.

Chinese dialectologists have divided the local varieties into a number of dialect groups, largely based on phonological developments in comparison with Middle Chinese.
Most of these groups are found in the rugged terrain of the southeast, reflecting the greater variation in this area, particularly in Fujian.
Each of these groups contains numerous mutually unintelligible varieties.
Moreover, in many cases the transitions between groups are smooth, as a result of centuries of interaction and multilingualism.

The boundaries between the northern Mandarin area and the central groups, Wu, Gan and Xiang, are particularly weak, due to the steady flow of northern features into these areas.
Transitional varieties between the Wu, Gan and Mandarin groups have been variously classified, with some scholars assigning them to a separate Hui group.
The boundaries between Gan, Hakka and Min are similarly indistinct. 
Pinghua and Yue form a dialect continuum (excluding urban enclaves of Cantonese).
There are sharper boundaries resulting from more recent expansion between Hakka and Yue, and between Southwestern Mandarin and Yue, but even here there has been considerable convergence in contact areas.

== Cree and Ojibwa ==

Cree is a group of closely related Algonquian languages that are distributed from Alberta to Labrador in Canada. They form the Cree-Montagnais-Naskapi dialect continuum, with around 117,410 speakers. The languages can be roughly classified into nine groups, from west to east:

* Plains Cree (y-dialect)
* Woods Cree or Woods/Rocky Cree (ð-dialect)
* Swampy Cree (n-dialect)
** Eastern Swampy Cree
** Western Swampy Cree
* Moose Cree (l-dialect)
* East Cree or James Bay Cree (y-dialect)
** Northern East Cree
** Southern East Cree
* Atikamekw (r-dialect)
* Western Montagnais (l-dialect)
* Innu-aimun or Eastern Montagnais (n-dialect)
* Naskapi (y-dialect)

Various Cree languages are used as languages of instruction and taught as subjects: Plains Cree, Eastern Cree, Montagnais, etc. Mutual intelligibility between some dialects can be low. There is no accepted standard dialect.

Ojibwa (Chippewa) is a group of closely related Algonquian languages in Canada, which is distributed from British Columbia to Quebec, and the United States, distributed from Montana to Michigan, with diaspora communities in Kansas and Oklahoma. With Cree, the Ojibwe dialect continuum forms its own continuum, but the Oji-Cree language of this continuum joins the Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi dialect continuum through Swampy Cree. The Ojibwe continuum has 70,606 speakers. Roughly from northwest to southeast, it has these dialects:

* Ojibwa-Ottawa
** Algonquin
** Oji-Cree (Northern Ojibwa) or Severn
** Ojibwa
*** Western Ojibwa or Saulteaux
*** Chippewa (Southwestern Ojibwa)
*** Northwestern Ojibwa
*** Central Ojibwa or Nipissing
*** Eastern Ojibwa or Mississauga
** Ottawa (Southeastern Ojibwa)
* Potawatomi

Unlike the Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi dialect continuum, with distinct n/y/l/r/ð dialect characteristics and noticeable west–east k/č(ch) axis, the Ojibwe continuum is marked with vowel syncope along the west–east axis and ∅/n along the north–south axis.

<text>A programming tool or software development tool is a computer program that is used to develop another computer program, usually by helping the developer manage computer files. For example, a programmer may use a tool called a source code editor to edit source code files, and then a compiler to convert the source code into machine code files. They may also use build tools that automatically package executable program and data files into shareable packages or install kits.

A set of tools that are run one after another, with each tool feeding its output to the next one, is called a toolchain. An integrated development environment (IDE) integrates the function of several tools into a single program. Usually, an IDE provides a source code editor as well as other built-in or plug-in tools that help with compiling, debugging, and testing.

Whether a program is considered a development tool can be subjective. Some programs, such as the GNU compiler collection, are used exclusively for software development while others, such as Notepad, are not meant specifically for development but are nevertheless often used for programming.

<text>Maurice-Alexis Jarre (; 13 September 1924 – 28 March 2009) was a French composer and conductor. Jarre is best known for his film scores, particularly for his collaborations with film director David Lean composing all of his films from 1962 to 1984. Jarre received numerous accolades including three Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globes, and a Grammy Award.

Jarre won three Academy Awards for Best Original Score for the David Lean films &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984). He was Oscar-nominated for &quot;Sundays and Cybèle&quot; (1962), &quot;The Message&quot; (1976), &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988), and &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990). Notable scores also include &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; (1959), &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975), &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982), &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989). He worked with such directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Elia Kazan, John Huston, Luchino Visconti, John Frankenheimer, and Peter Weir.

Three of his compositions spent a total of 42 weeks on the UK singles chart; the biggest hit was &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot; (to his tune &quot;Lara&#x27;s Theme&quot;, with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) performed by the Mike Sammes Singers, which reached Number 14 in 1966 and spent 38 weeks on the chart.
He was the father of musician Jean-Michel Jarre and the adoptive father of screenwriter Kevin Jarre.

==Early life==
Jarre was born in Lyon, the son of Gabrielle Renée (&quot;née&quot; Boullu) and André Jarre, a radio technical director. He first enrolled in the engineering school at the Sorbonne, but decided to pursue music courses instead. He left the Sorbonne against his father&#x27;s will and enrolled at the Conservatoire de Paris to study composition and harmony and chose percussion as his major instrument. He became director of the Théâtre National Populaire and recorded his first film score in France in 1951. He wrote the score for &quot;Toute la mémoire du monde&quot; by Alain Resnais.

==Film scoring==
In 1961, Jarre&#x27;s music career experienced a major change when American film producer Sam Spiegel asked him to write the score for the 1962 epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, directed by David Lean. The acclaimed score won Jarre his first Academy Award and he would go on to compose the scores to all of Lean&#x27;s subsequent films. He followed with &quot;The Train&quot; (1964) and &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), both for director John Frankenheimer, and in between had another great success in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, which included the lyricless tune &quot;Lara&#x27;s Theme&quot; (later the tune for the song &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot;), and which earned him his second Oscar. He worked with Alfred Hitchcock on &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969): although Hitchcock&#x27;s experiences with the film were unhappy, he was satisfied with Jarre&#x27;s score, telling him, &quot;I have not given you a great film, but you have given me a great score.&quot;

Jarre&#x27;s score for David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), set in Ireland, completely eschews traditional Irish music styles, according to Lean&#x27;s preferences. The song &quot;It Was a Good Time,&quot; from &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; went on to be recorded by musical stars such as Liza Minnelli who used it in her critically acclaimed television special &quot;Liza with a Z&quot; as well as by others during the 1970s. He contributed the music for Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969), and John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975).

He was again nominated for an Academy Award for scoring &quot;The Message&quot; in 1976, for the director and producer Moustapha Akkad. He followed with &quot;Witness&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989), for which he won a British Academy Award.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Jarre turned his hand to science fiction, with scores for &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot; (1974), &quot;Dreamscape&quot; (1984), &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; (1985), and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985). The latter is written for full orchestra, augmented by a chorus, four grand pianos, a pipe organ, digeridoo, fujara, a battery of exotic percussion, and three ondes Martenot, which feature in several of Jarre&#x27;s other scores, including &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, &quot;The Bride&quot; and &quot;Prancer&quot;. The balalaika features prominently in Jarre&#x27;s score for &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;.

In 1990, Jarre was again nominated for an Academy Award scoring the supernatural love story/thriller &quot;Ghost&quot;. His music for the final scene of the film is based on &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; composed by fellow film composer Alex North. Other films for which he provided the music include &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; (1995), for which he wrote the score and all of the songs, including the romantic &quot;Mariachi Serenade&quot;. Also to his credit is the passionate love theme from &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), and the moody electronic soundscapes of &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot; (1990). He was well respected by other composers including John Williams, who stated, on Jarre&#x27;s death, &quot;(He) is to be well remembered for his lasting contribution to film music ... we all have been enriched by his legacy.&quot;

Jarre&#x27;s television work includes the theme for the short-lived 1967 Western series on CBS, Cimarron Strip, his score for the miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), directed by Franco Zeffirelli, &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980), and the theme for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

Jarre scored his last project in 2001, a television mini-series about the Holocaust titled &quot;Uprising&quot;.

He was &quot;one of the giants of 20th-century film music&quot; who was &quot;among the most sought-after composers in the movie industry&quot; and &quot;a creator of both subtle underscoring and grand, sweeping themes, not only writing for conventional orchestras ... but also experimenting with electronic sounds later in his career&quot;.

==Style and artistry ==
Jarre wrote mainly for orchestras, but began to favour synthesized music in the 1980s. Jarre pointed out that his electronic score for &quot;Witness&quot; was actually more laborious, time-consuming and expensive to produce than an orchestral score. Jarre&#x27;s electronic scores from the 1980s also include &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;, &quot;Firefox&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot;. A number of his scores from that era also feature electronic / acoustic blends, such as &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;.

== Personal life ==
===Marriages and family ===
Jarre was married four times, the first three marriages ending in divorce. In the 1940s, his marriage to Francette Pejot, a French Resistance member and concentration camp survivor, produced a son, Jean-Michel Jarre, a French composer, performer, and music producer, who is one of the pioneers in electronic music. When Jean-Michel was five years old, Maurice split up with his wife and moved to the United States, leaving Jean-Michel with his mother in France.

In 1965, Jarre married French actress Dany Saval; together they had a daughter, Stephanie Jarre. He next married American actress Laura Devon (1967–1984), resulting in his adopting her son, Kevin Jarre, a screenwriter, with credits on such films as &quot;Tombstone&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot; (1989). From 1984 to his death, he was married to Fong F. Khong.

===Death===
Jarre died of cancer on 28 March 2009 in Los Angeles.

Jarre received three Academy Awards and received a total of nine nominations, eight for Best Original Score and one for Best Original Song. He also won four Golden Globes and was nominated for ten. The American Film Institute ranked Jarre&#x27;s score for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; #3 on their list of the greatest film scores. His scores for the following films were also nominated for the list: &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970). Numerous additional awards include ASCAP&#x27;s &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; in 1993. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia, originally titled The Prince of Abissinia: A Tale, though often abbreviated to Rasselas, is an apologue about bliss and ignorance by Samuel Johnson. The book&#x27;s original working title was &quot;The Choice of Life&quot;. The book was first published in April 1759 in England. Early readers considered &quot;Rasselas&quot; to be a work of philosophical and practical importance and critics often remark on the difficulty of classifying it as a novel.

== Origin and influences ==

At the age of fifty, Johnson wrote the piece in only one week to help pay the costs of his mother&#x27;s funeral, intending to complete it on 22 January 1759 (the eve of his mother&#x27;s death). Johnson is believed to have received a total of £75 for the copyright. Though this is still popular belief, Wharton and Mayerson&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot;Samuel Johnson and the Theme of Hope&quot;,&quot; explains how James Boswell, the author of Johnson&#x27;s biography, was &quot;entirely wrong in supposing that &quot;Rasselas&quot; was written soon after his mother&#x27;s death&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t a way of &quot;defraying&quot; the expenses of the funeral. In fact, Johnson wrote &quot;Rasselas&quot; instead of going to see his mother while she was still alive. It was written in anticipation of her funeral. Edward Tomarken writes in his book, &quot;Johnson, Rasselas, and the Choice of Criticism&quot;, that this belief was not questioned until 1927 as &quot;...the tradition of the gloomy, funereal tone of the choice of life motif in Rasselas remained unopposed: the question of whether or not the genesis of Rasselas involved a literal funeral was not considered important. Moreover, the assumption of a gloomy genesis served to keep religion in the background, for any theological difficulty could be attributed to the fact that the author was mourning the death of his mother&quot;.

Following in the footsteps of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zadig&quot; and Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Persian Letters&quot;, Johnson was influenced by the vogue for exotic locations including Ethiopia. He had translated &quot;A Voyage to Abyssinia&quot; by Jerónimo Lobo in 1735 and used it as the basis for his &quot;philosophical romance&quot;. Ten years before he wrote &quot;Rasselas&quot; he published &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot; in which he describes the inevitable defeat of worldly ambition.

Although many have argued that the book &quot;Rasselas&quot; had nothing to do with Abyssinia, and that Samuel Johnson chose Abyssinia as a locale for no other reason than wanting to write an anti-orientalist fantasy, some have begun to argue that the book has a deep tie to Ethiopian thought due to Johnson&#x27;s translation of &quot;A Voyage to Abyssinia&quot; and his lifelong interest in its Christianity. Other scholars have argued that Johnson was influenced, at least in part, by other texts, including works by Herodotus and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

According to Wendy L. Belcher, when Johnson sent his manuscript to the publisher he titled the work &quot;The History of – - – - Prince of Abissinia,&quot; which suggests that he had still not decided on the name of his protagonist. It is Belcher&#x27;s argument that &quot;Johnson coined the name &#x27;Rasselas&#x27; for its symbolic meaning, not its phonetic relation to the Catholic prince . Since means &#x27;prince&#x27; and means &#x27;portrait&#x27;, Johnson may have invented the term &#x27;portrait of a prince&#x27; as an evocative name for his main character.&quot;

==Content==
Rasselas, the fourth son of the King of Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia), is shut up in a beautiful valley called The Happy Valley, &quot;till the order of succession should call him to the throne&quot;. Rasselas enlists the help of an artist who is also known as an engineer to help with his escape from the Valley by plunging out through the air, though they are unsuccessful in this attempt. Rasselas grows weary of the factitious entertainments of the place and, after much brooding, escapes with his sister Nekayah, her attendant Pekuah and his poet-friend Imlac by digging under the wall of the valley. They are to see the world and search for happiness in places such as Cairo and Suez. After a sojourn in Egypt, where they encounter various classes of society and undergo a few adventures, they perceive the futility of their search and return to Abyssinia after none of their hopes for happiness are achieved.

The story is primarily episodic. According to Borges, &quot;Johnson wrote this book in such a slow, musical style ... in which all the sentences are perfectly balanced. There is not a single sentence that ends abruptly, and we find a monotonous, but very agile, music, and this is what Johnson wrote while he was thinking about the death of his mother, whom he loved so much&quot;.

===Character list===
* Rasselas – son of the King of Abyssinia
* Imlac – a philosopher, son of a merchant, who has come to the Happy Valley only to find that life there is empty
* Nekayah – sister and travelling companion of Rasselas
* Pekuah – Nekayah&#x27;s attendant
* The Hermit – One of the first men Rasselas meets on his journey. Discourages him from a life of solitude.
* The Master – One of Rasselas&#x27;s teachers, he learns of Rasselas&#x27;s discontent and tries to encourage him to be content in the valley of Happiness.
* The Bassa – The highest title of honour in the Ottoman Empire. The Bassa does little to help his subjects.
* The Engineer – Rasselas is intrigued by this man&#x27;s mechanical understanding and observes his attempt to create a flying contraption. However, he ultimately fails.
* The Astronomer – A learned man that lives in solitude. He confesses to Imlac that he believes he can control the weather. Later he comes back to his sense after a visit of Pekuah and Nekayah.

== Critical interpretations ==

Irvin Ehrenpreis sees an aged Johnson reflecting on lost youth in the character of Rasselas, who is exiled from Happy Valley. &quot;Rasselas&quot; has also been viewed as a reflection of Johnson&#x27;s melancholia projected on to the wider world, particularly at the time of his mother&#x27;s death. And some have interpreted the work as an expression of Johnson&#x27;s Christian beliefs, arguing that the work expresses the impossibility of finding happiness in life on earth, and asks the reader to look to God for ultimate satisfaction. Hester Piozzi saw in part Johnson in the character of Imlac, who is rejected in his courtship by a class-conscious social superior. Thomas Keymer sees beyond the conventional &quot;roman à clef&quot; interpretations to call it a work that reflects the wider geo-political world in the year of publication (1759): the year in which &quot;Britain became master of the world&quot;. Rasselas is seen to express hostility to the rising imperialism of his day and to reject stereotypical &quot;orientalist&quot; viewpoints that justified colonialism. Johnson himself was regarded as a prophet who opposed imperialism, who described the Anglo-French dispute for rule in North America as a dispute between two thieves over the proceeds of a robbery.

=== Orientalist interpretations ===

According to academic Abdulhafeth Ali Khrisat, Johnson follows a tradition of &quot;academic studies of orientalism in the 18th century... west of the oriental studies which mainly focused on the Turkish language, culture, institutions and Islam.&quot; This tradition of study shows up in Rasselas through the use of Imlac, who has traveled to the West and seen its advancements. This led to philosophical comparison between the West and the East in the story. Through this, Johnson implies that the West is superior to the East, using Imlac as a mouthpiece. This negative portrayal of the East is done in the beginning of the story with the description of the Happy Valley. This description details how this place is meant to be a paradise or utopia, but also alluded to the idea of a prison. This setting, coupled with the western idea of happiness seen in &quot;Rasselas&quot;, brings out a portrayal of Arab and Muslim culture as being oppressive. According to Khrisat, this is a result of Johnson&#x27;s portrayal of the east using European ideas.

=== Comparison to &quot;Candide&quot; ===

While the story is thematically similar to &quot;Candide&quot; by Voltaire, also published early in 1759 – both concern young men travelling in the company of honoured teachers, encountering and examining human suffering in an attempt to determine the root of happiness – their root concerns are distinctly different. Voltaire was very directly satirising the widely read philosophical work by Gottfried Leibniz, particularly the &quot;Théodicée&quot;, in which Leibniz asserts that the world, no matter how we may perceive it, is necessarily the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot;. In contrast the question Rasselas confronts most directly is whether or not humanity is essentially capable of attaining happiness. Rasselas questions his choices in life and what new choices to make in order to achieve this happiness. Writing as a devout Christian, Johnson makes through his characters no blanket attacks on the viability of a religious response to this question, as Voltaire does, and while the story is in places light and humorous, it is not a piece of satire, as is &quot;Candide&quot;. 

Borges thought &quot;Candide&quot; &quot;a much more brilliant book&quot; than &quot;Rasselas&quot;, yet the latter was more convincing in its rejection of human happiness:

==Legacy==

Johnson was a staunch opponent of slavery, revered by abolitionists, and Rasselas became a name adopted by emancipated slaves.

=== Editions ===
The first American edition was published in 1768. The title page of this edition carried a quotation, inserted by the publisher Robert Bell from La Rochefoucauld: &quot;The labour or Exercise of the Body, freeth Man from the Pains of the Mind; and this constitutes the Happiness of the Poor&quot;.

It was used by Philip Rusher in 1804 as the text of choice for the first use of his unsuccessful, paper-saving Patent Type with no descenders.

A quarto illustrated edition was published in 1805 by William Miller with engravings by Abraham Raimbach (after pictures by Robert Smirke).

=== Continuations ===
&quot;Rasselas&quot; was a jumping-off point for at least two continuations by other authors:
* &quot;Dinarbas&quot; (1790) by Cornelia Knight.
* &quot;The Second Part of the History of Rasselas&quot; (1835) by Elizabeth Pope Whately, wife of Richard Whately.

===Radio adaptation===
A radio adaptation of &quot;Rasselas&quot; by Jonathan Holloway was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 24 May 2015, with Ashley Zhangazha as Rasselas, Jeff Rawle as Samuel Johnson and Lucian Msamati as the poet Imlac. Cynthia Erivo made her BBC radio drama debut as Princess Nekayah. The drama was recorded at Dr Johnson&#x27;s House, 17 Gough Square, in the City of London, where he wrote &quot;Rasselas&quot; in 1759. Sound design was by David Chilton, and the drama was introduced by Celine Luppo McDaid, Curator of Dr Johnson&#x27;s House. It was produced and directed by Amber Barnfather.

<text>Arise, O Compatriots is a Nigerian patriotic song that was used as the national anthem of Nigeria from 1 October 1978 until 2024, when Nigeria, We Hail Thee was reinstated. On 29 May 2024, &quot;Arise, O Compatriots&quot; was officially relinquished followed by the readoption of the first national anthem, &quot;Nigeria, We Hail Thee&quot; used from 1960 until 1978.

==History==
The anthem was adopted in 1978 by the military government and replaced the previous national anthem, &quot;Nigeria, We Hail Thee&quot;.

The lyrics are a combination of words and phrases taken from five of the best entries in a national contest. The words were put to music by the Nigerian Police Band under the directorship of Benedict P. Odiase (1934–2013). The Nigerian national anthem lyrics were created by five people: P. O. Aderibigbe, John A. Ilechukwu, Dr. Sota Omoigui, Eme Etim Akpan and B.A. Ogunnaike.

On 29 May 2024, &quot;Arise, O Compatriots&quot; was officially relinquished following a bill passed by the National Assembly and subsequently signed into law by president Bola Tinubu. It was replaced by &quot;Nigeria, We Hail Thee&quot;, Nigeria’s first national anthem.

==Lyrics==
Although the anthem has two verses, usually only the first is sung. On some occasions, the second verse is recited as &quot;The National Prayer&quot;.

==National Pledge==
The Nigerian pledge of allegiance is recited immediately after the playing of the Nigerian national anthem. It was written by Felicia Adebola Adeyoyin in 1976.

<text>Lai Man-wai (; September 25, 1893 – October 26, 1953), also romanised as Lay Min-wei or M.W. Ray, considered the &quot;Father of Hong Kong Cinema&quot;, was the director of the first Hong Kong film &quot;Zhuangzi Tests His Wife&quot; in 1913. In the film, Lai played the role of the wife, partly due to the reluctance of women to participate in show business at the time.

Born in Yokohama, Japan, of Xinhui, Guangdong origin and raised in Hong Kong, he joined Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Kuomintang party in 1911 and helped make anti-warlord movies.

==Biography==
Lai was born in 1893 in Yokohama, Japan to Chinese parents. He grew up in Hong Kong. Liu&#x27;s earliest exposure to cinema was watching a newsreel from the Russo-Japanese War. 

In 1913, Lai founded a drama troupe in Hong Kong. He collaborated with Ukrainian-American filmmaker Benjamin Brodsky in the production of two short fiction films.

Lai was a member of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Revolutionary Alliance.

In 1921, Lai founded a film exhibition company. In 1922, he founded the production company Minxin. Because Lai believed that cinema in China should serve the country&#x27;s revolution and modernization, Minxin&#x27;s early productions focused on documentaries dealing with educational, current affairs, and cultural topics. In 1925, Lai relocated Minxin from Hong Kong to Shanghai. 

Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang became a major focus of Minxin&#x27;s films. Lai recorded Sun&#x27;s public announcement of the Northern Expedition, and documented Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s consolidation of power after Sun&#x27;s death, including filming the progress of the Northern Expedition. Initially, Minxin released film from this period as news reels. Later, Lai compiled footage into an eighty-minute film which the KMT branch in Shanghai approved as the only long format film for party propaganda, making the film one of the earliest party films in China.

Prior to Chiang&#x27;s anti-communist purge, Lai maintained strong political relationships with both anti-communists and communists. He continued working across the political spectrum thereafter.

In 1930, he co-founded one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; studios of the 1930s, Lianhua Film Company, with Lo Ming-yau. Lianhua, together with other leading Shanghai studios, was destroyed when the Empire of Japan attacked Shanghai in 1937. Lai returned to Hong Kong in 1938 and retired.

He was married to Lim Cho-cho, a Canada-born actress. His daughter Lai Suen and granddaughter Gigi Lai are both actresses.

==Memory==
His story was documented in &quot;Lai Man-wai: Father of Hong Kong Cinema&quot; by Choi Kai-kwong in 2001.

Lai Man-wai is portrayed in Stanley Kwan&#x27;s 1991 biopic of actress Ruan Lingyu, &quot;Center Stage&quot; by Hong Kong actor, Waise Lee.

<doc id="370917" wikidata="Q7607953" url="?curid=370917" title="Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology">
<text>Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology was a case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit primarily concerned with the enforceability of box-top licenses and end user license agreements (EULA) and their place in U.S. contract law. During the relevant period, Step-Saver Data Systems was a value-added reseller, combining hardware and software from different vendors to offer a fully functioning computer system to various end users. Step-Saver&#x27;s products included software produced by Software Link, Inc (TSL), computer terminals produced by Wyse Technology, and main computers produced by IBM. The fundamental question raised in this case was whether the shrinkwrap licenses accompanying TSL&#x27;s software were legally binding, given that different terms were negotiated over the phone with Step-Saver prior to receiving physical copies of the software. The case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where the court ruled that the shrinkwrap licenses were legally binding. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently reversed this decision, ruling that the shrinkwrap licenses were not legally binding.

==Facts==
During the relevant period, Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. was a value-added reseller marketing &#x27;single-user&#x27; computer systems (known at the time as micro-computers). These &#x27;single-user&#x27; computer systems consolidated software from multiple vendors into a single package tailored to the needs of various end-users.

In an effort to expand their market opportunities, Step-Saver sought to move to multi-user computer systems. To facilitate this transition, Step-Saver purchased a multi-user operating system from The Software Link (TSL) known as &quot;Multi-Link Advanced&quot;. They also purchased computer terminals from Wyse Technology that claimed to be compatible with the Multi-Link Advanced operating system. Combining these two components with computers provided by IBM, Step Saver began selling their new multi-user solution. However, soon after Step-Saver began selling this product, complaints were received by customers claiming that the system was not functioning properly. Step-Saver notified both TSL and Wyse of the complaints, but after a large amount of effort the customers&#x27; problems remained largely unresolved.

As a result, 12 of Step-Saver&#x27;s customers filed lawsuits against them. As producers of key components of Step-Saver&#x27;s overall product, Step-Saver contended that TSL and Wyse were liable in these suits, arguing that the same implied warranties Step-Saver made to its consumers were also made to Step-Saver by TSL and Wyse.
However, TSL argued that the box-top license on the software delivered to Step-Saver was the only valid agreement made between the two companies. Step-Saver challenged this argument, indicating that the box-top license should be non-binding since Step-Saver never explicitly agreed to its terms.

==Court opinions ==

Step-Saver initiated this case in an effort to hold Wyse and TSL liable in their customer lawsuits. Step-Saver argued, that any liability that it had to its customers should be shared by both Wyse and TSL since they were the original providers of the allegedly defective software and hardware. Step-Saver also argued that an implied contract existed between Step-Saver and these merchants at the time of purchase. They claimed that such an implied contract required the merchants to become co-defendants in the customer lawsuits.

TSL subsequently argued that the implied contract was not enforceable, but rather, that the Limited Use License Agreement (LULA) written on the software package was. Step-Saver sought a declaratory judgement on the matter and complained that it incurred more than $75,000 in direct damages as a result of the customer lawsuits resulting from the incompatibilities experienced between the terminals bought from Wyse and the software purchased from TSL. Five court cases and three years later the case was finally decided on the July 29th, 1991. All district cases were heard by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and all appeals were heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit . A history and summary of each case is provided in the subsequent sections.

===District case: Motion for Declaratory Judgment (1989)===
The plaintiff, Step-Saver, sought contribution and compensation from the defendants, seeking declaratory judgment. In turn, the defendants, Wyse and TSL, moved for summary judgment.

The defendants&#x27; motion for summary judgment was subsequently granted, and Step-Saver&#x27;s motion for a declaratory judgment was denied on the grounds of misuse of the Declaratory Judgment Act. Specifically it failed because of , and a lack of evidence demonstrating that the defendant was liable. The court held that Step-Saver&#x27;s motion for a declaratory judgment was &#x27;unripe&#x27;, on the grounds that cases involving customer suits had not yet been decided. The errors in the Step-Saver system that initiated the suits had not been identified and thus could not be designated to be the fault of the hardware or software, in which case TSL and Wyse could be liable.

===First appeal to Third Circuit (1990)===

Step-Saver called for a review of the district case, specifically a review of the court&#x27;s decision to dismiss Step-Saver&#x27;s complaint for a declaratory judgment. In order to reestablish that Step-Saver&#x27;s motion could not be affirmed, the court cited &quot;Aetna Life Co. v. Haworth&quot;, which supported the dismissal of motions for declaratory judgment if the motioning party provided insufficient concrete evidence. In addition, the court indicated that &quot;making a law without finding the necessary facts constitutes advisory opinion writing, and that is constitutionally forbidden&quot; 

In this appeal, the court also considered a direct damages claim brought forth by Step-Saver. The claim was defined as independent of declaratory judgment and it was found that the consequential damages could be recovered .

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The declaratory judgment motion made by Step-Saver was still considered to be unripe. However, the portion of the claim associated with direct damages was reversed, now in favor of Step-saver. The case was then remanded for further proceedings.

===District case: Motion for Retrial (1990) ===

Dissatisfied with the verdict of previous proceedings, the plaintiff motioned for a retrial. The defendants had been granted summary judgment on many of the issues presented by Step-Saver. In consideration of a retrial, the court examined the previous court&#x27;s holdings. The district court found the previous court&#x27;s holding to be true. Under contract law, ill-defined contracts are treated under , the previous court decision found that this would render the Step-Saver/TSL implied license as moot and instead the box-top license would be upheld. The court agreed that in the previous proceedings &quot;LULA effectively disclaimed alleged express warranties&quot;.

The court found that Step-Saver&#x27;s allegations of error were unfounded and denied the motion for a new trial.

===District case: dismissal of vendor suit (1990) ===

Wyse technology and TSL sought to dismiss plaintiff&#x27;s initial suit seeking compensation or indemnification for damages done to Step-Saver&#x27;s business due to customer lawsuits.

The court granted this motion on the basis that the first district case associated with Step Saver v. Wyse, was no longer relevant in light of Step-Saver&#x27;s motion for a second appeal to the 3rd Circuit.

===Second appeal to Third Circuit (1991)===

The court reversed holdings of the district court on the grounds that the box-top license is a non-enforceable contract, since Step-Saver did not explicitly agree to its terms. In addition the box-top license itself violated the original contract terms between Step and TSL which had given Step-Saver the right to freely distribute copies of TSL Multi-Link Advanced. The court remanded for further consideration of the Step-Saver initial contract consisting of implied warranty. The court affirmed in all other respects.
==Importance of verdict==

The enforceability of shrink wrap contracts has been an issue of controversy as demonstrated in a few notable cases, &quot;Vernor v. Autodesk&quot; and &quot;ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg&quot; both of which cited the Step-Saver case.

The questions raised about constitutional and statutory preemptions from this case however has been re-argued in other cases such as &quot;Softman v. Adobe&quot; and &quot;Novell, Inc. v. CPU Distrib., Inc.&quot; in which the preempted federal statutes have been enforced over the EULA terms, thus invalidating that part of the EULA.

<doc id="370924" wikidata="Q1772970" url="?curid=370924" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Italy">
<text>This is an introduction to the postal and philatelic history of Italy.

As Italy was not unified until 1861, its early postal history is tied to the various kingdoms and smaller realms that ruled in the peninsula.

== Pre-unification ==

=== Napoleonic Italy (1805–1814) ===
During the Napoleonic Wars, the geopolitical instability of the region led to a wide variety in postal systems. In the Kingdom of Italy, the short-lived Italian Republic, and other dependent regions, Napoleon appointed postal administrators loyal to him.

After the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the independent Italian kingdoms regained control of their postal systems.

=== 1814–1860 ===
The &quot;Cavallini&quot; (&quot;little horses&quot;) of Sardinia was an early private mail service, notable for the introduction of prepaid stamped lettersheets in 1819.

The first postage stamps in Italy were also issued by the Sardinian kingdom. In 1850, Count Camillo Cavour drafted a report to the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia proposing postal reform along the lines of that which had been adopted in several European states, and providing for the introduction of postage stamps, for which a new word - &quot;francobollo&quot; - was coined. The reform became law in November, and went into effect 1 January 1851.

After some casting around for expertise in the newfangled art of stamp printing, the government settled on the house of Francesco Matraire in Turin. Postage stamps of the Sardinian kingdom with the embossed profile of Victor Emmanuel II without indicating the name of the state were printed by Matraire and issued on January 1, 1851.

Following Sardinia, other Italian states also issued stamps. These include Tuscany (April 1851), the Papal States (January 1852), Modena (June 1852), Parma (June 1852), Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples - January 1858; Sicily - January 1859), Romagna (September 1859) . In the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom under the Austrian Empire, stamps were also issued with denominations in the local currency.

=== Gallery of Italian Stamps, 1814–1860 ===
== The Kingdom of Italy ==

Following the unification of Italy during 1860 and 1861, stamps in use in each of the territories that joined Italy were withdrawn from circulation and replaced with the stamps of the Sardinian kingdom. The transition took place in Modena, Parma and Romagna on February 1, 1860, in Naples on September 15, 1862 (although local authorities had previously printed stamps depicting the coat of arms of Savoy), and in the Papal States - only in 1870. Matraire&#x27;s stamps were reprinted several times, and those printed after 17 March 1861 are usually considered the first stamps of the Kingdom of Italy.
Perforated stamps of the fourth standard edition of the Sardinian kingdom with an embossed profile of Victor Emmanuel II were issued in 1862. Starting on 1 January 1863, uniform postal rates went into effect.

In 1862 Count Ambjörn Sparre won the stamp contract, but his designs were not liked, and he seemed unable to produce the stamps. In danger of running out of stamps altogether, at the end of 1862 the Italian government once again turned to Matraire, who quickly produced a stamp with a nominal value of 15 centesimo by lithography, depicting the profile of King Victor Emanuel II and the inscription &quot;Postale italiano&quot;.

The contract with Count Sparre was annulled in March 1863, and a new contract was given to the British printing house De La Rue. A series of eight stamps with the inscription &quot;Poste italiane&quot; in denominations from 1 centesimo to 2 lira was issued on December 1, 1863.

Italy joined the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875. Until 1877, Italian stamps were used in San Marino.

=== Humbert I ===
Humbert succeeded his father in 1878, which necessitated a new issue of stamps. First appearing on 15 August 1879, they were the first stamps of the kingdom to be entirely designed, engraved, and printed by Italians. Since considerable stocks of Victor Emmanuel stamps were left over and finances were poor, the old stamps continued in use for some years, and some values of Humbert&#x27;s stamps were little-used during his reign.
The new series incorporated rates and colors mandated by the Universal Postal Union.

=== Victor Emmanuel III ===
The first stamps with a portrait of Victor Emanuel III appeared in July 1901. The first series of commemorative stamps was issued in April 1910 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Expedition of the Thousand. The world&#x27;s first airmail stamps were issued in 1917 when Poste italiane overprinted their existing special delivery stamps.

=== Fascist regime ===
==== &quot;The Imperial Series&quot; ====
Until 1929, all definitive stamps were issued with the portrait of the king or the coat of arms. In April 1929, the so-called &quot;Imperial Series&quot; (&quot;Serie Imperiale&quot;) was released, the first definitive series of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government. The stamp designs featured images of the Capitoline she-wolf with Romulus and Remus, Julius Caesar, Octavian Augustus and &quot;Italia&quot;, and contained the fasces, symbol of the fascist regime.

==== Italian Social Republic ====
In 1943, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI) in northern Italy, a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers.
== Italian Republic ==

Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946.

=== &quot;Fiume&quot; stamp controversy ===
In 2007, the issue of an Italian stamp featuring the Croatian city of Rijeka caused a controversy. The stamp referred to the city in its usual Italian name of &quot;Fiume&quot;, claiming it was former Italian territory. This is seen as offensive in Croatia.

== Aegean Islands issues ==
The Italian Islands of the Aegean were the Italian possession in the Dodecanese from 1912 to 1945. Italian stamps overprinted &quot;Egeo&quot; and &quot;Isole Italiane dell&#x27; Egeo&quot; were issued for the Islands. Stamps were also issued for the individual islands: Calchi (Karki), Calino (Calimno), Kasos (Caso), Cos (Coo), Leros (Lero), Leipsoi (Lisso), Nisyros (Nisiro), Patmos (Patmo), Tilos (Piscopi), Rhodes (Rodi), Karpathos (Scarpanto), Symi (Simi), and Astypalaia (Stampalia).
== Venezia Giulia issues ==
Italy annexed Venezia Giulia - including the Istrian peninsula and the cities of Trieste and Gorizia with the Treaty of Rapallo (1920). With the Treaty of Rome (1924) the city of Fiume was also annexed.

After the war, from 1945 to 1947, Venezia Giulia was occupied by Allied Anglo-American troops (Zone &quot;A&quot; - the territory with the city of Trieste) and troops of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (Zone &quot;B&quot; - Istria and the Slovene Littoral). The zones of occupation were demarcated along the so-called Morgan Line. In Zone A, Italian stamps were overprinted &quot;A.M.G./V.G.&quot; (Allied Military Government/Venezia Giulia) in September 1945. In 1947, following the Paris Peace Treaties, Italy ceded most of these lands to Yugoslavia. 
=== Free Territory of Trieste ===
The peace treaty established Trieste and the surrounding area as the Free Territory of Trieste, also divided into zones A and B, under Allied military administration and Yugoslav military administration, respectively. In Zone A, Italian stamps overprinted &quot;A.M.G./F.T.T.&quot; were issued between 1947 and 1954. The Free Territory was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1954, with Zone A joining Italy.

== Campione d&#x27;Italia issues ==
Campione d&#x27;Italia is a small Italian exclave surrounded by Switzerland near Lake Lugano. The municipal council issued its own stamps in May 1944. The stamps were inscribed &quot;RR Poste italiane / Comune de Campione&quot; and denominated in the Swiss currency. Campione stamps were withdrawn in 1952. Since then, mail may be sent using either Swiss stamps or Italian stamps.

== Italian post offices abroad ==
The first stamps for the Italian post offices abroad were issued on January 1, 1874, overprinting &quot;Estero&quot; (&quot;Abroad&quot;) on Italian stamps.

*Italian post offices in Benghazi 1901–1912
*Italian post offices in Tripoli 1909–1912
*Italian post offices in Beijing 1917–1922
*Italian post offices in Tianjin 1917–1922
*Italian post offices in Crete
*Italian post offices in Egypt
*Italian post offices in the Ottoman Empire 1873–1923

<text>Scottish Television (now legally known as STV Central Limited) is the ITV network franchisee for Central Scotland. The channel — the largest of the three ITV franchises in Scotland — has been in operation since 31 August 1957 and is the second-oldest franchise holder in the UK that is still active (the oldest being Granada Television).

STV Central broadcasts from studios at Pacific Quay in Glasgow and is owned and operated by STV Group (formerly SMG plc), which also owns the Northern Scotland franchise, Grampian Television (now [[STV North]]), based in Aberdeen. It produces news for the west and east halves of its transmission region (&quot;STV News at Six&quot;) along with current affairs and feature programming for Northern and Central Scotland.

Along with STV North and ITV Border, STV Central is a commercial rival to the publicly funded national broadcaster, BBC Scotland.

==History==
Scottish Television was founded by Canadian newspaper magnate Roy Thomson (later Lord Thomson). To base the station, he bought the Theatre Royal, Glasgow from Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd, who became minor partners in the new venture. Thomson invited Canadian television producer Rai Purdy to become the station&#x27;s first head of programming. In the months leading up to opening night, Purdy pledged that the new channel would provide &quot;first class entertainment&quot; and &quot;as much cultural programming as possible&quot; as well as allowing &quot;Scottish talent every opportunity to develop and be seen on STV&quot;.

=== Pre-Launch ===
On 24 May 1955, a letter from the Independent Television Authority advised him that on the following Wednesday a press conference would be held in the North British Hotel, Edinburgh (which was to announce that he had been awarded the contract to set up a Scottish television company). The press release handed out at the conference stated that the transmitting station and aerials, which Thomson would have to rent from the ITA, would be ready for service in August 1957. Roy Thomson signed the contract with the ITA on 19 June 1957. The launch of a second television channel required alterations to people&#x27;s television sets and/or aerials. Older sets had to be converted with an additional tuning device, and even for newer sets which had this tuner already built-in, an additional aerial was required. With nearly half a million sets and aerials in Scotland, it was going to be a huge undertaking. When independent television began in England, everybody wanted their sets converted at the same time and radio dealers could not cope with the last-minute rush. The problem was exacerbated by a shortage of radio and television mechanics. In order to avoid similar chaos in Scotland, STV (in association with the television trade) arranged a series of 21 exhibitions in the principal towns and burghs in the reception area months ahead of launch.

The Exhibitions ran from Tuesday until Friday and were open from 14:30–21:30. The admission charge was 1/- for adults, 6d for children and old age pensioners. Every visitor to the Exhibition received a free copy of a 24-page Television Guide, which gave them a colourful picture of the programmes they would see on Scottish ITV. Every set in the Exhibition showed either BBC output or the new commercial programme. The latter was relayed through closed circuit from telecine equipment housed in a specially-constructed Morris Commercial vehicle, specially constructed for the exhibitions and carrying equipment valued at over £10,000. In an adjoining hall, a cinema show was staged. This showed samples of the programmes STV would be presenting, including American attractions such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Brave Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Douglas Fairbanks Presents&quot;, as well as home-grown shows &quot;Sunday Night at the Palladium&quot; and &quot;The 64,000 Question&quot;, and advertising films. Also featured was a film of local interest, taken by STV&#x27;s outside broadcasting (OB) unit a few days prior to the show, showing crowd scenes and various local activities. This offered the enticing prospect of exhibition visitors seeing themselves on television and thus finding out they were already &quot;television stars&quot;! The Pye OB unit, which cost £37,000 and was housed in a specially constructed vehicle, was on show outside the hall. A TV camera which was on display at the STV stand proved to be a big attraction. People standing around near the camera found that their images were being projected on screens at the other end of the hall.

Thomson said that, in initial stages, he expected to produce about ten hours a week of Scottish programmes. This was at a time when, under the terms of the Television Act, they were limited to a programme schedule of 50 hours a week. &quot;It will certainly make the Scottish station very Scottish indeed in its programme content,&quot; he said. They planned a talent show, &quot;Fanfare&quot;; a quiz programme; a play presented once a month or each alternate month, chosen from either the Citizen&#x27;s, Glasgow, the Gateway, Edinburgh, or the theatres in Perth or Dundee. There would also be a series, &quot;The Tamsons&quot;, about a Scottish family — but the problem was going to be finding someone who could write this, as not many Scots were experienced in writing for television. &quot;Scotsplay&quot; was also planned as a children&#x27;s programme, while &quot;In Heaven and Earth&quot; was described by Purdy as &quot;our big cultural effort&quot;, which would &quot;contain a bit of anything and everything culturally interesting, provocative, or entertaining&quot;; it would run for half an hour. British news would be featured twice a day, followed by Scottish news. In July, it was announced that the Scottish actor James Robertson Justice, a Rank Organization film star, would introduce STV&#x27;s opening programme, &quot;This is Scotland&quot;.

===1950s===
Scottish Television began broadcasting at 5:30 pm on Saturday 31 August 1957 with &quot;This is Scotland&quot;, an hour-long variety broadcast live from the Theatre Royal studios – STV was the seventh ITV franchise to launch, and the first outside the three largest regions (London, the Midlands and Northern England), as well as the first to broadcast seven days a week. Scottish Television’s first sport-related programme was &quot;Fanfare&quot;, which debuted on September 2, 1957 where, compered by Archie McCulloch, supporters of rival football club competed against one another each Monday.

===1960s===
The company broadcast musical entertainment, variety, documentary films presented by Dr John Grierson, and Scottish sports coverage. It also sponsored Scottish Opera and televised live opera and ballet, networking more opera than similar television companies. Much of the station&#x27;s early output was provided by ATV, under a ten-year deal worth £1 million per year. By 1965, ATV&#x27;s senior producer Francis Essex had become Scottish&#x27;s programming controller.

However, the station had also gained a reputation for low budget, entertainment-driven programming. It was jokingly said that STV only owned two pieces of equipment; one telecine to show western films and another to show the commercials. Lord Thomson was also criticised, for using much of the profits generated by Scottish Television to further gain his interests in the newspaper industry, rather than reinvesting into the station.

In 1965, the chairman of the Independent Television Authority Charles Hill paid a visit to STV&#x27;s Glasgow studios during which he observed an edition of the popular daytime entertainment show &quot;The One O&#x27;Clock Gang&quot;. He was so appalled by it that he personally axed the programme with the words &quot;My God, how long have you been getting away with this?&quot;.

From the launch of the station, television for schools was pioneered in association with Glasgow Corporation, and post graduate television services initiated, including surgery, in conjunction with universities. Programmes were devised for the emerging countries in the British Commonwealth, and the Thomson Foundation was created to educate and train television producers, journalists and engineers, this operated from Kirkhill House – a bespoke studio complex near Newton Mearns. Programmes from TFTC (Thomson Foundation Television College) were never seen by STV&#x27;s viewers, but much of STV&#x27;s redundant equipment found a new home at the studios, including STV&#x27;s first outside broadcast unit.

Although the early days of the ITV network were a financial gamble, the STV service soon became profitable, resulting in Thomson&#x27;s claim that &quot;running a commercial television station is like having a licence to print money&quot;. In 1966, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange for the first time.

Scottish Television retained its franchise at the first time of asking in 1967, despite strong competition from a consortium led by the future BBC Director General Alasdair Milne and strong indications that the company would lose its franchise. In the event, Lord Thomson was forced by the ITA to reduce his stake in the station from 80% to 25%, effectively ending the company&#x27;s standing as a subsidiary of the Thomson Group.

The start of colour broadcasting at the end of the decade was marked by the opening of new secondary studios at the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh in October 1969. The following month, on 3 November, the Theatre Royal headquarters were badly damaged by a major fire started by an electrical fault, in which a firefighter, Archie McLay, died after falling through a trapdoor.

===1970s===
Like many franchises within the ITV network, Scottish struggled through the late 1960s and early 1970s with the recession, increased transmitter rental fees, taxation on income (rather than profits), a decline in advertising revenue, and the costs of converting equipment for the launch of colour television. In 1970, the company made a loss of £39,000; a warning was given that regionalism would be abandoned, and a forced merger with Grampian Television would happen, unless the chancellor reduced the levy applied on advertising revenue.

By late 1971, STV&#x27;s fortunes recovered after a change in taxation rules reducing the company&#x27;s payments from £466,000 to £234,000, and a general increase in advertising saw profits rise to £475,000 within the first six months of 1971. A large proportion of the profits were spent on expanding the company&#x27;s programming output. This was in part to address criticism of the station&#x27;s output, and included improved sports coverage, new dramas by Scottish writers, and enhanced local entertainment.

With the increase in output, STV had expectations of becoming one of the major players in producing programming for the planned fourth UK television service (then referred to as &quot;ITV2&quot; and which later became Channel 4). Managing Director William Brown remarked at the time: &quot;One of the major factors in deciding to extend our activities, is the prospect of becoming nationally involved in the production of networked programmes for ITV2 if and when it begins&quot;.

In addition, STV were also seeking to consolidate their position to increase its partnership with foreign television stations. The company was associated with a public Israeli television company, who used STV&#x27;s post-production facilities for dubbing foreign language programmes. STV were hoping to be invited to act as an advisor for commercial television in Israel.

The company started work on building its new purpose-built complex at Cowcaddens, in early 1972. Original plans were to move to the Millerston area of Glasgow, costing £2 million, but negotiations fell through in mid-1960. The Cowcaddens site was planned to be built in the late 1960s, but was put on hold because of STV&#x27;s financial position. The company left the Glasgow base at the Theatre Royal in December 1974.

In 1975, a short-term strike hit the ITV network in the spring, due to a dispute over the payments agreed before the government-imposed pay freeze came into force. A 19% pay rise had been agreed between the ACTT (Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians) union, and with the ITV companies in July 1974. The union alleged that £231 of this deal was still owed to its members, and should not have been affected by the pay freeze. The strike took place from 6.00 am on 23 May (except for London Weekend Television, Tyne Tees Television, and Westward Television, where ACTT members ignored the strike). At 6.00am on 26 May, when striking workers came back to work, they were locked out by management. Normal service resumed on 30 May for all ITV stations, except for Scottish Television, whose staff refused to return to work after the lockout finished on 29 May. Staff eventually returned on Monday 9 June In 1978, company profits had risen by 21.8% in the first six months of the year, allowing for an increase in local programming.

===1980s===

During the 1970s and 1980s, Scottish Television produced a range of religious programming including weekly church services, half-hour religious programmes on a Sunday, religious contributions to the new Channel 4, the epilogue &quot;Late Call&quot;, and occasional documentaries, produced by Executive Producer Rev. Dr Nelson Gray, a Minister of the Congregational Church, and Rev. Eric Hudson, a Minister of the Church of Scotland but as the public service broadcasting requirement receded during the 1990s, the amount of religious programmes were gradually phased out.

In October 1981, Scottish Television became the first ITV station to operate a regional Oracle teletext service, containing over 60 pages of local news, sport and information.

As was industry-practice at the time, STV programming would either be totally studio-based, include film inserts where required (the local news programme &quot;Scotland Today&quot; and &quot;Take the High Road&quot; being early examples of this), or other programming such as documentaries and dramas, shot entirely on film. The company employed up to six film crews who could be assigned to providing daily local news coverage, football matches, or feature programming such as &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; or &quot;Weirs Way&quot;. Since the company originally went on air, images not provided electronically &#x27;live&#x27; within the studio centre were provided via telecine machines, allowing the station to run local advertisements to fill the ad breaks within and on either side of local and networked programming. Local advertisements – where a single image was shown on screen whilst the continuity announcer read the promotional message &#x27;live&#x27; – was sourced from a standard 35 mm slide.

Filmed inserts into regional news added a significant delay to the airing of programmes. STV, having no film processing capability of its own at Cowcaddens, sub-contracted this to a specialist company – Humphries Film Laboratories. Exposed film would be rushed to an industrial unit in North Glasgow to be processed and returned to Cowcaddens for the 16 mm film to be edited and prepared for transmission. This process often caused much annoyance to reporters and crews alike, as to ensure inclusion of a breaking news story for &quot;Scotland Today&quot;, film had to reach the labs no later than 4.30 pm. By the early to mid-1980s, STV had followed the rest of the ITV network in dispensing with film and embracing electronic news gathering, with Sony&#x27;s Betacam being the chosen system.

Gus Macdonald became the station&#x27;s Director of Programmes during the summer of 1986. One of his first decisions was to revamp the station&#x27;s regional news and features output, following criticism from an Independent Broadcasting Authority committee. Scottish&#x27;s flagship evening programme &quot;Scotland Today&quot; had previously been revamped from a regional news programme into a topical magazine show supplemented by short bulletins. David Scott was brought in from BBC Scotland as the station&#x27;s head of news and reverted &quot;Scotland Today&quot; back to a hard news format while long-running series including &quot;What&#x27;s Your Problem?&quot; and &quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot; were axed. Replacement programmes included the topical lunchtime show &quot;Live at One Thirty&quot; and social action series &quot;Scottish Action&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s, the company began gaining greater access to the national network, primarily through the soap opera &quot;Take the High Road&quot; and the long-running detective series &quot;Taggart&quot;, as well as programming for Channel 4. Towards the end of the decade, game shows &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Fun House&quot; began decade-long runs on the ITV network. During the late 1980s, the company, known as MAC III Productions, bought out the rights to game shows for the UK and foreign markets, including &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1990, Sir William Brown retired as managing director after 24 years of service, marking the longest serving chief executive in ITV history. He subsequently became chairman of Scottish Television plc from 1991 until 1996 Gus Macdonald was promoted as Managing Director and started overhauling the workforce by cutting it from 800 to 330 – Macdonald claimed the company was employing many more people though most were now freelancers.

In early 1992, J. Nigel Pickard became controller of entertainment and drama features. When he transferred from the outgoing ITV company TVS, some of the station&#x27;s children&#x27;s programmes continued production under Scottish Television including &quot;Art Attack&quot; and &quot;How 2&quot;. Pickard was based at an office in Maidstone (where many of Scottish&#x27;s new acquisitions were produced) until 1995, but he left the company in 1993. Scottish would continue as a major provider of children&#x27;s programming throughout the 1990s, including a number of co-productions with other broadcasters and production companies.

After retaining its franchise in 1991 unopposed with a bid of just £2,000 a year (just over £5 a day), plus 2% of their annual advertising revenue, STV&#x27;s production arm was placed into a separate company, &quot;Scottish Television Enterprises&quot;. The company invested shares in various ITV companies and media firms, including a 25% stake in GMTV as part of a consortium for the ITV breakfast franchise (STV&#x27;s stake was sold off to ITV plc in 2004 for £31 million), ITN and UTV, which helped push profits up to £10m. The company itself acquired new investors when in 1994 the Mirror Group brought 20% stake in company, In September 1995, STV acquired a 20% stake in HTV worth £36 million, as part of a deal with Flextech, which held a 20% stake while the Mirror Group stake was diluted to 16%. The deal also involved Mirror Group CEO David Montgomery and two Flextech executives joining the Scottish Television board, while Flextech committed to licensing more than 125 hours of drama and documentaries from STV. Within a month of the deal, the Mirror Group increased its stake to 19.93%.

In 1996, the HTV shares were sold off to the Wales and West contractor&#x27;s future owners United News and Media. For a short time, STV became a buyout target for Yorkshire Television. STV acquired Caledonian Publishing - then-publishers of The Herald and the Glasgow Evening Times - in July 1996. The following June, Scottish Media Group plc acquired Grampian Television, the ITV contractor for Northern Scotland, for £105 million. Shortly afterwards, the company became SMG.

In April 1998, Scottish formed a new partnership with Canadian entertainment company Nelvana and American TV network CBS to produce six new animated series, with Scottish having a significant creative input in the production of all their shows. Scottish Television Enterprises general manager Darrel James, who oversaw the deal, said: &quot;[It] came together in a surprisingly short time. We have worked very successfully with Nelvana on the Rupert series in the past. So when they came and asked us if we wanted to get involved, we said &#x27;yes&#x27; almost immediately. It is not often that you get the opportunity to work on such a high volume of co-produced material at one time.&quot; The new shows produced were &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Anatole&quot;, &quot;The Dumb Bunnies&quot;, &quot;Flying Rhino Junior High&quot;, &quot;Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend&quot; and &quot;Birdz&quot;. In November, Scottish doubled the funding for children&#x27;s programming.

Speculation followed in the summer of 1998 that STV&#x27;s 20% stake in GMTV would be sold off to help raise cash for new acquisitions in England, since the company continued to have no debt and could easily afford new purchases. At the end of the year, Gus Macdonald left the company to become a Scottish Trade Minister. In 1999, Mirror Group sold its stake to Granada

===2000s===
On 2 March 2006, it was announced by SMG plc (now &#x27;STV Group plc&#x27;) that Scottish Television would revert to the brand name of &#x27;STV&#x27;, used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as STV North. The new-look branding was launched on 30 May 2006.

In January 2007, the station launched separate news services for the East and West of the STV Central region, initially as a five-minute opt out within the 6:00pm edition of &quot;Scotland Today&quot; on weeknights.

==Studios==
From the station&#x27;s launch in 1957 until 1974, Scottish Television used the Theatre Royal, Glasgow on Hope Street as their main studio base and headquarters. Secondary studios at the Gateway Theatre on Leith Walk in Edinburgh were built in 1969 to accommodate more productions. The new facilities at Edinburgh grew in importance following the fatal Theatre Royal fire in November 1969, which gutted Studio A and several production suites.
Scottish&#x27;s main base moved in 1974 to custom built facilities on Renfield Street in Cowcaddens on land opposite the Theatre Royal site. Construction began on the new base in 1972 - it was officially opened on 12 December 1974 by Princess Alexandra, and expanded to accommodate further production in 1978. Following the completion of the new studio complex, the Theatre Royal was sold to Scottish Opera to become the first national opera house in Scotland, and the home of Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet.

Cowcaddens became Scottish&#x27;s main studio base where the majority of their productions were based. However, with the growing use of independent production companies as a source of programming, the need for increased studio space was alleviated. New Scottish programming, such as &quot;Art Attack&quot; and &quot;How 2&quot; from TVS was being made at the Maidstone Studios, where these programmes were formally based. As a cost-saving measure, the Gateway Theatre studios in Edinburgh, which for a time became the permanent studio home for &quot;Take the High Road&quot;, were closed in 1994.

In 2006, the newly rebranded STV moved from their Cowcaddens base to a new, smaller building at Pacific Quay alongside the headquarters of BBC Scotland. As a result of the move, the entire Cowcaddens site, with the exception of an extension containing &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot; newspapers, was demolished and redeveloped in 2007. STV&#x27;s Edinburgh operations are now based at small studios in Fountainbridge.

==Presentation==

Scottish Television&#x27;s first on-air symbol featured the Lion Rampant of Scotland. Initially a static caption, an animated ident was introduced by 1965 in which the lion would spin inside a box, though this later modified as a simple zoom in following, according to some reports, a complaint from The Lord Lyon King of Arms, the man in charge of protecting Scotland&#x27;s heraldry. The station&#x27;s first theme was a specially composed piece by Geraldo entitled &quot;Scotlandia&quot;, which began each day&#x27;s broadcasting – the theme continued to be heard until August 1985.

After the start of colour broadcasting, the lion rampant symbol was replaced within a year by a stylised &#x27;STV&#x27; logo. The solid STV lettering would be met by an outline of the lettering and the background would turn blue once both had met, accompanied by a trumpeted fanfare. Throughout the 1970s and up until 1985, this stylised STV was used as either a static caption, or form up from a patterned design that was supposed to represent tartan. Accompanying the look was a clock against a blue background with the white STV logo forming a pattern across the screen.

On 31 August 1985, the station revived the &#x27;Scottish Television&#x27; branding and introduced a computer generated thistle ident designed by Peter Goodfellow. Occasional special idents were also produced including a modified logo to mark the station&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1987, while the main ident was largely replaced in January 1988 in favour of a new set of seasonal and themed idents, but the 1985 clock was kept in use. The thistle logo was modified on 1 January 1989 to create a 2D identity which would remain in use until 27 February 2000, under various guises. Glasgow-based animation company Liquid Image, working with the Scottish Television in-house design department, created the station&#x27;s presentation packages in the 90s, first appearing on 1 January 1993 and 6 October 1996 respectively. Scottish did use the first national ITV ident from 1 September 1989, but used it in conjunction with its own branding: however, this was dropped by early 1990.

Scottish maintained in-vision continuity throughout its first thirty years on air. In later years, the station relied less on in-vision links compared to other ITV stations, although duty announcers also presented short regional news bulletins produced by the &quot;Scotland Today&quot; newsroom. In-vision continuity was confined to overnight junctions in February 1988 following the launch of 24-hour broadcasting and the start of the &quot;Scottish Through the Night&quot; service. The practice was abandoned in October 1991, when the overnight strand was relaunched as &quot;Scottish Night Time&quot;.

Scottish refused to adopt the 1999 ITV generic look and instead, alongside Grampian Television, launched a new on-screen logo on 28 February 2000, featuring a blue square with the words &#x27;Scottish TV&#x27; – a new set of 15 ident sequences featuring Scottish people and places was produced as part of the revamp. The presentation package remained in use until 6 January 2003, when Scottish and Grampian adopted the celebrity idents package, albeit with their own logos attached and also featuring Scottish and Grampian presenters.

The celebrity look remained until 2006, when the Scottish and Grampian names were traded in for one unified look: STV. The first ident package featured an elongated blue &#x27;S&#x27;, with scenes of Scottish people in various locations passing around the &#x27;S&#x27; from person to person in differing scenes, until one person places the S in the centre of the screen. An updated look was introduced on 23 March 2009, consisting of a picture postcard scene which would flip over to the right to reveal another theme. This flipping increases in pace and as the camera pulls back before the STV logo forms against a gradient blue background.

On 2 June 2014, STV&#x27;s logo was unified, along with Grampian&#x27;s. The white &quot;tv&quot; is now situated on a gradient blue triangle, and three light blue curves now appear on the 3 sides. The &quot;S&quot;&#x27; colours was changed to gradient light blue.

<doc id="370934" wikidata="Q57179" url="?curid=370934" title="Ernst Udet">
<text>Ernst Udet (26 April 1896 – 17 November 1941) was a German pilot during World War I and a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Colonel-General (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;) during World War II.

Udet joined the Imperial German Air Service in April 1915 at the age of 19, and eventually became a notable flying ace of World War I, scoring 62 confirmed victories. The highest scoring German fighter pilot to survive that war, and the second-highest scoring after Manfred von Richthofen, his commander in the Flying Circus, Udet rose to become a squadron commander under Richthofen, and later under Hermann Göring. Udet spent the 1920s and early 1930s as a stunt pilot, international barnstormer, light-aircraft manufacturer, and playboy.

On 1 May 1933 Udet joined the Nazi Party.
He became involved in the early development of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (officially founded on 15 May 1933), where he was appointed director of research and development. Influential in the adoption of dive-bombing techniques as well as of the Stuka dive bomber, by 1939 Udet had risen to the post of Chief of Procurement and Supply for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The stress of the position and his distaste for administrative duties led to Udet developing alcoholism.

The launch of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, combined with issues with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s needs for equipment outstripping Germany&#x27;s production capacity and increasingly poor relations with the Nazi Party, caused Udet to choose suicide on 17 November 1941 by shooting himself in the head.

== Early life ==
Ernst Udet was born on 26 April 1896, in Frankfurt am Main, German Empire. Udet grew up in Munich, and was known from his early childhood for his sunny temperament and fascination with aviation. In his youth he spent considerable time at a nearby airplane factory and an army airship detachment. In 1909, he helped found the Munich Aero-Club. After crashing a glider he and a friend constructed, he finally flew in 1913 with a test pilot in the nearby Otto Works owned by Gustav Otto, which he often visited.

== Military career ==
=== World War I ===

Shortly after the beginning of World War I, Udet attempted to enlist in the Imperial German Army on 2 August 1914, but at only tall he did not then qualify for enlistment. Later that month, when the &quot;Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club&quot; appealed for volunteers with motorcycles, Udet applied and was accepted. Udet&#x27;s father had given him a motorcycle when he had passed his first year examination, and along with four friends, Udet was posted to the 26. &quot;Württembergischen&quot; Reserve Division as a &quot;messenger rider.&quot; After injuring his shoulder when his motorcycle hit a crater from an artillery shell explosion, he was sent to a military hospital, and his motorcycle was sent for repairs. When Udet tried to track down the 26th Division, he was unable to find it and decided to serve in the vehicle depot in Namur. During this time, he met officers from the Chauny flying sector, who advised him to transfer as an aerial observer. Before he received his orders, the army dispensed with the volunteer motorcyclists, and Udet was sent back to the recruiting officials.

Udet tried to return to the fighting, but he was unable to get into either the pilot or aircraft mechanic training the army offered. However, he learned that if he were a trained pilot, he would be immediately accepted into army aviation. Through a family friend, Gustav Otto, owner of the aircraft factory he had hung out around in his youth, Udet received private flight training. This cost him 2,000 Deutsche Marks (about $400 in 1915 U.S. dollars) and new bathroom equipment from his father&#x27;s firm. Udet received his civilian pilot&#x27;s license at the end of April 1915 and was immediately accepted by the Imperial German Air Service.

==== Artillery ranging ====
Udet at first flew in &quot;Feld Flieger-Abteilung&quot; 206 (FFA 206)—an observation unit—as an &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; (non-commissioned) pilot with observer &quot;Leutnant&quot; Bruno Justinius. He and his observer won the Iron Cross (2nd class for Udet and 1st class for his lieutenant) for nursing their damaged Aviatik B.I two-seater back to German lines after a shackle on a wing-cable snapped. Justinius had climbed out to hold the wing and balance it, rather than land behind the enemy lines and be captured. After this structural failure, and a similar incident in which &quot;Leutnant&quot; Winter and &quot;Vizefeldwebel&quot; Preiss lost their lives, the Aviatik B was retired from active service.

Later, Udet was court-martialed for losing an aircraft in an incident the flying corps considered a result of bad judgement. Overloaded with fuel and bombs, the aircraft stalled after a sharp bank and plunged to the ground. Miraculously, both Udet and Justinius survived with only minor injuries. Udet was placed under arrest in the guardhouse for seven days. On his way out of the guardhouse, he was asked to fly &quot;Lieutenant&quot; Hartmann to observe a bombing raid on Belfort. A bomb thrown by hand by the &quot;leutnant&quot; became stuck in the landing gear, but Udet performed aerobatics and managed to shake it loose. As soon as the Air Staff Officer heard about Udet&#x27;s performance during the incident, he ordered Udet transferred to the fighter command.

==== Fighter pilot ====
Udet was assigned a new Fokker to fly to his new fighter unit—FFA 68—at Habsheim. Mechanically defective, the plane crashed into a hangar when he took off, so he was then given an older Fokker to fly. In this aircraft, he experienced his first aerial combat, which almost ended in disaster. While lining up on a French Caudron, Udet found he could not bring himself to fire on another person and was subsequently fired on by the Frenchman. A bullet grazed his cheek and smashed his flying goggles. Udet survived the encounter, but from then on learned to attack aggressively and began scoring victories, downing his first French opponent on 18 March 1916. On that occasion, he had scrambled to attack two French aircraft, but instead found himself facing a formation of 23 enemy aircraft. He dived from above and behind, giving his Fokker E.III full throttle, and opened fire on a Farman F.40 from close range. Udet pulled away, leaving the flaming bomber trailing smoke, only to see the observer fall from the rear seat of the stricken craft. He later described the incident: &quot;The fuselage of the Farman dives down past me like a giant torch... A man, his arms and legs spread out like a frog&#x27;s, falls past--the observer. At the moment, I don&#x27;t think of them as human beings. I feel only one thing--victory, triumph, victory.&quot; The victory won Udet the Iron Cross First Class.

That year, FFA 68 was renamed &quot;Kampfeinsitzer Kommando&quot; Habsheim before becoming &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 15 on 28 September 1916. Udet claimed five more victories, before transferring to &quot;Jasta&quot; 37 in June 1917. In the first of his victories on 12 October 1916, Udet forced a French Breguet to land safely in German territory, then landed nearby to prevent its destruction by its crew. The bullet-punctured tires on Udet&#x27;s Fokker flipped the plane forward onto its top wings and fuselage. Udet and the French pilot eventually shook hands next to the Frenchman&#x27;s aircraft. In January 1917, Udet was commissioned as a &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot; (lieutenant of reserves). The same month, &quot;Jasta&quot; 15 re-equipped with the Albatros D.III, a new fighter with twin synchronized Maschinengewehr 08 machine guns. On 15 August 1917 he shot down his 8th victory-a Sopwith Strutter 1/2 of 43d Squadron RFC.

During his service with &quot;Jasta&quot; 15, Udet later wrote he had encountered Georges Guynemer, a notable French ace, in single combat at . Guynemer, who preferred to hunt enemy planes alone, by this time was the leading French ace with more than 30 victories. Udet saw Guynemer and they circled each other, looking for an opening and testing each other&#x27;s turning abilities. They were close enough for Udet to read the &quot;&quot;Vieux&quot; of &quot;Vieux Charles&quot;&quot; written on Guynemer&#x27;s Spad S.VII. The opponents tried every aerobatic trick they knew and Guynemer fired a burst through Udet&#x27;s upper wing, however maneuvered for advantage. Once Udet had Guynemer in his sights, his machine guns jammed and while pretending to dogfight he pounded on them with his fists, desperate to unjam them. Guynemer realized his predicament and instead of taking advantage of it, simply waved a farewell and flew away. Udet wrote of the fight, &quot;For seconds, I forgot that the man across from me was Guynemer, my enemy. It seems as though I were sparring with an older comrade over our own airfield.&quot; Udet felt that Guynemer had spared him because he wanted a fair fight, while others have suggested that Guynemer had a gun jam himself, feared that Udet would ram him in desperation, or the French ace was so impressed with Udet&#x27;s skills that he hoped they might meet again on equal terms.

Eventually, every pilot in &quot;Jasta&quot; 15 was killed except Udet and his commander, Heinrich Gontermann, who said to Udet: &quot;The bullets fall from the hand of God ... Sooner or later they will hit us.&quot; Udet applied for a transfer to &quot;Jasta&quot; 37, and Gontermann was killed three months later when the upper wing of his new Fokker Dr. 1 tore off as he was flying it for the first time. Gontermann lingered for twenty four hours without awakening and Udet later remarked, &quot;It was a good death.&quot; By late November, Udet was a triple ace and &quot;Jastaführer&quot;, modelling his attacks after those of Guynemer, coming in high out of the sun to pick off the rear aircraft in a squadron before the others knew what was happening. Having witnessed one of these attacks, his commander in &quot;Jasta&quot; 37 Kurt Grasshoff, on being transferred, selected Udet for command over more senior men. Udet&#x27;s ascension to command on 7 November 1917, was followed six days later by award of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. Despite his seemingly frivolous nature, drinking late into the night, and womanizing lifestyle, Udet proved an excellent squadron commander. He spent many hours coaching new fighter pilots, with an emphasis on marksmanship as being essential for success.

==== The Flying Circus ====
Udet&#x27;s success attracted attention for his skill, earning him an invitation to join the &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 1 (JG 1), an elite unit of German fighter aces under the command of Manfred von Richthofen, popularly known as the Red Baron. Richthofen drove up to Udet one day as he was trying to pitch a tent in Flanders in the rain, pointing out that Udet had 20 kills, Richthofen said, &quot;Then you would actually seem ripe for us. Would you like to?&quot;, which Udet accepted. After watching him shoot down an artillery spotter by frontal attack, Richthofen gave Udet command of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11, von Richthofen&#x27;s former squadron command. The group commanded by Richthofen also contained &quot;Jastas&quot; 4, 6 and 10. Udet&#x27;s enthusiasm for Richthofen was unbounded, who demanded total loyalty and dedication from his pilots, immediately cashiering anyone who fell out of line. At the same time, Richthofen treated them with every consideration and when it came time to requisition supplies he traded favors for autographed photos of himself that read: &quot;Dedicated to my esteemed fighting companion.&quot; Udet remarked that because of the signed photographs, &quot; ... sausage and ham never ran out.&quot; One night, the squadron invited a captured British flyer for dinner, treating him as a guest. When he excused himself for the bathroom, the Germans secretly watched to see if he would try to escape. On his return the Englishman said, &quot;I would never forgive myself for disappointing such hosts&quot;; the British flyer did escape later from another unit.
Richthofen was killed in April 1918 in France, where Udet was not at the front as he had been sent on leave due to a painful ear infection which he avoided having treated as long as he could. Udet said about Richthofen: &quot;He was the least complicated man I ever knew. Entirely Prussian and the greatest of soldiers.&quot; before returning to JG 1 against the doctor&#x27;s advice and remained there to the end of the war, commanding &quot;Jasta&quot; 4. While at home, Udet had reacquainted himself with his childhood sweetheart, Eleanor &quot;Lo&quot; Zink. Notified that he had received the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, he had one made up in advance so that he could impress her, and painted her name on the side of his Albatros fighters and Fokker D VII. Also on the tail of his Fokker D VII was the message &quot;Du doch nicht&quot; - &quot;Definitely not you.&quot; Udet scored 20 victories in August 1918 alone, mainly against British aircraft and became a national hero with 62 confirmed victories to his credit.

On 29 June 1918, Udet was one of the early fliers to be saved by parachuting from a disabled aircraft, when he jumped after a clash with a French Breguet. His harness caught on the rudder and he had to break off the rudder tip to escape. His parachute did not open until he was 75 m (250 ft) from the ground, causing him to sprain his ankle on landing. On 28 September 1918, Udet was wounded in the thigh, from which he was still recovering on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when the war ended in Germany&#x27;s defeat.

=== Inter-war period ===

After the war, on his way home from the military hospital, Udet had to defend himself against a Communist who wished to rip the medals off his chest. Udet and Robert Greim performed mock dogfights at weekends for the POW Relief Organization, using surplus aircraft in Bavaria. He was invited to start the first International Air Service between Germany and Austria, but after the first flight the Entente Commission confiscated his aircraft. Udet married Eleanor &quot;Lo&quot; Zink on 25 February 1920, however the marriage lasted less than three years and they were divorced on 16 February 1923. The marriage is believed to have ended due to Udet having had many affairs. His talents were numerous: among these were juggling, drawing cartoons, and party entertainment.
During the inter-war period, Udet was known primarily for his work as a stunt pilot and for playboy-like behavior. He flew for movies and for airshows (e.g. picking a cloth from the ground with his wingtip, flying under low bridges and completing loops only several meters from the ground). One stunt only Udet performed was successive loops with the last complete after turning off the engine mid air and landing the aircraft in a sideways glide. He appeared with Leni Riefenstahl in three films: &quot;The White Hell of Pitz Palu&quot; (1929), &quot;Stürme über dem Mont Blanc&quot; (1930), and &quot;S.O.S. Eisberg&quot; (1933). Udet&#x27;s stunt pilot work in films took him to California. In the October 1933 issue of &quot;New Movie Magazine&quot;, there is a photo of Carl Laemmle, Jr.&#x27;s party for Udet in Hollywood. Laemmle was head of Universal Studios which made &quot;SOS Eisberg,&quot; a US-German co-production. Udet was invited to attend the National Air Races at Cleveland, Ohio. In 1935 he played himself in &quot;Miracle of Flight&quot; (1935; 79 mins.) directed by Heinz Paul. His co-star Jürgen Ohlsen, who had previously starred in the extremely popular film &quot;Hitlerjunge Quex: Ein Film vom Opfergeist der deutschen Jugend&quot;, played a youth who lost his pilot father in World War I and was befriended and encouraged by Udet, his idol. In the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics Udet entered the arts competition literature category with his autobiography, &quot;Mein Fliegerleben&quot; (My Flying Life) (published 1935).
These efforts were good publicity for Udet. An American, William Pohl of Milwaukee, telephoned him with an offer to back an aircraft manufacturing company. Udet Flugzeugbau was born in a shed in Milbertshofen. Its intent was to build small aircraft that the general public could fly. It soon ran into trouble with the Entente Commission and transferred its operations to a beehive and chicken coop factory.

The first aeroplane that Udet&#x27;s company produced was the &quot;U2&quot;. Udet took the second model, the U4, to the Wilbur Cup race in Buenos Aires at the expense of Aero Club Aleman. It was outclassed, and the club wanted him to do cigarette commercials to reimburse them for the expense, but he refused. He was rescued by the Chief of the Argentinian Railways, a man of Swedish descent named Tornquist, who settled the debt.

In 1924, Udet left Udet Flugzeugbau when they decided to build a four-engine aircraft, the U11 Kondor which was larger and not for the general population. He and another friend from the war, Angermund, started an exhibition flying enterprise in Germany, which was also successful, but Udet remarked, &quot;In time this too begins to get tiresome. ... We stand in the present, fighting for a living. It isn&#x27;t always easy. ... But the thoughts wander back to the times when it was worthwhile to fight for your life.&quot;

Udet and another wartime comrade—Suchocky—became pilots to an African filming expedition. The cameraman was another veteran, Schneeberger, whom Udet called &quot;Flea,&quot; and the guide was Siedentopf, a former East African estate owner. Udet described one incident in Africa in which lions jumped up to claw at the low-flying aircraft, one of them removing a strip of Suchocky&#x27;s wing surface. Udet engaged in hunting while in Africa.

=== World War II ===
==== Building the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ====
Though not interested in politics, Udet joined the Nazi party in 1933 when Hermann Göring promised to buy him two new U.S.-built Curtiss Hawk II biplanes (export designation of the F11C-2 Goshawk Helldiver). The planes were used for evaluation purposes and thus indirectly influenced the German idea of dive bombing aeroplanes, such as the Junkers Ju 87 (&quot;Stuka&quot;) dive bombers. They were also used for aerobatic shows held during the 1936 Summer Olympics. Udet piloted one of them, which survived the war and is now on display in the Polish Aviation Museum.

After the trials of the Ju 87, a confidential directive issued on 9 June 1936 by Wolfram von Richthofen called for the cessation of all further Ju 87 development, although the Ju 87 had been awarded top marks and was about to be accepted. However, Udet immediately rejected von Richthofen&#x27;s instructions and Ju 87 development continued. Udet became a major proponent of the dive bomber, taking credit for having introduced it to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. On 9 June 1936 he had, through his political connections, been named Chief of the Technical Office, &quot;T-Amt,&quot; (the development wing of the Reich Ministry of Aviation). Udet had no real interest in this job nor a particular aptitude for it, especially the bureaucracy of it, and the pressure led to him developing an addiction to alcohol, drinking large amounts of brandy and cognac.

In January 1939, Udet visited Italian North Africa (&quot;Africa Settentrionale Italiana&quot;, or ASI), accompanying &quot;Maresciallo dell″Aria&quot; (Marshal of the Air Force) Italo Balbo on a flight, because at the time there were distinct signs of German military and diplomatic co-operation with the Italians. On 1 February 1939 Udet became &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Generalluftzeugmeister&quot; (Chief of Procurement and Supply), responsible for all aircraft production, armament and supply. This was a massive organization supervising over 26 departments and, again, requiring organizational qualities for which Udet was not best equipped.

When World War II began, his internal conflicts grew more intense as aircraft production requirements were much more than the German industry could supply, given limited access to raw materials such as aluminium. Göring responded to this problem by simply lying about it to Adolf Hitler, and after the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s defeat in the Battle of Britain, Göring tried to deflect Hitler&#x27;s ire by blaming Udet. On 22 June 1941, the launch of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, drove Udet further into despair. In April and May 1941, Udet had led a German delegation inspecting the Soviet aviation industry in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Udet informed Göring that the Soviet air force and aviation industry were very strong and technically advanced. Göring decided not to report this to Hitler, hoping that a surprise attack would quickly destroy the Soviet Union. Udet realized that the upcoming war on the Soviet Union might destroy Germany. He tried to explain this to Hitler but, torn between truth and loyalty, suffered a psychological breakdown. Göring kept Udet under control by giving him drugs at drinking parties and hunting trips. Udet&#x27;s drinking and psychological condition became a problem, and Göring used Udet&#x27;s dependency to manipulate him.

== Death ==

By August 1941, the pressures from the Soviet campaign were exacerbating the conflicts between Udet and State Secretary Erhard Milch. In order to attain a mandated quadrupling of production, Milch was pressing Udet for a major reorganisation of his department. Udet resisted, but by September, Göring sided with Milch and several members of Udet&#x27;s staff were removed, as Milch began to assert increasing control over procurement and supply. Udet was losing his freedom of action and was clearly being eclipsed.

On 17 November 1941, Udet shot himself in the head while he was on the phone with his girlfriend, Inge Bleyle. Udet&#x27;s suicide was concealed from the public, and at his funeral, he was lauded as a hero who had died in flight while he was testing a new weapon. On their way to attend Udet&#x27;s funeral, the World War II fighter ace Werner Mölders died in a plane crash in Breslau, and the high &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; executive &quot;General der Flieger&quot; Helmuth Wilberg died in another plane crash near Dresden. Udet was buried next to Manfred von Richthofen in the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin. Mölders was buried next to Udet.

According to Udet&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Fall of an Eagle&quot;, he wrote a suicide note in red pencil that included: &quot;Ingelein, why have you left me?&quot; and &quot;Iron One, you are responsible for my death&quot;. &quot;Ingelein&quot; referred to his girlfriend, Inge Bleyle, and &quot;Iron One&quot; to Hermann Göring. The book &quot;The Luftwaffe War Diaries&quot; similarly states that Udet wrote &quot;&quot;Reichsmarschall&quot;, why have you deserted me?&quot; in red on the headboard of his bed. Evidence indicates that Udet&#x27;s unhappy relationship with Göring, Erhard Milch and the Nazi Party in general was the cause of a mental breakdown.

<text>Vincent T. Bugliosi Jr. (; August 18, 1934 – June 6, 2015) was an American prosecutor and author who served as Deputy District Attorney for the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office between 1964 and 1972. He became best known for successfully prosecuting Charles Manson and other defendants accused of the Tate–LaBianca murders that took place between August 9 and August 10, 1969.

In 1972, Bugliosi left the District Attorney&#x27;s (DA) office and started a private practice, which included defense cases for criminal trials. He twice ran for the DA&#x27;s office, but was not elected. He also began his writing career, exploring notable criminal cases.

==Early life and education==
Bugliosi was born on August 18, 1934, in Hibbing, Minnesota, to parents of Italian descent. When he was in high school, his family moved to Los Angeles. Bugliosi graduated from Hollywood High School. He attended the University of Miami on a tennis scholarship and graduated in 1956. In 1964, he earned his law degree from the UCLA School of Law, where he was president of his graduating class. 

==Career==
Bugliosi began his law career in the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office in 1964, where he served as a deputy district attorney for eight years, through 1972. He successfully prosecuted 105 out of 106 felony jury trials, which included 21 murder convictions.

===Manson prosecution===

As a Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney, Bugliosi came to national attention for prosecuting the seven murders that took place August 9–10, 1969, in which Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Parent, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were killed.

Bugliosi successfully prosecuted Charles Manson, Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Van Houten for these murders, and each was convicted. He was credited especially with gaining conviction of Manson, who, although he had tied up the La Biancas, had not been physically present during the actual murders.

===Political candidate===
In 1972, Bugliosi ran as a Democrat for Los Angeles County District Attorney against longtime incumbent Joseph Busch. Joseph Gellman was his legal counsel for this campaign. Bugliosi narrowly lost the campaign. Bugliosi ran again in 1976, after Busch died of a heart attack in 1975, but lost to interim District Attorney John Van de Kamp, who was incumbent.

===Private practice===
After leaving the Los Angeles district attorney&#x27;s office in 1972, Bugliosi turned to private practice. He represented three criminal defendants, achieving acquittals for each of them—the most famous of which was Stephanie Stearns (referred to as &quot;Jennifer Jenkins&quot; in his book, &quot;And The Sea Will Tell&quot;, whom he defended for the murder of Eleanor &quot;Muff&quot; Graham on Palmyra Atoll, a South Pacific island.

===O. J. Simpson case===
Bugliosi wrote &quot;&quot; (1996), about the acquittal of O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Bugliosi argues that Simpson was guilty. He criticizes the work of the district attorney, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and Judge Lance Ito. He criticized the media for characterizing Simpson&#x27;s lawyers as &quot;the Dream Team&quot;, and said that the lawyers were unremarkable and of average ability. He used his profiles to explore what he considers broader problems in American criminal justice, the media, and the political appointment of judges.

===Bill Clinton===
Bugliosi criticized the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot;. In his book, &quot;No Island of Sanity&quot;, he argues that the right of a president to be free of a private lawsuit while in office outweighed Paula Jones&#x27;s interest in having her case brought to trial immediately.

===George W. Bush===

Bugliosi condemned the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; case that decided the 2000 presidential election. He wrote a lengthy criticism of the case for &quot;The Nation&quot;, titled &quot;None Dare Call It Treason&quot;, which he later expanded into a book titled &quot;The Betrayal of America&quot;. Some of his criticisms were depicted in the 2004 documentary &quot;Orwell Rolls in His Grave.&quot; He also believed that George W. Bush should have been charged with the murders of the thousands of American soldiers who died in the Invasion of Iraq, because of his belief that Bush launched the invasion under false pretenses. In his book, &quot;The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder,&quot; he laid out his view of evidence and outlined what questions he would ask Bush at a potential murder trial. Bugliosi testified at a House Judiciary Committee meeting on July 25, 2008, at which he urged impeachment proceedings for Bush. The book formed the basis of a 2012 documentary film, &quot;The Prosecution of an American President.&quot;

===RFK assassination===

Bugliosi is on record for believing that Senator Robert F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. He said the following during a civil trial of the RFK assassination: &quot;We are talking about a conspiracy to commit murder ... a conspiracy the prodigious dimensions of which would make Watergate look like a one-roach marijuana case. ... The signed statements given me perhaps can be explained away, but in the absence of a logical explanation, these statements, by simple arithmetic, add up to too many bullets and therefore, the &quot;probability&quot; of a second gun.&quot; As a result of his research, Bugliosi came to refute conspiracy theories.
===JFK assassination===

In 1986, Bugliosi played the part of prosecutor in an unscripted 21-hour mock television trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. His legal opponent, representing Oswald, was the well-known criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. London Weekend Television sponsored the mock trial, which followed Texas criminal trial procedure. It also included a former Texas judge and a jury of U.S. citizens from the Dallas area which reviewed hundreds of exhibits and listened to witnesses who testified about the assassination. The jury found Oswald guilty. Spence remarked, &quot;No other lawyer in America could have done what Vince did in this case.&quot;

The program required extensive preparation by Bugliosi and inspired him to later write a comprehensive book on the subject of the assassination. His 1,612-page book with a CD-ROM containing an additional 958 pages of endnotes and 170 pages of source notes, &quot;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy,&quot; was published in May 2007. His book examined the JFK assassination in detail and drew on a variety of sources; his findings were in line with those of the Warren Report, which concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of the 35th President. He called &quot;Reclaiming History&quot; his &quot;magnum opus.&quot; The book won the 2008 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime. A portion of the book was re-published in 2008 as &quot;Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&quot;, which became the basis of the 2013 film &quot; Parkland&quot;.

The title of &quot;Reclaiming History&quot; derived from Bugliosi&#x27;s belief that the history of the Kennedy assassination has been hijacked by conspiracy theories, the popularity of which, he asserted, has a pernicious and ongoing effect on American thought:

===Writing career===
After leaving the district attorney&#x27;s office, Bugliosi wrote, jointly with Curt Gentry, a book about the Manson trial called &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (1974). The book won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the best true crime book of the year. It was adapted twice for television movies (one produced in 1976 and one in 2004). As of 2015, it is the best-selling true crime book in publishing history, with more than 7 million copies sold.

Bugliosi wrote several other books, mostly dealing with well-known crimes. His works include &quot;And the Sea Will Tell&quot; (1991), which he wrote with Bruce Henderson about the murder case against Stephanie Stearns. It was a #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book. He later wrote &quot;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&quot; (2007), in which he challenged numerous conspiracy theories and explored the events surrounding the assassination. He also wrote &quot;The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder&quot; (2008), a condemnation of former president George W. Bush&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq.

====Method of writing====
Bugliosi did not own a computer and at one time did all his research through library microfilm archives. In his later years, he relied on his virtual secretary, Rosemary Newton, to help with these tasks. He also wrote his books entirely by hand, with Newton later transcribing his long-hand texts.

==Personal life==
Bugliosi was married, and he and his wife Gail had two children: a daughter, Wendy, and a son, Vince Jr. Although raised Catholic, Bugliosi said later in life that he was an agnostic, although he was open to the ideas of deism.

==Death==

Bugliosi died of cancer at age 80, at a Los Angeles hospital on June 6, 2015. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>Grampian Television was the original name of the Channel 3 service for the north of Scotland founded in 1961 and which, decades later, was merged with the Central Belt channel STV. The northern region&#x27;s coverage area includes the Northern Isles, Western Isles, Highlands (except Fort William and Lochaber), Grampian, Tayside (except the Kinross area), and parts of north Fife.

Grampian went on the air on 30 September 1961. The company was bought out in 1997 by STV Group (the parent company of STV, the Channel 3 broadcaster in Central Scotland). The name &quot;Grampian Television&quot; was retired in 2006 and the channel is now known as &quot;STV&quot; on-air. STV runs one service which covers both central and northern Scotland but with separate news bulletins. Legally, however, the two services are still licensed separately; the northern licence is held by STV North, which is owned and operated by STV Group plc (formerly SMG plc), and the southern licence by STV Central (previously known as Scottish Television).

As an independent company, Grampian had a very distinctive local personality which was quite different from STV&#x27;s. After the station was bought, it gradually assimilated with STV, culminating in the change of name in 2006. STV did not adopt the generic ITV branding that is now used in the other Channel 3 regions which are owned by ITV plc.

STV&#x27;s regional news programme for Northern Scotland is called &quot;STV News at Six&quot; and is supplemented by short news bulletins on weekdays. The station also produces regional television commercials.

In 2007, the United Kingdom began its five year programme to end analogue television broadcasts as part of the switchover to digital transmissions, with the eight transmitters covering the STV North region (Angus, Rosemarkie, Knockmore, Eitshal, Durris, Bressay, Rumster Forest and Keelylang Hill) switching over from May to October 2010. The digital switchover ended in 2012.

==History==
===Foundation and launch===
Applications for the new North East Scotland contract area were sought by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) in the spring of 1960. From the original seven applicants, three serious contenders emerged and the contract was awarded in August 1960 to &quot;North of Scotland Television Limited&quot; on the provision that board positions were offered to the other two final applicants, &quot;Caledonian Television&quot; and &quot;North Caledonian Television&quot;. The company&#x27;s first managing director was G.E. Ward Thomas who later established Yorkshire Television in 1968.

The name &quot;North of Scotland TV&quot; was considered too cumbersome for use and to reflect the input of the other applicants, a new name was chosen on 11 January 1961– &quot;Grampian Television&quot; after one of the key Scottish mountain ranges, the Grampian Mountains. Grampian planned to launch on 1 October 1961 and had already bought and converted their studios for the start date. However, four months prior to launch, the Post Office announced that the links which would connect Grampian to the network would not be ready until February 1962. This would have left the new station only able to broadcast output from its neighboring colleagues at Scottish Television (STV). Pressure at the highest level of Government ensured that the links were in place in time for the station&#x27;s planned launch.

The first (pre-launch) test transmissions from the Durris transmitting station began on 1 September 1961. A week later, Grampian announced the names of their initial announcers-June Imray, Douglas Kynoch and Elizabeth Mackenzie -all of them were teachers. However, Mackenzie handed in her resignation the day before the station launched &quot;for health reasons&quot;; Her position was initially filled by 23 year-old Jimmy Sleigh, before James Spankie came into Grampian as the permanent replacement.

Grampian Television went on air on Saturday 30 September 1961 at 2.45 pm (the 15th ITA franchise to launch) with the opening authority announcement from continuity announcer Douglas Kynoch and a brief welcome from the chairman of the Independent Television Authority, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick:

Douglas Kynoch:

&quot;Good afternoon. This is the first transmission of Grampian Television Limited, over the Durris and Monteagle transmitters of the Independent Television Authority. Today, we&#x27;re about to join all the millions of viewers of the Independent Television network and we&#x27;re very glad to have in our studios, to switch us into the network, the chairman of the Independent Television Authority, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick.&quot;

Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick:

&quot;Good afternoon. I am glad to be in Aberdeen today to welcome you into the great family of Independent Television viewers. You now have your own television company in the North East and I hope that you&#x27;ll very soon come to regard Grampian Television as an essential part of your everyday life. I wish you and Grampian the best of luck and now, let us join the network.&quot;

Following the brief opening, the station handed over to ABC&#x27;s networked coverage of &quot;Racing from Catterick Bridge&quot;. Later in the opening day at 7pm, Grampian&#x27;s first chairman, Sir Alexander B. King, presented a half-hour introductory programme about the station. At the time of launch, Grampian served a potential audience of 332,000 people in 98,000 homes.

===Early years on air===
In its first year, Grampian produced nine regular regional programmes - namely &quot;News and Views&quot; (a thrice-weekly magazine programme), &quot;Country Focus&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Serenade&quot;, &quot;Scotland for Me&quot;, &quot;Points North&quot; (a long-running current affairs programme), &quot;Grampian Golf&quot;, local news bulletins and monthly church services.

In the early days, Grampian struggled as viewers in a key part of its transmission area, the city of Dundee, were still tuning into coverage from STV via the strong signal of the Black Hill transmitter. Three months after its first transmission, the station was only attracting 13% of the available audience in Dundee while viewing audiences across the region turned out to be less than had been hoped for. Viewer correspondence was said to amount to little more than half a dozen letters per week.

The problems in Dundee along with the effects of Television Advertising Duty and the Equity Strike led to heavy financial losses and a subsequent reduction in transmitter rental for Grampian. But by the end of 1962, the station had succeeded in increasing audience in both Dundee and the region as a whole. The success in viewing figures were attributed to an increase in regional programming.

Whereas Grampian had previously restricted its output to news and current affairs beforehand, production controller James Buchan decided to &quot;go for broke&quot; and branch out to produce light entertainment and music shows (originally, at the rate of four programmes a week) - such programming would remain a staple of the station&#x27;s local output for the next forty years or so. By 1963, no less than fifty Grampian shows had featured in the local Top Ten audience ratings.

Towards the end of the decade, the station&#x27;s potential audience reached a million viewers and Grampian was employing just over 200 staff at their studios in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh. Prior to the 1968 contract round, smaller regional stations sought an affiliation with one of the four major ITV companies, who would provide the bulk of their programming. Grampian chose to link up with ABC Weekend Television.

===1974 strike===

On 6 September 1974, management learned that staff producer Tony Bacon had shown banned pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; in the studio to friends the previous day, and fired him. The Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT) at the Aberdeen studio walked out that night. The strikers stated that Grampian had not followed the agreement with the union on firings, and believed firing Bacon for the showing was excessive. &quot;More than one million viewers&quot; lost the ITV network, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; wrote, &quot;from the Orkneys to the Tay&quot;. Grampian refused the union&#x27;s demand to challenge the firing; executives believed that the company might lose its license for the showing, and that they might be prosecuted. A striking worker said that about 40 people including executives saw the film, and that if Bacon should be fired everyone else should be too.

The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) refused to intervene unless Grampian requested it. ITV risked the strike expanding to elsewhere in the network. ACTT asked that former controller Buchan act as business mediator between the two sides. What the media called a &quot;sex film strike&quot; ended on 18 September when Bacon agreed to resign, after 13 years at Grampian, and the 65 ACTT strikers returned to work. His manager, programme controller Bob Hird, resigned after admitting that he had not reported seeing the film. Bacon reportedly received a buyout to leave the company. The strike cost Grampian £100,000, compared to its £149,718 profit the previous year.

===Technological advances===
Grampian was slower than most other ITV stations to begin colour broadcasting which, after the company invested £180,000 () in new equipment, started in September 1971—an occasion timed to mark their 10th anniversary on air.

The launch of the colour service led to a strike over Christmas 1971. A new film editor had signed a mutuality-binding three-month contract, and Grampian&#x27;s decision to offer him permanent employment was not exercised. For the Christmas period, Grampian had hired colour studio cameras especially for the Hogmanay programmes and the filming of a networked documentary. The station resumed broadcasting at 10 pm on Boxing Day, which allowed the station to broadcast its first networked colour documentary &quot;Two Of A Kind&quot;.

Despite this, the station did come up with a number of technical firsts. The most notable of these came in 1978 when Grampian became the first British television station to replace 16mm film cameras with Electronic News Gathering [ENG] video cameras for news coverage - a move which finally allowed its regional news programme &quot;Grampian Today&quot; to extend from three to five nights a week. Grampian also developed its own outside broadcast unit, initially using studio equipment. Later developments would allow Grampian to further enhance its regional news service and on air presentation, which relied heavily on in-vision continuity.

===The franchise rounds===
Following the station&#x27;s earlier troubles, Grampian Television, along with all other ITV companies at the time, won a three-year extension to their license (later extended by a further year) in 1964. In 1967, they went unopposed by any other consortiums to win a further six-year contract from July 1968 - a contract expanded by a further eight years in 1974.

Six years later, Grampian won another eight-year franchise (later extended to ten years), effective of January 1982. The only change made to the license was the classification of the franchise as &quot;North and North East Scotland&quot;, as opposed to &quot;North East Scotland&quot; - a change which the station had already capitalized upon in January 1980 when &quot;Grampian Today&quot; was relaunched as &quot;North Tonight&quot; as part of a major expansion for Grampian&#x27;s news operation.

The Broadcasting Act of 1990 led to a significant change in the way ITV franchises were awarded - as opposed to the straightforward review process utilized by the outgoing Independent Broadcasting Authority, the new &quot;light-touch&quot; regulator, the Independent Television Commission, required that the successful applicant pass a &quot;quality threshold&quot; and business plan.

In the event, Grampian was outbid by two challengers; &quot;Channel 3 Caledonia&quot; and &quot;North of Scotland Television&quot; (the latter of which was ironically the name of the original Grampian Television consortium). Both competitors failed to pass the quality threshold, and Grampian won back the franchise by default with a bid of £720,000 per year.

After retaining its franchise, Grampian sought to expand its media business interests. In May 1994, the company won the new Central Scotland FM radio licence in partnership with Border Television - the new station, Scot FM (now Heart Scotland), had an uneasy start as it struggled with ratings and programming. Border pulled out of Scot FM a year later, before Grampian sold it off in July 1996 to the Independent Radio Group for £5.25 million.

At the same time, Grampian also owned shares in Moray Firth Radio, until they were sold off to Scottish Radio Holdings.

===Networked production===
With encouragement from the IBA, Grampian and other small ITV companies were encouraged to produce more network output following the 1980 franchise round. The station had previously produced a small number of networked or part-networked productions including the daytime adult education series &quot;Katie Stewart Cooks&quot; and the light entertainment show &quot;Melody Inn&quot;. Prior to this, Grampian had expectations of becoming one of the major players in networking new programming for ITV2 (this was before Channel 4 was created, and the inception for ITV2 was discussed at that time which never came to fruition. This is not to be confused with the ITV2 which is now known on the digital platform).

In the franchise period following, the station was commissioned to produce networked series of the local film magazine programme &quot;The Electric Theatre Show&quot; (following a successful run on London Weekend Television) alongside new series including occasional variety show &quot;Magic of the Musicals&quot;, lifestyle series &quot;Pennywise&quot; &amp; &quot;Hot Property&quot;, networked one-off documentaries such as &quot;A Prince Among Islands&quot; and children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;James the Cat&quot;.

The station also produced various editions of several series co-produced by most ITV regions - namely the religious programme &quot;Highway&quot;, current affairs debate &quot;The Time, The Place&quot;, documentary strand &quot;About Britain&quot; and the Saturday morning children&#x27;s shows &quot;Get Fresh&quot; and &quot;Ghost Train&quot;.

Grampian also contributed to Channel 4 in the form of various documentary series including &quot;Oil&quot; (co-produced with NRK), &quot;The Blood is Strong&quot;, &quot;Alternative Energy&quot; and &quot;Scotland the Grave&quot;. The long-running schools programme &quot;Living &amp; Growing&quot; transferred from ITV to Channel 4 in September 1987.

Grampian&#x27;s later networked contributions were minimal, with the few exceptions including co-production of &quot;The National Television Awards&quot; from 1995 to 1997 and a daytime repeat run of local documentary series &quot;Medics of the Glen&quot; in 2004.

===SMG buyout===
Grampian remained independent until June 1997 when Scottish Media Group, owner of Scottish Television, bought the station for £105 million.

The buyout led to various cutbacks in Grampian&#x27;s staffing and programme production - notable changes included the transfer of on-air presentation from Aberdeen to Scottish Television&#x27;s playout centre in Glasgow. More Grampian-produced programmes were also broadcast on Scottish, and vice versa.

The station was also criticized by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) concerning the amount and relevance of its non-news regional output with more and more programming being produced from outside the region, chiefly in Glasgow - local production was gradually phased out with the station&#x27;s final non-news programme broadcast in 2008.

In June 2003, the company moved to new premises at Craigshaw Business Park in West Tullos, Aberdeen, and the original headquarters at Queen&#x27;s Cross were subsequently demolished, becoming home to a development of luxury flats.

===From Grampian to STV North===
In March 2006, the owners of Grampian Television, then known as SMG plc (now &quot;STV Group plc&quot;) announced that the Grampian TV brand would be retired and renamed, along with Scottish Television, as simply &#x27;STV&#x27;, with a new logo comprising a large, stylized letter &#x27;S&#x27;. Anne Scott made the final announcement for Grampian.

The two regional news programmes in the Northern and Central Scotland regions (previously known as &quot;North Tonight&quot; and &quot;Scotland Today&quot; respectively) were still broadcast in their respective regions after the &quot;STV&quot; rebranding, which occurred at 9:25 am on Tuesday 30 May 2006. Both &quot;North Tonight&quot; and &quot;Scotland Today&quot; were rebranded as &quot;STV News at Six&quot; on Monday, 23 March 2009 but continue to air as separate programmes.

The decision to rebrand Grampian was met with much criticism from across the former Grampian region - the move was viewed by many as similar to the ITV plc-owned licenses in England, Wales and Southern Scotland where all of the regions are branded as ITV1. The objections are largely due to the fact that the largely rural Scottish culture in the North is very different from the more industrial Central Scotland area.

The news service and advertising remains regionalized as before with the Tayside and North East Fife area receiving its own opt-out service, featuring a dedicated news bulletin within &quot;STV News at Six&quot; on weekdays and separate local advertising. Up until September 2011, both areas also received their own version of the overnight strand, &quot;The Nightshift&quot;.

==Studios==
===Aberdeen===
Grampian&#x27;s first studios and headquarters were located at Queens Cross, Aberdeen, where the company purchased a former tram depot belonging to Aberdeen Corporation Tramways in 1960. The depot was converted for use as television studios with completion planned prior to October 1961. The complex housed two main studios and a third smaller studio for continuity, which was updated in the early 1980s when £4 million worth (2009: £10.5m) was spent on a new Central Technical Area and presentation facilities.

These studios continued to be of importance to Grampian well into the new millennium, despite the transfer of the presentation and continuity to Scottish&#x27;s Glasgow base and job losses when SMG took over the company. In June 2003, Grampian moved to new, smaller, state-of-the-art all digital studios at Craigshaw Business Park in West Tullos, Aberdeen, some of the most advanced in the world at the time of opening. Their previous headquarters at Queens Cross were subsequently demolished in 2004 and redeveloped as housing.

===Dundee and Inverness===
In addition to their Aberdeen headquarters, Grampian ran a newsroom and sales office in Dundee at the entrance of the Angus Hotel in Marketgait, which also contained a film studio for interviews.

In 1978, the Dundee operation moved to a new remote-controlled studio at Albany House, before moving again to Harbor Chambers in the City Quay area in 1998.

As of April 2008, STV&#x27;s Tayside operation is based at Seabraes in the Greenmarket area of Dundee.

In 1983, a further district newsroom and remote-controlled studio was opened at Huntly Street, Inverness, aimed at improving coverage of the Highlands and Islands. The Inverness operation relocated to Stoneyfield Business Park during the summer of 2020.

===Other studios===
Grampian also had a studio in Edinburgh, despite it being in Scottish&#x27;s franchise area, which had closed by 1969, and a new £4 million studio complex in Stornoway, opened in the September 1990 to facilitate an expansion in Scottish Gaelic language output, including the daily news bulletin &quot;Telefios&quot;. The studios were closed in 2000 following the end of the Gaelic news service and the transfer of other programmes to Glasgow.

==Presentation==
Grampian&#x27;s company logo and on screen identity made use of The Saltire, the Flag of Scotland, in all incarnations of the company&#x27;s independent life. Grampian&#x27;s first on screen identification film, or ident for short, featured a black, white and grey image of four mountain peaks, which turn into the saltire, with the grey peak at the bottom, against the tune &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot;. This was replaced in 1964 by another ident, showing the saltire zooming into the centre of the screen, with the Grampian name appearing letter-by-letter towards the bottom of the screen; a music box-style rendition of &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; played underneath. This ident lasted until 1971, when colour came to the region at the same time as the 10th anniversary of the station. The colour ident started with the four sections of the saltire (now coloured red, yellow, blue and white) merging to form a white diamond, from which the saltire emerges upon a light blue background; the Grampian name and the word &quot;COLOUR&quot; rotate into place beneath the saltire (noticeably done with some sort of mechanical model, as opposed to being part of the animation). This was accompanied by a harp version of the &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; jingle.

In the early 1980s a new black background ident was introduced (placing a greater emphasis on the text, now including the word &quot;TELEVISION&quot;, with a smaller saltire), along with a newer version of the &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; jingle.

Grampian&#x27;s first computer generated ident was introduced in January 1985 and featured various diamond and dot shapes flying around in space, changing colour against an electronic tune. As the ident progresses, the dots move closer, and the diamonds bend so that it becomes a three-dimensional saltire shape as the &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; music begins to be more noticeable. The saltire logo then forms up as the box folds inside out and the dot shapes pull away.

However, this colorful and dynamic ident was only to last four years, as Grampian adopted the first ITV generic look from September 1989 until October 1998 - the longest usage of the generic ident by any ITV company. As the majority of junctions featured in-vision announcements into programmes, the ident was rarely seen for most of the day. When the new ITV logo was about to be launched and after SMG had bought the channel, the ident was replaced by a saltire on blue background, tilted slightly, with the sections of the saltire bursting into place, accompanied by an edited version of the ITV generic music from 1989.

In-vision continuity was relied upon heavily by Grampian - from the early 1980s onwards, the station&#x27;s duty announcers also presented short regional news bulletins, including the &quot;North Headlines&quot; at closedown, and the daily &quot;Birthday Spot&quot; for children. In-vision announcements were finally abandoned in the summer of 1998, before the closure of Grampian&#x27;s Aberdeen presentation department that September.

During 1999, Grampian, like Scottish Television refused to use the second generic ITV identity. The company decided instead to use a new branding package, based on a blue square with the words &#x27;Grampian TV&#x27; in the bottom of the square. Launched on 28 February 2000, it featured various scenes of Scottish people and places up and down the country. Various scenes featured a lady horserider along a beach, a young lady and dog returning home, elderly tweed workers in the highlands, waves crashing below Dunottar Castle, a tea dance, an oil rig in the North Sea, the Grampian mountains, chefs in a restaurant kitchen and a waitress in a pub. The look is notable for its cool colour palette and ambient music.
On 6 January 2003, the idents were replaced by the celebrity idents, mostly used by the Granada and Carlton regions, and adapted for use by Grampian. The ITV1 logo was replaced with Grampian&#x27;s logo, and additional idents made depicting Scottish and Grampian celebrities. However, this was not to last, as in 2006, the Grampian name was to be lost on screen in favour of STV. The idents featured Scottish people passing around the logo, an elongated &#x27;S&#x27;, to other people in other scenes off screen until the &#x27;S&#x27; is placed in the centre of the screen. The upbeat music and dynamic filming gives the idents an energetic quality to the station. These idents were shared with Scottish, as were all idents following the package as the two networks have ceased as separate entities.

The current ident set came into force in February 2009 and was an extension to the theme. A scene, similar to the last look, flips over to reveal another scene. This continues, with increasing pace and a wider perspective, until the STV logo flips into view against a blue background.

<doc id="370948" wikidata="Q1624092" url="?curid=370948" title="Paper embossing">
<text>Embossing and debossing are the processes of creating either raised or recessed relief images and designs in paper and other materials. An embossed pattern is raised against the background, while a debossed pattern is sunken into the surface of the material but might protrude somewhat on the reverse side.

==Techniques==
Often used in combination with foil stamping, embossing alters the surface of paper stock or other substrates by providing a three-dimensional or raised effect on selected areas. The procedure requires the use of two dies: one that is raised and one that is recessed. The dies fit into each other so that when the paper is pressed between them, the raised die forces the stock into the recessed die and creates the embossed impression. A specific level of pressure is applied to the dies in order to squeeze the fibers of the paper, which results in a permanently raised area in the paper. When the dies are produced, a die maker engraves the desired image into several metal plates, which are the embossing dies for use on an embossing press. A thorough understanding of the process will enable a more successful result. Generally, embossing is the process most often employed to attract attention or convey a high quality textural contrast in relation to the surrounding area of the paper stock.

&quot;Debossing&quot; is similar to embossing, but recesses the design rather than raising it. Rather than the paper being raised in specific areas, it is indented. The process involves applying pressure to the front side of a substrate and forcing the material down from the surface. Although it is not as common as embossing, it is occasionally used to provide a different effect or appearance that fits a particular theme. Embossing and debossing on digitally printed applications is an off-line process, which may add a significant cost to the job.

Embossing is basically used to create a distinctive effect. The greatest concern and emphasis on the client&#x27;s behalf should be placed on the outcome of the embossed effect. In order to achieve the best possible effect, it is important to understand the embossing process and the types of dies that are used for embossing. The three factors that need to be controlled during the embossing process are:

# Pressure: the intensity of the impact on the weight of the stock being embossed.
# Heat: the ability to maintain a consistent heat level for the best impression.
# Die depth: the client&#x27;s artwork or the engraver&#x27;s efforts will initially determine the die depth, however, if by looking at the artwork it appears that an adjustment of the die depth may be necessary, the die may need to be retooled to achieve a greater depth. Most types of paper can be embossed, and size is not normally a consideration. Embossing without ink, so that the image is raised but not colored, is called &quot;blind embossing&quot;. Embossing used in conjunction with ink, so that the raised area is coloured, is called &quot;colour register embossing&quot;. Embossing used in conjunction with foil stamping is called &quot;combination stamping&quot; or &quot;combo stamping&quot;.

Embossing involves a separate stage in the production process, after any varnishing and laminating. It requires a separate press run, and is priced accordingly. In addition to being used as a design element, embossing can be used to improve the performance of paper products like napkins, diapers, and tissue paper.

==Die materials==
The metals most often used for die construction are zinc, magnesium, copper, and brass. The material used for a specific application depends upon a number of factors.

==Embossing types==

===Blind emboss===

Blind embossing does not include the use of ink or foil to highlight the embossed area. The change in the dimensional appearance of the material is the only noticeable difference resulting from the embossing. The blind embossing process provides a clean and distinctive or subtle image on paper stock. It is best used to create a subtle impression or low level of attention to the piece, yet provide some slight form of differentiation for the finished work.

===Registered emboss===
Registered embossing is a process that places the embossed image in alignment with another element created with ink, foil, punching, or with a second embossed image.

===Combination emboss===
Combination embossing is the process of embossing and foil stamping the same image. It involves imprinting and aligning foil over an embossed image to create a foil emboss. A sculptured die, generally made of brass is used for this procedure. The process requires close registration that must be controlled to keep the image and foil matched precisely. The process of embossing and foil stamping is accomplished in one operation with the use of a combination die. The combination die has a cutting edge around the perimeter to cleanly break the excess foil away from the embossed area.

===Pastelling===
Pastelling is also referred to as tint leaf embossing. It involves the process of using a combination die to provide a subtle antique appearance to a substrate that is embossed and foil stamped. Pearl finishes, clear gloss, or similar pastel foil finishes can be selected that provide a soft two-color antique look (without scorching) to the embossed image. Lighter colored stocks work best to provide this soft contrasting effect.

===Glazing===
Glazing refers to an embossed area that has a shiny or polished appearance. Most often this process is accomplished with heat that is applied with pressure in order to create a shiny impression on the stock. Dark colored heavy weight stocks generally work best with glazing because the polished effect is much more noticeable and the dark color of the stock helps to eliminate or soften any burned appearance that may result from the application of the heat. When used in conjunction with foil, the process can provide the foil with a slightly brighter appearance.

===Scorching===
Scorching is similar to glazing except that it is not used to polish the stock. Instead, scorching does what it implies: as the temperature of the die heating plate is increased beyond a normal temperature range, a scorched effect is created in the embossed image, which results in an antique or shaded appearance. It is best to use a lighter colored stock for this procedure in order to provide a unique two-toned appearance. Caution should be used in requesting this effect, since it is easy to burn the stock if too much heat is used. If scorching occurs too close to the printed copy, it can interfere with the clarity of the printed copy; however, this may be the effect that is desired for a particular application.

== Document authentication ==
A notary public may use an embossed seal to mark legal papers, either in the form of an adhesive seal, or using a clamp-like embossing device, to certify a signature on a document, contract, etc., or cause to become certified through a notary public or bill. Registered professional engineers also use embossing seals to certify drawings, thereby guaranteeing to the recipient that due diligence has been exercised in the design. Government agencies use embossed seals to certify that an important document, such as a birth certificate, court order, etc., is an authentic, original copy, rather than a photocopy that could be altered in the copying process.

==On stamps==

Embossing has been used regularly on postage and other types of stamps. The embossed paper of a letter sheet or stamped envelope is called an indicium. Notable early examples include some of the earliest stamps of Italy, Natal, and Switzerland, as well as the early high values of Great Britain (1847–54). Modern stamps still sometimes use embossing as a design element.

<text>ITV Border, previously Border Television and commonly referred to as simply Border, is the Channel 3 service provided by ITV Broadcasting Limited for the England/Scotland border region, covering most of Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway, the Scottish Borders and parts of Northumberland. The TV service previously covered the Isle of Man from 26 March 1965 until 15 July 2009.

Border Television was taken over by Granada plc in 2001 and a year later, as part of a network-wide re-launch, the name Border Television was dropped from on-air presentation, continuity and idents before networked programming in favour of the national ITV1 brand (ITV1 Border was used before regional programming). The licence for the region was transferred from Border Television to ITV Broadcasting Limited in November 2008. The legal name of the company was changed on 29 December 2006 from Border Television Ltd to ITV Border Ltd. The company was dissolved on 7 February 2023.

As of 25 February 2009, the regional news programme &quot;Lookaround&quot; was broadcast from the studios of ITV Tyne Tees in Gateshead with news and advertising staff based at offices in Carlisle and Edinburgh. However, on 16 September 2013, a full regional news service for the Border region was restored as part of an extensive relaunch of the station&#x27;s local programming. A sub-regional service for the south of Scotland was reintroduced in January 2014. (The third channel in the rest of Scotland is STV.)

==History==
===Launch===
In May 1960, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) invited applicants to provide the ITV service for the &quot;Borders&quot; region – an area that covered the English counties of Westmorland and Cumberland, the south of Scotland and later, the Isle of Man.

Prior to this, the ITA had moved away from the idea of &quot;satellite stations&quot; (companies owned by distant management as seen with Southern Television in the south of England) towards companies that had strong local ownership. The contract covered two new transmitters at Caldbeck, near Carlisle and Selkirk, near Saint Boswells in the Scottish Borders. Granada Television and ABC Weekend Television had laid a claim to providing service via Caldbeck whilst Scottish Television expressed a strong interest in Selkirk. The ITA rejected both these in favour of a new contract area and a new company to serve it – although they stipulated the area to be &quot;marginal&quot; in their plans and that applicants had to present a very strong business case for the area as well as the contract.

Two applications were received, one from Solway Television and another from Border Television. Border were chosen on the basis of their plans and management which was considered local but still featured names from large business (the then chairman of Reuters for example) and from the world of education.

Launch was scheduled for February 1961 but construction problems with both transmitters resulted in delays until May of that year. As this led into the summer holiday period, Border asked for a launch delay as the break would affect advertising revenue. Accordingly, Border launched on Friday 1 September 1961, the 14th ITV station to go to air.

During its first year of operation, Border made a profit unlike other regional companies in their initial year, and by its second year, it had covered its launch costs, due mainly to a 60% audience penetration in an area that, at the time, was largely ignored by the BBC. From Friday 26 March 1965, the Isle of Man was added to Border&#x27;s coverage area.

===1970s and 1980s===
Initially, Border produced little for the network and concentrated on local programming, most notably its flagship local news programme &quot;Lookaround&quot;. Later, when ITV and the BBC were given permission to extend broadcasting hours to daytime, Border carved a niche for providing the ITV network with afternoon quizzes and light entertainment. Derek Batey, Border TV&#x27;s Assistant Controller of Programmes, became the frontman for one of ITV&#x27;s most popular daytime quiz shows of the 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot;. (A separate version of &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot; was also produced by HTV at the same time.) Batey also presented and produced the long-running chat show &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;. Meanwhile, a 15-minute music show, &quot;The Sound of ...&quot;, was seen across several ITV regions and featured The Spinners, British folk music band The Settlers and other similar artists.

Financial and industrial problems began to hit the company during the 1970s – a fall in net profits to just £13,587, led to job losses and a cut in programme production in September 1975. In November 1978, a dispute with the ACTT (Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians) led to 40 staff at the Durranhill studios being locked out for three weeks by management – several members of staff resorted to a sit in until the strike ended in stalemate and compromise.

By 1980, Border was again in severe financial trouble owing to a national economic downturn which affected advertising revenue on the whole ITV network, with the station losing £70,000 before tax in October 1981. The situation was deemed so serious that at one point the company considered not re-applying for its licence when it expired in December 1981 – though it would prove successful, as it did in July 1967 and October 1991. From January 1982, Border began broadcasting to south Cumbria from the Kendal transmitter which previously carried Granada. Border had lobbied the IBA for over a decade to serve the southern Lake District – a move backed by Cumbria County Council – while on the Isle of Man, officials voiced a preference to switch signals to Granada, citing inclusion in regional news coverage would benefit the tourism industry, with direct ferry links from Liverpool and Heysham.

More industrial problems were to follow in November 1982 when Border closed for a month in a dispute over new technology, which ended only after letters asking for an improvement in industrial relations were withdrawn. The dispute led to several members of management resigning – with Jim Graham moving from the BBC to become managing director and Paul Corley joining as director of programming. Graham and Corley began to transform Border by targeting a greater presence on the ITV network, despite the company&#x27;s weak financial position. Graham hired Melvyn Bragg to present new programming. The launch of Channel 4 in 1982 also bolstered Border&#x27;s network portfolio – providing extra finance for many of the new programmes being produced from the Carlisle studios (themselves being expanded) and commissioning to make a number of programmes, most notably &quot;Land of the Lakes&quot; (presented by Melvyn Bragg), a music show entitled &quot;Bliss&quot; (hosted by Muriel Gray) and Border&#x27;s very first sitcom, &quot;The Groovy Fellers&quot; with Jools Holland and Rowland Rivron.

Border also expanded into children&#x27;s programming during the 1980s with &quot;The Joke Machine&quot;, &quot;Crush A Grape&quot;, &quot;Pick A Number&quot;, &quot;Krankies Television, BMX Beat&quot; and contributions to Saturday morning series &quot;Get Fresh&quot; and &quot;Ghost Train&quot; (produced in conjunction with Tyne Tees Television, and others). Melvyn Bragg went on to become deputy chairman of Border Television in 1985 and its chairman in 1990. In 1996, he left the post but remained on the board.

===Opt-out services===
In 1989, Border began providing a sub-regional service for Scottish Borders viewers served by the Selkirk transmitter, consisting of a short opt-out during &quot;Lookaround&quot; each weeknight. In April 1999, the opt-out was extended to cover Dumfries and Galloway and a dedicated Scottish news bulletin was introduced on weekday lunchtimes.

The following August, Border began to use the opt-out service to provide split coverage of sports and occasional political programming. The station also opened an Edinburgh bureau to provide coverage of the Scottish Parliament.

===Acquisition and takeover===
Border was unopposed in retaining its ITV franchise in 1991, with a bid of £52,000 per year (or £1,000 per week).

In 1993, Border began its first venture into commercial radio when it was awarded the licence for a new regional radio station serving Central Scotland – Scot FM – in partnership with Grampian Television. By May 1995, Grampian had bought out Border&#x27;s stake in the company.

Border&#x27;s second venture was Century Radio, conceived as the second regional station for North East England, on 1 September 1994, with John Myers (a former continuity announcer) as managing director and John Simons as programming director. During the rest of the 1990s, Border launched an additional Century radio station in Manchester while holding interests in a number of other stations including Sun FM in Sunderland and Cumbria&#x27;s CFM Radio, and in 1997 formed a subsidiary, Border Radio Holdings, for its radio business.

In March 2000, a takeover battle broke out between Capital Radio and Scottish Radio Holdings for Border – the latter went on to state that Border&#x27;s ongoing status as a truly independent media business was no longer &quot;a realistic option&quot; in a consolidating industry. By April, Capital Radio had purchased the company and the following year sold Border&#x27;s television assets to Granada Media Group for £50.5 million. Rumours over its future persistently dogged Border and it trod a difficult path to balance the interests of three different nations. As with many of the other ITV regional stations, a steady reduction in the range and quantity of its output continued its decline.

In July 2006, it was announced that the Berwick-upon-Tweed transmitter was to transfer to Tyne Tees as part of the preparations for the digital switchover of the Border region in 2008, and to bring Berwick into line with the rest of the North East which was scheduled to switch over to digital in 2012. The transfer took effect from 13 December 2006, although Border news programmes still carry stories about Berwick-upon-Tweed due to its proximity to the eastern Scottish Borders.

===Merger===

In 2008, the United Kingdom began its five-year programme to cease analogue television broadcasts as part of the switchover to Digital television starting with Border.

Towards the end of his tenure as ITV plc executive chairman, Michael Grade began dismantling the ITV regional layout, arguing the existence of ITV Border &quot;no longer makes sense&quot; relative to the regional audience it serves. On 12 September 2007, Grade announced plans to close ITV Border and merge the region with ITV Tyne Tees.

On 25 September 2008, Ofcom gave ITV the go ahead to merge the Border and Tyne Tees operations from early in 2009. Following a survey of Isle of Man viewers in autumn 2008, coverage of the Isle of Man was transferred from ITV Border to ITV Granada on Thursday 16 July 2009. 

ITV Border&#x27;s own regional news service ceased production on Tuesday 24 February 2009, replaced by a dual-regional service the next day. The sub-regional service for southern Scotland was also closed. The main ITV Border newsroom is now based in the Kingstown area of Carlisle with reporters living and working in Carlisle, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Kendal, Selkirk and Whitehaven.

ITV Border won the RTS awards for &quot;Best News Programme: Nations and Regions&quot; for &quot;Lookaround&quot;, whilst ITV Tyne Tees &amp; Border was nominated in three categories in February 2011.

====Restoring a full regional service====
On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce a full service of news and regional programmes for the ITV Border region were approved by OFCOM. In September 2013, &quot;Lookaround&quot; was restored as a full half-hour programme on weekdays with shorter daytime and weekend bulletins reintroduced during the month. The programme continues to be broadcast from Gateshead with extra journalists recruited for newsgathering in the Border region, including a Scottish political editor in Edinburgh, a sports correspondent and district reporters.

ITV Border was also required to reopen its former opt-out service for southern Scotland, previously used to broadcast split news bulletins and select STV programming. A minimum of 90 minutes a week of bespoke local programming is broadcast on ITV Border Scotland while viewers in Cumbria continue to receive network output. The opt-out service was launched on Monday 6 January 2014 and initially broadcast over Freeview only, with programmes also available on the ITV Border website. From mid-March 2015, the split Border Scotland service became available to satellite viewers, replacing Border (England) in the relevant area.

==Studios==

Unlike some of the new ITV stations at the time, Border constructed a purpose-built studio centre, located in Brunel Way, Carlisle. The complex contained two production studios, a small continuity studio and a film interview studio. These were converted to colour with the station and were expanded and upgraded when demand increased following the launch of Channel 4.

Following the merger of ITV Border&#x27;s service with that of ITV Tyne Tees, the Border studios were closed and demolished in 2010. A new office was opened in the Kingstown area of Carlisle with a newsroom and sales offices. In 2015 a newsroom and edit suites were opened in Selkirk, where some of the southern Scotland opt-out programmes are produced. Both sites have fibre video and data links to ITV Tyne Tees in Gateshead.

ITV Border also maintains a bureau for Scottish Parliament coverage in Edinburgh with district news reporters and camera crews based locally in Dumfries, Galloway, Kendal and Whitehaven. The Edinburgh and Selkirk offices produces the southern Scotland political programme, &quot;Representing Border&quot;.

==Identity==

Throughout its history until its rebranding as &quot;ITV Border&quot;, Border Television used the same logo, an abstract symbol known affectionately by locals as &quot;the chopsticks&quot;. It features a thick shape with a forker line crossing it and running either side of the shape, which divides the area into three parts, representing Scotland above the line, England below it, and the Solway Firth in the small area to the left.

The launch identity was a black caption with the white logo and &quot;Border Television&quot; beneath, over an announcement. The start-up routine was symbolic because of its distinctive and unchanging music and the announcement stating: &quot;This is Border Television, coming to you from the Caldbeck, Selkirk and Richmond Hill transmitters of the Independent Television Authority.&quot; and then, &quot;This is Border Television broadcasting to Cumbria, South Scotland, the Isle of Man and North and West Northumberland, from the Caldbeck, Selkirk and associated transmitters of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.&quot; This was replaced when colour came to the region by the same contents, contained within a rectangle on a blue background with a &quot;Colour&quot; caption outside the box. The colour caption was removed in the 1980s and the announcement said: &quot;This is Border Television providing a full colour service to Cumbria, South Scotland, the Isle of Man and North and West Northumberland including Berwick-upon-Tweed, from the Caldbeck, Selkirk and associated transmitters of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.&quot;
Border finally adopted an animated ident on 1 September 1989 when they adopted the ITV Generic look. Their version was mildly well suited, as the contents of the traditional Border logo were recognisable in the &quot;V&quot; segment of the logo. This look was extensively used, even in the news department. Border also began to use in-vision continuity more heavily.

On 5 September 1994, the logo was updated into a 3D version, this ident features a 3D Border logo falling into place against an icy-cold cyan backdrop, which was set to the same as 1989 ITV Generic theme, and it remained for nearly 12 months until 31 August 1995. Border also to use the same in-vision continuity again.

On 1 September 1995, the logo was changed again with two different idents, a same 3D Border logo falling into place against a water-effect blue backdrop, which was set to the same tune as used previously but later played on instruments to match the water theme. In another one, with the same sequence against a backdrop of spinning discs and blue and purple colours. New music was also composed featuring deep basses. The whole effect was to make Border have an authoritative and broadcaster tone. This package remained for four years until 7 November 1999.

On 8 November 1999, Border adopted the second generic look along with the rest of the regions, but did not use their logo in this look. From then on, Border only used network designs for idents; as from 28 October 2002, Border idents featuring a celebrity with the ITV1 logo with the word Border underneath were used for local programming only. All other programming used network idents and from 1 November 2004 no regional idents existed. Local productions are now attributed on-screen to &#x27;ITV News and Current Affairs Border&#x27; and ITV Border.

<doc id="370970" wikidata="Q1150936" url="?curid=370970" title="Turner Field">
<text>Turner Field was a baseball stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1997 to 2016, it served as the home ballpark to the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). Originally built as Centennial Olympic Stadium in 1996 to serve as the centerpiece of the 1996 Summer Olympics, it was converted into a baseball stadium to serve as the new home of the team. The Braves moved less than one block from Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, which served as their home field for 31 seasons from 1966 to 1996.

Opening during the Braves&#x27; &quot;division dominance&quot; years, Turner Field hosted the NLDS a total of 11 times (1997–2005, 2010, 2013), the NLCS four times (1997–1999, 2001), one World Series (1999), one NL Wild Card Game (2012, the first in baseball history), and the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The Braves played the final game at Turner Field on October 2, 2016, a 1–0 win over the Detroit Tigers. The franchise allowed its lease on the facility to expire at the end of the calendar year. In 2017, the team moved to the newly constructed SunTrust Park (now called Truist Park), located in nearby Cobb County.

The stadium has been reconfigured for the second time, redesigned for college football in 2017 as Center Parc Stadium for Georgia State University. Architecture firm Heery was responsible for both stadium conversions. The stadium is also the second former Braves ballpark to be converted to a college football stadium, the first being Braves Field when it was renovated into Nickerson Field in 1955.

==History==
The ballpark was built in the Southeastern Atlanta neighborhood of Summerhill. across the street from the former home of the Braves, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, which was demolished in the summer of 1997 and replaced with a parking lot. The parking lot is painted with the field location and configuration of the old ballpark. The section of the outfield wall with the monument marking where Hank Aaron&#x27;s 715th home run went over it was reinstalled in its original location, and still stands today. From 2002 to 2004, the failed Fanplex entertainment center was located adjacent to the stadium&#x27;s parking lot. The stadium contained 5,372 club seats, 64 luxury suites, and three party suites.

The most popular name choice among Atlanta residents for the new stadium at the time of its construction (according to a poll in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;) was Hank Aaron Stadium. After the ballpark was instead named after Ted Turner (and subsequently nicknamed &quot;The Ted&quot; by fans), the city of Atlanta renamed the section of Capitol Avenue on which the stadium sits Hank Aaron Drive, giving Turner Field the street number 755, after Aaron&#x27;s home run total.

===1996 Summer Olympics===

The stadium was originally constructed as the 85,000-seat Centennial Olympic Stadium and used for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Immediately after the 1996 Summer Paralympics, which followed the Olympics, much of the north end of the stadium was removed in order to convert it to its permanent use as a 49,000-seat baseball park. The stadium hosted the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball from 1997 to 2016, following a multimillion-dollar renovation to retrofit the stadium for baseball by removing the temporary stands that had made up nearly half the stadium and building the outfield stands and other attractions behind them.

After the 1996 Olympics were complete the stadium was leased by the Atlanta Braves. Private entities, including NBC and other Olympic sponsors, agreed to pay a large sum of the cost to build Centennial Olympic Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium in a way that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion. This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves. The 71,228 seat Georgia Dome had been completed four years earlier by the state of Georgia, so there was no need for another large stadium in downtown Atlanta. Furthermore, the Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new stadium. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owns Turner Field and leased it to the Braves, who operated the stadium. The end of the Braves&#x27; most recent lease in 2016 coincided with the team&#x27;s departure for SunTrust Park (now Truist Park).

Because of the need to fit a track within the stadium in its earlier configuration, the field of play, particularly foul territory, while not large by historical standards, was still larger than most MLB stadiums of its era. The fence line around the north main entrance, beyond left field, marks the original extent of Centennial Olympic Stadium.

===Replacement===
Turner Field was a relatively new facility, being younger than 14 of Major League Baseball&#x27;s other 29 stadiums at the time of the Braves&#x27; last game there. However, the Braves executives complained that its downtown location restricted game attendance because of traffic into the city and a shortage of on-site parking. The stadium was from the nearest Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) stop, and many fans were unwilling to brave Atlanta&#x27;s infamous congestion to attend games; plus, the team could not secure more parking spaces. In addition, team VP for business operations Mike Plant said the site &quot;doesn&#x27;t match up with where the majority of our fans come from&quot;, as the stadium is near some of Atlanta&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods. Plant also said that while the Braves operated Turner Field, they had no control over the commercial development around the stadium. Other stadiums built in recent years have been accompanied by shopping and entertainment facilities in the surrounding area (as Truist Park later would be).

According to Braves team president John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $150 million in renovation costs merely for structural upkeep, including replacing seats, lighting, and plumbing, to remain operating for the future. He estimated that fan improvement renovations would have cost an additional $200 million. The Braves were in talks in 2013 with the Recreational Authority over extending the team&#x27;s original lease, Plant said, but those talks broke down. Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed said the city could not afford to support the kind of renovations the Braves desired.

After negotiations broke down, the team began planning a new stadium, SunTrust Park. The stadium would be built in southern Cobb County, with an Atlanta address, located &quot;near the geographic center of the Braves&#x27; fan base.&quot; The new stadium was constructed in a public/private partnership. The projected cost was $672 million. It occupies of a lot, with the remainder of the space devoted to parking, green space, and mixed-use development. The new stadium is part of a 60-acre development called The Battery Atlanta. Although Cobb County is not presently served by MARTA, the Braves use a &quot;circulator&quot; bus system to shuttle fans to and from the stadium. Construction on SunTrust Park broke ground on September 16, 2014. Had SunTrust Park been behind schedule, the Braves had the option (but ultimately declined) to extend their lease at Turner Field up to 5 years. Braves executive vice president Mike Plant has stated that capital maintenance would be much less at SunTrust Park. While Turner Field was designed from the ground up with the Braves in mind, Plant said that it required higher capital maintenance costs in the long run because it was value engineered for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Plant estimates that capital maintenance costs at SunTrust Park will be no more than $80 million after 30 years – less than half of the $150 million in capital maintenance needed for Turner Field after 17 years.

====Center Parc Stadium====

In April and May 2014, Georgia State University officials expressed an interest in acquiring Turner Field and converting it into a 30,000-seat open-air stadium for the Panthers football program. New development, including retail, residential and student housing, would also be put into use on the Turner Field site. Additionally, a new baseball field would be built on the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site, incorporating the outfield wall where Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. While Mayor Reed showed preference towards Georgia State&#x27;s plan, at least three offers from other developers were up for consideration. On August 13, 2015, the Braves officially gave notice to the city of Atlanta and Fulton County that the team would not exercise the option to extend their lease at Turner Field and would vacate the stadium by December 31, 2016, allowing the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority to move forward with any redevelopment plans. On November 23, 2015, Georgia State submitted an alternative proposal for redeveloping Turner Field, where portions of the current ballpark would be rebuilt into a mixed retail and housing development and a new football-specific stadium would be constructed north of Turner Field along with the new baseball field. While vetting bids for redevelopment, two casino firms showed interest in the Turner Field property; however, they did not submit bids due to Mayor Reed&#x27;s and the community&#x27;s opposition to casino gaming. On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that they have accepted the joint bid by Georgia State University and real estate firm Carter for the stadium property. Georgia State was considered the front-runner for the property as the other two bids submitted were from little known entities with no documented redevelopment experience. Residents of the Summerhill neighborhood expressed their criticism for Turner Field&#x27;s quick sale without their input; however, city and county officials stated that a quick sale was necessary to keep the burden of the stadium&#x27;s security and upkeep from falling on the tax payers&#x27; shoulders once the Braves move out. On August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for Turner Field, and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on November 9, 2016. On January 5, 2017, the sale of the Turner Field property to Georgia State was officially closed, with the stadium conversion project beginning in February 2017. The stadium conversion would occur over multiple phases, while the first phase was completed in time for Georgia State&#x27;s opener on August 31, 2017.

===Final game===

The Braves&#x27; final game at Turner Field was October 2, 2016, an interleague game against the Detroit Tigers, which the Braves won 1–0; the last run was scored by Adonis Garcia off a sacrifice fly ball from Freddie Freeman, and Julio Teherán had a career-high 12 strikeouts to earn the final win at the field.

Prior to the game, the Braves unveiled their All-Turner Field Team, as chosen on the team&#x27;s website by fans: catcher Javy López, first baseman Freddie Freeman, second baseman Marcus Giles, shortstop Rafael Furcal, third baseman Chipper Jones, left fielder Ryan Klesko, center fielder Andruw Jones, right fielder Brian Jordan, utility player Martin Prado, pitchers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Tim Hudson, and Julio Teheran, and relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel.

In a post-game ceremony, home plate was removed and delivered to SunTrust Park by Hank Aaron and Braves chairman Terry McGuirk, as those remaining at Turner Field watched its progress on the video board. While home plate was being driven up Interstate 75, the ceremony included a parade of fans representing each state in the Braves&#x27; television footprint and speeches from Braves dignitaries, followed by a simultaneous performance of the Braves&#x27; signature &quot;Tomahawk Chop&quot; rally cry by the crowd still at Turner Field and the small gathering of team executives and Little Leaguers at SunTrust Park.

===Comparison with Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium===
===Stadium firsts===
The first game played at Turner Field was an exhibition game against the New York Yankees on March 29, 1997; Braves starter Tom Glavine threw the first pitch, a swinging fastball strike, to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and the Braves won the exhibition game 2–0. The first regular season game played at Turner Field was on April 4, 1997, against the Chicago Cubs, with Denny Neagle making the start for the Braves. The Braves were losing 4–3 in the eighth inning when Chipper Jones drove in the tying run. A Michael Tucker single gave the Braves the lead as they won their first regular season game at Turner Field 5–4.

The first postseason game played at Turner Field was also during the 1997 season between the Braves and the Houston Astros in the NLDS. Starting pitcher Greg Maddux pitched a complete game, giving up only one run and leading the Braves to a 2–1 victory. Following a sweep of the Astros, the Braves went on to the NLCS, where Tom Glavine picked up the first NLCS win at Turner Field; however, the Braves lost to the eventual-World Series-champion Florida Marlins.

The first World Series game ever played at Turner Field was Game 1 of the 1999 World Series, where the starting pitcher Maddux and the Braves were defeated 4–1 by the New York Yankees&#x27; Orlando Hernández and series MVP Mariano Rivera; the Braves went on to lose the series by a four-game sweep. The only Major League Baseball All-Star Game ever to be played at Turner Field was in 2000. Atlanta&#x27;s Chipper Jones hit the lone home run in the game, and Braves outfielder Andruw Jones drove in a run as the National League was defeated 6–3.

Turner Field was also home to the first NL Wild Card Game in 2012 between the Braves and St. Louis Cardinals. The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the 8th inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to shallow left field that dropped in between Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma and left fielder Matt Holliday. Umpire Sam Holbrook called Simmons out, citing the infield fly rule. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.

===Renovations===

Significant renovations to the stadium were put into place for the 2005 season. Among the improvements was installation of a $10 million video display, which was at the time listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest HD video board. The video board was kept by Georgia State as part of the football stadium.

Other renovations in that year included the addition of a long LED display to the stadium&#x27;s upper deck, primarily for advertising purposes.

Turner Field&#x27;s left field vista was dominated by advertising fixtures from two iconic Atlanta corporations. In 2009, a new large Coca-Cola bottle was installed behind left field. Replacing an earlier version made of various pieces of baseball equipment, the new bottle featured a HD display around the label, as well as LED lighting. Next to this second iteration of Turner Field&#x27;s Coca-Cola bottle was a Chick-fil-A cow, added in 2008. Wearing a Braves hat, the cow did the Tomahawk Chop along with fans while holding a sign with rotating slogans which tie in to the fast-food chain&#x27;s successful &quot;Eat Mor Chikin&quot; advertising campaign. The cow was removed from Turner Field following the 2015 season for refurbishment before being installed at Truist Park.

===Major League Baseball stadium records===
The highest recorded attendance for a playoff game, and overall, was 54,357 and was set on October 5, 2003, against the Chicago Cubs. The number includes standing room tickets.

The longest game by time, and in Braves history, was played on July 26–27, 2011 between the Braves and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The game lasted 6 hours and 39 minutes with the Braves winning controversially 4–3 in 19 innings. The Braves&#x27; previous longest game by time was 6:10 against the Mets on July 4, 1985, at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium.
The most runs scored by either team in a single inning was 10, set on October 5, 2001, between the Braves and the Florida Marlins. The record was set in the 1st inning of the game. The Braves won the game 20–3.

==Accidents==

===2008===
On May 21, 2008, during a game against the New York Mets, fan Justin Hayes was attempting to slide down the staircase railing from the club level to the field level; he slipped and fell to his death. Police later confirmed alcohol as a factor in the accident.

===2013===
On August 13, 2013, Ronald Lee Homer Jr., a fan attending the game against the Philadelphia Phillies, fell to his death after leaping over the fourth level wall in the rear of the stadium and landing in the player&#x27;s parking lot. His death was later ruled a suicide.

===2015===
On August 29, 2015, during a game against the New York Yankees, as Alex Rodriguez was being introduced for his first plate appearance of the series, 60-year-old Greg Murrey fell from section 402 in the stadium&#x27;s upper deck into the second and third rows of seats in section 202. He was pronounced dead on scene from his injuries. Murrey was a longtime season ticket holder and &quot;incredibly passionate Braves fan&quot;, the team said.

==Features==

===Premium seating/suites===

Turner Field featured multiple premium seating areas and suites. The &quot;SunTrust Club&quot; was named for the bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta and was reserved for official partners and luxury clients of the ballpark. This $6 million addition was completed in 2008 and its 143 premium seats were just from home plate, closer than seats in any other MLB ballpark of the era (and closer to home plate than the pitcher&#x27;s mound). SunTrust Club members also had access to an exclusive club area located under the Hank Aaron Seats (Section 101) that consists of free food and drinks for club members. The club area featured a waitstaff that catered to club members in their seats during the games. Members could choose to watch the games from their reserved seats, or from inside the club itself on high definition televisions.

The &quot;755 Club&quot; (named in honor of Hank Aaron&#x27;s home run record) was the stadium&#x27;s predominant suite location. The club was a area of space rented for special events and parties; individual suites were rented for individual games or for the entire season. The &quot;Delta Sky 360 Lounge&quot; was added in 2010 and was located behind the 755 Club suites on the second level of the ballpark. The lounge could only be accessed by members of the 755 Club. The lounge consisted of multiple premium eateries not found in the rest of the ballpark. Other Delta Sky 360 Lounges could be found at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field, and one was included in the construction of SunTrust Park. The 755 Club became the &quot;University Club&quot; as part of the Georgia State football stadium.

Turner Field also featured the &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Own Credit Union Club&quot; and &quot;Superior Plumbing Club&quot;, consisting of 152 collective premium seats located directly adjacent to each side of the press box. The original club, sponsored by Georgia&#x27;s Own Credit Union and featuring 80 seats, was added to the ballpark for the 2012 season and also contained multiple upscale dining options and in-seat food and beverage services. Instead of stadium seats, patrons faced the field in chairs around semicircular tables. A slightly smaller second section, sponsored by Superior Plumbing and featuring 72 seats, was added for the 2013 season on the opposite side of the press area. The &quot;Club Level&quot; was another indoor premium concourse level located on the second deck of the ballpark. This level featured multiple VIP suites that could be purchased for individual games and used for party-style affairs, among other events. For Turner Field&#x27;s final few seasons, the Club Level had no title sponsor; in previous years, it was known as the &quot;Lexus Level&quot; and &quot;Golden Moon Casino Level&quot;.

===Other areas and features===

* Coca-Cola Sky Field: Along the Left Field Corner of the Upper Level and sponsored by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, Sky Field was a large standing room area from which fans could view the game. The area contained a base path which kids can run during the games, as well as an unobstructed view of the downtown Atlanta skyline and the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site. Rising above Sky Field was a giant Coca-Cola Bottle. The original bottle was designed and outfitted with baseball equipment; however, a newer &quot;glass&quot; bottle featuring a video screen serving as the bottle&#x27;s label replaced the original during the 2009 season. Many of the pieces of the original bottle would later go on display at the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta.
* Scouts Alley: Along the field level under the left field seating area, Scout&#x27;s Alley was an area featuring interactive baseball-themed games targeted at younger fans. Games included pitching cages and batting cages. Balloon and face-painting artists were also located along Scout&#x27;s Alley. Most attractions required additional payment by tokens, which were purchased at kiosks within Scouts Alley.
*Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame: Located along the northwest side at Aisle 134 and served as the franchise&#x27;s main museum. Admission to the museum and hall of fame could be purchased at the Braves ticket window. It was open year-round, and served as the starting and ending point for stadium tours, which were offered to the public on dates when the stadium was dormant and on mornings preceding night games. While the stadium was in use, the museum was featured as a Scout&#x27;s Alley attraction, and was open to game ticket holders for an additional fee (paid in Scouts Alley tokens).
* Fan Plaza: Fan Plaza (sometimes called Grand Entry Plaza) served as the primary entrance and exit to the park, and was the hub of pregame and postgame activity at Turner Field. The Plaza was located directly behind centerfield and the jumbotron. The area featured the Majestic Clubhouse Store, as well as multiple dining options and drink stands, and the Family Zone (a children&#x27;s interactive area, which replaced Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Tooner Field&quot; in 2012). The radio pre-game and post-game show broadcast location was also located on the Plaza. Prior to select home games, live music was performed in this area.
* Monument Grove: Located outside the gates of the ballpark, but inside the gated perimeter, near the ticket windows, was Monument Grove. Monument Grove featured statues of Braves legends Hank Aaron and Phil Niekro (as well as Georgia native Ty Cobb), the &quot;Full Count&quot; sculpture, a bust of Aaron, as well as the high team baseballs originally used to celebrate the 2000 All Star Game. Every Braves player with a retired number (plus Jackie Robinson) was honored with a large sculpture of the number fashioned after the font used during that player&#x27;s era. The Braves Walk Of Fame was also housed here, as was the exterior entrance to the Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame.
* Braves Chop House: The Braves Chop House was a casual dining restaurant located behind the right-center field seats. Each table in the restaurant is placed to provide a view of the field. On the roof of the Braves Chop House was the Budweiser Pavilion party deck. The Chop House, now sponsored by Coors Light, is an integral part of the SunTrust Park design. The Turner Field Chop House became the &quot;State House Grill&quot; as part of the Georgia State re-use of the stadium. 
* Skyline Tickets: Located on each end of the upper level (along the third base line in section 422L, and above right field in section 437R), the Skyline seats were available for purchase for $1 each, and went on sale at the Turner Field ticket windows 2½ hours before gametime. There was a strict policy of one ticket per person, and entry to the stadium was required immediately after purchase, in an effort to prevent ticket scalping.

==Additional events==

===Concerts===
During its tenure, Turner Field was also used as a concert venue, with capacity of up to 60,000. Among the performers who performed at the stadium are the Dave Matthews Band, Metallica, Eminem, Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones.

===College baseball===
From 2003 to 2016, the NCAA baseball teams of Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia, which had previously played two games on each school&#x27;s campus, replaced one of the home and home pairs in favor of a third game at Turner Field. This rivalry game at Turner Field was one of the most attended games in college baseball, with the 2004 game drawing 28,836—larger than that year&#x27;s College World Series games. Proceeds from this annual match benefit Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta. The annual event moved to SunTrust Park in 2017.

===In film &amp; TV===
The stadium was used as a central location in many films and television series, including &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;The Change-Up&quot;, &quot;Trouble with the Curve&quot; and the 19th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, which took place outside of the stadium.

==Panoramas==

==Retired numbers==
There were 11 retired numbers on display at Turner Field. The numbers were on display at the Monument Grove section of the ballpark, as well as on display inside the actual stadium. From the time of its opening in 1997 until the 2012 season, the retired numbers were commemorated by the number as pictured below hanging from the facade in left field. These were removed for the 2013 season and replaced with a modern representation of the player&#x27;s first name followed by their number and last name (such as Dale 3 Murphy), which were located on the left and right sides of the club level.

Of the 10 Braves whose numbers were retired prior to Turner Field&#x27;s closure, nine (Spahn, Mathews, Aaron, Niekro, Cox, Maddux, Glavine, Smoltz and Jones) were elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, while Murphy&#x27;s eligibility expired without election. Only Glavine, Jones, Maddux, and Smoltz appeared in games at Turner Field. Cox managed the team for 25 seasons in all, including its first 14 seasons in Turner Field.

<doc id="370972" wikidata="Q1122878" url="?curid=370972" title="Prince Albert National Park">
<text>Prince Albert National Park encompasses in central Saskatchewan, Canada and is about north of Saskatoon. Though declared a national park March 24, 1927, official opening ceremonies weren&#x27;t performed by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King until August 10, 1928. This park is open all year but the most visited period is from May to September. Although named for the city of Prince Albert, the park&#x27;s main entrance is actually north of that city via Highways 2 and 263, which enters the park at its southeast corner. Two additional secondary highways enter the park, Highway 264, which branches off Highway 2 just east of the Waskesiu townsite, and Highway 240, which enters the park from the south and links with 263 just outside the entry fee-collection gates. Prince Albert National Park is not located within any rural municipality, and is politically separate from the adjacent Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD). Until the establishment of Grasslands National Park in 1981, it was the province&#x27;s only national park.

The hamlet of Waskesiu Lake is the only community within the park and it is located on the southern shore of Waskesiu Lake. Most facilities and services one would expect to find in a multi-use park are available there, such as shopping, fuel, and lodging.

About 90% of the park is in the Waskesiu Hills and elevations range from on the western side to on the eastern side. There are several large lakes in the park, including Waskesiu, Kingsmere, and Crean, and several notable rivers have their source there, such as Spruce, Sturgeon, and Smoothstone.

The park&#x27;s development as a recreation destination has led to the region immediately south-east of the park boundaries – locations such as Christopher Lake, Emma Lake, Sunnyside Beach, and Anglin Lake, themselves becoming popular recreation destinations. Additional development has taken place just beyond the park&#x27;s eastern entry.

== Biology ==

Prince Albert National Park represents the southern boreal forest region of Canada. It is a rolling, mostly forested landscape that takes in the drainage divide between the North Saskatchewan and Churchill Rivers. The boreal forest extends northerly into the Canadian Shield area from the agricultural zones of southern Canada. Prince Albert National Park lies south of the Shield in landscapes that were shaped by Pleistocene glaciers that deposited glacial till, sand and other materials that were later colonized by trees and shrubs.

Most of the park is dominated by coniferous forests, with the cover of jack pine and white spruce becoming more prevalent the farther north one goes. The very southern part of the park is predominantly aspen forest with an understorey of elderberry, honeysuckle, rose, and other shrubs and openings and meadows of fescue grassland. The fescue grasslands are considered ecologically important because of their rarity; outside the park, most of the native fescue grasslands have been lost to the plough or to urban development.

=== Wildlife ===
Some of the many animals are elk, moose, red foxes, beavers, white-tailed deer, badgers, river otters, red squirrels, black bears, coyotes, and timber wolves. The aspen forest/meadow mosaic in the south-west corner of the park is particularly unique as it sustains a growing herd of more than 400 plains bison, the only free-ranging herd in its original range in Canada that has a full array of native predators, including timber wolves. Boreal woodland caribou from a regional population that is declining due to loss of habitat to forest logging range sometimes into the park, but their core habitat lies outside the park to the north. White-tailed deer, elk, and moose are the common ungulates. Flycatchers, Tennessee warblers, double-crested cormorants, red-necked grebes, brown creepers, nuthatches, three-toed woodpeckers, bald eagles, osprey, great blue herons, many species of ducks, and the common loon are just a few of the water fowl and birds which make their home in the park. There are 21 species of fish recorded in the park, including Iowa darter, yellow perch, brook stickleback, spottail shiner, cisco, northern pike (locally called &quot;jack fish&quot;), walleye (locally called &quot;pickerel&quot;), and lake trout. Although most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter.

The park is noted for its numerous lakes including three very large lakes — Waskesiu, Kingsmere, and Crean. The water quality is high and fish populations robust, except for lake trout that were commercially fished to near-extinction in Crean Lake in the early 20th century and, in spite of protection, have yet to recover their former numbers. Northern pike, walleye, suckers, and lake whitefish are among the most common larger fish. One of Canada&#x27;s largest white pelican colonies nests in an area closed to public use on Lavallée Lake in the north-west corner of the park, and pelicans, loons, mergansers, ospreys, and bald eagles are common in summer. Otters are seen regularly, year round. Winter is an especially good time to find otters as they spend considerable time around patches of open water on the Waskesiu Lake Narrows and the Kingsmere and Waskesiu Rivers.

== History ==


There are archeological traces of pre-history in the park reserve in the form of tools which have been located.
*Early Pre-contact (11,000 to 7500 BP)
*Middle Pre-contact (7500 to 2000 BP)
*Late Pre-contact (2000 to 200 BP)
*Post Contact or Historic (200 BP to Present)

At Waskesiu Lake, there was an early Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trading post between 1886 and 1893.

In 1908–1909 the New Northwest expeditions led by Frank Crean were the first to document the region, with the extensive use of photography and the mapping of lakes. Crean Lake was named in honour of Frank.

In the early 20th century the industries of fishing and logging were carried out in this boreal forested area. The large 1919 forest fire eliminated the logging industry.

Indigenous peoples who traditionally lived on the lands were forcibly removed from the land by federal officials and the RCMP upon creation of the park in 1927, with their possessions and cabins destroyed.

The park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by Stéphane Lafleur and scored by Andre Ethier, Mathieu Charbonneau, and Rebecca Foon.

=== Grey Owl ===
The Dominion Parks Service hired Grey Owl, Archibald Stanfield Belaney (September 18, 1888 – April 13, 1938), as the first naturalist. He lived on Ajawaan Lake in Prince Albert National Park and wrote of wilderness protection: &quot;Pilgrims of the Wild&quot; (1935), &quot;Sajo and the Beaver People&quot; (1935), and &quot;Empty Cabin&quot; (1936). He was played by Pierce Brosnan in the 1999 feature film, &quot;Grey Owl&quot;.

== Activities ==
There are many things to do in this park:

===Scenic driving tours===
There are a few main roads through the park.
* The Narrows Road along Waskesiu Lake&#x27;s southern shore, with many points of interest and picnic areas, ending at a 200-metre narrows, where there is a campground.
* Lakeview Drive or Scenic Route #263 which provides access to several other lakes: Namekus, Trappers, Sandy (also called Halkett); as well as many trails.
* Highway 264 to Kingsmere River, which accesses a small boat or canoe launch site midway between Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes, and a trail through a railway portage to Kingsmere Lake.

=== Picnicking ===
There are many picnic sites within the park, set up with picnic tables, scenic views, campfire pits and swimming areas.
*Namekus Lake
*Sandy Lake
*South Gate
*Meridian Day
*South Bay
*Trippes Beach
*King Island
*Paignton Beach
*The Narrows
*Waskesiu River
*Waskesiu Landing (Main Marina)
*Point View
*Birch Bay
*Heart Lakes
*Kingsmere

=== Hiking ===
These trails are in length or less. They each have descriptive guided brochures which help to identify the natural sights along the way.
*Boundary Bog Trail
*Mud Creek Trail
*Treebeard Trail
*Waskesiu River Trail
*Kingsmere River Trail
*Red Deer Trail (Red, Blue, and Yellow)
*Ice-Push Ridge Trail
*Narrows Peninsula Trail
*Spruce River Highlands Tower Trail

There are longer trails for the backpacker and hiker which vary from 13 kilometres in length and to 54 kilometres (return).
*Kingfisher Trail
*Grey Owl Trail
*Fish Trail
*Hunters Trail
*Spruce River Highlands Trail

=== Swimming ===
Surrounding Waskesiu Lake there are several beaches to take in swimming during the hot summer months. There are also good beaches at the south end of Kingsmere Lake (boat or trail access), Namekus Lake, and Sandy Lake.

=== Canoeing ===
Bagwa Canoe Route and Bladebone Canoe Route are two canoe routes of varying lengths. As well the park offers a multitude of lakes which are amenable to the canoe enthusiast. Amiskowan, Shady, Heart, Kingsmere, and Waskesiu lakes are just a few of them.

=== Boating ===
Power boats are only permitted on some of Prince Albert National Park&#x27;s lakes. Motor boats are allowed on Waskesiu, Crean, Kingsmere, Sandy, and the Hanging Heart Lakes. There is a limit of 40 horsepower motors on Kingsmere. The Waskesiu Marina, Heart Lakes Marina, and the Narrows have boat launches (permit and fee required) and docks. Boat, canoe, and kayak rentals are available at all three, by the hour or by the day. The Waskesiu Marina has a concrete breakwater and a permit is required to use boat launch facilities. Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks, and sail boats are allowed on all waters.

=== Fishing ===
Just like those who used the waters for commercial fishing in the early 20th century, campers may also find relaxation fishing for northern pike, walleye, lake trout, whitefish, or yellow perch. The park requires purchase of its own licences to fish in the park and limits and seasons are different from the province of Saskatchewan. Some areas, e.g., spawning grounds, are closed to fishing.

=== Camping ===
At this park one can choose from serviced or unserviced &#x27;front country&#x27; camping or go by canoe / boat and backpacking, and choose &#x27;back country&#x27; camping. Most back country camping occurs on Kingsmere and Crean lakes. Permits and fees are required for all camping, whether front or back country. Front country sites can be reserved by website or telephone.

Open fires are allowed at campsites (Excluding Red Deer Campground), after payment for a &quot;fire permit&quot; (fire permits are not required in picnic areas).

The following are accessible by automobile and can accommodate trailers and motorhomes:
*Beaver Glen Campground on the east margins of the Waskesiu town site has electricity to half of its 213 sites (no water or septic hook-ups), washrooms with hot and cold water and showers, central septic tank service, and drinking water. Sites can be booked in advance through the Parks Canada Campground Reservation Service through a toll free number or via online reservation. Details about how to reserve can be found at the Parks Canada website.
*Red Deer Campground, formerly &quot;Trailer Court&quot; is to the immediate South-West of Beaver Glen in the Waskesiu townsite. This site has power, water, and sewage hookups at each of its 161 pull through sites and is designed for large trailers and motorhomes. There are no open fires are allowed at Red Deer. Sites in Red Deer can be booked in advance in the same way as Beaver Glen.
*The Narrows Campground has flush toilet washrooms with cold water only, and no other services. Sites at the Narrows are first come, first served.
*Namekus Lake and Sandy Lake Campgrounds have septic tank toilets, water source (not drinkable without treatment). These sites are also first come, first served.

There are a series of boat-accessible campsites – the level of waves that can come up with overnight weather changes on Waskesiu, Kingsmere, and Crean lakes, provide some risk for boats that cannot be completely pulled out of the water at night.

=== Interpretive programs ===
The nature centre in the Waskesiu townsite has information about interpretive programs
* Freight Trail – 27 km one way
* Elk Trail – 39 km one way
* Fish Lake Trail – 12 km one way
* Hunters Lake Trail – 12 km one way
* Westside Boundary Trail – 37 km one way
* Red Deer Trail – three loops totalling 17 km
* Kinowa Trail – 5 km one way
* Amyot Lake Trail – 15.5 km loop

Bicycle rentals are available in Waskesiu townsite.

=== Wildlife and bird watching ===
Flycatchers, Tennessee warblers, red-necked grebe, brown creepers, nuthatches, three-toed woodpeckers, bald eagle, osprey, great blue herons, common loon are just a few of the many bird species to be seen in the park. Elk, black bear, fox, moose, beaver, deer, otter are a sampling of wild life of the park area.

Although most people visit the park in summer, the best wildlife watching is often in the winter. Wolves often travel on the frozen lakes and along the ploughed roads, and elk and deer are common right in the town of Waskesiu. Open water at the Narrows on Waskesiu Lake and where the Waskesiu River exits from the lake makes otter sightings very reliable. Foxes, including the red, cross, and silver colour phases, are frequent sightings in winter too.

=== Golfing ===
Stanley Thompson designed an 18-hole golf course in the park. It was built in the early 1930s. Its official name is the Waskesiu Golf Course, but is often called &quot;The Lobstick&quot; after a tournament it hosts each year.

== Climate ==
Waskesiu experiences a borderline humid continental/subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Dfc&quot;). The highest temperature ever recorded in Waskesiu was on June 5, 1988. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on January 21, 1935.

<text>Micro Chips (also styled Microchips and M.I.C.R.O. C.H.I.P.S.) was a Mexican children&#x27;s rock music group active from 1987 to 1993.

==History==
In 1987 Javier Willy (keyboard) and Daniel Willy (drums) from Torreón, Mexico, decided to start a band. Soon after, Ricardo Villa (lead guitar) and Sergio Robles (bass guitar) joined them under the name &quot;Explotion&quot;. Later they were joined by Jay de la Cueva. To expand their regional musical career and supported by their parents, they moved to Mexico City, where TV and record producer Luis de Llano Macedo, recognizing their potential he signed them and added his son, Tito de Llano. Finally, the Willy brothers invited their sister, Toti Willy, and this lineup became Micro Chips. (TV interview) 

Their first album, &quot;Niños Eléctricos&quot;, (Electric Children) with original music by Spanish composer Miguel Rios, was recorded in early 1988 with the advice and help from Ricardo Ochoa (musician and producer). They released three singles. &quot;No quiero&quot; (I don&#x27;t want to), &quot;Angello&quot; which was composed specially for one of the &quot;Menudo&quot; members (Angelo Garcia) and gained popularity on the radio, and &quot;Boomerang&quot;, a track for a roller coaster ride in Mexico City. This record received a gold award for its high sales.

In 1989 the band radically changed when Javier, Daniel and Toti Willy decided to return to Torreón, in order to continue their studies. They later formed Rock Kids which signed with Polygram Records and released two albums.
Micro Chips continued and looked for new band members, and found them in Mariana Navarro (Vocals), Jorge Mercado (Keyboards) and Tomás Pérez-Ascencio (Drums and Vocals). A single was released simply called &quot;Batimix&quot; (Batmix) while preparing the next album. This was during the 1989 Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; craze.

&quot;De Película&quot; (Movielike) from 1989 was the group&#x27;s second album. Produced again by Ricardo Ochoa. With participation by Aleks Syntek and Jorge &quot;Chiquis&quot; Amaro as composers. Engineered and recorded by Juan Switalski. Several singles were released, &quot;Grandes Años Del Rock And Roll&quot;, a cover of Jive Bunny&#x27;s &quot;Swing the Mood&quot;. &quot;Perro Lanudo&quot; (Fluffy Dog) was also released as a single. At the end of the subsequent tour Mariana Navarro left the group.

In 1990 &quot;Energía es Amo&quot;r was released, produced by Marco Flores and recorded at Dallas Sound Lab studios., this time two new female singers join, Yani Contreras from Mexico City and Jessica Herreman from Guadalajara. Several singles were released from this album, Including &quot;Quiero Ser&quot; (I Want To Be) and &quot;Tiempo al Tiempo (Give Time the Time).&quot; This album also has songs written by Marco Flores, Ricardo Arjona, and band members Jay de la Cueva, Ricardo Villa and Tomás Pérez-Ascencio.

1992 brought &quot;No Somos Números&quot;. Produced by Óscar Flores was the fourth and final album, again there were band member changes. Anna Borrás (Vocals) formerly at La Onda Vaselina/OV7 comes in place of Yani, and Alejandro Santoyo (Keyboards) comes in place of Jorge. The album is recorded in New York City and includes two cover songs from Jovanotti which also became two hit singles. &quot;Números-I Numeri&quot; (Numbers) and &quot;Sácalo-Diritti E Doveri&quot; (Rights and Duties). They toured extensively in Mexico and also did some concerts in the US.

In 1993 the band decided to record a new album and started looking for a new name, since they were no longer children. However this never happened, and the musicians continued their musical careers separately.

In April 2014 the band&#x27;s Facebook page announced the re-release, on April 22, 2014, of the &quot;Niños Eléctricos&quot; album, celebrating its 25th anniversary and the Mexican holiday, Children&#x27;s Day, on April 30.

On February 23, 2024, on the band&#x27;s Facebook page was announced the 35th Anniversary release by Universal Music México, of the Album &quot;Niños Electricos&quot; on March 8, 2024, featuring 3 bonus tracks, never released.

<doc id="370987" wikidata="Q3722381" url="?curid=370987" title="2002 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 2002 New Zealand general election was held on 27 July 2002 to determine the composition of the 47th New Zealand Parliament. It saw the reelection of Helen Clark&#x27;s Labour Party government, as well as the worst-ever performance by the opposition National Party (the 2020 election would see it suffer a greater defeat in terms of net loss of seats).

A controversial issue in the election campaign was the end of a moratorium on genetic engineering, strongly opposed by the Green Party. Some commentators have claimed that the tension between Labour and the Greens on this issue was a more notable part of the campaign than any tension between Labour and its traditional right-wing opponents. The release of Nicky Hager&#x27;s book &quot;Seeds of Distrust&quot; prior to the election also sparked much debate. The book examined how the government handled the contamination of a shipment of imported corn with genetically modified seeds. Helen Clark called the Greens &quot;goths and anarcho-feminists&quot; during the campaign.

==Background==
On 12 June the government announced that the country would have a general election on 27 July. This was several months earlier than was required, a fact which caused considerable comment. The Prime Minister, Helen Clark, claimed that an early poll was necessary due to the collapse of her junior coalition partner, the Alliance. Critics, however, claimed that Clark could have continued to govern, and that the early election was called to take advantage of Labour&#x27;s strong position in the polls. Some commentators believe that a mixture of these factors was responsible.

Before the election, the Labour Party held 49 seats in parliament. It governed in coalition with the smaller (and more left-wing) Alliance, which had 10 seats. It also relied on support from the Greens, but this was a largely informal arrangement, and the Greens were not a part of the administration itself. Opposing Labour were the National Party (centre-right), United Future (centrist), New Zealand First (populist), ACT New Zealand (free-market). Many opinion polls for the election indicated that Labour was popular enough to conceivably win an absolute majority, leaving it able to govern without the support of smaller parties. Labour&#x27;s dominance over National was such that for many people, the question was not whether Labour would win, but whether Labour would receive the absolute majority it sought.

===MPs retiring in 2002===
Eleven MPs, including two Alliance MPs, six National MPs, and two Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 46th Parliament.

==The election==
There were 2,670,030 registered voters, the highest number for any election in New Zealand. However, only 77% of these registered voters chose to cast a vote, a considerable drop from previous elections. Many commentators cited Labour&#x27;s dominance in the polls as a reason for this low turnout. Many people saw the outcome as inevitable, and so did not bother to vote at all.

In the election 683 candidates stood, and there were 14 registered parties with party lists. Of the candidates, 433 were electorate and list, 160 were electorate only, and 90 were list only. 71% of candidates (487) were male and 29% (196) female.

==Summary of results==
As most people expected, Labour was victorious. It did not, however, receive an absolute majority, gaining only 52 seats (eight seats short of the half-way mark). Labour&#x27;s former coalition partner, the Alliance (which had splintered shortly before the election), was not returned to parliament. However, the new Progressive Coalition (now the Progressive Party) started by former Alliance leader Jim Anderton won two seats, and remained allied with Labour. The Greens, who were now distanced from Labour over the genetic engineering controversy, gained nine seats (an increase of two).

In general, it was a bad election for the parties of the right. The National Party, once referred to as &quot;the natural party of government&quot;, suffered its worst-ever electoral defeat, gaining only 21% of the vote. ACT New Zealand, National&#x27;s more right-wing neighbour, failed to capitalise on the exodus of National supporters, retaining the same number of seats as before. Instead, the most notable gains among opposition parties were made by two centrist parties. One of these was Winston Peters&#x27;s New Zealand First, a populist and nationalist party opposed to immigration. Strong campaigning by Peters allowed the party to recover from its serious losses in the 1999 election. The other was United Future New Zealand party, a centrist party based on a merger of the United Party and the Future New Zealand party – primarily due to the performance of leader Peter Dunne, the party shot from having one seat to having eight seats.

Once the final distribution of seats was determined, it was clear that Labour would be at the centre of the government, and that it would be allied with the Progressives. However, this still left Labour needing support in matters of confidence and supply, as the two parties together fell short of an absolute majority. Labour expressed a preference for an &quot;agreement&quot; rather than a full coalition, hoping to establish an arrangement similar to the one that existed with the Greens prior to the election. Three realistic choices existed for a partner – the Greens, United Future, and New Zealand First. Labour had repeatedly ruled out deals with New Zealand First during the election campaign, and reaffirmed this soon after the election, leaving just the Greens and United Future as candidates. After a period of negotiation, Labour opted to ally with United Future, being unwilling to change their genetic engineering policies to secure the Green Party&#x27;s support.

Labour and the Progressives remained in power, with support in confidence and supply votes from United Future.

===Party vote by electorate===
===Votes summary===

===Electorate results===
Of the 69 electorates in the 2002 election, a majority (45) were won by the Labour Party. The opposition National Party won 21 electorate seats. Labour dominated the urban areas, where it has traditionally been strongest, while National performed best in rural areas. However, Labour&#x27;s strong position in this election led to National losing ground in a number of its traditional strongholds. The loss of Otago electorate, a rural area, was one notable example.

Labour also dominated in the seven Maori seats. National gained second place in only one Maori electorate, with Labour&#x27;s main rivals being the Mana Maori Movement, the Greens, and the Alliance.

Of the minor parties, only three managed to win electorates, mostly due to the strong personal following of the incumbents. United Future leader Peter Dunne retained his strong support in the Wellington electorate of Ohariu-Belmont, while New Zealand First leader Winston Peters retained Tauranga. Progressive leader Jim Anderton retained the Christchurch seat of Wigram, which he had formerly held as leader of the Alliance.

The table below shows the results of the 2002 general election:

===List results===

MPs returned via party lists, and unsuccessful candidates, were as follows:
*Chal was ranked fifth on the United Future list and was declared elected, serving as an MP for 17 days. However, it emerged that Chal was not actually eligible to stand for election, as she was not a New Zealand citizen. As a result, she was removed from the party list.
;Notes:
# These party list members later entered parliament in the term as other list MPs elected resigned from parliament.
# These party list members later resigned during the parliamentary term.

===Summary of seat changes===
* Electoral redistributions:
** A minor reconfiguration of electorates and their boundaries occurred between the 1999 and 2002 elections. Five seats were abolished and seven were created, giving a net increase of two electorates.
** The seats of &quot;Albany&quot;, &quot;Hunua&quot;, &quot;Karapiro&quot;, &quot;Titirangi&quot; and &quot;Hauraki (Maori)&quot; ceased to exist.
** The seats of &quot;Clevedon&quot;, &quot;East Coast Bays&quot;, &quot;Helensville&quot;, &quot;New Lynn&quot;, &quot;Piako&quot;, &quot;Tainui (Maori)&quot; and &quot;Tamaki Makaurau (Maori)&quot; came into being.
* Seats captured:
** By Labour: &quot;Hamilton East&quot;, &quot;Otago&quot; and &quot;Waitakere&quot; were captured from National.
** By National: &quot;Coromandel&quot; was captured from the Greens.
** The seat of &quot;Wigram&quot; transferred from the Alliance to the Progressives due to a change of its MP&#x27;s party affiliation.
* Seats transferred from departing MPs to new MPs:
** The seat of &quot;Rakaia&quot;, held by a departing National MP, was won by a new National candidate.
** The seats of &quot;Mana&quot;, &quot;Napier&quot;, &quot;Otaki&quot;, and &quot;Te Tai Hauauru&quot;, all held by departing Labour MPs, were won by new Labour candidates (although the departing Mana MP became a list MP and the departing Te Tai Hauauru MP returned to Parliament in another electorate).

** Retired: 1
** Became electorate MPs: 3
** Re-elected: 4
** Newly elected: 3 (including a former electorate MP)

<text>SS &quot;Elingamite&quot; was an Australian passenger steamer of 2,585 tons, built in 1887, and owned by Huddart Parker. The ship was wrecked on 9 November 1902 off the north coast of New Zealand carrying a large consignment of gold. The wreck is now a favourite site for adventurous divers because of the drama associated with it, and wild tales of lost treasure.

==Ship history==
&quot;Elingamite&quot; arrived at Sydney, on 22 November 1887, having departed from Newcastle upon Tyne in England on 24 September, where she had been built by C.S. Swan &amp; Hunter. She was a steel-hulled screw steamer long, in the beam, with a depth of .
She was powered by triple-expansion compound steam engines, built by the Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company, which gave her a top speed of . There was accommodation for 100 passengers in 1st class, and another 100 in steerage. The Victorian government had selected her for use as an armed cruiser, and she had fittings in place for four Armstrong 36-pounder guns (two forward and two aft), and machine-guns amidships. She was schooner-rigged on two pole masts.

===The sinking===

&quot;Elingamite&quot; left Sydney early on Sunday morning, 5 November 1902, on the regular Tasman Sea run between Sydney and Auckland. Captain Ernest Atwood was in charge. On board were 136 passengers and 58 crew, and a consignment of 52 boxes of coins for banks in New Zealand, including 6,000 gold half-sovereigns.

The voyage was uneventful until mid-morning on the 9th when the ship suddenly encountered thick fog. Captain Atwood took necessary precautions, but the vessel struck West Island, one of the islands in the Three Kings group, about north of Cape Reinga on the northern tip of mainland New Zealand.

The vessel foundered and sank within 20 minutes, but those on board managed to escape in lifeboats and rafts, some taking survivors to King Islands and some to the mainland. One lifeboat was never seen again. 45 people were killed (28 passengers and 17 crew) when the ship foundered. A party of 75 people from three boats landed on a rocky ledge on the middle King Island and after two days were picked up by the SS &quot;Zealandia&quot; and taken to Auckland. A raft and a fourth boat reached the Great King island and a fifth boat with 52 people on board sailed to Houhora on the North Island, 80 miles away.
==Aftermath==
A court of enquiry into the sinking began at Auckland on 28 November and lasted about two months. Captain Atwood was found guilty of grossly negligent navigation (and on other matters), and his master&#x27;s certificate was suspended.

Eight years later the Australian Naval Station reported that the Three Kings were wrongly charted. In 1911, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; surveyed the area and established the Three Kings group to be a mile and a quarter south, and a third of a mile east, of their position shown on Captain Atwood&#x27;s chart.

The enquiry was reopened and the court found that the sinking would never have happened had the chart been accurate. Captain Atwood was cleared of all charges and later became a ship surveyor at Wellington.

==Salvage==
Over the years there have been exaggerated claims that there was unregistered bullion aboard, and inflated tales about the true value of the coins on board when she sank. It was worth £17,320 (approximately equivalent to $2 million in 2004 US dollars) which was a lot of money, but less than claimed by urban legends. For almost 30 years the &quot;Elingamite&quot; wreck has been a favourite site for adventurous divers and although widely dispersed and now relatively scarce, some coins have been recovered. The late Kelly Tarlton ran several salvage expeditions to this wreck, during which explosives may have been used to free non-ferrous metals from solidifying precipitate and ferrous corrosion.

The wreck is now privately owned, having passed through several hands after auction of the rights to the wreck by the original insurance company.

<doc id="370999" wikidata="Q18857" url="?curid=370999" title="Greater sand plover">
<text>The greater sand plover (Anarhynchus leschenaultii) is a small wader in the plover family of birds. The spelling is often given as &quot;greater sandplover&quot; or &quot;greater sand-plover&quot;, but the official IOC and British Ornithologists&#x27; Union spelling is &quot;Greater Sand Plover&quot;. The specific &quot;leschenaultii&quot; commemorates the French botanist Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. Like most other species in the genus &quot;Anarhynchus&quot;, it was until recently included in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot;.

==Distribution==
It breeds in the semi-deserts of Turkey and eastwards through Central Asia, where it nests in a bare ground scrape. This species is strongly migratory, wintering on sandy beaches in East Africa, South Asia and Australasia. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, where it has been recorded as far west as Iceland. It has been recorded twice in North America, the most recent being on 14 May 2009 in Jacksonville, Florida.

==Subspecies==
There are three subspecies:
*&quot;A. l. leschenaultii&quot;, the nominate, in the east of the species&#x27; range in Mongolia and NW China. Bill intermediate; summer plumage with a weak orange breast band.
*&quot;A. l. scythicus&quot;, in the centre of the species&#x27; range in Central Asia. Bill largest in the species; summer plumage with a moderate orange breast band. Syn. &quot;A. l. crassirostris&quot;; this name is however preoccupied by a subspecies of Wilson&#x27;s plover, &quot;A. wilsonia crassirostris&quot; described 48 years earlier.
*&quot;A. l. columbinus&quot;, in the west of the species&#x27; range in SW Asia west to central Turkey. Bill smallest in the species; summer plumage with a strong orange breast band.

==Description==
This chunky plover is 19–22 cm long, slightly larger than a common ringed plover, and is conspicuously long-legged and thick-billed. Breeding males have sandy buff backs and white underparts. The breast, forehead and nape are variably orange in summer, and there is a black eye mask in summer. The female is duller and greyer, and winter and juvenile birds are browner, apart from a hint of rufous on the head. The legs are greenish-yellow and the bill black.

In all plumages, it is very similar to its close relatives Siberian sand plover &quot;A. mongolus&quot; and Tibetan sand plover &quot;A. atrifrons&quot;. Separating the species may be straightforward in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is another thing altogether to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the southwest Asian subspecies of the greater is the most similar to the other two species in its smaller bill.

==Ecology==
Its food consists of insects, crustaceans and annelid worms, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups.

Its flight call is a soft trill.

The greater sand plover is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>John Allen Veatch (5 March 180824 April 1870), a surgeon, surveyor, and scientist, was known for his discovery of large deposits of borax at Tuscan Springs, California, on 8 January 1856.

Veatch moved with his family to Texas in 1833, where he surveyed for the Mexican government. He received two land grants in 1835, one located in what would become Beaumont, Texas, and another near the future Sour Lake, Texas. After the Texas Revolution, where he served as a surgeon, Veatch moved to California, where he discovered borax in Lake County, California. Veatch eventually ended up in Oregon, where he taught at the Willamette University College of Medicine.

<text>Nathaniel Brown Palmer (August 8, 1799 – June 21, 1877) was an American seal hunter, explorer, sailing captain, ship designer, and a whale hunter. He gave his name to Palmer Land, Antarctica, which he explored in 1820 on his sloop &quot;Hero&quot;. He was born in Stonington, Connecticut, and was a descendant of Walter Palmer, one of the town&#x27;s founders.

==Sealing career and Antarctic exploration==
During the 1810s the hides of Antarctic Ocean seals were highly valued as items for trade with China. Palmer served as second mate on board ″s first voyage, during which she became the first American vessel known to reach the South Shetland Islands. As a skilled and fearless seal hunter, Palmer achieved his first command at the early age of 21. His vessel, a diminutive sloop named , was only in length. Palmer steered southward in &quot;Hero&quot; at the beginning of the Antarctic summer of 1820–1821. Aggressively searching for new seal rookeries south of Cape Horn, on November 17, 1820, Palmer and his men became the first Americans and the third group of people to discover the Antarctic Peninsula. Larger ships skippered by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Edward Bransfield had reported sighting land earlier in 1820. Along with English sealer George Powell, Palmer also co-discovered the nearby South Orkney Islands archipelago.

==Merchant marine career and development of the clipper ships==
After concluding a successful sealing career, Palmer, still in the prime of life, switched his attention to the captaining of fast sailing ships for the transportation of express freight. In 1843, Captain Palmer took command of on her maiden voyage from Boston to Hong Kong, arriving in 111 days. In this new role, the Connecticut captain traveled many of the world&#x27;s principal sailing routes. Observing the strengths and weaknesses of the ocean-going sailing ships of his time, Palmer suggested and designed improvements to their hulls and rigging. The improvements made Palmer a co-developer of the mid-19th century clipper ship.

Capt. Palmer purchased the Capt. Loper house in 1836, in Stonington, Connecticut. The Loper family were primarily whalers out of East Hampton, Long Island. Capt. Jacob Loper had four sons who brought whaling to Nantucket, Massachusetts; the Delaware Bay, southern New Jersey; and, Stonington, Connecticut. The composite character of Ismael in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is based on events in the life of one of his children, who was the only survivor of an 1835 sinking off Japan, in which all were lost but young James Loper, who floated upon a coffin for a week. In the Capt. Loper House library Capt. Palmer found many old maps, including two of the coastline of Antarctica, made by the Lopers while working with The Dutch East India Company. The Loper family invented &quot;All Found&quot;, which meant that berth and food were not deducted from sailors&#x27; pay, insuring eager crews for Capt. James Loper. Escaping slaves likewise signed on as each sailor was paid the same rate. All African-Americans with the last name of &quot;Loper&quot; can trace their lineage back to this time, taking their last name from the Dutch Loper family. Between 1852 and 1854 Capt. Palmer built his home in Stonington which is today known as the Capt. Nathaniel B. Palmer House. The house is of a transitional style combining elements of the Greek revival and Victorian Italianate styles. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996 and is now the headquarters of the Stonington Historical Society.

Palmer closed his sailing career and established himself in his hometown of Stonington as a successful owner of clipper ships sailed by others. He died in San Francisco June 21, 1877, at the age of 77.

==Legacy in the Antarctic and beyond==
Palmer Land, part of the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as the Palmer Archipelago, were named in his honor.

The Antarctic science and research program operated by the U.S. government continues to recall Palmer&#x27;s role in the exploration of the Antarctic area. Palmer Station, located in the seal islands that Palmer explored, the clipper ship (built by Jacob Aaron Westervelt) and the Antarctic icebreaker RV &quot;Nathaniel B. Palmer&quot; are named after Captain Palmer.
Hero Bay, in the South Shetland Islands, is named for Captain Palmer&#x27;s sloop &quot;Hero&quot;, one of the vessels of the Pendleton sealing fleet from Stonington which visited the islands in 1820–21.

Also named after Palmer&#x27;s sloop &quot;Hero&quot; is Hero Rupes, an escarpment which was discovered in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mercury in 1973.

On September 14, 1988, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp honoring Nathaniel Palmer.

His home in Stonington, the Capt. Nathaniel B. Palmer House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996.
According to the records of the Grand Lodge AF&amp;AM of Connecticut, he was initiated in 1826 by the Loper family. His record of membership ends in the year of his death and was reported at a special meeting of Asylum Lodge of Masons in Stonington, CT No. 57 on June 29, 1877, a Seafarer&#x27;s Lodge. The Masonic Service Association of North America published a Short Talk Bulletin in March 2007 that is Vol. 85 No. 3 which details his history and attests to his membership in the Masonic Fraternity.

<text>GNU Wget (or just Wget, formerly Geturl, also written as its package name, wget) is a computer program that retrieves content from web servers. It is part of the GNU Project. Its name derives from &quot;World Wide Web&quot; and &quot;&quot;get&quot;&quot;. It supports downloading via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.

Its features include recursive download, conversion of links for offline viewing of local HTML, and support for proxies. It appeared in 1996, coinciding with the boom of popularity of the Web, causing its wide use among Unix users and distribution with most major Linux distributions. Wget is written in C, and can be easily installed on any Unix-like system. Wget has been ported to Microsoft Windows, macOS, OpenVMS, HP-UX, AmigaOS, MorphOS, and Solaris. Since version 1.14, Wget has been able to save its output in the web archiving standard WARC format.

==History==
Wget descends from an earlier program named Geturl by the same author, the development of which commenced in late 1995. The name changed to Wget after the author became aware of an earlier Amiga program named GetURL, written by James Burton in AREXX.

Wget filled a gap in the inconsistent web-downloading software available in the mid-1990s. No single program could reliably use both HTTP and FTP to download files. Existing programs either supported FTP (such as NcFTP and dl) or were written in Perl, which was not yet ubiquitous. While Wget was inspired by features of some of the existing programs, it supported both HTTP and FTP and could be built using only the standard development tools found on every Unix system.

At that time many Unix users struggled behind extremely slow university and dial-up Internet connections, leading to a growing need for a downloading agent that could deal with transient network failures without assistance from the human operator.

==Features==
===Robustness===
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections. If a download does not complete due to a network problem, Wget will automatically try to continue the download from where it left off, and repeat this until the whole file has been retrieved. It was one of the first clients to make use of the then-new codice_1 HTTP header to support this feature.

===Recursive download===
Wget can optionally work like a web crawler by extracting resources linked from HTML pages and downloading them in sequence, repeating the process recursively until all the pages have been downloaded or a maximum recursion depth specified by the user has been reached. The downloaded pages are saved in a directory structure resembling that on the remote server. This &quot;recursive download&quot; enables partial or complete mirroring of web sites via HTTP. Links in downloaded HTML pages can be adjusted to point to locally downloaded material for offline viewing. When performing this kind of automatic mirroring of web sites, Wget supports the Robots Exclusion Standard (unless the option codice_2 is used).

Recursive download works with FTP as well, where Wget issues the codice_3 command to find which additional files to download, repeating this process for directories and files under the one specified in the top URL. Shell-like wildcards are supported when the download of FTP URLs is requested.

When downloading recursively over either HTTP or FTP, Wget can be instructed to inspect the timestamps of local and remote files, and download only the remote files newer than the corresponding local ones. This allows easy mirroring of HTTP and FTP sites, but is considered inefficient and more error-prone when compared to programs designed for mirroring from the ground up, such as rsync. On the other hand, Wget does not require special server-side software for this task.

===Non-interactiveness===
Wget is non-interactive in the sense that, once started, it does not require user interaction and does not need to control a TTY, being able to log its progress to a separate file for later inspection. Users can start Wget and log off, leaving the program unattended. By contrast, most graphical or text user interface web browsers require the user to remain logged in and to manually restart failed downloads, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

===Portability===
Written in a highly portable style of C with minimal dependencies on third-party libraries, Wget requires little more than a C compiler and a BSD-like interface to TCP/IP networking. Designed as a Unix program invoked from the Unix shell, the program has been ported to numerous Unix-like environments and systems, including Microsoft Windows via Cygwin, and macOS. It is also available as a native Microsoft Windows program as one of the GnuWin packages.

===Other features===
*Wget supports download through proxies, which are widely deployed to provide web access inside company firewalls and to cache and quickly deliver frequently accessed content.
*It makes use of HTTP persistent connections where available.
*IPv6 is supported on systems that include the appropriate interfaces.
*SSL/TLS is supported for encrypted downloads using the OpenSSL or GnuTLS library.
*Files larger than 2 GiB are supported on 32-bit systems that include the appropriate interfaces.
*Download speed may be throttled to avoid using up all of the available bandwidth.
*Can save its output in the web archiving standard WARC format, deduplicating from an associated CDX file as required.

==Authors and copyright==
GNU Wget was written by Hrvoje Nikšić with contributions by many other people, including Dan Harkless, Ian Abbott, and Mauro Tortonesi. Significant contributions are credited in the &quot;AUTHORS&quot; file included in the distribution, and all remaining ones are documented in the changelogs, also included with the program. Wget is currently maintained by Giuseppe Scrivano, Tim Rühsen and Darshit Shah.
The copyright to Wget belongs to the Free Software Foundation, whose policy is to require copyright assignments for all non-trivial contributions to GNU software.

===License===
GNU Wget is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later, with a special exception that allows distribution of binaries linked against the OpenSSL library. The text of the exception follows:
Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7

If you modify this program, or any covered work, by linking or combining it with the OpenSSL project&#x27;s OpenSSL library (or a modified version of that library), containing parts covered by the terms of the OpenSSL or SSLeay licenses, the Free Software Foundation grants you additional permission to convey the resulting work. Corresponding Source for a non-source form of such a combination shall include the source code for the parts of OpenSSL used as well as that of the covered work.
It is expected that the exception clause will be removed once Wget is modified to also link with the GnuTLS library.

Wget&#x27;s documentation, in the form of a Texinfo reference manual, is distributed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.2 or later. The man page usually distributed on Unix-like systems is automatically generated from a subset of the Texinfo manual and falls under the terms of the same license.

==Development==
Wget is developed in an open fashion, most of the design decisions typically being discussed on the public mailing list followed by users and developers. Bug reports and patches are relayed to the same list.

===Source contribution===
The preferred method of contributing to Wget&#x27;s code and documentation is through source updates in the form of textual patches generated by the diff utility. Patches intended for inclusion in Wget are submitted to the mailing list where they are reviewed by the maintainers. Patches that pass the maintainers&#x27; scrutiny are installed in the sources. Instructions on patch creation as well as style guidelines are outlined on the project&#x27;s wiki.

The source code can also be tracked via a remote version control repository that hosts revision history beginning with the 1.5.3 release. The repository is currently running Git. Prior to that, the source code had been hosted on (in reverse order): Bazaar, Mercurial, Subversion, and via CVS.

====Release====
When a sufficient number of features or bug fixes accumulate during development, Wget is released to the general public via the GNU FTP site and its mirrors. Being entirely run by volunteers, there is no external pressure to issue a release nor are there enforceable release deadlines.

Releases are numbered as versions of the form of &quot;major.minor[.revision]&quot;, such as &quot;Wget 1.11&quot; or &quot;Wget 1.8.2&quot;. An increase of the major version number represents large and possibly incompatible changes in Wget&#x27;s behavior or a radical redesign of the code base. An increase of the minor version number designates addition of new features and bug fixes. A new revision indicates a release that, compared to the previous revision, only contains bug fixes. Revision zero is omitted, meaning that for example Wget 1.11 is the same as 1.11.0. Wget does not use the odd-even release number convention popularized by Linux.

====Popular references====
Wget makes an appearance in the 2010 Columbia Pictures motion picture release, &quot;The Social Network&quot;. The lead character, a somewhat fictionalized version of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, uses Wget to aggregate student photos from various Harvard University housing-facility directories.

===Notable releases===
The following releases represent notable milestones in Wget&#x27;s development. Features listed next to each release are edited for brevity and do not constitute comprehensive information about the release, which is available in the &quot;NEWS&quot; file distributed with Wget.
*Geturl 1.0, released January 1996, was the first publicly available release. The first English-language announcement can be traced to a Usenet news posting, which probably refers to Geturl 1.3.4 released in June.
*Wget 1.4.0, released November 1996, was the first version to use the name &quot;Wget&quot;. It was also the first release distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, Geturl having been distributed under an ad hoc no-warranty license.
*Wget 1.4.3, released February 1997, was the first version released as part of the GNU project with the copyright assigned to the FSF.
*Wget 1.5.3, released September 1998, was a milestone in the program&#x27;s popularity. This version was bundled with many Linux based distributions, which exposed the program to a much wider audience.
*Wget 1.6, released December 1999, incorporated many bug fixes for the (by then stale) 1.5.3 release, largely thanks to the effort of Dan Harkless.
*Wget 1.7, released June 2001, introduced SSL support, cookies, and persistent connections.
*Wget 1.8, released December 2001, added bandwidth throttling, new progress indicators, and the breadth-first traversal of the hyperlink graph.
*Wget 1.9, released October 2003, included experimental IPv6 support, and ability to POST data to HTTP servers.
*Wget 1.10, released June 2005, introduced large file support, IPv6 support on dual-family systems, NTLM authorization, and SSL improvements. The maintainership was picked up by Mauro Tortonesi.
*Wget 1.11, released January 2008, moved to version 3 of the GNU General Public License, and added preliminary support for the codice_4 header, which is often used by CGI scripts to indicate the name of a file for downloading. Security-related improvements were also made to the HTTP authentication code. Micah Cowan took over maintainership of the project.
*Wget 1.12, released September 2009, added support for parsing URLs from CSS content on the web, and for handling Internationalized Resource Identifiers.
*Wget 1.13, released August 2011, supports HTTP/1.1, fixed some portability issues, and used the GnuTLS library by default for secure connections.
*Wget 1.14, released August 2012, improved support for TLS and added support for Digest Access Authentication.
*Wget 1.15, released January 2014, added—https-only and support for Perfect-Forward Secrecy.
*Wget 1.16, released October 2014, changed the default progress bar output, closed , added support for libpsl to verify cookie domains, and introduced—start-pos to allow starting downloads from a specified position.
*Wget 1.17, released November 2015, removed FTP passive to active fallback due to privacy concerns, added support for FTPS and for—if-modified-since.
*Wget 1.18, released June 2016, resolved the issue, and added the &quot;--bind-dns-address&quot; and &quot;--dns-servers&quot; options.
*Wget 1.19, released February 2017, added new options for processing a Metalink file; version 1.19.1 added the—retry-on-http-error option to retry a download if the Web server responds with a given HTTP status code.
*Wget 1.20, released November 2018, added codice_5 for more reliability and codice_6, codice_7 options for recursive FTP retrievals.

==Wget2==
GNU Wget2 2.0.0 was released on 26 September 2021. It is licensed under the GPL-3.0-or-later license, and is wrapped around Libwget which is under the LGPL-3.0-or-later license. It has many improvements in comparison to Wget, particularly, in many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to support of the following protocols and technologies:

* HTTP/2,
* HTTP compression,
* parallel connections,
* use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header,
* TCP Fast Open.

==Related works==

<doc id="371039" wikidata="Q305255" url="?curid=371039" title="Siberian sand plover">
<text>The Siberian sand plover (Anarhynchus mongolus) is a small wader in the plover family of birds. The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union split the Tibetan sand plover from the lesser sand plover and changed its vernacular name to Siberian sand plover. The specific &quot;mongolus&quot; is Latin and refers to Mongolia, which at the time of naming referred to a larger area than the present country.

==Taxonomy==
The Siberian sand plover and the Tibetan sand plover were previously considered to belong to the same species known as the &quot;lesser sand plover&quot;, consisting of five races within the species complex. However, a study published in 2022 suggested that the &quot;&quot;mongolus&quot; group (currently identified as the Siberian sand plover) within the lesser sand plover is actually the sister group of the greater sand plover. Additionally, the &quot;atrifrons&quot; group (representing the Tibetan sand plover) is the sister group of the monophyletic group formed by the &quot;mongolus&quot;&quot; group and the greater sand plover.

This means that the lesser sand plover is paraphyletic. Therefore a taxonomic revision was needed. The authors suggested new scientific and common English names for them. The large East Asian forms &quot;mongolus&quot; and &quot;stegmanni&quot; are currently identified as the Siberian sand plover, &quot;Anarhynchus mongolus&quot;; and the Tibetan Plateau form is now known as the Tibetan sand plover, &quot;Anarhynchus atrifrons&quot;, which includes the three races &quot;atrifrons&quot;, &quot;pamirensis&quot; and &quot;schaeferi&quot;.

IOU accepted the split and renaming of the lesser sand plover in 2023.

==Description==

This chunky plover is long-legged and long-billed. Breeding males have grey backs and white underparts. The breast, forehead and nape are chestnut, and there is a black eye mask. The female is duller, and winter and juvenile birds lack the chestnut, apart from a hint of rufous on the head. Legs are dark and the bill black.

In all plumages, this species is very similar to the greater sand plover, &quot;Charadrius leschenaultii&quot;. Separating the species may be straightforward in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is more difficult to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of greater sand plover is the most similar to the lesser. The lesser usually has darker legs, a white forehead, and a more even white wing bar than the greater.

==Distribution==

It breeds discontinuously across bare coastal plains in north-eastern Siberia, with the Mongolian plover in the eastern part of the range; it has also bred in Alaska. It nests in a bare ground scrape, laying three eggs. This species is strongly migratory, wintering on sandy beaches in east and southeast Asia.

==Ecology==

The Siberian sand plover feeds on insects, crustaceans and annelid worms, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. This species takes fewer steps and shorter pauses than the greater sand plover when feeding.

The flight call is a hard trill.

The Siberian sand plover is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

==Identification==
Size is one of the factors distinguishing a Siberian sand plover from a greater sand plover, with the Siberian being slightly smaller. However, it is not easy to rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the Siberian generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in a Siberian sand plover is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in a greater sand plover it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.

<doc id="371047" wikidata="Q183083" url="?curid=371047" title="Micropolyphony">
<text>Micropolyphony is a kind of polyphonic musical texture developed by György Ligeti, which consists of many lines of dense canons moving at different tempos or rhythms, thus resulting in tone clusters. According to David Cope, &quot;micropolyphony resembles cluster chords, but differs in its use of moving rather than static lines&quot;; it is &quot;a simultaneity of different lines, rhythms, and timbres&quot;.

Differences between micropolyphonic texture and conventional polyphonic texture can be explained by Ligeti&#x27;s own description:
The earliest example of micropolyphony in Ligeti&#x27;s work occurs in the second movement (mm 25–37) of his orchestral composition &quot;Apparitions&quot;. He used the technique in a number of his other works, including &quot;Atmosphères&quot; for orchestra; the first movement of his &quot;Requiem&quot; for soprano, mezzo-soprano, mixed choir, and orchestra; the unaccompanied choral work &quot;Lux aeterna&quot;; and &quot;Lontano&quot; for orchestra. Micropolyphony is easier with larger ensembles or polyphonic instruments such as the piano, though the &quot;Poème symphonique&quot; for a hundred metronomes creates &quot;micropolyphony of unparallelled complexity&quot;. Many of Ligeti&#x27;s piano pieces are examples of micropolyphony applied to complex &quot;minimalist&quot; Steve Reich and Pygmy music derived rhythmic schemes.

<text>World Expo 88, also known as Expo 88, was a specialised Expo held in Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia, during a six-month period between Saturday, 30 April 1988 and Sunday, 30 October 1988, inclusive. The theme of the Expo was &quot;Leisure in the Age of Technology&quot;, and the mascot for the Expo was an Australian platypus named Expo Oz.

The A$625 million fair was the largest event of the 1988 Bicentennial celebrations of the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney Harbour. Expo 88 attracted more than 15,760,000 visitors who bought tickets worth A$175 million. The event achieved both its economic aims and very good attendances, was successfully used to promote Queensland as a tourist destination and it spurred a major re-development at the South Brisbane site. The core feature of the site were the international pavilions. Many of the exposition&#x27;s sculptures and buildings were retained by various entities around the state and are still in use or on display today.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The first thoughts of a world expo for Brisbane began soon after James Maccormick, architect for the Australia Pavilion at Expo &#x27;67, Expo &#x27;70 and Expo &#x27;74, was commissioned to do an urban renewal study for Kangaroo Point in the early 70s. It occurred to Maccormick that an exposition would be an ideal catalyst for such a redevelopment, and he later hosted meetings with prominent Queensland business persons and government representatives to discuss the idea. With the Australian Bicentenary looming in 1988, other Australian capitals sought means by which to celebrate the event, including hosting of a Universal Exposition or the Summer Olympic Games. Sydney and Melbourne both made representations to the Federal Government for matching dollar for dollar funding for a Universal Exposition in the 1988 bicentennial year, however, citing the costs of the new Parliament House in Canberra, also to be opened in the same year, these proposals were knocked back. But 12 years later the 2000 Summer Olympics were held in Sydney, and Brisbane will be the 2032 Summer Olympics host city .
Brisbane, under Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, then developed Maccomick&#x27;s earlier proposal to host an international-scale exposition, however at no cost to the Australian taxpayer, a world&#x27;s first &#x27;free enterprise&#x27; World Exposition, which the Federal Government rubber stamped.

With federal representation, at the December 1983 Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) General Assembly, Brisbane won the right to hold the 1988 World Exposition, as a specialised international exposition. Immediately, the Brisbane Exposition and South Bank Redevelopment Authority was formed with Sir Llewellyn Edwards, State Deputy Premier, at the helm. Maccormick later was appointed as Joint Chief Architect of the Expo, under the architectural firm Bligh Maccormick 88.

===Construction===

World Expo 88 occupied a mixed usage 40-hectare (98.8 acres) resumed (acquired/taken, as in &quot;Eminent Domain&quot;) parcel of land on the South Bank of the Brisbane River, opposite the city&#x27;s central business district. For many years this mainly industrial area had been largely derelict. Stanley Street was permanently excised between Melbourne Street and Vulture Street while Grey Street was reinstated after the showground was demolished. The creation of Expo, along with the recent construction of the Queensland Cultural Centre, helped to revive the area. Construction was coordinated by Brisbane-based Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd. 

Around 100 works of sculpture were either commissioned, purchased or borrowed for World Expo 88 at a cost of $25 million. Large sun sails were erected over the site to provide shade from the hot Queensland climate. These became an icon of the Expo, becoming an element of Expo&#x27;s sun-sails logo. Two thousand kilometres of telecommunication wire were laid during construction of the site.

A A$4.5 million 88-metre (289.37911 feet) symbolic tower for the Expo was constructed, called The Night Companion (also known as &quot;The Skyneedle&quot;), which featured a gold and copper dome black spire top, with a xenon laser beam eye that scanned the Brisbane horizons each Expo evening up to away. 

The main entry gate was the Melbourne Street gate at the northern end of the campus, located on the current Grey Street alongside South Brisbane Station. 

===Monorail===

A Von Roll MkII monorail was constructed for World Expo 88 to take visitors quickly around the Expo site. Costing A$12 million, it consisted of 2 stations at either end of the site, of track and 4 nine-carriage trains. The route included going through the Queensland Pavilion, across the Pacific Lagoon and beside the Brisbane River. The system was able to carry 44,000 passengers per day. Following Expo, one of the trains and some track joined the existing Sea World Monorail System at Sea World on the Gold Coast. The other three trains were bought back by Von Roll and are now running at the German theme park Europa-Park in Rust since 1995.

==The Fair==
A ticket to the fair allowed entry to the World Expo Park amusement park at the same location. Although originally intended to be a permanent feature, the park remained open for only one year after Expo had closed. The fair was open daily from 10am to 10pm. 

The Expo sunsails and the Expo tower Night Companion can be seen clearly here, as well as the monorail. Some of the rides of the World Expo Park can be seen in the background. The &#x27;cubistic flotilla&#x27; can be seen in the foreground.
World Expo 88 was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday, 30 April 1988 to much fanfare. The fair attracted more than 18 million visitors, including staff and VIPs, more than double the predicted 7.8 million, and was considered a turning point in the history of Brisbane, which had recently successfully hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games. With Expo 88 Queensland had transformed itself from a northern backwater into Australia&#x27;s &quot;most progressive state&quot;.

The Commissioner General for World Expo 88 was Sir Edward Williams (who was also the Chairman for the also very successful 1982 Commonwealth Games). The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the former State Government Minister Sir Llewellyn Edwards, was appointed in February 1984. The General Manager was Bob Miniken and the Entertainment Director was Ric Birch (who would soon become one of the greatest experts in Olympic ceremonies and large-scale events in the world). Landscaping at the site was done by Brisbane landscape architect Lawrie Smith. The landscaping was based on nine precincts and used more than 150,000 temperate and tropical plants.


===Pavilions===



Despite late entrants into the Exposition due to domestic political measures, World Expo 88 attracted some 100 pavilions, from 52 governments, of which 36 were from international-level, and numerous corporate participants. Major western and European nations were represented such as the United States, the Soviet Union (last representation at a World Exposition), France, West Germany (also last representation at a World Exposition), the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain and Greece, as well as major Asian countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Nepal, Pakistan, China, Japan, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and amongst others. Close neighbouring countries, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea were also represented.

State-level and multi-lateral organisations included the six Australian states, the United Nations, the European Union, Vatican City, three American states (Hawaii, California and Alaska), one Japanese prefecture (sister state of Queensland, Saitama Prefecture), and one Japanese city (Brisbane&#x27;s sister city Kobe City).

Corporate pavilions included IBM, Ford, Fujitsu, Queensland Newspapers, Australia Post, Cadbury Chocolate, Suncorp, and the Queensland Teachers Credit Union. NASA and Universal Studios hosted outdoor exhibits, with models of the Space Shuttle and Apollo program, as well as the car KITT from the TV series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. Also having its own pavilion was the official Australian TV partner of the Expo, Network Ten, via its Queensland station TVQ, whose news studios were located there for public tours and during the Expo also switched channel frequencies in September (from channel 0 to channel 10) in line with the other state channels.

The most expensive pavilion was Japan (A$26 million), followed by the Queensland Pavilion (A$20 million) and the Australia Pavilion (A$18 million). The largest Pavilions were also Queensland, followed by Australia then Japan.

High-definition television received its Australian premiere at the Japan Pavilion, and the text-based Internet at the Swiss Pavilion. At the University pavilion the world&#x27;s longest lab experiment was on display. The pitch drop experiment, which features tar pitch slowly dripping through a funnel at a rate of nine drops in 81 years, actually made an unseen drop while on display.

The most popular pavilion was New Zealand with its animated Footrot Flats show and glow worm cave followed by Australia, with its special effects &#x27;Dreamtime Theatre&#x27;; Queensland, with its popular 180-metre long people mover ride through Queensland of the present and the future; Japan with its Japan Pond and Garden and hi-tech displays; Switzerland, with its artificial snow ski slope and cable car ride; and Nepal, with its 3-level hand-crafted Nepalese Peace Pagoda.

===Architecture===
For the most part, pavilions were housed in pre-fabricated units constructed by the expo authority, with the exception of the Nepalese Peace Pagoda, of Nepal, and aspects of the Kingdom of Thailand Pavilion, amongst others. The Australia Pavilion and Queensland Pavilion, side by side, were also custom-made, with the exterior of the Australia Pavilion notably in the shape and colours of Uluru (Ayers Rock). The Queensland Pavilion was designed by Robin Gibson.

===Theming===


As well as the popular platypus mascot Expo Oz, designed by Disney&#x27;s Imagineering Division, there were several themed initiatives that promoted World Expo 88, most notably the Expo&#x27;s two interchangeable brands (as noted above): one, a boomerang-styled &#x27;88&#x27; on a wire frame globe, and the colourful sunsails logo, which superimposed aspects of the Expo&#x27;s entertainment on a relief of one of the Expo&#x27;s popular sun sails (designed by Ken Cato, of Cato Purnell Partners). There was also a new weekly theme which allowed special-interest groups to entertain.

The logos were used extensively throughout the Expo site as well as souvenirs, and a costume Expo Oz could be seen as part of the daily parades, shows, and other variety performances. Over 500 items of souvenir memorabilia were made using Expo Oz&#x27;s image. Expo Oz also featured in extensive international tours in the lead-up to the Expo, to Europe, the US and Japan.

The theme song of the Expo, &#x27;Together We&#x27;ll Show the World!&#x27; by Frank Millward and Carol Lloyd, was also an important rallying point in promoting the Expo in the lead-up to and during phases of the fair, and captured a sense of the excitement of the Expo.

The colourful theme for the Australia Pavilion, which became synonymous with the hosting of the Expo with Australia as host nation, was designed by prominent Australian artist Ken Done, and featured huge playful colourful letters making up the word Australia in an Australia Pavilion Entrance set, and Exit set, with the entrance set a stack of nine, 3x3, some 2.1 metres high each, and the exit set, in a line of nine letters, some 5.6 metres high each. These letters became a very popular photo opportunity for the Expo, and the theme was also found on the brightly coloured Australia Pavilion uniforms also.

5 heritage-listed buildings in South Brisbane were refurbished and repurposed for Expo 88. They were retained after its closure and can still be seen today: Plough Inn, Ship Inn, Central House, Collin&#x27;s Place Spaghetti House, and South Brisbane Municipal Library. The Expo House building on Sidon Street, which housed &#x27;Club 88&#x27; and administrative offices, has been incorporated into today&#x27;s Griffith University South Bank Campus. 

===Entertainment===
The $38 million entertainment program featured acts from all over Australia and the world at a variety of custom-made performance venues on the World Expo 88 site from the 10,000-seat spectacular open-air River Stage (for national day events, opening and closing ceremonies and large-scale events), the 850-seat piazza for circus, marching band, acrobatics, magic and mime, and the smaller-scale amphitheatre for national day ceremonies and laser shows. The River Stage was also the venue for the popular evening fireworks and large-scale laser show, set to music, each Expo evening at 10 pm.

Big international and Australian names were a feature at World Expo 88. Perennial Australian favourites such as Icehouse, Little River Band, Mental as Anything, The Cockroaches, Joe Camilleri and the Black Sorrows, John Farnham, Julie Anthony, Simon Gallaher, Wickety Wak and Jon English, were regular performers, as well as concerts by international artists such as Jerry Harrison (of Talking Heads), Julio Iglesias, John Denver, Donny Osmond, Cher, Phyllis Diller, and a wide variety of international theatre, opera, and classical music at the adjoining (separate ticket admission) World Expo on Stage program at the Queensland Performing Arts Complex.

The exposition averaged 100,000 visitors a day, with highest day of attendance being 184,000 visitors on 29 October 1988, the last day before the closing ceremony.

Network Ten was the official television broadcast partner for Expo 88.

At the closing ceremony of World Expo 88 at the River Stage, a concert showcased all the Expo&#x27;s entertainers singing and dancing. The concert finished up with the Australian pop-folk band, The Seekers, singing one of their songs &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; at the very end of the celebrations, in what has become an Australian tradition. As Judith Durham refused perform for the Expo &#x27;88 Closing Ceremony celebrations (due to her sentiments of what happened to the aborigines), Australian soprano Julie Anthony joined the group as the lead vocalist in her stead. During the events of the Expo&#x27;s closing ceremony, the Night Companion&#x27;s light beam was stilled. Sir Llewellyn Edwards concluded the Expo with the words &quot;With the Prime Minister, Mr Premier, my Lord Mayor, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen – as the Prime Minister indicated, the carnival is now over, Expo &#x27;88 has come to a close...Thank you for all that have contributed and may the light of World Expo 88 never really fade.&quot; .
A massive fireworks display, the longest in Australia at the time, soon followed, with a burning icon of the World Expo 88 sun sails logo set alight on the Brisbane River.

==Legacy==

===The Nepalese Peace Pagoda and South Bank Parklands===

After the end of World Expo 88, various contingency plans were mooted as to possible future developments. One proposal was for a second central business district area to be developed, however this proposal was rejected. A second proposal, incorporating extensive parklands, boutique retail, as well as low-medium residential development, was later accepted, and four years after the closure of World Expo 88, the site was reopened as South Bank Parklands, which is managed by the South Bank Corporation, a State Government corporation.

The only remaining trace of the Exposition on the former site is the Nepalese Peace Pagoda, part of the Nepalese representation, a traditional three-storey handmade wooden replica of a Pagoda in Kathmandu. The popular boardwalk eateries at the southern end of the Expo 88 site were replaced by River Quay Green and modern restaurants in 2011.

===Riverstage and the Courier Mail Piazza===
Two of the most popular performing arts venues from World Expo 88 took on a new form at the conclusion of the Expo as Riverstage (at the new venue in the City Botanic Gardens), and the Courier Mail Piazza (formerly called the Suncorp Piazza) at the South Bank Parklands. These two outdoor performing arts venues today welcome visitors to a variety of performing arts genres.

===The Skyneedle===

The Skyneedle (or &quot;Night Companion&quot;) is -high and beams light skywards with a visibility of more than during special events.

The Skyneedle, which was originally built for World Expo 88, was to be relocated to Tokyo Disneyland after the Expo. Hairdresser and local celebrity Stefan bought the rights and moved it from its original location at South Bank to his corporate headquarters in South Brisbane, where it remains a local landmark.

===Sculpture park===
During World Expo 88, the park was filled with 90 sculptures, one of the largest and most prestigious displays the country had ever hosted. Sixteen pieces were commissioned for the event, while others were on loan. Also the 88-strong white fibreglass &#x27;Human Factor&#x27; sculpture series which captured the whimsy of persons in day-to-day life, were also put up for private sale, with many of them being purchased for shopping centres and arcades. Some of the works that were for sale have been purchased by the Brisbane City Council and are on display at various places in the city today, most notably Gidon Graetz&#x27;s work &quot;Mirage&quot; in the Brisbane Arcade and American sculptor Jon Barlow Hudson&#x27;s work &quot;Morning Star II&quot; located in the City Botanic Gardens. A sectional model or maquette of Jon Barlow Hudson&#x27;s artwork &quot;Paradigm&quot; is on display outside State Library of Queensland.

One can view and take part in a Heritage Walk of some of the major works at the World Expo 88 Art Heritage trail at Celebrate 88.

===The Japan Pond and Garden===
The Japan Pond and Garden from the Japanese Government Pavilion was gifted to the City of Brisbane at the end of the Expo and was re-located to the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens.

===Australia Pavilion letters===
The colourful, large Australia Pavilion letters, designed by Australian artist Ken Done were synonymous with the success of the Expo, and were purchased by Shaftesbury Citizenship Campus at the end of the Expo, for their Burpengary Campus. The end of Expo till 2008 the letters could be viewed along the Bruce Highway near Burpengary as one approached Brisbane City, a reminder of their successful role at World Expo 88. In 2018, the letters were restored and placed at the Caboolture Historical Village.

===World Expo Park – Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre===
World Expo Park, the Expo&#x27;s theme park located adjacent to the Expo site, was intended to be a permanent legacy of the Expo at its conclusion. Citing lack of patronage, however, it closed down just a year after the Expo closed its doors. The site of World Expo Park was re-developed into the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre.

===Queensland Pavilion===
The Queensland Pavilion was purchased by the Gateway Baptist Church, and now stands on their Mackenzie premises.

===Victorian Pavilion===
The Victorian Pavilion was purchased privately and moved to 77 Shore St West, Cleveland, where it is known as Redland Trade Centre.

===Foundation===
On 30 April 2004, sixteen years after World Expo 88&#x27;s official opening, a non-government not-for-profit commemorative entity for the Exposition was launched, named Foundation Expo &#x27;88. The Foundation based its activities at the Nepalese Peace Pagoda from the Expo, including a weekly Guided Tours program &quot;Pagoda on Sundays&quot;, and hosting at the Pagoda first level a commemorative museum display of memorabilia from Expo, which is still maintained to this day. 

For the 10th Anniversary of Foundation Expo &#x27;88 in 2014, the Foundation was re-branded into one new entity &quot;Celebrate 88!&quot;.

=== Expo Gold ===
The Golden Penda tree (&quot;Xanthostemon chrysanthus)&quot; was selected as the theme plant for Expo 88. Cuttings of the tree, which is native to north Queensland, were taken from a superior form from a garden in Brisbane and planted in flower in Brisbane to create a &#x27;Sea of Gold&#x27;. In late autumn, the tree can still be seen in flower in gardens and lining streets across Brisbane. The tree is also the native floral emblem of Cairns.

=== Q150 Icon ===
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Expo 88 was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Defining Moment&quot;.

==Anniversaries==
Celebrations for the 20th anniversary were held at South Bank Parklands during May 2008. Celebrations included a charity dinner on 9 May at the Great Hall of the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, and a community day of celebration on 10 May. It featured entertainment from the Expo, fireworks, interpretive displays and themed walks, and a Suncorp Spirit of Expo Staff Breakfast, also attended by then Lord Mayor of Brisbane Sallyanne Atkinson, and Expo Chair and CEO Sir Llewellyn Edwards.

2013 saw commemorative activities which included a special retrospective exhibition on World Expo 88 entitled &quot;Light Fantastic: Expo 88 Rewired&quot;, a special family fun day at the former Expo 88 site, Southbank Parklands, where a special Plaque was also unveiled.

The Brisbane City Council arranged several initiatives to as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations. A special closing event ceremony was held at the Caboolture Historical Village, where the restored Ken Done Australia Pavilion Signs completely restored were unveiled on 28 October 2018.

<text>Przemysł II ( also given in English and Latin as &quot;Premyslas&quot; or &quot;Premislaus&quot; or in Polish as &quot;&quot;; 14 October 1257 – 8 February 1296) was the Duke of Poznań from 1257–1279, of Greater Poland from 1279 to 1296, of Kraków from 1290 to 1291, and Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia) from 1294 to 1296, and then King of Poland from 1295 until his death. After a long period of Polish high dukes and two nominal kings, he was the first to obtain the hereditary title of king, and thus to return Poland to the rank of kingdom. A member of the Greater Poland branch of the House of Piast as the only son of Duke Przemysł I and the Silesian Princess Elisabeth, he was born posthumously; for this reason he was brought up at the court of his uncle Bolesław the Pious and received his own district to rule, the Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Six years later, after the death of his uncle, he also obtained the Duchy of Kalisz.

In the first period of his government, Przemysł II was involved only in regional affairs, first in close collaboration and then competing with the Duke of Wrocław, Henryk IV Probus. This policy caused the rebellion of the prominent Zaremba family and the temporary loss of Wieluń. Working with the Archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub Świnka, he sought the unification of the principalities of the Piast dynasty. Unexpectedly, in 1290, under the will of Henryk IV Probus, he managed to obtain the Duchy of Kraków and with this the title of High Duke of Poland; however, not having sufficient support from the local nobility (who supported another member of the Piast dynasty, Władysław I the Elbow-high) and faced with the increasing threats of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, Przemysł II finally decided to retreat from Lesser Poland, which was then under the rule of Přemyslid dynasty.

In 1293, thanks to the mediation of Archbishop Jakub Świnka, he joined into a close alliance with the Kuyavian princes Władysław the Elbow-high and Casimir II of Łęczyca. This alliance was anti-Bohemian, and his goal was to recover Kraków, then in the hands of King Wenceslaus II.

After the death of Duke Mestwin II in 1294, and according to the Treaty of Kępno signed in 1282, Przemysł II inherited Pomerelia. This strengthened his position and enabled his coronation as King of Poland. The ceremony was held on 26 June 1295 in Gniezno, and was performed by his ally Archbishop Jakub Świnka. Only nine months later, on 8 February 1296, Przemysł II was murdered during a failed kidnapping attempt made by men of the Margraves of Brandenburg, with some help from the Polish noble families of Nałęcz and Zaremba.

==Birth and naming==
Przemysł II was born on 14 October 1257 in Poznań as the fifth child and only son of Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia. It is known that he was born in the morning, because according to the Chronicle of Greater Poland, when Dowager Duchess Elisabeth gave birth to a son, the vicars and canons of the city were singing morning prayers. At the news of the birth, the local clergy chanted the &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot;. Shortly after his birth, the prince was baptized by the Bishop of Poznań, Bogufał III.

According to the Chronicle of Greater Poland (&quot;Kronika wielkopolska&quot;), Przemysł II was named after his father, who had died four months before his birth, on 4 June 1257. The form of the name in the days of his contemporaries certainly sounded like &quot;Przemysł&quot; or possibly &quot;Przemyśl&quot;. However, due to the fact that the word &quot;Przemysł&quot; () means &quot;production of a good or service within an economy&quot; today, it is reasonable to be considered that his name could be a valid form from &quot;Przemysław&quot;, especially as this version is undoubtedly more medieval (occurs at the beginning of the 14th century). Another name under which the Duke of Greater Poland was probably known, following the indications of the &quot;Rocznik Kołbacki&quot;, is Peter (), but Oswald Balzer considered this an obvious mistake. The only historian who recognised the name Peter as authentic was K. Górski.

No sources about contemporary rulers provided information about a nickname. Only in sources related to the Teutonic Order from 1335 he is given the nickname &quot;Kynast&quot;. In current historiography he is sometimes nicknamed &quot;Posthumous&quot; (), but this has not been universally accepted.

==Tutelage of Bolesław the Pious (1257–1273)==

===Childhood===
At the time of is birth, Przemysł II was the nominal ruler of the Duchy of Poznań. The guardianship of the Duchy, probably along with his mother Elisabeth, was taken by his uncle Duke Bolesław the Pious and his wife, the Hungarian princess Jolenta (Helena). In consequence the prince remained at the court in Poznań, where his mother raised him. On 16 January 1265 Dowager Duchess Elisabeth died at her estate in Modrze, and the orphaned Przemysł together with his sisters were later cared for by their uncle and aunt.

Very little information exists about the education given to Przemysł II. Diplomatic sources have retained only the names of two of his teachers: Dragomir and Przybysław. It is assumed (although without any direct evidence) that the prince had some knowledge of at least Latin in speech and writing.

===Relations with Brandenburg and Neumark===
The next mention of Przemysł II came in 1272, when his uncle Duke Bolesław the Pious appointed him the nominal commander of an armed expedition against Brandenburg. The true commanders of the expedition were the Governor of Poznań, Przedpełk and the Castellan of Kalisz, Janko. The expedition was launched on 27 May; in addition to the specific purpose to acquire and destroy the newly built fortress in Strzelce Krajeńskie (or, in case it proved to be impossible, at least the desolation of Neumark). The young prince was to be educated in the art of war. The project, as detailed in the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot;, was a great success. The city of Strzelce Krajeńskie after a short, but extremely fierce battle, was defeated and captured by the Greater Poland army. According to the Chronicle, while gaining command of the fortress, Przemysł II ordered the slaughter of the defenders, and only the intervention of the polish knights saved the lives of the few survivors

Shortly after completing the expedition and with the majority of his forces in his way back, Przemysł II received a confidential message that the fortress of Drezdenko was protected by only a few German knights. The young prince, despite the fact that he only had a part of his forces, decided to make a quick attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the same fate of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.

In the same year, Przemysł II concluded his first alliance with Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. At first an ally of the Margraves of Brandenburg, Mestwin II could expel his brother and uncles from Pomerania and became sole ruler in 1271, but shortly after he was defeated and even imprisoned by them; this caused him to cede the province of Gdańsk to Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg in exchange for aid against his foes. Despite Mestwin II retaining the feudal sovereignty over the territory, the Brandenburg Margraviate still occupied the main castles and fortresses of the city even after the restoration of Mestwin II in the ducal throne. With his knowledge that his forces are too weak against Brandenburg, the Pomeranian Duke decided then to make an alliance with the Greater Poland rulers, Bolesław the Pious (who probably was his first-cousin) and Przemysł II.

The Greater Poland-Pomerania alliance ended up in regaining the fortresses in Gdańsk and the complete expulsion of the Brandenburg forces from Pomerania. Although soon after Mestwin II decided to conclude a separate peace with the Margraviate, the alliance with Greater Poland signed in 1272 remained in force. The continuous threat of Brandenburg and the uncertainty of the alliance with Mestwin II, caused that Bolesław the Pious began to seek new allies in case of war. For this purpose, Bolesław decided to seek an agreement with Duke Barnim I of Pomerania.

===First marriage===
As a part of the new alliance with Pomerania, marriage was arranged between Przemysł II and Barnim I&#x27;s granddaughter Ludgarda, daughter of Henry I the Pilgrim, Lord of Mecklenburg and Anastasia of Pomerania. Apparently, the young prince was pleased with his young bride, as stated in the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot;:

After the wedding the couple was briefly separated. Przemysł II came to Greater Poland, where together with his uncle prepared the ceremonial arrival of his wife to Poznań. Finally, together with his uncle, his aunt Jolenta, Bishop Mikołaj I of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries the prince went to the border frontier in Drezdenko, where he solemnly brought Ludgarda to her new home. The alliance between Greater Poland and Pomerania was directed against Brandenburg and in 1274, resulted in more than one retaliatory expedition against Greater Poland; taken by surprise, the princes watched how without major obstacles the Brandenburg army came to Poznań, and burned the main fortress of the city. Only after this, the Greater Poland knighthood was hastily organized and was able to expel the invaders.

==Independent Duke of Poznań (1273–1279)==

===Rebellion===
In 1273 Przemysł II became an independent Duke of Poznań. The circumstances around this event are not entirely clear. On the basis of only one known source, a document dated 1 October 1273, it appears that Przemysł II began to use the title of &quot;dux Poloniae&quot; (&quot;Duke of&quot; [Greater] &quot;Poland&quot;). A document issued on 25 August 1289, notes that the Greater Poland ruler gave the villages of Węgielnice and Łagiewnice to the major of Gniezno, Piotr Winiarczyk, in gratitude for helping him to escape from the Gniezno fortress (however, when the incident took place wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the document). In light of modern historiography, the events preceding the issue of this document could be as follows: Przemysł II, unhappy with the prolonged guardianship of his uncle, and with the support of some powerful Greater Poland magnates decided, regardless of the consequences, to assert his rights over Poznań. It is unclear at this stage whether there has been any armed incidents; in any case, the demands of Przemysł II became so insistent that they ended in his imprisonment in the Gniezno castle. It can be assumed that there wasn&#x27;t a prison in the proper sense of the word, but under house arrest, during which Przemysł II was not too rigorously guarded, since the prince was able to escape from the castle without any outside help. In a document issued to Piotr Winiarczyk, the writer used the phrase &quot;qui de nocte consurgens&quot;, which supports the assumption that the clerk was asleep and was completely surprised by the arrival of the prince. In any case, the real cause of this grant of lands given to Winiarczyk by Przemysł II apparently wasn&#x27;t sure, and probably only equipping him with sufficient means to escape.

===Alliance with Henryk Probus===
After escaping from Gniezno, Przemysł II probably went on Lower Silesia under the care of Henryk IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław. This help was evidenced by the conclusion of an alliance (in unknown date) directed against &quot;any man and Polish prince&quot; with the exception of Duke Władysław of Opole and King Ottokar II of Bohemia.

An alliance between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious in a very uncomfortable situation, because he was a member of the Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain indifferent to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).

This alliance probably forced Bolesław the Pious to reconsider his treatment of his nephew and finally granted him the Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Przemysł II, in exchange, not only interrupted for a time his cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, but decided to support his uncle in the expedition against Władysław of Opole (ally of King Ottokar II and Henryk IV Probus), in retaliation for the attempts of the Opole ruler to overthrow the government of Bolesław V the Chaste in Lesser Poland during the first half of 1273. Thus, with high probability, it can be concluded that by this time the conflict between Przemysł II and his uncle for power has been finally resolved.

Very little information exists about the rule of Przemysł II over Poznań. From the period 1273–1279, are known only four documents issued by the prince, including two issued jointly with his uncle Bolesław the Pious.

===Conflict with Bolesław the Horned===

Przemysł II&#x27;s foreign politics are more known during this time. His friendly relations with Henry IV Probus survived, despite the momentary interruption, even after 1273. This alliance was maintained without significant changes, and only as a result of the events that taken place on 18 February 1277 in the town of Jelcz near Wrocław, the Duke of Poznań was forced to explicitly stand at the side of the Wrocław ruler, his cousin. Henryk IV was kidnapped and imprisoned in the Legnica castle by his uncle, Duke Bolesław II the Horned. The pretext used by the Duke of Legnica to do this was the demands of the Duke of Wrocław over one-third of his domains, which, according to him, were part of his inheritance as legacy from both his father Henry III the White (died in 1266) and uncle Władysław (died in 1270). Bolesław used in his favor the political weakness of Henryk IV&#x27;s guardian, King Otakar II of Bohemia, who in September 1276 was forced to submit to King Rudolph I of Germany.

Przemysł II, faithful to his previous agreements with Henry IV Probus, decided to stand at the head of the knights of Poznań, Wrocław (which generally were loyal to their ruler) and Głogów (commanded by Duke Henry III) and marched to Legnica in order to obtain the freedom of Henry IV. The Legnica army was commanded by Bolesław and his eldest son Henry V the Fat. The battle took place on 24 April 1277 in the village of Stolec near Ząbkowice Śląskie, and, according to modern historiography, was extremely bloody and lasted almost the entire day. Initially it seemed that the coalition Poznań-Głogów-Wrocław would have a complete victory. The situation became even more favorable to them when Bolesław escaped from the battlefield. However, his son Henry V decided to stay until the end, and in this desperate situation encouraged his knights to fight, and finally obtain the victory; to complete the success, even Przemysł II and Henry III were taken prisoners. However, according to Jan Długosz in his chronicle, for the Dukes of Legnica this was a Pyrrhic victory, since &quot;died in this battle so countless number of people that the knights of Legnica, although the winner, they could mock the vanquished, because the bloody paid for victory&quot;. The imprisonment of the Duke of Poznań, if it occurred, was brief. The argument against this was noted in the fact that there is no record of Przemysł II having to pay for his release.

Whatever the truth was, by 5 July 1277 Przemysł II was in Lubin. The release of Henryk IV Probus took place some days later, on 22 July, after the surrender to Bolesław II of 1/5 of his Duchy, with the town of Środa Śląska at the head. Bolesław the Pious was against the participation of his nephew in this conflict; he not only refused to support him militarily but also invaded the borders of the Duchy of Wrocław, trying to assert financial claims. Moreover, at this point, he gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Henry V the Fat.

An additional reason for a quick end to this conflict among the Silesian princes was the personal intervention of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in preparation for his final confrontation with King Rudolph I of Habsburg German needed to calm the situation in Poland.

===Cooperation with Bohemia===
In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in the border city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn&#x27;t specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians speculate only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several political decisions were made during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.

The decisive battle between Ottokar II and Rudolph I took place on 25 August 1278 in the known Battle on the Marchfeld. As many 1/3 of the Czech army were supposed to be allied with the Polish troops. Przemysł II wasn&#x27;t among them, because he was then in Ląd. However this doesn&#x27;t mean that, as historians speculate, he didn&#x27;t send troops to the Bohemian King as was planned.

===Reconciliation with Bolesław the Pious===
The apparent difference of interests between Przemysł II and his uncle Bolesław the Pious in the Silesian and Czech affairs, did not disturb their good relations. Evidence of this was the common issuance of documents, such as 6 January 1278.

Another proof of the close cooperation between uncle and nephew in the last years of Bolesław the Pious&#x27; life is in the events that took place in mid-1278 (probably in August): Bolesław, using the weakness of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the fight between Ottokar II and Rudolph I, in only eight days attacked Neumark and advanced until Myślibórz, where his troops defeated Margrave Otto V the Long.

Przemysł II didn&#x27;t participate in this expedition (at least directly, according to Jan Długosz), because at that moment he was in Ląd, according to a document dated 24 August 1278. Certainly by the command of his uncle, Przemysł II acted as mediator in the dispute between Dukes Leszek II the Black and Ziemomysł of Inowrocław and his subjects.

Przemysł II was able to end the dispute between Leszek and Ziemomysł with their local nobility definitively. The Duke of Inowrocław had to agree to two conditions: firstly, in his court all the noble families would be well tolerated and respected, and secondly, he had put a distance from his German advisors. In addition Ziemomysł also have to accept the surrender of the towns of Kruszwica and Radziejów to Bolesław the Pious and Wyszogród to Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The friendly relations between Przemysł II and the Kuyavia Dukes proved to be durable and survived to the end of his reign. The expedition against Brandenburg in 1278 was the last important event in Bolesław the Pious&#x27; life. &quot;Maximus trumphator de Teutonicis&quot; (in: &quot;The highest winner on the Germans&quot;), died on 13 or 14 April 1279 in Kalisz. Without male heirs, shortly before his death he declared his nephew his only and legitimate heir and urged him to take care of his wife Jolenta-Helena and his two underage daughters, Hedwig and Anna.

==Duke of Greater Poland (1279–1290)==
===Acquisition of Greater Poland===
The inheritance of Greater Poland by Przemysł II went peacefully. The union proved to be durable, and with the exception of its borders with the Duchy of Wrocław, survived throughout his reign. However, despite the personal unification of the territory, the division between Kalisz and Gniezno persisted almost to the end of the 18th century. Later, in times of Casimir III the Great, there was also a visible division between the old voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz.

===Relations with nobility and neighbors===
An analysis of the contemporary documents showed that in the first period of his rule over all Greater Poland, Przemysł II relied on the following nobles: Jan Gerbicz, Bishop of Poznań; members of the powerful noble family of Zaremba: Andrzej, chancellor of Kalisz (since 1288 the first &quot;cancellerius tocius Polonia&quot;) and later Bishop of Poznań; Sędziwój, chamberlain of Gniezno; Beniamin, voivode of Poznań; and Arkembold, voivode of Gniezno. Other close collaborators were Wojciech Krystanowic z Lubrzy, chamberlain of Poznań; Tomisław Nałęcz, Poznań castellan; Maciej, Kalisz castellan; Stefan, Wieluń castellan, Mikołaj Łodzia, Poznań judge; Wincenty Łodzia, chancellor of Poznań; and the brothers Tylon, Jaśko and Mikołaj, three notaries of middle-class origin.

During the years 1279–1281, Przemysł II had a rather friendly (or at least neutral) relationship with all of his immediate neighbors.

===Imprisonment===
The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he was invited to a meeting organized by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who were invited (Przemysł II, Henry V the Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more outrageous by the fact that only four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III risked their lives and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry V the Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.

Finally, after brief resistance, Przemysł II was forced to give the strategic Lesser Polish land of Wieluń (also known as Ruda) in order to obtain his release, because Henry IV wanted a direct connection between Wrocław and Lesser Poland. The imprisonment of Przemysł II did not last too long, because on 3 March he was documented to have been in Poznań. Henry III and Henry V the Fat were both forced to grant much larger territorial concessions. In addition, the three Dukes agreed that upon the request of the Duke of Wrocław they would each give him military aid in the amount of thirty lancers. So this was, in practice, an act of homage.

The rapid release of Przemysł II could have been aided by the intervention of Leszek II the Black and Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The reason for the arrival of Mestwin II to Greater Poland, in addition to helping his imprisoned ally, was to settle the claims of the Teutonic Order over parts of Pomerelia and to resolve the issue of succession after his own death; from his first marriage, Mestwin II had only two daughters, Catherine and Euphemia. The situation was further complicated by the fact that Mestwin II gained the rule over all the Duchy of Pomerelia after a war against his uncles, Racibor and Sambor II, who in revenge for this willed his possessions (including Białogard and Gniew) to the Teutonic Order upon his death in 1278.

===Treaty of Kępno===
The first talks between Przemysł II and Mestwin II about the latter&#x27;s succession probably occurred around 1281, on occasion of the arrival of the Duke of Pomerelia in Greater Poland to visit the Benedictine Abbey in Lubin. Although there is no direct evidence that Przemysł II was also in the Abbey in person, the presence of Jan I of Wysokowce, Bishop of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries suggest that a compromise was then suggested. At the beginning of the next year Mestwin II again went to southern Greater Poland, in order to talk with the Papal legate Filippo di Fermo about his dispute with the Teutonic Order over the possession of the towns of Gniew and Białogard. The legate stayed in Milicz, which belonged to the Diocese of Wrocław. Due to the friendly relations of Przemysł II (and thus his ally Mestwin II) with Henry IV Probus, the Duke of Pomerania decided to stop at the frontier village of Kępno (also in the Diocese of Wrocław), and waited to hear the legate&#x27;s verdict.

In Kępno, Mestwin II probably expected the arrival of the Duke of Greater Poland. Here, on 15 February 1282, a treaty was concluded between Przemysł II and Mestwin II, which secured the future unification of Gdańsk Pomerania and Greater Poland. Witnesses in the signed document, among others, were Pomeranian Voivode Waysil, Poznań voivode Beniamin, Gniezno voivode Arkembold, Poznań judge Mikołaj, Kalisz judge Andrzej, and the Dominican friar Piotr (later Prince-Bishop of Cammin from 1296 to 1298), who was possibly responsible for writing the text. Other important dignitaries might have been present in Kępno at the time, however, they are not mentioned.

There are ongoing disputes between historians about the exact nature of the Treaty of Kępno. According to some historians (for example Balzer and Wojciechowski) the treaty was a classic pact of mutual inheritance, in which the one who survives the other inherits his territory. According to others (like Kętrzyński, Baszkiewicz, Zielinska, Nowacki and Swieżawski), it was a one-sided arrangement or donation for life from Mestwin II to Przemysł II (called &quot;donatio inter vivos&quot;). Another theory was posed by Janusz Bieniak. He believed that Mestwin II simply paid homage for his lands to the ruler of Greater Poland, who became the &quot;de jure&quot; ruler of the territory. Currently, the second theory is the most accepted, mainly because it agrees entirely with the contemporary sources. Since 1282 Przemysł II formally used the title of &quot;dux Pomeranie&quot; (Duke of Pomerania), but during Mestwin II&#x27;s life he renounced his claim to the rights over Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia).

As was customary, the treaty would have to be approved by the nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13 and 15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.

===Widowhood===
In December 1283 in Gniezno, at the age of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations between the spouses for some time before her death weren&#x27;t very good; perhaps there had even been a separation between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young at the time of their wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda&#x27;s barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman&#x27;s fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II&#x27;s second marriage), it seems more likely. It was not a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. No contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also, any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.

The first suggestion about Ludgarda&#x27;s mysterious death came from the 14th century &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot;:
The chronicler of the &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot; doesn&#x27;t suggest an unnatural death for the Duchess, but leaves some doubts about it. The &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot;, by the other hand, spoke clearly about Ludgarda&#x27;s murder in the Szamotuły code, in which added further information about this event:

Another source that describes the death of Ludgarda is the &quot;Kronika oliwska&quot;, written in the mid-14th century by Abbot Stanisław. On the pages of his work, the author clearly showed aversion towards the Samborid dynasty, rulers of Pomerelia until the end of the 13th century. This aversion is also transferred to Przemysł II:

It is unknown why the Margraves of Brandenburg would avenge the murder of Ludgarda, since this could place them in a dangerous position, considering their alliance with Pomerelia-Greater Poland. The reports of the &quot;Kronika oliwska&quot; were repeated in Mecklenburg by chronicler Ernst von Kirchberg, a wandering bard from Thuringia, who around 1378 appears at the court of Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg (Ludgarda&#x27;s nephew) on occasion to his wedding. Shortly after von Kirchberg wanted to show his thanks for the Duke&#x27;s hospitality and wrote a long rhyming poem, in which he also mentions Ludgarda. The story of the chronicler was as follows: Przemysł II, at the instigation of his mother Elizabeth of Wrocław (who is well known had died in 1265, a long time before the marriage of her son) asked his wife for a divorce and return her to Mecklenburg. In view of her refusal because &quot;What God has joined, men must not divide&quot;, Przemysł II decided her imprisonment in the tower, where he tried to persuade her again to accept a divorce. Finally, due to her obstinacy, Przemysł II killed her with his own dagger. In this event he was helped by one of his ministers, who finished the deed by suffocating a dying Ludgarda with a towel.

The last important source for the history of Ludgarda are Annals of Jan Długosz, who wrote about this events almost two centuries after (around 1480). Długosz was the first chronicler who locates Poznań as the place of Ludgarda&#x27;s death. Besides, he established her date of death on 14 December, who is corroborated by contemporary sources as a date of her burial. Modern historiography generally supports the complete innocence of Przemysł II in the sudden death of his wife.

Based on the findings of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn&#x27;t successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn&#x27;t be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II&#x27;s growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II&#x27;s court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th-century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke&#x27;s rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.

===Archbishopric of Gniezno===

On 18 December 1283, a few days after Ludgarda&#x27;s funeral, Greater Poland witnessed an extremely important event for later history of Poland: the consecration of Jakub Świnka as Archbishop of Gniezno. The event took place in the Franciscan church in Kalisz and was extremely important because after twelve years (since the death in 1271 of Archbishop Janusz Tarnowa) Poland wasn&#x27;t a full-recognized prelate. Jakub Świnka received the papal nomination on 30 July 1283, however, because he was only a deacon, it was necessary to ordain him. This ceremony took place on 18 December and a day later Jakub received the episcopal consecration. The ceremony, according to sources, was assisted by five Polish bishops and Przemysł II, who gave the new archbishop an expensive ring as a gift.

Little is known about the origin and early years of Jakub Świnka, except for his mention in a document issued by Bolesław the Pious. As Archbishop of Gniezno, the cooperation between him and Przemysł II was excellent. One example of this was the fact that he appeared as witness in 14 diplomats issued by the Duke of Greater Poland, including the confirmation of all his existing privileges and the permission to mint his own coins in Żnin and the castellany of Ląd.

===War against Western Pomerania===
In the first half of 1284 Przemysł II was involved on the side of Denmark and Brandenburg in an armed conflict against Western Pomerania and Rügen. Details about this event are limited, and the peace, which was concluded on 13 August, didn&#x27;t bring any real benefits to Greater Poland.

Much more positive effects would arise from Przemysł II&#x27;s friendly relations with Leszek II the Black, Duke of Kraków; they had a meeting in Sieradz on 20 February 1284. Details about the reason and talks of this relationship are unknown, but they would be productive, since Przemysł II decided to give the Kraków voivode Żegota three villages (Nieczajno, Wierzbiczany and Lulin). This good relations were maintained for some time, since seven months later, on 6 September, the Duke of Greater Poland mediated in a dispute between Leszek II the Black and his brother Casimir II of Łęczyca with the Teutonic Order. Przemysł II also didn&#x27;t lose sight of the Pomerelian affairs, because on 13 September he had a new meeting with Mestwin II in the city of Nakło.

===Betrayal of Sędziwój Zaremba===
According to the &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot; (based probably in older sources now missing), on 28 September 1284, Kalisz was burned. This soon caused a series of events which threatened the power of Przemysł II. Now governor of Kalisz and in the city at the time of the fire, Sędziwój Zaremba, fearing the consequences, decided to take the Kalisz castle (apparently not damaged in the fire) and give it to Henry IV Probus. At the news of the events of Kalisz, Przemysł II reacted instantly. No later than 6 October, as attested by a document issued in that time, Przemysł II was at the head of the Greater Poland knights under the city walls. In view of the refusal of submission, the duke ordered the siege. It is unknown how prolonged this siege was, but certainly soon due to the reluctance to fight from the rebels (knights and nobles probably feared that Przemysł II, after the capture of the castle, would not spare nobody), the duke agreed to negotiate with them. Eventually, Przemysł II regained his castle of Kalisz, but he had to give the newly built castle in Ołobok to Henryk IV Probus. There is no certainty that the betrayal of Sędziwój Zaremba was an isolated incident or part of a wider conspiracy from the Zaremba family. However, it can be assumed that the duke didn&#x27;t believe in a familiar conspiracy because most of Sędziwój&#x27;s relatives remained in their posts even after 1284. Another source supporting this is a document issued on 6 October (and thus during the period of siege) where the voivode of Poznań Beniamin Zaremba appears as a witness, and therefore had to remain in the inner circle of Przemysł II.

Przemysł II&#x27;s change of attitude against Beniamin occurred in 1285. Due to little contemporary information, the cause is unknown. The &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot; only pointed that the Duke of Greater Poland imprisoned both Sędziwój and Beniamin. At the end apparently they were treated very gently, because Mestwin II of Pomerelia not only restored them their previous post but also part of the property that was confiscated them. Moreover, Beniamin appeared again in the circle of Przemysł II around 1286.

===Second marriage===
In 1285 Przemysł II decided to remarry. The chosen bride was Richeza, daughter of the deposed King Valdemar of Sweden and granddaughter of King Eric IV of Denmark. Due to the lack of contacts between Greater Poland and Sweden, the negotiations were probably concluded through the mediation of the House of Ascania. The marriage by proxy took place in the Swedish city of Nyköping on 11 October 1285; in the ceremony, the Duke of Greater Poland was represented by the notary Tylon, who received from Przemysł II the village of Giecz in gratitude for his services. It is unknown when and where the formal wedding between Przemysł II and Rikissa took place, or who administered the sacrament of marriage: it could be either Bishop Jan of Poznań or Jakub Świnka, Archbishop of Gniezno.

===Congresses of Łęczyca and Sulejów===
The year 1285 brought to Przemysł II other successes: in January, Archbishop Jakub of Gniezno convened a meeting in the town of Łęczyca, where the excommunication of the main opponent of the Greater Poland ruler, Henryk IV Probus was confirmed; On 15 August Przemysł II had another princely meeting, this time with Władysław I the Elbow-high and Ziemomysł of Inowrocław in the town of Sulejów, where the rebellion against Leszek II the Black and his deposition in favor of Konrad II of Czersk was probably discussed.

In May 1286 after the death of the Bishop of Poznań Jan Wyszkowic, his successor Jan Gerbicz was consecrated. The cooperation between the new bishop and Przemysł II was good, although some historians wonder why Bishop Gerbicz later was surnamed &quot;traditor&quot; (&quot;traitor&quot;).

===Alliance between Greater Poland, Pomerelia and Western Pomerania===
According to Jan Długosz, on 14 June 1287 some Greater Poland knights and (as was suggested by the chronicler), without the knowledge of his ruler, made a surprise attack to Ołobok, won the castle and returned the district to Greater Poland. Henryk IV Probus decided to not respond with any armed conflict and accepted the loss; in unknown circumstances, around this time Przemysł II also regained Wieluń (lost in 1281). It can be assumed that the attitude of the Duke of Wrocław was part of the concessions associated with his plans to obtain the throne of Kraków, and wanted in this way to ensure that benevolent neutrality of the Duke of Greater Poland.

Some months later, on 23 November in the city of Słupsk a meeting took place between Przemysł II, Mestwin II of Pomerelia and Bogislaw IV of Pomerania. There, they entered into and agreement of mutual cooperation and help against any opponent, especially the rulers of Brandenburg and Vitslav II, Prince of Rügen. The agreement also guaranteed the inheritance of Gdańsk by Bogislaw IV or his descendants in the case of the deaths of both Mestwin II and Przemysł II. In addition, this treaty contributed to a significant deterioration of the relations between Greater Poland and the House of Ascania, rulers of Brandenburg. The treaty was subsequently confirmed at a meeting in Nakło in August 1291.

===Coalition and fatherhood===
According to the theory of historian Oswald Balzer, around 1287 and by inspiration of Archbishop Jakub of Gniezno, treaty of mutual inheritance was agreed on between Leszek II the Black, Henryk IV Probus, Przemysł II and Henry III of Głogów. Balzer&#x27;s theory gained immense popularity among historians. This view is refuted by Władysław Karasiewicz and Jan Baszkiewicz. However, doesn&#x27;t completely exclude the possibility that during this period an agreement could have been concluded between Przemysł II and Henryk IV Probus, evidenced by the fact that the Duke of Wrocław voluntary returned of lands Ołobock and Wieluń to Przemysł II in his will.

On 14 May 1288 at the Congress of Rzepce the alliance between Przemysł II and Mestwin II was further strengthened. In July, the Duke of Greater Poland visited the seriously ill Leszek II the Black in Kraków. The matters discussed in this visit are unknown.

The first and only child of Przemysł II was born in Poznań on 1 September 1288: a daughter, named Richeza, who later became queen of Bohemia and Poland as the wife of Wenceslaus II and after his death, of Rudolph I. The news of the birth of her daughter were also the latest information about Duchess Richeza. She certainly died after that date and before 13 April 1293, when Przemysł II entered into his third and last marriage. It seems that Przemysł II had deep and strong feelings for his second wife. This is evidenced not only by the fact that he give their daughter the name of the mother, but also by a document issued on 19 April 1293 where he ceded to the Bishopric of Poznań the village of Kobylniki as payment for a lamp lit eternally at his second wife&#x27;s tomb.

===Death of Leszek the Black===
On 30 September 1288 Leszek II the Black, Duke of Kraków, Sandomierz, and Sieradz, died childless . His death launched the outbreak of war in Lesser Poland. The Kraków knighthood were in favor of Bolesław II of Płock, while the Sandomierz knighthood supported his brother Konrad II of Czersk; on the other hand, the middle-class citizenry favored Henryk IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław.

At the beginning of 1289, Silesian troops marched under the command of the Duke of Wrocław and his allies Bolko I of Opole and Przemko of Ścinawa. They also counted on the support of Sulk the Bear (pl: &quot;Sułk z Niedźwiedzia&quot;), the castellan of Kraków, who had control over Wawel castle. In response, a coalition against them was formed by Bolesław II of Płock, Casimir II of Łęczyca, and Władysław I the Elbow-high. Surprisingly, Przemysł II joined with them, thus ending all of his prior arrangements with the Duke of Wrocław.

The Wrocław-Opole-Ścinawa army realized that they had insufficient forces to resist the coalition of Greater Poland-Kuyavia-Masovia, and decided to retreat to Silesia, where they would gather more troops. The retreating troops were quickly followed and a bloody battle took place in the town of Siewierz in Bytom on 26 February 1289, culminating in a full victory for Przemysł II and his allies. In this battle Przemko of Ścinawa was killed and Bolko I of Opole was captured. After the battle Władysław I the Elbow-high took Kraków, and Przemysł II withdrew with his troops, making a separate truce with Henryk IV Probus. However, later in 1289, Henryk IV Probus took up arms against Kraków, removing Władysław I the Elbow-high to the government of Sandomierz. This event was considered as temporary, because both Henryk IV Probus and Władysław I the Elbow-high continued to use the title of Duke of Kraków and Sandomierz.

==Rise to kingship (1290–1295)==

===Acquisition of Kraków===
Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław and Kraków, died on 23 June 1290, probably poisoned. Because he died childless, in his will he bequeathed the Duchy of Wrocław to Henry III of Głogów, and Kraków – with the title of high duke and thus the overlordship over Poland – to Przemysł II. In addition, he returned Kłodzko to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and also gave the Duchy of Nysa–Otmuchów to the Bishopric of Wrocław as a perpetual fief with full sovereignty.

These latter dispositions were not surprising, since they were compatible with the most recent political stance of Henryk IV. However, the inheritance of Kraków and Sandomierz by Przemysł II, one of his closest male relatives, caused considerable surprise among historians. In historiography, there are several theories to explain the decision of the Duke of Wrocław. Recently it has been assumed that Archbishop Jakub of Gniezno was behind this testament, because he was in Wrocław on 17 June 1290, a few days before the death of Henryk IV. In accordance with custom, Przemysł II had to pay some religious dispositions from Henryk IV: the transfer to Kraków Cathedral of 100 pieces of fine gold and devotion to the implementation of ornaments and liturgical books to the Tyniec monastery.

Przemysł II was probably informed very quickly about the death of the Duke of Wrocław. Due to the lack of documents, the first time he appeared with the title of Duke of Kraków was in a diploma issued on 25 July 1290. Przemysł II never used the title of Duke of Sandomierz in any of his documents, despite having full rights over this land under the will of Henryk IV Probus. This is because he did not have possession of it: Władysław I the Elbow-high, in fact, had conquered the land shortly before Henryk IV&#x27;s death.

In Lesser Poland, Przemysł II adopted the crowned eagle – which was used previously by Henryk IV Probus – as his emblem; his previous emblem, inherited from both his father and uncle, was a climbing lion.

It is unknown exactly when Przemysł II went to Kraków to assume control, as on 24 April 1290 he was still in Gniezno. Two months later he issued a document in Kraków, where he initially supported and confirmed the power of the local elite (with castellan Żegota, chancellor Prokop, voivode Mikołaj, and treasurer Florian, among others), the clergy (including Paweł of Przemankowo, the Bishop of Kraków, who in another document issued on 12 September 1290 was given the right to collect tithes from the local income), and middle-class people.

===Relations with Władysław the Elbow-high===
There is no certainty about the political relations between Przemysł II and Władysław I the Elbow-high, especially regarding who was the real ruler over the Duchy of Sandomierz. The fact that Przemysł II did not use the title &quot;Duke of Sandomierz&quot; supports the thesis that both competitors accepted the Elbow-high&#x27;s authority and formal possession over that land, without precluding the possibility of minor clashes.

It is also noted that Przemysł II appointed officials only in Kraków and the surrounding areas (Wieliczka and Miechów). This probably indicated that the real power of the Duke of Greater Poland was confined to the city and nearby towns. The other territories were probably held by Władysław I the Elbow-high.

===Resignation of Lesser Poland===
Przemysł II left Kraków, capital of Lesser Poland, between 12 September and 23 October 1290. He never returned. Leaving Wawel castle, he took with him the royal crown and regalia that had been kept in the cathedral since the times of Bolesław II the Generous. At this point he was already planning his own royal coronation.

Meanwhile, the pretensions of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia over Lesser Poland became more evident. His claims were supported by the donation made for his maternal aunt, Gryfina (also named Agrippina) of Halych (widow of Leszek II the Black) and the investiture given to him by King Rudolph I of Germany. Both documents had no significance under Polish law; however, his military power, wealth and the cultural proximity with the Kingdom of Bohemia made Wenceslaus II a widely accepted candidate in Lesser Poland. Przemysł II thus had two choices: a military confrontation (in which he had no chance due to the predominance of the Bohemian army), or political discussions.

On 14 October 1290, Archbishop Jakub Świnka inaugurated a provincial synod in Gniezno, assisted by Jan Gerbicz, Bishop of Poznań; Tomasz Tomka, Bishop of Płock; Wisław, Bishop of Kujawy; and Konrad, Bishop of Lebus (Lubusz). In addition to the Bishops, Przemysł II and Mestwin II of Pomerelia also assisted at the Synod. It was probably in this meeting that the Duke of Greater Poland decided to abandon his rights over Lesser Poland to Wenceslaus II in exchange for a monetary compensation.

It is not known exactly when the negotiations began between Przemysł II and Wenceslaus II. They certainly ended between 6 January (the last time when Przemysł II used the title of Duke of Kraków in a document) and 10 April 1291 (the first time when Wenceslaus II used this title in charters). In addition, it is also known that by mid-April Bohemian troops led by Bishop Arnold of Bamberg were already at Wawel castle.

===Alliance with Henry III of Głogów===
The loss of Lesser Poland did not prevent Przemysł II from actively participating in national politics. In the early 1290s (probably shortly after the death of Henryk IV Probus), he entered in a close alliance with Henry III of Głogów. Details of this treaty are not preserved, and the only historic knowledge of this matter derives from a document issued by Władysław I the Elbow-high in Krzywiń on 10 March 1296, in which he emphasizes that Henry III had good rights over Greater Poland. Rejected the idea of kinship (who the Elbow-high could claim due to his marriage to Hedwig of Kalisz), it seems justified the view that in the early 1290s (certainly before January 1293, when Przemysł II became involved with the Elbow-high) a treaty was signed in which the ruler of Greater Poland give rights of succession to the Duke of Głogów.

===Congress of Kalisz===
In January 1293, political talks occurred in Kalisz between Przemysł II, Władysław I the Elbow-high, and his brother Casimir II of Łęczyca. Details about the conversations are unknown; however two documents survive in which the succession of the throne of Kraków (although only theoretical, because the Duchy was in the hands of Wenceslaus II) would be in the following order: first Przemysł II, then the Elbow-High, and finally Casimir II of Łęczyca. In addition, they promised to help each other in the recovery of this land by any one of them and annually pay 300 pieces of fine silver to the Archbishop of Gniezno, with the obligation to duplicate the amount during the first two years. Conversations in Kalisz were certainly sensitive, and the initiator was without doubt Archbishop Jakub Świnka. The main motivation was probably to reinforce the anti-Bohemian coalition, in which the allies undertook to help each other. Przemysł II also named the Elbow-high as his successor in Greater Poland in the case of his death without male heirs (although it is possible that, as in the case of Henry III of Głogów, they signed a treaty of mutual inheritance). In spite of the arrangements there are no known actions by the coalition. Casimir II of Łęczyca died on 10 June 1294 in the Battle of Trojanów against Lithuania.

At the Congress of Kalisz, the marriage between Władysław I the Elbow-high and Hedwig of Kalisz, Przemysł II&#x27;s cousin and daughter of Bolesław the Pious, was probably arranged (and possibly performed).

===Third marriage===
Around the time of the Congress of Kalisz, Przemysł II decided to remarry, as his beloved wife Richeza was certainly dead by that time (probably the year before). The chosen bride was Margaret, daughter of Albert III, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel and Matilda of Denmark, daughter of King Christopher I. This marriage was concluded for political reasons and was expected to secure the succession of Przemysł II in Pomerelia. Due to the relatively close relationship between the Duke and his bride (they are both great-grandchildren of King Ottokar I of Bohemia), a papal dispensation was needed for the marriage. The wedding ceremony took place shortly before 13 April 1293; according to some historians, it was probably on this occasion that the betrothal between Przemysł II&#x27;s daughter Ryksa and Otto of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, Margaret&#x27;s brother, was also celebrated.

===Acquisition of Pomerelia===
In spring of 1294, Mestwin II of Pomerelia paid a visit to Przemysł II. In turn, the Duke of Greater Poland was in Pomerelia on 15 June, where he approved documents with Mestwin II in Słupsk. By 30 June Przemysł II was again in Greater Poland.

The deteriorating health of Mestwin II forced Przemysł II to make another visit to Pomerelia in autumn. It is unknown if he was present when Mestwin II died on 25 December 1294 in Gdańsk; however, there is no doubt that Przemysł II took part in his funeral. The last Duke of Pomerelia from the Samborides was buried in the Cistercian monastery in Oliwa.

After inheriting Pomerelia, Przemysł II adopted the new title of &quot;dux Polonie et Pomoranie&quot;. He remained in Gdańsk Pomerelia until the beginning of April, but by 10 April he was in Poznań.

==King of Poland (1295–1296)==

===Coronation===
The unification of Greater Poland and Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia) definitely made Przemysł II the strongest Piast ruler. Already by 1290, and with the help of Archbishop Jakub of Gniezno, duke began to prepare his coronation, earlier unsuccessfully pursued by Henryk IV Probus, the preliminary step for the unification of Poland.

Due to the occupation of Lesser Poland by Wenceslaus II, the Duke of Greater Poland had to postpone his plans until 1294. Only with the death of Mestwin II – an event which increased considerably his power among the Piasts rulers – Przemysł II, together with Archbishop Jakub, took the decisive decision for a coronation.

The coronation of Przemysł II and his wife Margaret took place at Gniezno Cathedral on Sunday 26 June 1295, the day of Saints John and Paul. It is unknown why it took place as a simple coronation ceremony (&quot;ordinis cororandi&quot;) despite it was the first Polish coronation in 219 years. Besides Archbishop Jakub of Gniezno, the other main representants of church hierarchy who participated in the ceremony were: Bishops Konrad of Lubusz, Jan II of Poznań, Wisław of Włocławek and Gedko II of Płock. From the Polish episcopate, Bishops Johann III Romka of Wrocław and Jan Muskata of Kraków were possibly either present in person or sent their consents. Historians generally agree with the above list of Bishops who participated in the coronation. Certainly are some doubts about the presence of Bishop Konrad of Lubusz, who on 18 June was in Prague. However, as was noted by Kazimierz Tymieniecki, he could be able to make the travel to Gniezno for the coronation. There is no information about the secular witnesses of the coronation; certainly many dignitaries from both Greater Poland and Pomerelia must have arrived. Similarly, no sources point to the presence of other Piasts rulers in the ceremony.

The consent of Pope Boniface VIII wasn&#x27;t necessary, because due to the earlier coronations Poland was already a Kingdom. Contemporary sources do not definitively confirm that Przemysł II and Archbishop obtained the approval of the Holy See for the coronation. Only the &quot;Kronika oliwska&quot; and the &quot;Kronika zbrasławska&quot; stated that the coronation took place with such consent.

If there was an explicit approval, it could influence the later effort of Władysław the Elbow-high to obtain the Pope&#x27;s permission for his own coronation; the coronation in 1320 took however place in very different circumstances, because Władysław had a competitor to the throne in the person of King John of Bohemia and the Papacy was then strongly influenced by the French court. In 1295 the Papacy was an independent entity and the Polish episcopate could more calmly await the expected protests from Wenceslaus II.

Regardless of whether Przemysł II has obtained the consent of the Pope or not, the legality of his coronation was not questioned by his contemporaries. Even the Czech &quot;Kronika zbrasławska&quot; did not deny the royal title of the Duke of Greater Poland, although it called him &quot;King of Kalisz&quot;. Finally, Wenceslaus II restricted his actions only to diplomatic protests to both Przemysł II (where he tried to persuade him to give up the crown) and the Papal Curia.

The coronation of Przemysł II gave rise to a dispute between historians about the extent of his kingdom. Stanisław Kutrzeba pointed that Przemysł II, in fact, was crowned &quot;King of Greater Poland&quot;. This theory caused a lively discussion, which to this day doesn&#x27;t give a clear answer about the monarchical status of Przemysł II. It could be expected however that Przemysł II wanted to revive through the coronation the old Kingdom of Poland, which also agrees with the inscription on the post-coronation seal &quot;Reddidit ipse pronis victricia signa Polonis&quot;, although in reality Przemysł II was politically limited to Greater Poland and Gdańsk Pomerania.

===Royal government and assassination===
After the coronation, Przemysł II went to Pomerelia and came to Słupsk On 30 July, where he confirmed the privileges of the Cistercian monasteries in Oliwa and Żarnowiec. He then visited other major cities: Gdańsk, Tczew and Świecie. In August 1295 he returned to Greater Poland but in October he was again in Gdańsk. This demonstrates how important the Duchy of Pomerelia was for Przemysł II.

Taking into account the fact that these events took place in the 13th century, the sources that stated any details concerning Przemysł II&#x27;s death are dubious; the &quot;Kronika wielkopolska&quot; failed to mention the events in Rogoźno.

Sources are divided about who are the perpetrators of the murder of the Polish King: the margraves of Brandenburg, some Polish families (the Nałęczs or Zarembas or the two families at the same time), and finally attempts to reconcile the two theories.

One of the first sources who must be taken into account was the almost contemporary &quot;Rocznik kapituły poznańskiej&quot;. The records shows that the margraves of Brandenburg, Otto V, another Otto (perhaps Otto IV), and John IV, nephew of Przemysł II (as son of his oldest sister Constance), sent an army who arrived in the dawn on 8 February 1296 to the town of Rogoźno, where the King spent the Carnival to kidnap him. However, because he showed strong resistance and was wounded, the men, unable to take him injured to Brandenburg, finally killed him. The motive for the crime was the hatred of the margraves toward the Polish King because of his coronation.

The murder of King Przemysł II by men of the margraves of Brandenburg was also supported by the &quot;Kronika oliwska&quot; (Chronicle of Oliva), which stipulates that after the coronation:

With high probability it is assumed that the first part of this information, was translated from the &quot;Liber Mortuorum Monasterii Oliviensis&quot; by the author of the &quot;Kronika oliwska&quot;, Abbot Stanisław, and the message about the motives of the murder as a revenge for Ludgarda&#x27;s death is the result of a latter addition of the Abbot. This passage established the main indication that Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg was guilty of the crime; however, during the tragic events he could not have participated because in 1296 he had less than 15 years old. Waldemar certainly gained notoriety only around 1308, after his failed attempt to seize Pomerania.

Another earlier source who wrote about the death of Przemysł II at the hands of Brandenburg, was the &quot;Rocznik kołbacki&quot; of the Cistercian monastery in Kołbacz on Western Pomerania. The brief information is valuable primarily because it was the only one who named the direct perpetrator of the crime, a man named Jakub Kaszuba. The problem is that nothing certain about him was found in other sources, and besides, the name of Piotr, under what is known Przemysł II in the chronicle, raises big surprise. Most likely this is a mistake of the author.

Finally, another source who accused the margraves of Brandenburg was the relative later Chronicle of Henry of Hertford, which although written during the mid-14th century, was reliable enough because was from Germany (and therefore unsuspected of being partial). There he stated that Przemysł II died during a war between Brandenburg and Greater Poland. Another German chronicler, who unequivocally accused the House of Ascania was Dietmar of Lübeck, which also pointed out that Przemysł II&#x27;s wife Margaret took part in the conspiracy which killed him, due to her family relations. It is unknown whether the chronicler found this information, from earlier sources or deduced it based on the simple relationship: because Margaret came from the family accused of the murder, she had to participate.

There are a number of sources, both Polish and foreign, who accused some Polish noble families as perpetrators of the crime. Among the Polish sources who established this fact are: the &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot; in the Szamotuły codec, the &quot;Rocznik Sędziwoja&quot; and the &quot;Kronika książąt polskich&quot;. The priority should be given to the nearest chronologically &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot;. Extremely important is also the testimony of Jan Łodzia, Bishop of Poznań during the Polish-Teutonic War of 1339, because it came from a person who participated in the political life of Greater Poland of those times.

The foreign sources who described the crime and pointed the culprits are: the &quot;Annales Toruniensis&quot; (date from the early 15th century), the &quot;Kronika zbrasławska&quot; (dated from the 14th century) and the , who was written in the first half of the 14th century. From the above-mentioned chronicles (from Lesser Poland, Bohemian and Kievan Rus&#x27; provenance), the main perpetrators in the King&#x27;s death were Greater Poland noble families. These families have been identified as either the Zarembas (according to the &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot;) or the Nałęczs with the help of the Zarembas (according to the ).

Finally, a third group of sources accused both the margraves of Brandenburg and the Polish noble families of the murder; for example the &quot;Rocznik świętokrzyski nowy&quot;. Almost identical information was shown in the &quot;Katalog biskupów krakowskich&quot;, dated from the 15th century; however, there is an addition which also indicated that Wenceslaus II and a group of unnamed Polish princes are involved in the crime. It is unknown whether the author mentioned the involvement of Wenceslaus II as a simple deduction: because he had the greatest benefit for this crime, he must be the perpetrator. Finally, Jan Długosz indicated that the Zaremba and Nałęcz families, with the help of some &quot;Saxons&quot;, are the perpetrators of the crime, a fact also reported by Marcin Bielski and Marcin Kromer.

8 February 1296 is widely recognized as the date of the crime. In fact, it appears in the &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot;, &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot;, , &quot;Kalendarz włocławski&quot; and the &quot;Liber mortuorum monasterii Oliviensis&quot;. The dates given by the &quot;Rocznik kapituły poznańskiej&quot; (6 February) and the &quot;Nekrolog lubiński&quot; (4 February), as well the reports of Jan Długosz are considered erroneous.

As for the place of death, historians considers accurate the versions of the &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot; (&quot;prope oppidum Rogoszno&quot;) or the &quot;Rocznik Sędziwoja&quot; (&quot;ante Rogoszno&quot;), who stated that Przemysł II was killed near Rogoźno.

The body of 39-year-old Przemysł II was buried in the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Poznań, according to the &quot;Rocznik kapituły poznańskiej&quot;. The funeral was presided by Bishop Jan. Crowds of nobles, clergy, knights and common citizens took part in the procession.

===Reconstruction of the murder===

The death of Przemysł II as a result of a failed kidnapping attempt was a matter of interest between historians. Circumstances of the death of the last of the Piast Greater Poland line was specifically studied by Karol Górski, Kazimierz Jasiński, Zygmunt Boras, Bronisław Nowacki and Edward Rymar. The importance in Polish history of the death of Przemysł II was also relevant in the works of Władysław Karasiewicz and Jan Pakulski, due to the role of the Nałęcz and Zaremba families.

In 1295 the King spent Christmas in Gniezno, where he met with Władysław I the Elbow-high. The reason for this meeting is unknown. Probably the possibility of the recovery of Lesser Poland was discussed, as was the defeat of Brandenburg. In any case, these conversations could be shown as a threat by the Brandenburg Margraves, who still are anxiously watching the inheritance of Pomerelia by Przemysł II after Mestwin II&#x27;s death and his royal coronation. But the main concern of the House of Ascania was obvious to all: the union of the Kingdom of Poland, and that sooner or later Przemysł II would claim the lands seized by the Margraves in Greater Poland.

After 25 January 1296 the King left his capital, and surely by 3 February he was in Pyzdry. For the last days of the Carnival (between 4–7 February) Przemysł II decided to spend these festivities in the town of Rogoźno.

Leaving Pyzdry, the King certainly didn&#x27;t think that about only 30 km away, in the Brandenburg town of Brzezina are staying the two brothers Margraves Otto IV &quot;with the Arrow&quot; and Conrad, and the sons of the latter: Otto VII, John IV and probably also the youngest, Waldemar. They were carefully informed by traitors from Przemysł II&#x27;s inner circle about the King&#x27;s itinerary for the next few days.

In the meanwhile, Przemysł II participated in the traditional tournaments and religious services of the Carnival. The security guard of the King became weaker, especially since probably 8 February. On that day began the forty days of Lent, and before heading out again the entourage wanted to rest.

The plan of kidnap the King by the Margraves of Brandenburg was widely detailed by the &quot;Roczniki małopolski&quot;. They probably wanted to obtain from Przemysł II the resignation of Pomerelia and with this, his plans for the unification of Polish Kingdom. The contingent was probably consisted of dozens of people, because made the kidnapping in hostile territory require adequate preparation. Direct command of the army was entrusted, according to the &quot;Rocznik kołbacki&quot; to certain Jakub, who was identified by Edward Rymar as Jakub Guntersberg (Jakub Kaszuba).

Although the personal participation of the Margraves in the kidnapping was stated in the &quot;Rocznik kapituły poznańskie&quot; and the chronicle of Jan Długosz, this fact seems unlikely, because they would not risk their lives, with no certainty of success. In any case, an army of a few dozen men set off in the evening on 7 February (probably after sunset), by the shortest route through Noteć to the place where Przemysł II stayed. As was stated by Karol Górski, the sunset of 7 February (or properly 30 January, if we taken into account the subsequent calendar reform) occurred at 16:48, and the sunrise had come about 7:38, which gave fourteen hours to the army to quietly reach to their target.

The attack took place early in the morning of 8 February, on Ash Wednesday, when the bodyguards of the King were in a deep sleep. Despite this, they were able to organize a defense under the personal guidance of the King, but the attackers were too numerous to overcome. The primary objective of Jakub Kaszuba&#x27;s people was the capture of Przemysł II; they succeeded only after the King, covered with numerous wounds, fell to the ground. The Brandenburg army seriously wounded his horse to flee towards the border with Silesia (probably with the intention to confuse the Polish army). Soon, the kidnappers realized that they weren&#x27;t able to bring alive the King, and the prisoner only delays their escape. Then decided the murder of the King, a deed personally made by Kaszuba. A late tradition says that the murder took place probably in the village of Sierniki, about 6.5 km east from Rogoźno. The King&#x27;s body was abandoned on the road, where was found by the knights involved in the persecution. The place where the crime was committed and his body was found (pl: &quot;porąbania&quot;) was traditionally named &quot;Porąblic&quot;. The assassins were never caught.

Thus, there is much convincing evidence for the participation of the Margraves of Brandenburg in the murder. According to Kazimierz Jasiński, that efficient action wasn&#x27;t possible without the participation of people who was close to Przemysł II. Historians are divided about what of two noble families, Nałęcz or Zaremba, participated in this event. The Zarembas are more suspect based on the writings of the &quot;Rocznik małopolski&quot;:; the rebellion of 1284, certainly caused a deterioration in their relations with the King. About the Nałęcz family, there is no accusation against them in the &quot;Rocznik świętokrzyskiego nowy&quot; or in the chronicle of Długosz; in fact, modern historiography writes about the friendly relationship of Przemysł II with the Grzymała and Łodzia families, and also with the Nałęcz.

==Aftermath==
Although the death of Przemysł II, last male member of the Piast Greater Poland line, certainly surprised his neighbors (including Brandenburg, whose purpose was to kidnap the king, not his murder), it caused the rapid intervention of all the forces who wanted to seize power in his domains. Probably even in February, and by March, Greater Poland was in the middle of a confrontation between Władysław I the Elbow-high (supported by Bolesław II of Płock) and Henry III of Głogów (with the help of Bolko I of Opole).

The war, if it really took place, didn&#x27;t last long, because on 10 March 1296 in Krzywiń an armistice was signed. Under the agreement, the Elbow-high accepted the rights of the Duke of Głogów over Greater Poland, following the terms of his previous treaty with Przemysł II. In addition the Duke of Kujawy adopted Henry III&#x27;s eldest son Henry as his heir, while ensuring that at the moment of his majority the Elbow-high would provide him with the Duchy of Poznań.

It&#x27;s not known why Władysław I the Elbow-high considered that Henry III of Głogów had better rights to Greater Poland than him. Generally, historians believe that it was probably because of the constant threat of Brandenburg, who seized the land of Noteć and the castles in Wieleń, Czarnków, Ujście, Santok and Drezdenko.

The second reason for Władysław I the Elbow-high&#x27;s quick agreement with Henry III of Głogów was the intervention in Gdańsk of his nephew Leszek of Inowrocław, which made claims to this part of the lands of Przemysł II. Finally, thanks to the fast intervention of the Elbow-high in Pomerelia, Leszek retreated to his paternal domains in Inowrocław after receiving as compensation the town of Wyszogród.

With the death of Przemysł II came the partition of his domains, and only thanks to the instant reaction of Władysław I the Elbow-high, the losses against of Brandenburg, Głogów and Kujawy were relatively small.

==Seals and coinage==
During his reign Przemysł II had only five seals:
*The first seal was inherited from his father and manifesting standing figure with a pennant in his right hand and a shield in his left. On the dial bears a climbing lion. On both sides of the form appear standing towers, with trumpeters blowing horns. The character of the prince&#x27;s hand is shown blessing of God. Around an inscription: &quot;Sig. Premislonis Dei Gra(cia) Ducis Polonie&quot;. This seal was in consequence used conclusively between the years 1267–1284.
*The second seal and coat of arms shows a climbing lion, and around is shown the inscription: &quot;S. Premizlonis Dei Gra(cia) Ducis Polonie&quot;. Przemysł II used this form of seal during 1267–1289.
*The third seal, depicting the same elements of the first (figure is, however, larger and on the dial instead of a lion appears an eagle without crown), bears the inscription: &quot;&quot;Sig Premislonis Secundi Dei Gra(cia) Ducis Polonie&quot;. It&#x27;s known only from a single document issued on 12 September 1290.
*The fourth seal, used during the years 1290–1295, is larger than the previous ones and shows the prince standing with pointed cap on his head. In his left hand he holds a shield with a crowned eagle, the right pennant with crowned eagle, which runs ribbon with the inscription &quot;Et Cra&quot;. At the bottom of the seal bears trampled by the ruler a dragon. In the rim bears the same inscription as on the third seal.
*The fifth seal was used by Przemysł II after his coronation, during 1295–1296. The new stamp is majestic and shows on the obverse the king sitting on a throne in a long robe and with long hair, wearing a crown on his head, holding in his left hand an apple with a cross in the right scepter. On the right hand of the king, the throne bears a helmet with feathers. An inscription around the seal is shown: &quot;S. Premislii Dei Gracia. Regis. Polonie (et Ducis) Pomoranie&quot;. It also includes the inscription, according to K. Górski (in &quot;&quot;Rocznik Gdański&quot;, XII, 1938, p. 29): &quot;S(igillum) Premislii Dei Gracia Regis Polonorum et Ducis Pomora(nie)&quot;&quot;. The inscription on the seal raises some doubt due to the damage to the preserved copy of the seal according to the reconstruction of Stanisław Krzyżanowski reads: &quot;Reddidit Ips(e Deus) Victricia Signa. Polonis&quot;.

Historians do not agree why Przemysł II replaced the seal used by his father and uncle for a lion and an eagle. It is believed that either he wanted to emphasize his precedence from the Piast dynasty (the eagle in the coat of arms was also used by Władysław III Spindleshanks and Władysław Odonic), or with the symbol wanted to emphasize his rights inherited from Henryk IV Probus.

There is no known coin which can certainly be attributed to Przemysł II. However, due to the existence of mints, confirmed by sources, it is possible that many coin portrayals were misinterpreted by experts. Some historians attributed to the Greater Poland ruler two types of coins: the Bracteate, preserved in seven copies, showing a portrait in profile with a crown, holding in his hands a sword, and a coin preserved in a single copy, which differs from the first model inscription &quot;REX&quot; and the crowning headgear (on the second copy appears topped with a cross). Both coins resemble the Denarius from times of Bolesław II the Generous.

==Economic policy==
Due to the nature of the extant sources from the times of Przemysł II (documents, and narrative texts recording mainly -if not exclusively- political events) it is difficult to indicate what the major plans of action of the King in the economic sphere were. The most important ally for Przemysł II was the Roman Catholic Church, and for obvious reasons (copyists and translators, in the vast majority, are from the clergy) most documents who detailed their collaboration have been preserved to this day.

One of the most important political allies of Przemysł II was Jakub Świnka, Archbishop of Gniezno. Already on 8 January 1284 he managed to obtain the village of Polanów. Much more important grace of the King to Archbishop Jakub was received on 1 August when he obtained the right of mint his own coins in Żnin and the castellany of Ląd. Moreover, under these privilege of coins mint, the Archbishop was to be treated as equal with the Greater Poland ruler. Two years later, on 20 June 1286 there was a failed attempt to get the same privilege of the Archbishop to Duke Bolesław II of Masovia in Łowicz; this became in the basis for the economic independence of Jakub and the economic power of Greater Poland. Also, the Bishop of Poznań received similar grants from Przemysł II for example, in 1288 in the city of Śródka, in 1289, an exemption from mercantile taxes to the episcopal city of Buk, and finally, in 1290, was approved the grant of German law for Słupca. For political reasons, there is no similar support to other bishops -with one exception- in 1287, Przemysł II released Bishop Konrad of Lubusz from the current Polish law and authorized the implementation of the German law in his diocese.

The Greater Poland ruler also tried to support monastical Orders. The surviving sources showed that among the most favored were the Cistercians and especially his monasteries in Ląd (who received grants in the years 1280, 1289, 1291 and 1293), Łekno (1280, 1283, 1288), and Gościkowo (1276, 1277, 1290). Those enjoying a little less support included the Benedictines (especially the monastery of Lubin, who received privileges in the years 1277, 1294, 1296), and Dominicans (his friary in Poznań received in 1277 the right to fishing on the Warta, and the monastery of Wronki monetary grants). Przemysł II also granted small privileges to military orders: the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre.

Przemysł II also favored the middle class, and happily to this day many documents regarding this have survived. In 1280, the capital Poznań bought from the government lands and utilities, and received income from stalls and shambles. Three years later, the merchants were freed from paying some taxes in Greater Poland. The second main city in Greater Poland, Kalisz, received in 1282 the confirmation of some rights previously granted by Bolesław the Pious. In 1283, the Duke extended the town privileges in all the cities of Greater Poland following the model of Kalisz (&quot;Privilege of Kalisz&quot;). In 1287 another city was granted privileges for the Jewish community to establish a local cemetery in the village of Czaszki). In 1289 a city obtained consent for the construction of five pharmacies and the authorization of a sixth). In 1291 cloth sellers received from the Duke the revenue from customs duties, and the city received 12 pieces of land for the purpose of grazing). In 1292 an exemption from customs duties levied in Ołobok was granted.) In 1294 noble privileges, based on former and existing German laws, were granted in the city of Kalisz).

In addition to the privileges granted to Poznań and Kalisz, other individual privileges given to Pyzdry in 1283 (exemption from paying customs duties merchants in Greater Poland), to Rogoźno in 1280 (implementation of the German law) and Elbląg in 1294 (confirmation of privileges given by Mestwin II).

<text>The Duchy of Greater Poland was a district principality in Greater Poland that was a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Poland. It was formed in 1138 from the territories of the Kingdom of Poland, following its fragmentation started by the testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth. In 1177, the state broke had separated into the duchies of Poznań, Gniezno and Kalisz, and united again in 1279, lasting in that form until 1320, when it was incorporated back into the Kingdom of Poland. Its capital was Poznań.

==History==

Upon the death of Polish Piast duke Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138, his country was divided by his will into 4-5 hereditary provinces distributed among his sons. The late duke had also established the Seniorate Province of Kraków for the eldest Władysław II, designated high duke of whole Poland.

===Mieszko the Old===
As one of these provinces, Greater Poland was given to Mieszko III the Old, the third son of late Duke Bolesław. 
Duke Mieszko III the Old at first ruled over the western part of the Greater Polish lands at Poznań. His dominion bordered on the Polish Duchy of Silesia in the south, on the Seniorate Province in the east and on the Pomeranian lands in the north. In the west the Greater Polish lands stretched up to Lubusz Land on the western Polish border, where in 1157 the Ascanian count Albert the Bear established the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg.

After the death of his Mieszko&#x27;s brother Bolesław IV the Curly in 1173, he also became High Duke of Poland according to the principle of agnatic seniority as laid down in Bolesław&#x27;s testament. However, he soon had to face a rebellion at Kraków instigated by Lesser Polish magnates led by his younger brother Casimir II the Just with the support of Mieszko&#x27;s own son Odon fearing for his heritage. Casimir assumed the high ducal title, while in 1179 Odon even expelled his father from the Greater Polish lands. Mieszko fled to the Duchy of Pomerania at the court of Duke Bogislaw I, husband of his daughter Anastasia.

With support by Pomeranian forces, Mieszko in 1181 was able to return to his duchy and also to conquer the adjacent lands of Gniezno and Kalisz, formerly part of the Seniorate Province. Odon was forced to leave Poznań and only retained a small strip of land south of the Obra river. While Mieszko&#x27;s subsequent attempts to regain the high ducal title failed, in 1186 he was able to further expand his duchy by the adjacent lands of Kuyavia up to the Vistula in the east, which had been ruled by his deceased nephew Duke Leszek of Masovia. He gave Kuyavia to his son Bolesław, nevertheless after Bolesław&#x27;s death in 1195, the lands were again separated from Greater Poland, when Mieszko had to cede Kuyavia to Casimir&#x27;s son Duke Konrad of Masovia in 1199.

In 1191 Mieszko had finally reconquered Kraków, nevertheless his decision to entrust the rule over Lesser Poland to his son Mieszko the Younger proved to be a failure: Casimir soon regained the Polish throne and Mieszko the Younger fled to his father, who installed him as a duke at Kalisz. When Mieszko the Younger died in 1193, his father reconciled with his eldest son Odon and gave the Duchy of Kalisz to him. Upon the death of Odon in the following year, all Greater Polish lands were re-united under the rule of Mieszko the Old; he ceded late Odon&#x27;s territories south of the Obra river to his only surviving son Władysław III Spindleshanks. By 1194 Mieszko the Old had outlived his brothers. However, Casimir&#x27;s son Leszek I the White, like his father, would not acknowledge his rule at Kraków. Upon Mieszko&#x27;s death in 1202, his son Władysław soon was confronted with the rivaling claims raised by his cousin.

===Władysław Spindleshanks and Władysław Odonic===
In 1206 Władysław Spindleshanks finally lost the high ducal title to Leszek and furthermore had to deal with his rebellious nephew Władysław Odonic, son of his late brother Odon. Władysław Odonic claimed the lands of Kalisz, which his father had held in 1193/94 and was able to gain the support by the Archbishop of Gniezno, nevertheless his attempts to depose his uncle failed. At least he received Kalisz, backed by the Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded and from 1216 also ruled over the Greater Polish lands south of the Obra, which his father had held until his death in 1994.

In 1217 the conflict again erupted, when Władysław Spindleshanks reconciled with Leszek and Henry and received free rein to expel Władysław Odonic, who fled to the court of Duke Swietopelk II of Pomerelia. However, even with the help of the Pomerelian duke, Władysław Odonic only was able to conquer the Greater Polish lands of Ujście in 1223. In 1227 Swietopelk raided a ducal assembly (&quot;wiec&quot;) at Gąsawa, whereby High Duke Leszek was killed and Duke Henry the Bearded seriously wounded. Władysław Spindleshanks did not attend the meeting, which probably saved his life. Furthermore, he got rid of his long-time rival Leszek, whom he now could succeed as high duke. Władysław Odonic, accused of involvement in the assault, retired to the Duchy of Masovia, where he forged another alliance with Duke Konrad I. With both Pomerelian and Masovian support he was enabled to take the whole Duchy of Greater Poland from Władysław Spindleshanks in 1229.

Władysław Spindleshanks fled to Silesia and died without issue two years later, whereafter his nephew became the sole heir of the Greater Polish line. Nevertheless, he was confronted by claims raised by the Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded, also Polish high duke from 1232, who from 1234 onwards conquered most of his territories. When Henry I was succeeded by his son Henry II the Pious in 1238, Władysław Odonic was confined to the lands around Ujście. He died in the following year, whereafter High Duke Henry II ruled over all of Greater Poland until he himself was killed at the 1241 Battle of Legnica.

===Przemysł I and Bolesław the Pious===

The Greater Polish line of the Piasts was continued by the sons of Władysław Odonic, Przemysł I and his minor brother Bolesław the Pious, who first had to reconquer their heritage from the Silesian successors of Henry the Pious. Soon after a conflict arose between the brothers: in 1247 Bolesław openly rebelled against his elder brother with the help of local nobles and the lands were formally divided, whereby the younger received the smaller district of Kalisz. The quarrels continued, as dissatisfied Bolesław also claimed the lands of Gniezno. Przemysł had him deposed and arrested in 1250, and not until 1253, by the agency of the Archbishop of Gniezno, was Bolesław re-installed as Duke of Kalisz and Gniezno.

Przemysł had to deal with the expansionist policies of the Brandenburg margraves John I and Otto III, who had acquired Lubusz Land at the western border of his duchy from the Silesian duke Bolesław II Rogatka in 1248. When he died in 1257, his brother Bolesław became sole ruler over all Greater Poland. In 1264 Bolesław the Pious passed the Statute of Kalisz which extended Jewish rights in his duchy.

===Przemysł II===
Greater Poland was once again re-united under the rule of Przemysł&#x27;s son Przemysł II at Poznań in 1279. In the west, the Brandenburg margraves had made Lubusz Land the nucleus of the New March, where they established the town of Landsberg (present-day Gorzów Wielkopolski) in 1257. Przemysł II was able to encounter the Brandenburg expansion by allying with their opponent Duke Bogislaw IV of Pomerania. He briefly controlled Cracov after the death of Henry IV Probus but soon sold it to the king of Bohemia Wenceslaus II, he also inherited the Pomerelian lands due to a succession agreement with the previous duke Mestwin II and even was crowned King of whole Poland in 1295. However, the Greater Polish line finally became extinct when he was abducted and killed in the following year. His succession was claimed by his Kuyavian cousin Władysław I the Elbow-high, who had to deal with his rivaling Silesian relative Duke Henry III of Głogów due to the fact that Przemysl II made a succession agreement with both of them, while the Brandenburgers finally conquered the strategically important fortress of Santok on the Warta River. In 1300 both Piasts had to renounce in favour of mighty King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia.

Upon the death of King Wenceslaus in 1305, the rivalry continued and after a short period of rule by dukes from various branches of the Piast dynasty, the province finally fell to Władysław, who was crowned King of re-united Poland 1320. The duchy was turned into the Poznań Voivodship and Kalisz Voivodship under the united Polish Crown.

<text>, also known as Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac or simply Knights of the Zodiac (translated from the French title &quot;Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque&quot;), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1985 to 1990, with its chapters collected in 28 volumes. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media.

The story follows five mystical warriors called the Saints who fight wearing sacred sets of armor named &quot;Cloths&quot;, the designs of which derive from the various constellations the characters have adopted as their destined guardian symbols. The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the Olympian goddess Athena in her battle against other gods who want to dominate Earth.

The manga was adapted by Toei Animation into a 114-episode anime television series broadcast on TV Asahi from 1986 to 1989. The anime series was followed by a 31-episode original video animation (OVA) series, subtitled &quot;The Hades Chapter&quot;, released from 2002 to 2008. Four animated feature films premiered in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. A live-action film adaptation premiered in 2023.

The &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; manga had over 50 million copies in circulation by 2022, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Both the original manga and the anime adaptation were successful internationally across Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

A manga sequel by Kurumada, titled &quot;Saint Seiya: Next Dimension&quot;, was serialized from 2006 to 2024. Several spin-off manga by different authors have also been created. 

==Plot==

The story focuses on an orphan named Seiya who was forced to go to the Sanctuary in Greece to obtain one of the , the Bronze Cloth of the Pegasus constellation, a protective armor worn by the Greek goddess Athena&#x27;s 88 warriors known as . Upon awakening his , Seiya acquires the ability to unleash the true power of a Saint through what is variously described as the &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;explosion&quot;, or &quot;big bang&quot; of his &quot;Cosmo&quot; (alluding to the Big Bang of the universe). He then quickly becomes the Pegasus Saint and returns to Japan to find his older sister.

Because his sister disappeared the same day Seiya went to the Sanctuary, Saori Kido, the adopted granddaughter of Mitsumasa Kido (the person who sent all the orphans to train) makes a deal with him to go to fight in a tournament called the Galaxian Wars. In this tournament, all the orphans who survived and became Bronze Saints must fight to win the most powerful Cloth: The Sagittarius Gold Cloth. If Seiya goes to compete there and wins, Saori would start a search to find Seiya&#x27;s sister. The tournament is interrupted by the vengeful Phoenix Bronze Saint, Ikki, who wishes to eliminate the people who forced him to undergo his especially harsh training. He steals parts from the Sagittarius Cloth and eventually fights against the remaining Bronze Saints: Seiya, Shun (Ikki&#x27;s brother), Shiryū, and Hyōga.

Upon Ikki&#x27;s defeat, the Bronze Saints are attacked by the Silver Saints sent by the Sanctuary&#x27;s corrupt Pope to eliminate them. When they prevail, the Bronze Saints learn that Saori is Athena&#x27;s reincarnation and that the Pope once tried to kill her as a baby. The previous Sagittarius Gold Saint Aiolos saved Saori but was mortally wounded shortly after escaping and gave Saori to her adopted grandfather. Deciding to join forces with Saori, the Bronze Saints go to the Sanctuary to defeat the Pope, but upon their arrival, Saori is severely wounded by a gold arrow from a Silver Saint and will die at the end of the day. Believing the Pope may be able to heal her, the Bronze Saints go to find him. To do so, they must go through 12 temples, each one guarded by one Gold Saint (the most powerful Saints of Athena). Some of these Gold Saints are friendly, but others are just as corrupt as the Pope and take a sick pleasure in fighting the Bronze Saints. Following several battles, Seiya gets to the Pope&#x27;s temple and learns that he is actually the Gold Saint Gemini Saga, who suffers from a split personality: one good and one evil. His evil side took over completely and had killed the real Pope to obtain more power. With help from his friends&#x27; Cosmos, Seiya is able to knock out Saga and use the shield from Athena&#x27;s statue to heal Saori just in time. Shortly afterwards, Saga, his good side having regained control, commits suicide as a self-punishment.

In the second story arc, the Greek god Poseidon reincarnates within the body of Julian Solo, the heir to a rich and powerful family, and plots to flood the Earth. Saori goes to his Temple, where Julian offers her to reduce the flooding by absorbing the water inside the Oceans&#x27; Central Pillar. Following Saori, Seiya, Hyōga, Shun and Shiryū go to Poseidon&#x27;s underwater Temple and are confronted by his underlings, the Marines. As Seiya, Hyōga, and Shiryū make their way to Julian, Ikki learns that the mastermind behind this conflict is Saga&#x27;s twin brother, Gemini Kanon, who is manipulating Poseidon. During the final battle, Poseidon&#x27;s spirit awakes within Julian and manages to defeat his opponents. Saved by the Saints from the Pillar, Saori seals Poseidon&#x27;s soul within her amphora.

The third and last arc follows how Hades, the Underworld god, is freed from his seal and revives the deceased Gold Saints and the Pope Aries Shion, and alongside some of his 108 Specters, sends them to the Sanctuary to kill Athena. The remaining Gold Saints serving Athena are able to subdue the enemies, but Saori then commits suicide. This act is instead meant to directly send her to the Underworld to face Hades, and the Bronze Saints follow her. Shion reveals that the revived Gold Saints&#x27; true intentions were of giving Saori her own Cloth so she could fight alongside her knights, and gives it to Seiya&#x27;s group before dying once again. In the Underworld, as the Saints fight Hades&#x27; Specters, Shun is possessed by Hades. Saori reaches Hades and expels his soul from Shun&#x27;s body. Hades then takes Saori to Elysium, and the five Bronze Saints follow them. In the final fight against Hades and his two subordinates, the gods Hypnos and Thanatos, the Saints gain the all-powerful God Cloths and use them to aid Saori in defeating Hades. However, Seiya also sacrifices himself by getting stabbed by Hades&#x27; sword, and the Saints return to Earth with his body.

==Production==
At first, manga author Masami Kurumada planned to create a wrestling-themed manga, as he enjoyed writing individual sports stories rather than collective ones. He was initially inspired by &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984) to conceive a story about a young karateka named Seiya found by a karate master and his female assistant; however, his publishing department did not approve the idea. Since he thought simple sports like judo or karate would not be interesting enough, he added aspects from Greek mythology and constellations to make it innovative. However, the basic concept of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was to be a manga with a &quot;fashion&quot; touch added by the Saint Cloths. After the quick cancellation of his previous work, &quot;Otoko Zaka&quot;, in 1984, this &quot;fashion sense&quot; was something Kurumada thought would be an aspect that would attract fans, making it different from his previous manga with simple high school uniforms. Although they look like European medieval armors, Kurumada said his main inspiration for the Cloths was Hajime Sorayama&#x27;s 1983 illustration book &quot;Sexy Robot&quot;. Besides from fashion, the Cloths were created because Kurumada wanted characters to throw explosive sparks and the armors was a way to give them some protection. Initially, he could not decide what type of armor it would be, considering even Buddhist ; based on the Greek motif, he designed the actual Saint Cloths. The usage Greek mythology came up when reusing elements from his previous work, &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;.

When Kurumada was in the process of creating &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, he gave Seiya the name Rin at first, since Kurumada was going to title his manga &quot;Ginga no Rin&quot; (Rin of the Galaxy). However, as Kurumada continued developing his manga, he decided to change the name to Seiya, which was more fitting. First he spelled the name with the kanji that meant &quot;Holy Arrow&quot;, to relate it to Seiya&#x27;s condition as a Saint, but later decided to use the kanji that meant &quot;Star Arrow&quot;, to emphasize the constellation and mythological motif. Finally, he changed his manga title as well, to &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, once he fully developed the concept of the Saints. Also, Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he conceived for &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was the Pegasus Meteor Fist. Since his manga was going to use the constellations as a very important and ever-present theme, he wanted his protagonist to have a special move that would be like a shower of meteors. While at first &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was not a popular manga during serialization as they did not understand the themes of Cosmos or Sanctuary, it took half a year for the series to become popular. All concepts and names were elaborated to be connected with being based on ancient The evolved God Cloths were created as a means to defeat Thanatos in the final volume, but Kurumada considered that he went too far with the concept. Whether Athena&#x27;s Cloth or Hades and Poseidon&#x27;s protections are also God protections were left in vague. The Hades arc was inspired by Dante&#x27;s Inferno. The Gold Saints were revived due to their popularity in the fandom but with the twist of they being traitors. The Pope Aries Shion was included specifically to clarify his strength by making him Aries Mu&#x27;s mentor so that Cancer Deathmask and Pisces Aphrodite would not be able to face Mu. While Gemini Saga remains as an antagonist, his twin brother Gemini Kanon was written so that he would jump from being an antagonist to an ally especially when redeeming himself in front of Scorpio Milo. Kurumada put carefully his emotions into writing this scenes which he thought was popular in France. Other major twists like Hyoga facing his mentor who turns out to be the Gold Saint Camus and Shun turning out to be Hades&#x27; new vessel were created at the moment as Kurumada did not plan much of the story.

When Kurumada designed Seiya&#x27;s likeness, he was inspired by his character Ryūji Takane, the protagonist of his hit manga &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;, which he created 9 years before Seiya. Most protagonists of Kurumada&#x27;s works bear a resemblance to Ryūji, as Kurumada subscribed to Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Star System (a stable cast of characters) technique. The same process is done with almost all the other characters from the series. After creating Seiya as a character, he decided to give different personality traits to each of other main characters: Shiryū is the &quot;righteous and serious&quot;; Hyoga is &quot;posed and classy&quot;; Shun is the &quot;lovable boy&quot;; and Ikki is the lone wolf. Nevertheless, he noted that he wrote so many characters besides the five main heroes, that there were several supporting characters who overshdaowed the leads in terms of popularity like Kurumada&#x27;s previous works. While &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; ended with the Saints battle against the God of the Underworld Hades, Kurumada had ideas for new story arcs involving Apollo and Artemisa as there are still several gods of the Olympus to explore. However, he feared that he might die drawing too much. Instead, he was more busy writing a sequel to &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;. While &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot; made Kurumada popular in Japan, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; gave him international fame. Regarding the anime adaptation of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, Kurumada commented that, on the positive side, it made him happy, as he felt that his work would receive more publicity and popularity; on the other hand, he recalled that his master once told him that when a manga becomes an anime series &quot;it&#x27;s like giving your daughter away in marriage.&quot; Nevertheless, Kurumada was pleased with the adaptation, particularly highlighting the sound effects, noting that &quot;the intensity of a sound cannot be compared to an onomatopoeia.&quot; Kurumada participated in the adaptation of the final arc by composing the final song , and was pleased with the final product.

===Anime===

====Television series====
An anime adaptation of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was first proposed in June 1986 three months before the first manga volume was published. After Toei Animation started a partnership with TV Asahi, they looked for sponsors. Bandai got interested in selling the Saint Cloths as merchandise so it began development. Masayoshi Kawata, producer of TV Asahi, thought &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was the perfect fit for the &quot;hero show&quot; they were looking for. By July of that same year, scriptwriter Takao Koyama had written the first episode scheduled to be broadcast in October. Since an episode adapts several chapters the anime goes faster than the manga, which led the TV series staff to create some original stories to fill the gap. The series was broadcast on TV Asahi from October 11, 1986, to April 1, 1989. It was directed first by Kōzō Morishita (episodes 1–73) and then by Kazuhito Kikuchi (episodes 74–114). The character designers and aestheticists were Shingo Araki and Michi Himeno, and Seiji Yokoyama composed the soundtracks. Following Kurumada&#x27;s storylines from the manga closely, the chief scriptwriters were Takao Koyama (1–73) and Yoshiyuki Suga (74–114). The series has three main parts: &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (episodes 1–73), &quot;Asgard&quot;—an anime original story arc (episodes 74–99), and &quot;Poseidon&quot; (episodes 100–114). The series was cancelled and left unfinished, with the final story arc of the manga not animated until it was adapted into an original video animation series in 2002. The entire series was later released on two Blu-ray box sets on June 20 and September 24, 2014. It was re-broadcast on TV Asahi in 2015.

After Japan, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was first broadcast in France in 1988 on TF1&#x27;s , under the title &quot;Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque&quot; (which inspired the title in other language versions), and the series became quickly popular. The series was broadcast throughout Asia, Europe and Latin America, where it was a success as well. In North America, the series was first licensed by DIC Entertainment, under the title &quot;Knights of the Zodiac&quot;, in 2003. The DIC version was edited for broadcast, cutting overly violent scenes, coloring the red blood to blue, adding in previously non-existent digital scene transitions, rewriting the scripts, renaming several characters and replacing the music themes and the original soundtrack. This version premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on August 30, 2003, and in Canada on YTV on September 5 of the same year. Unlike other territories, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; did not succeed in North America, and DIC only dubbed forty episodes. ADV Films licensed the home video rights to the series. They released the DIC-edited version and an uncut version of the show with English subtitles, which also included a new dub (with a different voice cast than the one used by DIC). ADV Films released the first twenty-eight episodes of the edited version on seven DVDs from January 27 to October 25, 2004, and released only sixty episodes of the uncut version on twelve DVDs from October 21, 2003, to May 31, 2005. A box-set collection was released on January 13, 2009. New Video released the first seventy-three episodes on a subtitle-only DVD set, titled &quot;Saint Seiya: Sanctuary Classic Complete Collection&quot;, on April 15, 2014. On October 15, 2019, Netflix began streaming a third English dub, featuring the cast from &quot;Knights of the Zodiac: Saint Seiya&quot;; the first fifteen episodes premiered first and episodes 16–41 were added some days later; episodes 42–73 were added in January 2020; and episodes 74–114 were added in April 2020, in effect making the Netflix dub the only complete English dub of the entire original series. The series was removed from the platform in December 2021. Crunchyroll added the series to its catalogue in April 2023.

A spin-off television series, &quot;Saint Seiya Omega&quot;, was broadcast for ninety-seven episodes on TV Asahi from April 1, 2012, to March 30, 2014.

====Films====

Four animated feature films were shown in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989. A fifth animated film came out in Japanese theaters in 2004, , which was supposed to follow the regular chronology right after the end of the manga (which finished being adapted on August 1, 2008) as a prologue to a new chapter. Toei Animation first announced that this new chapter would be a new animated series, but later Kurumada stated that he wanted the film to be part of a trilogy. Tōru Furuya, Pegasus Seiya voice actor, revealed Kurumada&#x27;s wishes for the series during a press conference. After Pegasus Seiya eventually defeats Zeus, he is to go on and face Chronos, the God of Time.

Despite the first film being released in 1987, none of the films received an official English release in North America until it was announced by Discotek Media in 2012 that it had acquired the home video rights to the first four ones and intended to release them across two DVDs, each containing two films. The DVDs contain Japanese audio with English subtitles.

On June 21, 2014, &quot;Legend of Sanctuary&quot; was released. Animated in CGI, &quot;Legend of Sanctuary&quot; is based on the original series. It was produced by Toei to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the franchise.

====Original video animations====

The last story arc of the original manga series, which was not previously adapted into the television series, was adapted into an original video animation (OVA) series, subtitled and released across three parts. The first part, , was directed by Shigeyasu Yamauchi, still with designs by Shingo Araki and Michi Himeno, while the scripts were done by Michiko Yokote, and the soundtrack was entirely taken from Yokoyama&#x27;s work on the previous TV series. It consists of 13 episodes, and before its release on home video, it was broadcast on the pay-per-view channel SKY PerfecTV! from November 9, 2002, to April 12, 2003, with the episodes released by Bandai Visual on seven DVDs from January 25 to July 25, 2003.

The second part, , consists of 12 episodes; from this part onwards there was a recasting for the main characters. The first six episodes were broadcast on SKY PerfecTV! from December 17, 2005, to February 18, 2006, and were released on three DVDs by Avex from February 22 to April 26, 2006; the following six episodes were broadcast on from December 15, 2006, to February 18, 2007, and were released on three DVDs by Avex from January 31 to March 28, 2007.

The final part, , consists of six episodes, which premiered on Perfect Choice from March 7 to August 1, 2008, and were released on three DVDs from March 28 to August 22, 2008.

===Live-action film===

In 2003, the French magazine AnimeLand published an interview with Masami Kurumada where the author revealed that a company in Hollywood had approached him some years prior with a fifteen-minute pilot of a live-action film of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. The project was abandoned as Kurumada did not feel the essence of the series had been preserved. In a later interview published in 2005 the reporter was allowed to see the video and commented on how the names of the main characters were changed and noted that one of them, Andromeda Shun had been changed from male to female.

In 2017, a collaboration between Toei Animation and Hong Kong-based production company A Really Good Film Company was announced. In the press conference, plans for a live-action &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; film were detailed, and Polish director Tomasz Bagiński was announced as being in charge of filming, based on the 1986 series, which was supposed to take place in 2019. The film was released in English under the title &quot;Knights of the Zodiac&quot;. It stars Mackenyu as Seiya, Madison Iseman as Sienna, Sean Bean as Alman Kido, Diego Tinoco as Nero, Famke Janssen as Vander Guraad, Nick Stahl as Cassios and Mark Dacascos as Mylock. The film premiered in Japan on April 28, 2023. Sony Pictures distributed the film outside Japan, except in China and the Middle East.

===Stage plays===

===Other media===
In the early 1990s, Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment planned to produce an American animated version of the series titled &quot;Guardians of the Cosmos&quot;. Only a pilot was made, and the intro was revealed at the end of YouTuber Ray Mona&#x27;s documentary on the subject titled &quot;The Secret Stories of Saint Seiya&quot; in December 2022. The full pilot was showcased in the follow-up documentary &quot;The Secret Stories of Saint Seiya Part 2&quot; in April 2023.

==Reception==
The &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; manga has sold over 25 million copies in Japan by 2007. It had over 35 million copies in circulation by 2017, and over 50 million copies in circulation by 2022. The anime series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1987. In Animage&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Top-100 Anime&quot; ranking, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was 53rd. In 2006, TV Asahi conducted a nationwide survey for the one hundred most popular animated television series, where &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; came in 25th place. In NHK&#x27;s &quot;Best 100 Anime&quot; online poll ranking, celebrating a century of Japanese Animation, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; came in 123rd place.

The series was considered one of the biggest phenomena of the 1980s. It would become the inspiration for future series, including several Gundam series such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot; and &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;, &quot;Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato&quot;, &quot;Ronin Warriors&quot;, &quot;Wild Knights Gulkeeva&quot;, and Kurumada&#x27;s later work &quot;B&#x27;t X&quot;. In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917&quot;, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy praises the series&#x27; complex plot and felt that animation designers&#x27; Shingo Araki and Michi Himeno had worked &quot;magic&quot; with both the anime series and the films. They also praised the grand soundtrack and director Shigeyasu Yamauchi&#x27;s ability to stretch out the tension and chose the perfect places to stop an episode to keep audiences waiting for the next one. Clements and McCarthy did, however, find the series disturbing in that its main emotional impact comes from the audience seeing &quot;older boys and men fighting brave but naive teenagers&quot; and through victories earning more weapons. Jason Thompson describes the series as being &quot;almost pure battle&quot;.

 based on &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; popularized the term &quot;&quot; in 1987. &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; was particularly popular as a subject in as it had a large cast which was predominantly male. This allowed &quot;an incredible number&quot; of pairings, although Andromeda Shun was one of the more popular characters to create for.

Tite Kubo, the author of the manga series &quot;Bleach&quot;, named &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; as one of his biggest inspirations for the designs of the different types of weapons that his characters use in the story as well as the battle scenes.

&quot;Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold&quot; (2015) drew a viewership worldwide by September 2015.

<text>American Bible Society is a U.S.-based Christian nonprofit headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the American member organization of United Bible Societies, it supports global Bible translation, production, distribution, literacy, engagement, ministry, and advocacy efforts. American Bible Society publishes and distributes interconfessional translations of the Christian Bible and provides study aids and other tools to help people engage with it. Founded on May 11, 1816, in New York City, it is best known for its Good News Translation of the Bible, written in the contemporary vernacular. American Bible Society also publishes the Contemporary English Version.

American Bible Society is a member of the United Bible Societies, Forum of Bible Agencies International, Every Tribe Every Nation and not affiliated with any single denomination. With Trinitarian Christian faith that adheres to the Nicene Creed, American Bible Society does not consider Latter-day Saints or Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to be Christians.

American Bible Society&#x27;s headquarters relocated from 1865 Broadway in New York City to Philadelphia in August 2015.

==History==

===19th century===
American Bible Society was founded in 1816 by prominent American Protestants. The first President was Elias Boudinot, who had been President of the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1783. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, was named president in 1821, and a number of illustrious individuals like Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen and Edwin Francis Hyde, a former president of the Philharmonic Society of New York, headed up the organization over the years. Francis Scott Key, the writer of the United States&#x27; national anthem, was a Vice President of the organization from 1817 until his death in 1843. American Bible Society&#x27;s first headquarters were on Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan.
American Bible Society used the King James Bible, and, starting in 1858, appointed committees to prevent textual corruption. The American Bible Society provided the first Bibles in hotels and the first pocket Bibles for soldiers during the American Civil War. The first translation by the American Bible Society was in 1818 into Lenape of Delaware, a Native American language. By the 1830s, American Bible Society sold several English Bibles and Testaments, including a pocket version. The organization owned stereotype plates that allowed it to print Scripture in French, Spanish, and German. It also carried Bibles from other printers in various languages, including Gaelic, Welsh, Dutch, Mohawk, Hawaiian, and Seneca.

American Bible Society began its outreach to the blind in 1835. The organization was a supporter of Samuel Gridley Howe, who developed a raised-letter printing system called “Boston” or “Howe” type. A Bible using Howe’s type was heavily funded and sold by American Bible Society in the first half of the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, the organization was printing the entire Bible in the New York Point System.

In an incident well publicized at the time, the ABS refused a donation offered in 1834 by the American Anti-Slavery Society. The purpose was to subsidize the distribution of Bibles to American slaves, about one-sixth of the population, as abolitionists believed that knowledge of the Bible hastened the end of slavery. (That the Bible &quot;supported&quot; slavery was maintained by a number of Southern clergymen.) While it sent Bibles to Liberia for the former slaves there, the ABS left domestic distribution in the hands of its state auxiliaries, who refused to distribute Bibles directly to slaves. The Society was widely seen as insufficiently committed to the abolition of slavery, to the point that the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society &quot;decided to throw most of its support behind the American Missionary Society, an organization that it believed was making a &#x27;systematic effort&#x27; to get Bibles and tracts to slaves.&quot;

In 1852, while Theodore Frelinghuysen was President of American Bible Society, the Bible House was built, occupying the whole of the block bounded by Third and Fourth Avenues, Astor Place, and Ninth Street in New York City. Suffragist and economist Virginia Penny offered an employment office for women in the Bible House, and she gave lectures on the many different types of jobs for women in New York City. By 1920, it was one of the oldest office buildings in the city.

The American Bible Society&#x27;s mission is to make the Bible available to all people and to that end, during the 19th century, four canvasses of the United States for this purpose were undertaken. These canvasses took place in 1829, 1856, 1866, and in 1882. During the fourth canvass, in 1882, more than 6.3 million families were visited, and 473,806 families were supplied with Bibles; in addition nearly 300,000 individuals received Bibles. American Bible Society sold 437,000 Scriptures and portions in 1898 in China.

===20th century===
By 1912, American Bible Society issued Bibles for use in the United States in 83 languages besides English. Foreign circulation was rising steadily, increasing from 250,000 copies in 1876 to over 2 million copies in 1915. Although American Bible Society continues to publish and print Bibles with partner printing presses, it ceased printing Bibles on printing presses owned by the organization itself in 1922. American Bible Society celebrated a century of service to China in 1934. Vice President John R. Mott recalled that in 1833 American Bible Society sent $3,000 to Elijah Coleman Bridgman, first U.S. Protestant missionary to China, to print scriptures in Chinese. As of 1934 American Bible Society had spent $2,897,383 distributing nearly 70 million volumes of Scripture in China.

In 1998, American Bible Society paid about $1.6 million to Sony Music Entertainment in order to distribute several Christian children&#x27;s series, including &quot;Angel Wings&quot; and &quot;Kingsley&#x27;s Meadow&quot;. In 1999, the organization launched its first major Internet ministry, ForMinistry.com, a free church web-builder. Operations ceased in 2013 after 14 years of serving over 180,000 churches and ministries.

===21st century===

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, American Bible Society distributed more than one million Scriptures and offered downloadable portions free of charge to those affected by the tragedy. Staff members also volunteered at Ground Zero distributing Scripture Portions to rescue workers. It has also maintained its commitment to the military, including producing a pocket-sized military Bible, developed jointly with the aid of Catholic and Protestant chaplains from all branches of the armed forces. Since 1817, it has distributed almost 60 million free Bible resources to America&#x27;s armed forces. It also provides Scriptures to victims of natural disasters.

Following the tsunami in 2004, American Bible Society worked in cooperation with the United Bible Societies and partner Bible Societies in Thailand, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka to provide a host of Bible resources to people in the affected regions. In 2005, it sent nearly a million Bibles and Scripture portions to those who survived the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. American Bible Society formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity to give a free Bible to each of its new homeowners in the United States.

In 2007, American Bible Society partnered with The Salvation Army to promote literacy with its program Mission: Literacy.

In 2008, American Bible Society published its first polyglot Bible and presented a specially bound copy to Pope Benedict XVI. The text was printed in five languages: Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English and Spanish.

In 2010, American Bible Society launched an annual, nationwide study to survey trends in the U.S. regarding spirituality and Scripture engagement called State of the Bible. American Bible Society launched a new Bible Search tool, an ad-free web engine that searches across ten translations of the Bible and targets the &quot;Bible curious&quot; and Protestant, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox believers. Also in 2010, American Bible Society launched the Bible-based Trauma Healing ministry in a war zone in East Africa. 

In 2013, American Bible Society and United Bible Societies launched the Digital Bible Library, a repository that houses digital copies of Bible translations and makes the texts available for repurposing across any media platform. Doug Birdsall was also appointed in 2013 as President and CEO.

In 2014, American Bible Society contracted with ICANN to operate the .BIBLE TLD Registry. The availability of .BIBLE domain names will accelerate global online Bible engagement. The first site to launch was American.Bible in September 2015 In 2014, Roy Peterson succeeded Doug Birdsall, having previously served as President of the Seed Company and Wycliffe Bible Translators.

 In 2015, American Bible Society announced that it had sold 1865 Broadway to AvalonBay Communities for US$300 million and was moving to a new location in Philadelphia, leasing 100,000 square feet at 401 Market Street.

In December, 2017, American Bible Society introduced the Affirmation of Biblical Community, an employee policy which requires staff to align around a core set of Christian beliefs and practices. The organization came under criticism as excluding individuals who are homosexual, stating they had to agree that marriage was between one man and one woman, or unwed heterosexuals living together, stating they had to agree not to have sex until they were married. The organization lost 20 percent of its workforce in 2018. Leadership of the organization claims the 20 percent attrition in 2018 was consistent with annual totals, but could not show that the organization suffered a 20% loss in staff in 2017, prior to the new Affirmation policy.

On October 28, 2019, American Bible Society announced the retirement of President Roy Peterson. He had held the role since 2014. Robert Briggs was announced as the Interim President and CEO. On June 23, 2020, Robert L. Briggs was appointed by the Board of Directors as permanent President and CEO.

In 2022, after two years on the job, President Robert Briggs left American Bible Society. Jeff Brown, former board chairman stepped in as interim president. Brown was then replaced in September of 2022 by another former board member, David Viehman. Paul Cleckner joined as Interim CEO in 2023, having previously held the role of interim CEO of Women’s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In January of 2024, Dr. Jennifer Holloran was introduced as the new president and CEO of American Bible Society. Dr. Holloran had previously served for 22 years in various leadership roles at Wycliffe Bible Translators USA, most recently as chief operating officer. 

===Museums===

====Faith and Liberty Discovery Center====
The Faith and Liberty Discovery Center was a museum that existed on Independence Mall from 2021 to 2024. It said it &quot;explores the relationship between faith and liberty in America from its founding to today, by illuminating the influence of the Bible on individuals in key historical and personal moments.&quot;

The project was originally slated to begin construction in Spring of 2017. The Center was completed and opened in 2021.

American Bible Society leadership described the FLDC as “...an exciting experience for people of all faiths and backgrounds,&quot; 

In 2019, American Bible Society paid to relocate White Water, a 40-foot-long, 16-foot high masterpiece of geometric stainless steel sculpture of 1978 by Robinson Fredenthal, from 401 Market Street to the Woodmere Art Museum. The piece was commissioned for its location at 401 Market Street by the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s Percent for Art Program, which mandated a certain percentage of construction costs for a development involving city-owned property to go toward public art. The Faith and Liberty Discovery Center included a 4-story-high sculpture called the Beacon. The surfaces is said to represent the three documents essential to the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bible.

In March 2024, the American Bible Society announced it would close the center.

====Museum of Biblical Art====
The Museum of Biblical Art, was an independent but affiliated organization and was housed in American Bible Society&#x27;s building at 1865 Broadway, in New York. It has since closed.

==Rare Scripture Collection==
American Bible Society has a Scripture collection over 45,000 volume holdings, one of the largest collection of Bibles in the world including a number of interesting and valuable editions of ancient and historic Bibles dating back as far as the Gutenberg edition, of which American Bible Society has several pages under protection. The collection contains editions of scripture in every language, from many countries and regions and spanning nearly six centuries and is the second largest collection of religious books, with the Vatican&#x27;s being the largest.

<text>Legio II Parthica (&quot;Parthian-conquering Second Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 197 by the emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211), for his campaign against the Parthian Empire, hence the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Parthica&quot;. The legion was still active in the beginning of the 5th century. The legion&#x27;s symbol was a centaur.

==Parthian campaign and Castra Albana (197–4th century)==

Together with its twin legions I &quot;Parthica&quot; and III &quot;Parthica&quot;, the Second Parthian legion was levied for the attack on the eastern frontier. The campaign was a success and Ctesiphon, the Parthian capital was taken and sacked. After this war, II &quot;Parthica&quot; returned to Italia in 198 and was stationed near Rome, in &quot;Castra Albana&quot; (Albano Laziale) – it was the first legion stationed in Italia for several centuries. Since it was not garrisoning a Roman province, it functioned both as a reserve that could be used in afflicted parts of the Empire, as well as a security element against possible internal rebellions. Emperors in the 3rd century were very likely to have problems with usurpers, and Severus, by stationing the II &quot;Parthica&quot; near the capital, was aware of it.

Nevertheless, the legion served in the Severan campaign in Britain of 208–211 and afterwards, under Caracalla against the Germanic tribe of the Alamanni in 213. Next, the legion was again sent to Parthia and their commander Macrinus was responsible for Caracalla&#x27;s murder in that region in 217. In the following year, however, the II &quot;Parthica&quot;, stationed in Apamea (Syria), abandoned Macrinus and sided with Elagabalus; the Second supported Elagabalus&#x27; rise to purple, defeating Macrinus in the Battle of Antioch. The new emperor awarded the legion with the cognomina &quot;Pia Fidelis Felix Aeterna&quot; (forever faithful, loyal and pious).

===Under Severus Alexander and Maximinus===

In 231, the legion fought under Alexander Severus against the Sassanid Empire, and returned with the emperor to the German provinces. The legion was at &quot;Moguntiacum&quot; (modern Mainz), when Alexander was assassinated in 235. In the following fight for the power, the II &quot;Parthica&quot; sided with Maximinus Thrax. In 238, the Roman senate declared Maximinus &quot;persona non grata&quot; and nominated Gordian III as emperor. Maximinus then marched on Rome to fight for his rights, taking the II &quot;Parthica&quot;, among other legions, with him to be stationed again at Castra Albana. What happened next is a good example of the political power of the legions in the 3rd century. The II &quot;Parthica&quot; weighed the chances of its commander and, concluding that supporting him was not a good move, they killed Maximinus before he could harass the senate. As a reward, they were pardoned for supporting a public enemy and allowed to return to their base and families in the Alban Hills.

===Whittling away===
In the next decades they were used as reinforcements in several provinces within the empire and continued to be used as pawns in the constant battles for the imperial throne of the 3rd century. Emperor Gallienus (253-268) awarded the legion with the titles &quot;V Fidelis V Pia&quot; and &quot;VI Fidelis VI Pia&quot; (respectively, &quot;Five&quot; and &quot;Six times loyal and faithful&quot;).

Where the legion was based when it received these titles from Gallienus is uncertain. Other things being equal one would have thought that Valerian, father and co-regent with Gallienus, would have wanted to take it to the east with him in the late 250s and that it would have been involved in his defeat and capture by King Sapor of the Persians at Edessa in 260. Since it continued as a functioning unit and avoided the subsequent pitfalls of over-identification with the rebellion of the Macrianii and Palmyra&#x27;s bid for autonomy under Zenobia, and given the honorific title appearing on coins of Gallienus, it is probable that it was under the command of Gallienus, not his father. However unlikely, it is possible that it would have returned to Europe as part of the army of the Macrianii and was forgiven by Gallienus after the latter were defeated. Besides an inscription from Macedonia giving thanks to the god Jupiter for the safety and well-being, &quot;pro salute et incolumitate,&quot; of Gallienus, and an inscription from Rome dating to AD 242 giving thanks to the legion&#x27;s &quot;Genius Gordiana and to Fortuna&quot; for keeping safe emperor Gordian and his spouse, there is little known regarding its fortunes in this period.

===Under Constantine I===
The II Parthica was in Italy at the end of the third century, but was almost certainly disbanded by Constantine I the Great after his victory at the Milvian bridge in 312, as we know that this emperor disbanded the imperial guard as a punishment for its support of the usurper Maxentius, and it is likely that this also meant the end of II Parthica.

==In Mesopotamia==

In the next century, a legion with the same name was garrisoned, together with II &quot;Armeniaca&quot; and II &quot;Flavia Virtutis&quot;, at the Roman fortified city of Bezabde (modern Cizre) on the Tigris and from the beginning of the 4th century II &quot;Parthica&quot; had abandoned Italy.

In 360, the Sassanid King Shapur II attacked and conquered Bezabde.

According to &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, II &quot;Parthica&quot; was in Cepha, Turkey, around 400, under the command of the &quot;Dux Mesopotamiae&quot;.

<text>Legio XVII (&quot;Seventeenth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. It was founded by Augustus around 41 BC. The legion was destroyed in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (September 9, 9). The legion&#x27;s symbol and &quot;cognomen&quot; are unknown.

This legion was probably created to deal with Sextus Pompey, the last opponent of the second triumvirate, garrisoned in Sicily and threatening Rome&#x27;s grain supply.

Following the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra in the battle of Actium (31 BC), the legion was stationed in Gaul. In the end of the 1st century BC, the Seventeenth was sent to the Germania provinces in the Rhine and was stationed in Castra Vetera (Xanten). In AD 5, the provinces were pacified and Publius Quinctilius Varus was assigned governor and commander of the Germania army.

On September 9, Arminius, leader of the Cheruscan allies, reported a rebellion in the Rhine area. Without suspecting the information received, Varus took his three legions, the XVII along with XVIII and XIX, and headed west. On 9 September, near modern Osnabrück, the Cheruscii led by Arminius ambushed the governor&#x27;s army. All three legions were destroyed in what is known as the battle of the Teutoburg Forest and their eagle standards lost. The eagle standards were recovered by the Romans in later years.

After its destruction, the Romans never used this legion number again.

<text>The white-tailed lapwing or white-tailed plover (Vanellus leucurus) is a wader in the lapwing genus. The genus name &quot;Vanellus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a lapwing and derives from &quot;vannus&quot; a winnowing fan. The specific &quot;leucurus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukouros&quot;, &quot;white-tailed&quot;.

This medium-sized lapwing is long-legged and fairly long-billed. It is the only lapwing likely to be seen in other than very shallow water, where it picks insects and other small prey mainly from the surface.

Adults are slim erect birds with a brown back and foreneck, paler face and grey breast. Its long yellow legs, pure white tail and distinctive brown, white and black wings make this species unmistakable. Young birds have a scaly back, and may show some brown in the tail.

The breeding season call is a &quot;peewit&quot;, similar to northern lapwing.

It breeds semi-colonially on inland marshes in Iraq, Kuwait, Iran and southern Russia. Four eggs are laid in a ground nest. The Iraqi and Iranian breeders are mainly residents, but Russian birds migrate south in winter to the Indian Subcontinent, the Middle East and north east Africa. It is a very rare vagrant in western Europe, the first example in Britain being found at Packington, Warwickshire on 12 July 1975.

In some parts of its distribution range the species faces threats related to habitat destruction and unintentional poaching.

The white-tailed lapwing is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="371117" wikidata="Q1934992" url="?curid=371117" title="North Sulawesi babirusa">
<text>The North Sulawesi babirusa (Babyrousa celebensis) is a pig-like animal native to Sulawesi and some nearby islands (Lembeh, Buton and Muna) in Indonesia. It has two pairs of large tusks composed of enlarged canine teeth. The upper canines penetrate the top of the snout, curving back toward the forehead. The North Sulawesi babirusa is threatened from hunting and deforestation.

The common and scientific names are various transcriptions of its local name, which literally translated means &quot;pig-deer&quot; (from Indonesian &quot;babi&quot;, &quot;pig&quot; + &quot;rusa&quot;, &quot;deer&quot; – see also Javan rusa) in reference to the huge tusks of the male suggestive of a deer&#x27;s antlers.

== Classification ==
Together with the other members of the genus &quot;Babyrousa&quot;, the North Sulawesi babirusa has usually been considered a subspecies of a widespread &quot;Babyrousa babyrussa&quot;, but recent work suggests that there may be several species, differentiable on the basis of geography, body size, amount of body hair, and the shape of the upper canine tooth of the male. Following the split, the &quot;true&quot; &quot;Babyrousa babyrussa&quot; is restricted to Buru and the Sula Islands.

Most experts agree that babirusas are part of the pig family, and are one of the oldest living members of the family, representing a subfamily, Babyrousinae, that branched off from the warthog branch of the pig family (Subfamily Phacochoerini) during the Oligocene or early Miocene.

==Appearance==

The North Sulawesi babirusa has a head-and-body length of and weighs up to . It is virtually hairless (easily revealing its greyish skin), and the tail-tuft is also nearly hairless. In males, the relatively long and thick upper canines are strongly curved. They emerge through the roof of the snout, while the long lower canines emerge through the side of the mouth. The upper canines can grow backwards in a curve until they penetrate the skull of the male babirusa.

In females, the canines are far shorter and typically do not protrude. In comparison, the Buru babirusa has relatively long, thick body hair, a well-developed tail-tuft, and relatively short and slender upper canines in males, while the Togian babirusa is larger, has a relatively well-developed tail-tuft, and the upper canines of the male are &quot;short, slender, rotated forwards, and always converge&quot;.

== Habitat ==
Its habitat is the underbrush of tropical forests and canebrakes, and the shores of rivers and lakes. Its mostly-hairless, mottled-grey-and-brown hide provide it with a degree of camouflage. The North Sulawesi Babirusa is known for its two pairs of tusks; both its upper and its lower pairs of canine teeth are greatly enlarged, and curve up and back towards the head. The upper canines of the male are so curved and enlarged that they emerge through the flesh, by way of holes, to pass through the top of the snout.

This species is protected by Indonesian law but is threatened by illegal hunting.

== Captivity ==

In captivity, the species is very inbred. The Bronx Zoo has an excellent breeding record for this animal, but it has also been bred at several other zoos such as St. Louis Zoo, Los Angeles Zoo, South Lakes Safari Zoo, Marwell Wildlife, Audubon Zoo and Chester Zoo.

In 2006, a male North Sulawesi Babirusa and a female domestic pig were accidentally allowed to interbreed in the Copenhagen Zoo. The offspring were five hybrid piglets, two of whom died from injuries received from their mother; the remaining three (two males and one female) were found to be infertile.

<doc id="371120" wikidata="Q4951966" url="?curid=371120" title="Boxing in the 1960s">
<text>During the 1960s, boxing, like mostly everything else around the world, went through changing times. Notable was the emergence of a young boxer named Cassius Clay, who would, in his own words &quot;shock the world&quot;, declare himself against war, and change his name to Muhammad Ali. 
Among significant boxers in lower weights, were middleweights Emile Griffith, Nino Benvenuti and Dick Tiger, and lightweights Joe Brown, Carlos Ortiz and Ismael Laguna as also bantamweight Eder Jofre. The first world champions from Venezuela, Brazil and Thailand were crowned during the 1960s, and the WBA and WBC started competing against each other, after the WBA changed its name from the National Boxing Association in 1962 and a group split from the WBA in 1963 to form the WBC.

A new division was created in the Jr. Middleweights, where a high school teacher, Freddie Little, was crowned world champion. Fights were seen on color television for the first time, and one of the most famous tragedies, Benny Kid Paret&#x27;s, was also shown live on TV.

==1960==

<text>The sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius), referred to as the sociable plover in the UK, is a wader in the plover family. It is a fully migratory bird, breeding in Kazakhstan and wintering in the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and Sudan. Historical literature referred to this bird as the Black-bellied lapwing.

==Taxonomy==
Along with other lapwings, it is placed in the genus &quot;Vanellus&quot;. The genus name is Medieval Latin for a lapwing and derives from &quot;vannus&quot; a winnowing fan. The specific &quot;gregarius&quot; is Latin for &quot;sociable&quot; from &quot;grex, gregis&quot;, &quot;flock&quot; referring to its tendency to be present alongside conspecifics and other closely related birds.

The sociable lapwing is one of many birds described by Pallas during his trip through the Russian landscape.

It is a monotypic species - no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

This medium-sized lapwing has longish black legs and a short black bill. Non breeding individuals in winter have light brown wings with a striking head pattern. The sociable lapwing has a black crown and eyestripe, the latter being bordered above and below with white. The underside of the bird is white. Its long-ish black legs, white tail with a black terminal band and distinctive brown, white and grey wings make it almost unmistakable in flight.

The summer breeding plumage is much more vivid. The brown feathers become grey-ish and slightly glossy with the exception of the cheeks, which are ochre. The stripes across the eyes and the bird’s crown are stronger in colour, and the lower breast of the bird takes on a black plumage which fades to rich chestnut-coloured feathers as they near the vent.
Juveniles have a bordered back feathers giving them a “scaly” appearance and only traces of the head pattern.

This bird resembles the more abundant white-tailed lapwing, but has a striped crown and dark grey legs as opposed to the yellow legs and plain head of the white-tailed lapwing. It is between in length. The call is a harsh &quot;kereck&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

Unlike other lapwings, that tend to gravitate towards wetter aquatic environments, the sociable lapwing prefers steppes, arid grasslands, as well as cultivated fields. It breeds in the steppes of Kazakhstan. Three to four eggs are laid in a ground nest. The sociable lapwing historically took two routes, a western and eastern route. On its western route, it passes over Central Asia and turkey to winter in Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, a few regions in Saudi Arabia, as well as Eastern Africa. On its eastern route, it winters in coastal Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and India.

In the case of two countries, however, the case is different. Qatar and Kuwait, the sociable lapwing was recorded historically as a vagrant, with the first sightings in the 80’s. As the nations industrialised, farms and parks were established throughout the countries. In particular, vagrants have visited the Rukaiya farm and Sulaibyia pivot fields in the early 2000’s have taken to repeatedly visiting or even wintering in the nations, giving rise to a third, Central migration route.

Once occupying a large range in Europe, the sociable lapwing has been practically wiped out from the continent. The remnants of the former Ukrainian population migrate to the Iberian peninsula, where up to five individuals may spend the winter. On their way, individuals have been observed in nearly every European country and the French Empire, often found alongside the Northern lapwing on its migratory and vagrancy trips. It feeds in a similar way, picking insects and other small prey mainly from grassland or arable land.

== Status==
The sociable lapwing’s population had always been difficult to quantify. It was estimated that the population has always been in decline, and especially following a major crash towards the end of the 20th century, leaving the current population at only 20-25% of its historical count.

The estimated population count was enhanced following decades long studies and, in October 2007, a superflock of approximately 3,200 sociable lapwings were discovered in Turkey, according to Guven Eken, director of the Turkish Nature Association. Additionally, 1500 sociable lapwings were found overwintering in Syria. The population is currently estimated to sit at 17 thousand individuals, and there was a reported increase in nests each year leading up to 2007, however it is difficult to determine whether this was an increase or simply more nests being found as a result of intensified fieldwork. The range of the sociable lapwing has heavily contracted as it has once existed from Ukraine to China.

The fieldwork undergone that led to the discoveries of thousands of sociable lapwings had led to the population being much larger than once feared, however it was also discovered adults have low survival rates, and the population is projected to decline at a similar or accelerated rate. The reasons for the crash of the population are largely unknown, but hunting along migratory flyways have been attributed as a notable threat at the very least.

<text>Marian Ruth Engel (née Passmore; May 24, 1933 – February 16, 1985) was a Canadian novelist and a founding member of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada. Her most famous and controversial novel was &quot;Bear&quot; (1976), a tale of erotic love between an archivist and a bear.

==Biography==
Born May 24, 1933, in Toronto, Ontario, Engel lived the first years of her life in foster care before being adopted by Frederick Searle and Mary Elizabeth (Fletcher) Passmore. Her father taught auto mechanics, taking on positions at schools across southwestern Ontario. The family moved frequently and Engel spent time as a child in Port Arthur, Brantford, Galt, Hamilton and Sarnia.

After graduating from the Sarnia Collegiate Institute &amp; Technical School, Engel obtained her Bachelor of Arts in Language Studies at McMaster University in 1955 and completed a Master of Arts in Canadian Literature at McGill University in 1957. Her M.A. supervisor while at McGill was author Hugh MacLennan, whom she corresponded with until her death. In 1960 Engel was awarded a Rotary Foundation Scholarship and spent a year studying French Literature at the Université d&#x27;Aix-Marseille in Aix-en Provence, France. Instead of returning to Canada the following year, she worked in England as a translator and began working on the unpublished manuscript &quot;Women Travelling Alone&quot;.

Engel met Howard Engel, a mystery novel writer and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio producer in Canada, and married him in England in 1962. They returned to Toronto in 1964. The couple had two children, twins William Lucas Passmore and Charlotte Helen Arabella. While raising her young family, Marian began to pursue a writing career. Marian and Howard separated in 1975 and divorced in 1977.

Engel taught briefly (1957–58) at The Study in Montreal, as well as at McGill University, the University of Montana-Missoula and St. John&#x27;s School in Cyprus. Engel was writer-in-residence at the University of Alberta from 1977 to 1978 and served the same role at the University of Toronto from 1980 to 1982. From 1975-1977 she served on the City of Toronto Book Award Committee (an award she won in 1981 for &quot;Lunatic Villas&quot;) and the Canadian Book and Periodical Development Council.

===Writers&#x27; rights advocacy===
Engel was a dedicated activist for the rights of Canadian writers on the national and international stage. She was the first chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, established in 1973, with early meetings taking place in her Toronto home. Engel also helped instigate the Public Lending Right Commission as a trustee on the Toronto Public Library Board from 1975-1978 .

Pensions for writers and royalties from library loans were two of the issues Engel championed. In a 1974 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; editorial, &quot;Our Authors are Being Ripped Off,&quot; Engel outlined a vision for author compensation based on library circulation statistics. She argued that authors are expected &quot;to live off that vapourous substance &#x27;prestige&#x27;&quot; and suggested that the uncompensated use of Canadian writers&#x27; work is a violation of copyright.

==Writing==
Marian Engel&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;No Clouds of Glory&quot;, was published in 1968. Later reissued in the United States as &quot;Sarah Bastard&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (1974), the work challenged traditional notions of female identity by using a fragmented approach to the subjective narrative that mirrored entries in a notebook.

Engel&#x27;s most famous and controversial novel was &quot;Bear&quot; (1976), a tale of erotic love between an archivist and a bear. Her editor at Harcourt Brace rejected the manuscript noting that: &quot;Its relative brevity coupled with its extreme strangeness presents, I&#x27;m afraid, an insuperable obstacle in present circumstances.&quot; It was eventually published by McClelland &amp; Stewart after being championed by Robertson Davies. It won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for Fiction in 1976.

&quot;Inside the Easter Egg&quot; (1975) and her posthumous &quot;The Tattooed Woman&quot; (1985) were collections of short stories. Some of these short stories had originally been written for Robert Weaver&#x27;s CBC radio program &quot;Anthology&quot;. The novel &quot;JOANNE: The Last Days of a Modern Marriage&quot; was originally commissioned as a radio-novel by CBC for the program &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot;. In addition to her novels, Engel wrote two children&#x27;s books; &quot;Adventures of Moon Bay Towers&quot; (1974) and &quot;My name is not Odessa Yarker&quot; (1977).

Engel was an avid journal keeper and she used them primarily as a repository for memories and details from which she drew for her fiction. In 1999, this material was edited and published as &quot;Marian Engel&#x27;s Notebook: &#x27;Ah, mon cahier, écoute...&quot;&#x27;.

From 1965 to 1985 she corresponded with literary peers and friends such as Hugh MacLennan, Robertson Davies, Dennis Lee, Margaret Atwood, Timothy Findley, Alice Munro, Margaret Laurence, Matt Cohen, Robert Weaver, Graeme Gibson and more. Some of this correspondence can be found in &quot;Dear Hugh, Dear Marian: the MacLennan-Engel Correspondence&quot; (1995) and &quot;Marian Engel: Life in Letters&quot; (2004)

===Themes===
Engel&#x27;s writing illustrated contemporary life with a focus on the day to day experiences of women. She described her work as an exploration of &quot;how you deal with an imperfect world when you have been brought up to look for perfection.&quot; The relationships between mothers and daughters, rooted in explorations of identify formation and subjective experiences, were a common theme. Doubled identities were also commonly used to illustrate the challenge of choosing between the push and pull of daily life – namely traditional gender roles and the imagined possibility of the &quot;other.&quot;

Although Engel&#x27;s writing garnered multiple awards, some viewed her focus on women and their search for self-fulfillment as one-note writing. Author Alice Munro disagreed, noting that Engel was one of the first to examine women&#x27;s lives &quot;at their most muddled&quot;, demonstrating it was possible to not only write but be published while writing about female experiences.

==Death==
Engel died in Toronto, of cancer, on February 16, 1985. Writers, including Gwendolyn MacEwen, read during a memorial service in her honour co-ordinated by Timothy Findley at The Music Gallery on February 28. &quot;Elizabeth and the Golden City&quot;, the novel Engel was working on at the time of her death, was left unfinished. It was incorporated into &quot;Marion and the Major: Engel&#x27;s Elizabeth and the Golden City&quot; by Christyl Verduyn and published in 2010.

After her death the Writer&#x27;s Development Trust of Canada instituted the $10,000 Marian Engel Award, which was presented annually to a woman writer in mid-career. The award was prompted by Engel&#x27;s friends and colleagues who established an endowment fund in her name to recognize significant literary achievement by female writers under the age of 45. The first contributor to the fund was Margaret Atwood. The Engel and Findley Awards are no longer awarded separately, but were combined into the new Writers&#x27; Trust Notable Author Award as of 2008, subsequently renamed the Writers&#x27; Trust Engel Findley Award.

<text>The Zorn Collections, or &quot;Zornsamlingarna&quot;, is a Swedish state museum, located in Mora, dedicated to preserving the works by painter Anders Zorn.

Anders Zorn was one of Sweden&#x27;s internationally best known artists. His fame abroad was founded mainly on his portraiture, with his ability to capture the character and personality of the depicted person. His nude studies are also very famous, as are his genre pictures which mostly depict working people and in which his swift and elegant impressionistic technique found its fullest scope.

The Zorn Collections administers Anders and Emma Zorn&#x27;s donation to the Swedish State. The Zorn Collections consists of four museums: Zorngården, Zorn Museum, Zorn&#x27;s Gammelgård &amp; Textilkammare and Zorn&#x27;s Gopsmor.

==Museums==
*Zorngården was the home of Anders and Emma Zorn. It is shown today as it was at the time of Emma Zorn&#x27;s death in 1942. Drawing inspiration from English and Swedish architecture, it is a fine example of the architecture which characterizes the years around 1900.
*The Zorn Museum (Swedish: &quot;Zornmuseet&quot;), Ragnar Östberg&#x27;s last work, is a two-storied rectangular brick building in the classical style. The Zorn Museum mainly displays for work by Anders Zorn and examples of his artistic variety - oil paintings, water colors, etchings and sculptures.
*Gammelgård is Zorn&#x27;s old farm consisting of about 40 old houses, grouped around a farm, a mill, chalets, and boathouses. Gammelgård provides the opportunity to see how the Dalarna farmers lived in the past. Textilkammare, the Textile Room, was added in 1993 to display parts of the Zorn family&#x27;s collection of country textiles.
*Gopsmor was a combination of a fishing cottage and a wilderness studio, situated some 20 kilometers to the north of Mora. Zorn arranged for some old log buildings to be moved there. It became something of an escape for him when he became too well known in Mora.

<text>Columbia Metropolitan Airport is the main commercial airport for Columbia and the Midlands region of South Carolina, United States. The airport is located in West Columbia, southwest of Columbia, in Lexington County. It is surrounded by the city of Cayce and the towns of Springdale, Pine Ridge, and South Congaree. The airport is a regional cargo hub for UPS Airlines.

==History==

===World War II era===
The airport was built in 1940 as Lexington County Airport. In 1940, the United States Army Air Corps indicated a need for the airfield as part of the buildup of its forces after World War II began in Europe. The earliest recorded Air Corps use of the airport was when the 105th Observation Squadron began flying Douglas O-38 and North American O-47 light observation aircraft on 24 September.

In 1941, the airport came under formal military control, and an immediate program began to turn the civil airport into a military airfield. On 8 December 1941, as the Columbia Army Air Base, Columbia Army Airfield&#x27;s mission was a training base for B-25 Mitchell crews.

One of the earliest units to train at Columbia AAB was the 17th Bombardment Group, which arrived on 9 February 1942. When the group arrived in Columbia, its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an &quot;extremely hazardous&quot; but unspecified mission which ultimately turned out to be the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan. Contrary to popular belief, the volunteers who made up the crews of the Doolittle Raid did not train for the raid itself at Columbia.

Training at Columbia Army Air Base was phased down during the summer of 1945. Several units arrived at the base from overseas to inactivate during September and October. It was inactivated by the U.S. Army Air Forces on 30 November and returned to civil authorities, who converted it back to an airport. The 350th Bombardment Squadron was assigned to Columbia Metropolitan Airport on 16 July 1947 as part of the Air Force Reserve, but it was never equipped or manned; it was inactivated on 27 June 1949.

===Postwar use===

Before World War II, Columbia&#x27;s main civil airport had been Owens Field. However, its location near downtown made expansion impossible. Accordingly, in 1947, most frontline passenger service relocated to Lexington County Airport, which was renamed Columbia Metropolitan Airport. The city of Columbia built a new terminal at the airport in the early 1950s. It burned down, and a new one was built in its place.

In 1962, the Richland-Lexington Airport District was established to operate the airport. It is governed by a 12-member commission–five nominated by Lexington County&#x27;s legislative delegation, five nominated by Richland County&#x27;s legislative delegation, and two nominated by the Columbia city council.

Passenger service began on Delta Air Lines which has served Columbia for over 70 years. Delta began flights from Columbia to Charleston, Asheville, Jacksonville, Augusta, Savannah and New York–La Guardia. Delta DC-9 jet flights began March 7, 1966, with Flight 521 from Charleston continuing to Atlanta.

Eastern Airlines flew to Charlotte, Washington, and New York; it first scheduled jets to CAE in 1965. Piedmont Airlines flew from Augusta, Florence, and Charlotte in 1962. Southern Airways flew to Charleston and Greenville/Spartanburg. In January 1978, Eastern started flights to Atlanta after a route swap with Piedmont Airlines. Southern Airways left in December 1978, six months before their merger with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines. Atlantis Airlines started service in 1979 for a brief time using Twin Otter aircraft. Piedmont Airlines introduced nonstop service to Miami in January 1980, but dropped Columbia in June 1980 leaving only Delta and Eastern for a time.

In November 1982, Piedmont Airlines returned to Columbia with flights to Charlotte and later Newark. American Airlines would start service in 1985 to Raleigh and United Airlines would fly to Charlotte and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare. PeopleExpress and Continental Airlines. Freedom Airlines operated Convairs to Columbia in 1983. United Express (operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines) entered the market May 24, 1999, with service to Washington–Dulles and added Chicago–O&#x27;Hare on July 1, 2000. Northwest Airlines (operated by Pinnacle Airlines) came to Columbia on October 6, 2003, offering service to Detroit. On October 30, 2005, American Eagle returned after a nine-year absence with service to Dallas/Fort Worth after Delta closed their DFW hub earlier that year. In October 2010, US Airways Express operated by Air Wisconsin began non-stops to New York–La Guardia, but wound up discontinuing it as a result of a New York–La Guardia slot swap with Delta, which now has two daily flights to the airport.

Since 2000, the airport has tried to recruit low-cost carriers, but has been unable to maintain those services. Allegiant Air tried service to Orlando/Sanford, St. Petersburg/Clearwater and Fort Lauderdale in Florida, yet these services did not last. Independence Air served Columbia briefly in 2004 and 2005 with service to Washington–Dulles before ceasing its operations in January 2006. In May 2008, Spirit Airlines began service to Fort Lauderdale but terminated the route in March 2009. In 2011, Vision Airlines launched service to Destin, Florida, ending the route after a month.

In 2015, United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to step down after it was revealed that he had continued to run an unprofitable route to the airport from Newark Liberty International Airport for former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey chairman David Samson.

On June 7, 2018, American Airlines restored mainline service to Columbia with two daily nonstop flights to Dallas/Fort Worth. The airline also announced it would start flights to/from Miami by the end of 2019.

==Facilities==
The airport covers and has two runways: 11/29 is and 5/23 is . It has a helipad. The center of runway 5/23 is asphalt; the edges are grooved concrete.

The airport is a hub for UPS Airlines and was a hub for Air South, a former low-cost carrier.

For the year ending February 22, 2022 the airport had 63,338 aircraft operations, an average of 174 per day: 46% general aviation, 23% air taxi, 23% airline and 8% military. In November 2023, there were 81 aircraft based at this airport: 44 single-engine, 13 multi-engine, 14 jet, 5 helicopter and 5 gliders.

The terminal opened May 30, 1965, and was renovated in 1997. The renovation was designed by Heyward, Woodrum, Fant &amp; Associates, Ltd. It replaces a terminal built in the early 1950s which was a replacement of a terminal built several years earlier in the early 1950s. Since the late 1980s, capital improvements have been undertaken, including a renovated and expanded terminal, a new parking garage (completed in 2003), the lengthening of the runways, and better interstate access. The terminal has several services, including gift shops, the Everett Adams Memorial Chapel, restaurants and bars inside the terminal. Free wireless internet service is provided throughout the airport as well as small number of recharge stations with access to outlets.

Police and fire/rescue services are provided by the Columbia Metro Airport Department of Public Safety. Public safety officers are South Carolina Police Academy Class 1 officers, and South Carolina Fire Academy IFSAC Firefighter II, and Airport Firefighter. Some have basic EMT certifications. The Department has three ARFF units, one RIV unit, one fire pumper, and a service truck. Law enforcement is covered by four patrol vehicles. The Department provides fire services at the FAR 139 level only. Structural firefighting is handled by Lexington County Fire Service.

==Airlines and destinations==
Passenger service is currently provided by five scheduled airlines, with commercial cargo service being handled by three scheduled airlines and numerous air freight operators. Two fixed-base operators also serve the Metro facility with various charter flights. The airport maintains a newly dedicated air cargo terminal, the Columbia Airport Enterprise Park (CAE Park) and Foreign Trade Zone #127. Columbia Metropolitan Airport recently completed a $45 million terminal expansion and renovation. Annually, the airport serves about 1 million passengers, though prior to the Great Recession, nearly 1.5 million passengers were served.

<doc id="371133" wikidata="Q1104955" url="?curid=371133" title="Cocacolonization">
<text>Cocacolonization (alternatively coca-colonization) refers to the globalization of American culture (also referred to as Americanization) pushed through popular American products such as the soft-drink brand Coca-Cola. The term is a portmanteau of the name of the multinational soft-drink maker and &quot;colonization&quot;.

The term was first documented in 1949 in Australia
and in France, where the French Communist Party strongly opposed the further expansion of Coca-Cola. In 1948, the French finance ministry stood against &quot;Coke&quot; on the grounds that its operation would bring no capital to help with French recovery, and was likely to drain profits back to the parent company in the United States. The French Communist Party also warned that the Coke distribution-system would double as an espionage network.

In World War II (1939-1945) and the Cold War (1947-1991), many outside of the United States associated Coca-Cola with American culture. Seeing ties to the culture of the United States, some Europeans rejected perceived attempts to cocacolonize
their countries, objecting to what they saw as an invasion of their nationalistic identities. Europeans saw Coca-Cola not just as a carbonated refreshment, but as bottled America. By the end of the Cold War, American ideals were spread across the world by Coke and in certain cases, used to combat Communism.

Cocacolonization as a historical concept gained visibility in the Americanization debate in Europe with the 1994 publication of Reinhold Wagnleitner&#x27;s book &quot;Coca-Colonization and the Cold War: The Cultural Mission of the United States in Austria After the Second World War&quot;. Wagnleitner used &quot;Coca-Colonization&quot; to embody the premise of his book: the United States of America attempted cultural imperialism by expanding American ideals through the spread of consumer goods such as Coca-Cola and Levi jeans, and through cultural symbols like rock and roll and Marlon Brando&#x27;s black leather jacket, as well as through the promotion of democracy in Europe.

The expression &quot;coca-colonization&quot; also appears in medical literature to describe the lifestyle changes and the associated increase of incidence of characteristic chronic diseases, e.g. type 2 diabetes.

== History ==
The concept of Cocacolonization began at the beginning of World War II. Over time, some countries resisted the American soft drink while others openly accepted it. To all, it represented America and its culture and at a majority of major historical events during the 20th century, Coke was in attendance.

=== World War II ===
When war broke out and American troops were sent overseas, the Coca-Cola company vowed that any American in uniform should be able to get a Coke for five cents wherever they were. As a result, the company built bottling stations in the Pacific and on the Western front.

Nazis recognized Coke to be a &quot;Jewish-American&quot; drink. In response, the regime only allowed Coke in the country if it displayed a swastika on the bottle, which it did. In the Soviet Union, war hero Marshal Georgi Zhukov loved the drink, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin viewed it as a symbol of American imperialism and forbade its consumption. As a solution, Coca-Cola developed a clear version of the drink bottled with a white cap and red star as a disguise to allow Zhukov to consume Cola without suspicion.

On the Pacific front of the war, Coke had a tough time reaching the troops. To address the issue, the company created portable soda fountains that were distributed throughout the islands on the Pacific Ocean. Asian countries experienced Coca-Cola. According to the company, the drink spread throughout the islands because, &quot;Coke symbolized the American way of life.&quot;

Throughout the war, Coke dispersed ads for their soda all over the world. The majority of the ads displayed an American soldier drinking a soda with the natives of that country. If the ad was in a country outside of the United States, it was written in the native language of that country. Popular ads had positive images of Americans with Coke in New Zealand, Russia, the Philippines, Newfoundland, Italy, England, and in Poland. According to Coca-Cola, &quot;From the jungles of the Admiral Islands to the officer clubs in the Riviera,&quot; Coke and America was there.

=== Late 1940s and the Cold War ===
The end of World War II marked up by widespread cocacolonization of Europe and Asia. In 1947, Coca-Cola bottling operations began in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; then Switzerland, Italy, and France by 1949. Author Mark Gordon said, &quot;American ideals were now being pushed on Europeans every time they sipped a bottle of Coke.&quot; By the early 1950s, there were 63 bottling plants expanding across three continents including the countries of: Egypt, Iceland, Iran, West Africa, and New Guinea. Many US companies benefitted from expansion into Europe, including Coca-Cola. Through these foreign endeavours, the US was able to informally create a business and corporate empire via the expansion of several US companies.

By the time of the Cold War, Coke met resistance in some countries. Italians kept from indulging in the soda. Austrians recognized the expansion of the company as an attempt to spread American culture and ideals overseas. In France, French communists spread awareness about Coca-Cola. They coined the term cocacolonization because they saw the spread of Coke in their country as an attempt to make it an American colony. When the company attempted to open a bottling plant in the country, French Communists threatened to barricade Paris to keep Coke out. To the French, the company represented capitalist America.

At the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Communism in Germany in November 1989, Coca-Cola handed out sodas.

== Significance ==

=== Health factors ===
Medical experts use the term cocacolonization in their medical journals representing the spread of unhealthy American foods overseas.

A significant shift in nutrition has occurred. Developed nations export processed foods that are high in trans fats and refined sugar to developing nations, causing a change from previous methods of survival such as hunting and gathering.

Cocacolonization has been linked to the spike in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases because of the connection between economic situation and low costs of high fat, high sugar foods.

Due to an increase in tourism in their area, the Mayan tribe in the Yucatán Peninsula experienced a decline in health because they were introduced to unhealthy American foods. They became increasingly dependent on the foods. Similarly, the Tz&#x27;utujill tribe in Guatemala was also introduced to the same food and encountered the same decline in health. Worldwide, type 2 diabetes spread and steadily increased over the next 20 years. The explanation for their decline in health was cocacolonization.

=== Widespread ===
As of 2015, Coca-Cola has been distributed to over 200 countries worldwide. A few of the many countries consist of China, Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Russia, Canada, United Kingdom, Algeria, and Libya. According to the company, &quot;Coca-Cola is the second-most understood term in the world behind &quot;okay.&quot;

Coca-Cola as a product has stretched across international borders to create a brand. “In much political, academic and conversational rhetoric the term Coca-Cola comes to stand, not just for a particular soft drink, but also for the problematic nature of commodities in general. It is a meta-commodity. … It may stand for commodities or capitalism, but equally Imperialism or Americanization.” Cocacolonization as referring to the spread of American culture and/or brands; Coca-Cola is an example of the widespread infrastructure of westernized capitalism and consumerism. There have been several notable pushbacks against Cocacolonization. In 2012, Bolivia&#x27;s Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca (alongside President Evo Morales) unsuccessfully tried to place a ban on Coca-Cola in a move against Western imperialism and capitalism.

Coca-Cola operates via franchises; therefore, for areas to benefit from its production, local bottling plants are required. Trinidad obtained the franchise in 1939, so in Trinidad Coke was bottled by the firm of Cannings - which, like other older colonial firms, was taken over, in Cannings&#x27; case in 1975.

In Trinidad, sweet drinks are not viewed as luxury items, but instead as everyday items of the common man. In relation to Coca-Cola, “the centrality of the black sweet drink to Trinidadian drinking is above all summed up in the notion of a “rum and Coke” as the core alcoholic drink for most people of the island.” Having a common drink that requires the existence of an exact sweet drink emphasizes its hold on the local environment.

<text>Tivadar Soros (; born Theodor Schwartz; 7 April 1893 – 22 February 1968) was a Hungarian lawyer, author and editor. He is best known for being the father of billionaire George Soros, and engineer Paul Soros.

He was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Nyírbakta, Hungary, near the border with Ukraine. His father had a general store and sold farm equipment. When Tivadar was eight, his father moved the family to Nyiregyhaza, the regional center in north-eastern Hungary, providing a somewhat less isolated life experience.

He first met his wife Erzsébet when she was eleven years old during a visit to the home of her father Mor Szücs, a cousin of his own father.

He studied law at the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca), in what was then Hungarian Transylvania. 

Soros fought in World War I and spent years in a prison camp in Siberia before escaping. He founded the Esperanto literary magazine &quot;Literatura Mondo&quot; (&quot;Literary World&quot;) in 1922, having learned the language from a fellow soldier during the war, and edited it until 1924. 

In 1936, Soros changed the family&#x27;s surname from the German-Jewish &quot;Schwartz&quot; to &quot;Soros&quot;, in an attempt to protect the family from Hungary&#x27;s increasing antisemitism. Soros was said to like the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning; in Hungarian, &quot;&quot; means &quot;next&quot;; in Esperanto it means &quot;will soar&quot;.

Soros forged paperwork, giving the family&#x27;s new alias, as the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944. The family fled to safe houses for nearly a year, until Soviet forces invaded the country.

Soros died of cancer in New York in 1968.

==Publications==

* &quot;Modernaj Robinzonoj&quot; (&quot;Modern Robinsons&quot;) (1923), a short account of his escape from a Russian prison camp, which was republished in 1999 by Esperanto publisher Bero and was translated into several languages, including English (&quot;Crusoes in Siberia&quot;, Mondial, 2010). 

* &quot;Maskerado ĉirkaŭ la morto&quot; (&quot;Masquerade around death&quot;) (1965), an autobiographical novel about Soros&#x27;s experience during the Nazi occupation of Budapest. It has been translated into English (&quot;Maskerado: Dancing Around Death&quot; London: Canongate, 2000), French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Czech, Russian, German and Turkish.

<doc id="371147" wikidata="Q5456091" url="?curid=371147" title="Five Points (Columbia, South Carolina)">
<text>Five Points in Columbia, South Carolina is a shopping, restaurant, and nightlife area that attracts customers from the nearby University of South Carolina and the Columbia metropolitan area. It is the center for the city&#x27;s annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival.

It was Columbia&#x27;s first neighborhood shopping district, named for the intersection of Harden Street, Devine Street, and Santee Avenue. It was home to Columbia&#x27;s first supermarket (an A &amp; P), first Chinese restaurant (Kester’s Bamboo House), and the first bar in South Carolina to serve a cocktail (the Stage Door, which claimed to sell the state&#x27;s first legal mixed drink after the South Carolina General Assembly approved the use of minibottles in 1973).

When streetcars were prevalent, Five Points was a hub (rotating circle) for moving between downtown Columbia and the residential area of Shandon.

In 2019, Five Points was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
