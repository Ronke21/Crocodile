<text>Mansion House is a London Underground station in the City of London which takes its name from Mansion House, the residence of the Lord Mayor of London. It opened in 1871 as the eastern terminus of the Metropolitan District Railway. Today, Mansion House is served by the Circle and District lines. It is between Blackfriars and Cannon Street stations and it is in fare zone 1. The station is located at the junction of Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street.

Mansion House is a sub-surface station with three platforms. The westbound platform, number 1, and the eastbound platform, number 3, are shared by both the Circle and District lines. A third platform was used for terminating eastbound trains, however it is no longer used and the track removed as services continue and terminate at Tower Hill.

Despite the station&#x27;s name, it is not the nearest tube station to Mansion House itself, which is in fact directly opposite an entrance to Bank station. Moreover, two other stations on the same District and Circle lines ( and Monument) are also nearer to Mansion House than its namesake.

==History==
Mansion House station was opened on 3 July 1871 by the Metropolitan District Railway (MDR, now the District line) when the company extended its line eastwards from St. Paul&#x27;s station (which is now named Blackfriars). Mansion House became the new eastern terminus of the MDR.

The MDR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

On 1 February 1872, the MDR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London line) which it connected to at Addison Road station (now named Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the MDR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the MDR to Mansion House.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through Westminster running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, to the West London Line to Addison Road and the MDR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the MDR.

From 1 March 1883, the District operated a service between Mansion House and Windsor, using Great Western Railway tracks from a junction installed just east of Ealing Broadway station, but it was unremunerative and ceased on 30 September 1885.

On 10 October 1884, the MDR and the MR jointly opened the line eastwards to Mark Lane station (closed 1967), thereby completing the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

The first penny chocolate vending machine in the country was installed in the station in July 1886.

In 1897 the MDR obtained parliamentary permission to construct a deep-level railway running between Gloucester Road and Mansion House, beneath the existing sub-surface line. This new line was to be an express route using electric trains to relieve congestion on the sub-surface tracks. Mansion House was to be the terminus of the express route, with platforms below the sub-surface ones. No immediate work was carried out on the deep-level line, and the subsequent take over of the MDR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and the resignalling and electrification of the MDR&#x27;s routes between 1903 and 1905 meant that congestion was relieved without needing to construct the deep-level line. The plan was dropped in 1908.
On 30 June 1900, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908, the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service was also withdrawn.

In the 1920s Mansion House station&#x27;s entrance was rebuilt to a design by Charles Holden. It featured a tall glazed screen with the Underground roundel similar to his station designs for the extension to Morden of the City &amp; South London Railway (now the Northern line) opened between 1924 and 1926.

In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated &quot;Inner Circle&quot; was given its own identity on the Tube map as the Circle line.

On 29 October 1989, the station was closed for the construction of a new entrance and for further renovation. It reopened on 11 February 1991.

During the weekend of 8–9 October 2016 the west-facing bay platform number 2 was decommissioned and the track removed; all District line trains now continue to Tower Hill. the hydraulic buffer at the east end of platform 2 is still in place.

<text>Marble Arch is a London Underground station near Marble Arch in the City of Westminster. It is on the Central line between Lancaster Gate and Bond Street stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 1.

==History==
The station was opened on 30 July 1900 by the Central London Railway (CLR).

Like all the original stations on the CLR, Marble Arch was served by lifts to the platforms but the station was reconstructed in the early 1930s to accommodate escalators. This saw the closure of the original station building, designed by the architect Harry Bell Measures, that was situated on the corner of Quebec Street and Oxford Street, and a replacement sub-surface ticket hall opened further to the west. The new arrangements came into use on 15 August 1932. The original surface building was later demolished.

The platforms, originally lined in plain white tiles, were refitted with decorative vitreous enamel panels in 1985. The panel graphics were designed by Annabel Grey.

The station was modernised in 2010, resulting in new finishes in all areas of the station, apart from the retention of many of the decorative enamel panels at platform level.

==The station today==
The station is named after the Marble Arch nearby and is located at the north east side of the Marble Arch junction, at the western end of Oxford Street.

There is a siding to the west of the station allowing trains from Epping, Hainault and Woodford to terminate here. It is not commonly used but it is still retained for emergencies and when engineering works take place.

==Incidents==

On 27 April 2018, a 90-year old man, Robert Malpas, was suddenly and without warning pushed onto the train tracks, suffering a broken pelvis and a head wound. A bystander rescued him from the tracks, and the perpetrator - who was unknown to Malpas - was later found guilty of attempted murder and jailed for life. The incident was captured on CCTV.

<doc id="373528" wikidata="Q1473963" url="?curid=373528" title="Pimlico tube station">
<text>Pimlico () is a London Underground station in Pimlico, City of Westminster. The station is on the Victoria line between Vauxhall and Victoria stations in fare zone 1. It was a late addition to the line, not appearing in the original plans, and the last to open in 1972.

The station is the only one on the line without an interchange to any other railway line or Underground line, and is the deepest beneath sea level. It is the main transport access point for the Tate Britain gallery. The station is known for its distinctive artwork, which reflects its proximity to the Tate Britain. Several buildings surrounding the station are Grade II listed, though the station itself is not.

==Location and name==

The station is in London fare zone 1 at the junction of Bessborough Street and Rampayne Street. There are three entrances; entrance A with the ticket hall is on the east side of Rampayne Street, while exit C is on the west side of Bessborough Street. An additional exit, B is further along on Bessborough Street to the east of these two. There are two platforms; platform 1 serves trains northbound to Victoria while platform 2 serves trains southbound to Vauxhall. The platforms are around below ground. 

The main entrance forms part of an eight-storey octagonal building, designed in 1976 by William Whitfield of Whitfield and Partners, and erected between 1980 and 1983. It was a speculative development by the Crown Commissioners, and consists of a concrete frame with a skin of red bricks, which is load-bearing. The building is an example of post-modernist architecture, and is Grade II listed in recognition of this, although the tube station is specifically excluded from the listing. Next to the station entrance is a sculptural ventilation shaft, designed and built between 1978 and 1982 by the artist Eduardo Paolozzi. The casting was produced by the Robert Taylor Foundry in Larbert, Scotland. This is also Grade II listed, and is part of the ventilation system for the basement of 2 Bessborough Street and 33 Vauxhall Bridge Road.

Both the station and the surrounding area are believed to be named after a 16th-century publican, Ben Pimlico, who was well known for brewing nut-brown ale. Pimlico is the only station on the Victoria line which does not have an interchange with another Underground or National Rail line. There is no step-free access. It is the deepest station on the line measured by average depth of platform below sea-level, at .

==History==

When the extension of the Victoria line to Brixton via Stockwell was approved in 1966, there were discussions about building an additional station between Victoria and the River Thames. It was not included in the original plans for the extension, as there were concerns that it would not be financially viable or support enough footfall. However, there was strong local support for a station as it would better serve the surrounding community, and would immediately improve access to the Tate Gallery (now Tate Britain). The Crown Estate offered free land for a site. 

In June 1968, Minister of Transport Richard Marsh approved a proposal to build the station, following work by London Transport that showed &quot;considerable benefits&quot; to the local area, despite the station not being profitable to operate. The extension to Brixton opened on 23 July 1971, but Pimlico station was not yet complete, and trains passed through slowly without stopping.

Construction of the sub-surface works was complicated by the presence of the Kings Scholars Pond Sewer, also known as the Tachbrook, which runs under the road along the southern edge of the ticket hall. Bessborough Street covers a large number of pipes and mains which had to be avoided, while the escalator shaft had to be excavated through water-bearing gravel. As at Vauxhall on the south side of the Thames, the ground had to be frozen to prevent it collapsing during construction.

The station was opened by the Lord Mayor of Westminster on 14 September 1972 – more than a year after the rest of the line had become fully operational – and began serving regular passengers that afternoon. The total estimated cost was £1.4 million. Pimlico was the last Underground station to open until the first section of the Piccadilly line&#x27;s Heathrow extension was opened to Hatton Cross in 1975. After Blackhorse Road station was re-sited to interchange with the Victoria line in 1981, Pimlico became the only station on the line without any direct connections to any other.

In March 2015, the station was chosen to be the test site station for &#x27;Wayfindr&#x27;, an app that helps visually impaired people navigate their way through the station using iBeacon devices. The trial was successful, which subsequently led to a $1 million grant from Google, and the app was installed at other stations.

The station was closed in 2020 from 21 March to 18 May in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where non-essential travel was restricted. In July 2021, the station was temporarily closed again because of a lack of staff, after over 300 Transport for London (TfL) staff self-isolated as a result of COVID.

==Artwork==

Along with other stations on the Victoria line, Pimlico station features distinctive artwork motifs in the station building. The platform walls are covered with tiles decorated with a series of op art yellow spots designed by Peter Sedgley, who derived it from his 1968 piece, &quot;Go&quot;. Sedgley was chosen by Sir Misha Black, who had formed London Transport&#x27;s Design Research Unit, which oversaw the design of the whole Victoria Line. Black wanted a contemporary artist to create the tiles for Pimlico, because of its closeness to the Tate Gallery, but Sedgley&#x27;s request that the tiles should be set in a washable grout was ignored, and the grout has become blacker with time because of the dusty air on the platforms.

A poster by David Booth was installed at the station in 1987 as part of the &quot;Art on the Underground&quot; series. It features the various underground lines as paint squeezed from a tube, with the tube itself positioned at Pimlico. The poster has become well known, and has been reprinted on a number of occasions. It is now held at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden.

==Incidents==
On 1 December 2019, a passenger was killed after being hit by a train. The station was evacuated and services suspended on the Victoria line between Victoria and Brixton.

In 2023, a cat was found on the Victoria line by tube drivers. He had been transported to the UK from Dubai for rehoming but had been left at Pimlico station. After several attempts, he was rescued two weeks later.

It opened on 30 July 1900, as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Road&quot;, and was renamed on 1 September 1946. The building is an unusual survivor of the buildings designed for the Central London Railway by Harry Bell Measures, with a flat roof so that commercial development could take place above – in this case, a hotel. The Coburg hotel opened in 1907: its design features three cupolas, over shops and Queensway station.
It was used as a location on the 1953 British film The Yellow Balloon (film).

==The station today==
There is a crossover east of the station to allow trains to terminate there. The crossover is not often used.

===Refurbishment===
The station was closed between 8 May 2005 and 14 June 2006 for refurbishment. These works were prompted by the need to replace the station&#x27;s two (very old) lifts, which had been breaking down quite frequently prior to the station&#x27;s closure. In addition the station had been modernised and re-tiled, as well as having replicas of the original lamps fitted to the façade.

Metronet, the private maintenance contractors, were originally given a deadline of 9 May 2006 to complete the works. When they failed to meet this or the revised 12 June deadline, Transport for London issued a harshly worded press release quoting London Underground Managing Director Tim O&#x27;Toole as saying &quot;This is a further, and one hopes final, pathetic delay on a project that Metronet has failed to manage to time.&quot; The station finally re-opened on 14 June 2006.

During refurbishment, the closest station was on the Circle and District lines, which is also located on Queensway approximately 100 metres north of the Queensway station. While the two stations are in close proximity, they are not connected.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 70, 94, 148 and night route N207 serve the station.

<doc id="373537" wikidata="Q1530578" url="?curid=373537" title="Sloane Square tube station">
<text>Sloane Square () is a London Underground station in Chelsea, serving Sloane Square. It is served by the Circle and District lines, between South Kensington and Victoria stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 1.

The entrance to the station is on the east side of Sloane Square (A3217). It is adjacent to the Royal Court Theatre and is the nearest station for King&#x27;s Road shopping, the Peter Jones department store and the Cadogan Hall.

==History==

The station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) when the company opened the first section of its line between South Kensington and Westminster stations.
The construction of the station was complicated by the crossing of the site by the River Westbourne which ran through Hyde Park as the Serpentine Lake and was originally crossed by the Knight&#x27;s Bridge at Knightsbridge. The river was carried above the platform in a large iron pipe suspended from girders. This pipe remains in place today.

The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London line) to which it connected at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) from Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road. From Addison Road it ran over DR tracks to Mansion House.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through Sloane Square running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road then, via a now demolished link, to the West London line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated by the Great Western Railway.

On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was also withdrawn.

In the late 1930s, the station building was rebuilt in the modern style. Escalators were installed between the ticket hall and the platforms in early 1940, making the station the first on the sub-surface network to have escalators. The new station building did not last long as it was mostly destroyed during World War II. A German bomb that fell in November 1940 killed 37 and injured 79 passengers on a train in the station and destroyed the ticket hall, escalators and the glazed roof over the tracks.

In 1949, the Metropolitan line operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line. By 1951 the station had been rebuilt again in a similar style to the 1930s building. The arched glass roof was not replaced and the current station does not have the light open atmosphere of the original. The office building above the station entrance is a later addition.

The Hole in the Wall pub on the eastbound platform existed from 1868 to 1985.

===Incidents and accidents===
On 5 April 1960, Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the Llewelyn Davies boys who were the inspiration for the boy characters of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, and who resented the public association with the character named after him, committed suicide by throwing himself under a train as it was pulling into the station.

On 26 December 1973, a terrorist bomb exploded in the telephone kiosk in the booking office. No one was injured.

===Former Chelsea-Hackney line proposal===

Sloane Square was considered as a potential station on the long-proposed &quot;Chelsea-Hackney line&quot; which has been absorbed into plans for Crossrail 2. The station is no longer on the planned route.

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 11, 19, 22, 137, 170, 211, 319, 360, 452, C1 and night routes N11, N19, N22 and N137 serve the station.

==In popular culture==
Sloane Square is one of two tube stations (the other being South Kensington) mentioned in the song &quot;When you&#x27;re lying awake&quot; from the operetta &quot;Iolanthe&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan.

<text> (, ), which means , is the motto of the monarch of the United Kingdom. It appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the version of the coat of arms of the United Kingdom used outside Scotland. The motto is said to have first been used by Richard I (1157–1199) as a battle cry (he spoke French and Occitan but knew only basic English) and the concept of the divine right of the monarch to govern. It was adopted as the royal motto of England by King Henry V (1386–1422), with the phrase &quot;and my right&quot; referring to his claim by descent to the French crown.

==Language==
The motto is French for &quot;God and my right&quot;, meaning that the king is &quot;&quot; (&quot;King of England by the grace of God&quot;). It is used to imply that the monarch of a nation has a God-given (divine) right to rule.

It was not unusual for the royal coat of arms of the Kingdom of England to have a French rather than English motto, given that Norman French was the primary language of the English Royal Court and ruling class following the rule of William the Conqueror of Normandy and later the Plantagenets. Another Old French phrase also appears in the full achievement of the Royal Arms: the motto of the Order of the Garter, (&quot;Shamed be the one who thinks ill of it&quot;), appears on a representation of a garter behind the shield. Modern French spelling has changed to , but the motto has not been updated.

==Other translations==
 has been translated in several ways, including &quot;God and my right&quot;, &quot;God and my right hand&quot;, &quot;God and my lawful right&quot;, and &quot;God and my right shall me defend&quot;.

The literal translation of is &quot;God and my right&quot;. However, &quot;Kearsley&#x27;s Complete Peerage&quot;, published in 1799, translates it to mean &quot;God and my right hand&quot; (in standard French that would be , not ). The Kearsley volume appeared during publication of the 1st edition (1796–1808) of the German , which emphasised the raising of the &quot;right hand&quot; during installations and coronations of German Kings.

Diderot&#x27;s &quot;&quot; lists the motto as , which Susan Emanuel translated as &quot;God is my right&quot;.

==Use as royal motto==

 has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs, and later by British monarchs, since being adopted by Henry V. It was first used as a battle cry by King Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France and after he made it his motto. Medieval Europeans did not believe that victory necessarily went to the side with the better army, but (as they also viewed personal trial by combat) to the side that God viewed with favour. Hence Richard wrote after his victory &quot;It is not us who have done it but God and our right through us&quot;. So after his victories on the crusades &quot;Richard was speaking what he believed to be the truth when he told the Holy Roman Emperor: &#x27;.

Alternatively, the Royal Arms may depict a monarch&#x27;s personal motto. For example, Elizabeth I and Queen Anne&#x27;s often displayed ; Latin for &quot;Always the same&quot;, and James I&#x27;s depicted , Latin for &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers&quot;.
==Current usages==

 has been adopted along with the rest of the Royal Coat of Arms by &quot;The Times&quot; as part of its masthead. When it incorporated the Coat of Arms in 1875, half the newspapers in London were also doing so. Since 1982 the paper abandoned the use of the current Royal Coat of Arms and returned to using the Hanoverian coat of arms of 1785.

Versions of the Coat of Arms, with the motto, are used by various newspapers, including Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; in Australia, Christchurch&#x27;s &quot;The Press&quot; in New Zealand, the UK&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and Canada&#x27;s Victoria Times Colonist. It is also used in Hardwick Hall in England on the fireplace of The High Great Chamber, also known as the Presence Chamber, though there it reads , God is my right. instead creating an additional &#x27;ES&#x27; monogram. The extra E and S are a superimposition on the original E. This was added at a later date after the original writing was put up; to deface the Royal Arms would have been very dangerous, hence it was added later.

It is also found on the official belt buckle of the Jamaica Constabulary Force; the front page of a British passport; the rank slide of a warrant officer in the British and other Commonwealth armed forces; the arms of the Supreme Court of South Australia, the Supreme Court of Victoria and Supreme Court of New South Wales; and the crests of Hawthorn Rowing Club in Melbourne, Australia, Nottingham Law School, and Sherborne School.

The coined phrase was also used by Michael Jackson at his Neverland Ranch&#x27;s front gates. The crest on the main gates carried the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, along with the phrase at the bottom.

The motto was formerly included in a scroll on the Western Australia Police Force coat of arms, before being replaced with &quot;Protect and Serve&quot; when the organisation changed its name from Western Australia Police Force to Western Australia Police Service.

It is the motto of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Barnet.

It is the motto of the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, England.
It is the motto of several, but not all, schools within the King Edward VI School Foundation, Birmingham, England including:

* Fee Paying: King Edward’s School
* Selective: King Edward VI Aston School, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls, King Edward VI Five Ways School, King Edward VI Handsworth School for Girls
It is also found on the Old Customs House in Sydney, Australia. The Royal Coat of Arms is intricately carved in sandstone, located above the main entry pediment.

==Variants==

The Hearts of Oak, a revolutionary New York militia commanded by Alexander Hamilton, wore badges of red tin hearts on their jackets with the words &quot;God and Our Right&quot;.

The phrase was the inspiration for a joke motto by The Beatles, &quot;Duit on Mon Dei&quot; (&quot;Do it on Monday&quot;) and Harry Nilsson&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Duit on Mon Dei&quot;.

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as consort of the British monarch, used a similar motto: &quot;God Is My Help&quot;.
Henry Hudson in 1612 used the wording (God is my right).

Other people considered the phrase (God is my right) means he was direct sovereign and not vassal of any other king.

Another example of is inscribed under the royal coat of arms on the over mantle of the High Great Chamber in Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire.

<text>Temple is a London Underground station located at Victoria Embankment in the City of Westminster, close to its boundary with the City of London. It is on the Circle and District lines between Embankment and Blackfriars stations, and is in fare zone 1.

The station was opened on 30 May 1870 with the name The Temple, from the Temple area in the vicinity of Temple Church, and from the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple, two of the four Inns of Court of London. The definite article in the name fell out of use quite early.

==History==
The Temple station was opened in the parish of St. Clement Danes on 30 May 1870 by the District Railway (DR; now the District line) when the company extended its line from Westminster to St. Paul&#x27;s station (now called Blackfriars). The construction of the new section of the DR was planned in conjunction with the building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over a shallow trench.

The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR; now the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London line) which it connected to at Addison Road station (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House, which was the new eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through the station running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road then, via a now demolished link, to the West London line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR.

On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House.

At the beginning of the 20th century early plans for the Great Northern and Strand Railway (later incorporated into the Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway and now part of the Piccadilly line) included a proposal for the line to continue to Temple. The plan was rejected and the route was ended instead at the now closed Aldwych station, about to the north.

On 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was withdrawn from the DR tracks.

In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the Tube map as the Circle line.

For many years, Temple station was closed on Sundays. In the new Tube Map of March 2005, it stated that it would be open on Sundays from 8th May 2005 onwards.

The rooftop of the station has been converted into an open-air art exhibition space known as The Artist&#x27;s Garden.

<doc id="373542" wikidata="Q86666660" url="?curid=373542" title="Vauxhall station">
<text>Vauxhall (, ) is a National Rail, London Underground and London Buses interchange station in central London. It is at the Vauxhall Cross road junction opposite the southern approach to Vauxhall Bridge over the River Thames in the district of Vauxhall. The mainline station is run by the South Western Railway and is the first stop on the South West Main Line from towards and the south-west. The Underground station is on the Victoria line and the station is close to St George Wharf Pier for river services.

The station was opened by the London and South Western Railway in 1848 as Vauxhall Bridge station. It was rebuilt in 1856 after a large fire, and given its current name in 1862. In the early 20th century, Vauxhall saw significant use as a stop for trains delivering milk from across the country into London. The tube station opened in 1971 as part of the Victoria line extension towards Brixton, while the bus station opened in 2004. It remains an important local interchange on the London transport network.

==Location==
The station sits just to the east of Vauxhall Bridge, on a viaduct with eight platforms, straddling South Lambeth Road and South Lambeth Place, alongside Vauxhall Cross. On the National Rail network it is the next station on the South West Main Line along from , to the south-west. On the London Underground it is on the Victoria line between Stockwell and Pimlico stations. The area has several surrounding railways, including the line from Victoria to . The station is on the boundary of zones 1 and 2 of the London Travelcard area and, although a through station, it is classed as a central London terminus for ticketing purposes.

Vauxhall bus station is at ground level, across the road from the railway station. It has a photovoltaic roof supplying much of its electricity, and caters for around 2,000 buses per day.

==History==
===Mainline station===

The station is incorporated within the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct. It was opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as &quot;Vauxhall Bridge Station&quot; on 11 July 1848 when the main line was extended from to Waterloo, then known as &quot;Waterloo Bridge Station&quot;. The viaduct was constructed to minimize property disturbances; nevertheless some 700 properties were demolished extending the line past Nine Elms and through Vauxhall.

In the period when Vauxhall was opened, there was no way for an inspector to move through the length of a train to check tickets, so it was used as a ticket stop, like several other stations. Having arrived at Vauxhall, the train would stop for as long as necessary while all tickets could be examined and collected.

On 13 April 1856, the station caught fire and was almost totally destroyed. The line was quickly repaired and services through to Waterloo resumed without much delay. After being rebuilt, the station was renamed &quot;Vauxhall&quot; in 1862. In the same year, the LSWR widened the main line through the station. Vauxhall was remodelled in 1936, which included an overhaul of the signalling system up to Waterloo.

====Milk trains====
In 1921, United Dairies opened a major creamery and milk bottling plant opposite Vauxhall station. Subsequently, milk trains regularly stopped at the station. The regular daily milk train was from Torrington, but services from all over the West Country would stop at Clapham Junction in the evening, and reduce their length by half so that they did not block Vauxhall station while unloading. They would then proceed to Vauxhall, and pull into the Up Windsor Local platform, where a discharge pipe was provided to the creamery on the other side of the road. There was also pedestrian access from below the station, under the road to the depot, in the tunnel where the pipeline ran. Unloaded trains would then proceed to Waterloo, where they would reverse and return to Clapham Junction to pick up the other half of the train. The procedure was then repeated, so that the entire milk train was unloaded between the end of evening peak traffic and the start of the following morning.

====Modern developments====
In 2017, work began to modernise the station layout and reduce congestion as part of an £800 million works programme to improve access to Waterloo. The existing lift was replaced and a new staircase was added between platforms 7 and 8 and the concourse.

===London Underground===


The first proposed underground station at Vauxhall was as part of the West and South London Junction Railway. The line was intended to connect to Oval via Vauxhall, crossing the River Thames slightly downstream of Vauxhall Bridge. It was rejected in January 1901 for failing to comply with Standing Orders and giving correct notice of eviction, and the plans were quietly shelved. Another abandoned scheme to connect with would have seen an interchange at Vauxhall; these plans were scrapped in 1902 owing to lack of funds.

The current deep tube London Underground station is on the Victoria line, which was the first major post-war underground project in Central London. The line was given approval to be extended from underneath the Thames to Vauxhall (and onwards to Brixton) in March 1966. To construct the escalator shaft, the ground beneath it was frozen with brine. The station platforms were designed by Design Research Unit and decorated with a motif from the 19th-century Vauxhall Gardens, designed by George Smith. At the same time, Vauxhall Cross road junction was rebuilt in order to accommodate the new Underground station. The Underground station was opened on 23 July 1971 by Princess Alexandra, as part of the extension of the Victoria line to Brixton.

In October 1982, the first automated ticketing system on the Underground was installed at Vauxhall on an experimental basis. The two machines were a &quot;Tenfare&quot; which sold the ten most popular single tickets, and &quot;Allfare&quot; which supplied single and return tickets to any tube station. The experiment ran until July 1983, and was subsequently used in the design of the rollout of the Underground ticketing system across the network.

In 2005, the existing fixed staircase between the two escalators down to platform level was replaced by a new escalator. Installed by Metronet as part of the Tube Private Public Partnership, the escalator was installed due to the high numbers of passengers using the station.

In the late 2000s, one potential option for extending the Northern line to Battersea was a route via Vauxhall station. Despite the benefit of connecting to the Victoria line and National Rail services, the option had a significantly higher cost than others, and increased the potential for increased overcrowding at the station. A route via Nine Elms was chosen instead. In the mid 2010s, the Underground station was upgraded and refurbished at a cost of £36m, as part of the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea regeneration project. Lifts were installed to provide step-free access to the Victoria line.

===Bus===

The bus station opened on 4 December 2004. It was designed by Arup Associates and features a distinctive metallic design constructed out of stainless steel. The station has been criticised for its proximity to the heavy traffic around Vauxhall Cross. In 2011, Transport for London announced they would demolish the bus station and construct a &quot;linear walkway&quot; instead. This was scrapped, but in 2017, they revived the demolition plans as part of general improvements in the area following support from Lambeth Council. The rebuilding is expected to take place between 2019 and 2021. Kate Hoey, member of parliament for Vauxhall has criticised the proposals, calling them a &quot;stitch up&quot;.

==Services==
===National Rail===

*24 tph to London Waterloo

===London Underground===
Vauxhall is between Pimlico and Stockwell on the Victoria line with a peak time service frequency of 36 trains per hour, or around one every 100 seconds.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 2, 36, 77, 87, 88, 156, 185, 196, 344, 360, 436, 452 and night routes N2, N87 and N136 serve the adjacent bus station.

London River Services are available from nearby St George Wharf Pier. The service was opened in September 2011 by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, with the aim of expanding boat transport along the Thames by 20%. A service runs approximately every 40 minutes to the City of London and Canary Wharf.
==Incidents==
* On 11 September 1880, a light engine collided with a service from Waterloo to Hampton. Five passengers were killed.
* On 29 August 1912, a light engine collided with a rake of nine carriages. One passenger was killed and 43 were injured.
* On 20 September 1934, two electric suburban trains collided at Vauxhall. The driver of one train and a passenger were taken to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital for treatment.
* On 9 October 2000, an untrained student worker was hit by a train near Vauxhall station while unsupervised. An inquest in May 2002 returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
* On 5 May 2016, a fire broke out in one of the signal cables at Vauxhall station. Services from Waterloo through the station were cancelled and the next major down station, was closed as an overcrowding measure.

==Name==
The name Vauxhall is phonetically similar to the Russian word for a railway station, (&quot;vokzal&quot;). One theory for this similarity is that Tsar Nicholas I visited Britain in the mid-19th century to study the railway network. At the time, every train on the South Western Railway called at Vauxhall as a ticket stop. From this, the Tsar concluded that Vauxhall was a major transport interchange, and the word was introduced as the generic term in Russian.

<doc id="373543" wikidata="Q62692" url="?curid=373543" title="Günter Wand">
<text>Günter Wand (7 January 1912, in Elberfeld, Germany – 14 February 2002, in Ulmiz near Bern, Switzerland) was a German orchestra conductor and composer. Wand studied in Wuppertal, Allenstein and Detmold. At the Cologne Conservatory, he was a composition student with Philipp Jarnach and a piano student with Paul Baumgartner. He was a conducting pupil of Franz von Hoesslin in Munich, but was otherwise largely self-taught as a conductor. During his 65-year-long career as a conductor, he was particularly revered for his Schubert and Bruckner, and was honoured with many significant awards, including the German Record Award and the internationally important Diapason d&#x27;Or.

== Career ==
In February 1924, aged 12, Wand attended a performance of Der Zigeunerbaron at the Thalia Theatre in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, and was so entranced he decided to become a conductor. The role of Sandor Barinkay that evening was sung by Richard Tauber.

=== Cologne ===
Wand started his career in Cologne, where he was to stay for several decades, as a conductor of the Cologne Opera in 1939. After World War II his position in Cologne was consolidated as he became &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; in charge of both the opera and the Gürzenich Orchestra, which he conducted until 1974.

In 1948, he also started teaching conducting at a music school in Cologne. From the early 1950s he guest-conducted a number of orchestras, making his London debut in 1951 with the London Symphony Orchestra. Other orchestras who invited him included the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. 

After several recordings of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven with the Gürzenich for a French subscription collection in the mid-1950s, he made no studio recordings for nearly two decades with the exception of an appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on Decca Records, accompanying Wilhelm Backhaus in Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto (his only recording with that orchestra). In the 1970s and early 1980s, he recorded the complete symphonies of Franz Schubert and Anton Bruckner with the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne.

=== Hamburg and late years ===
In 1982, Wand became chief conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra. With the latter ensemble, he was able to record the complete symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms as well as works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Schubert and Schumann. He also remade Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies 3 to 9.

In January 1982, Wand conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the first time, and was appointed principal guest conductor of the orchestra that same year. Wand was noted for demanding considerable rehearsal time, a minimum of 5 to 8 rehearsals, for his London concerts. On 9 September 1990 his UK Promenade Concert of Bruckner&#x27;s 5th Symphony with the BBC Symphony was recorded and subsequently released in 2011 on DVD by the BBC/ICA (ICAD 5049). For his first appearance with a US orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1989, he asked for and received 11 hours of rehearsal time. Wand subsequently recorded the Brahms Symphony No. 1, part of that first U.S. program, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

The highlights of Wand&#x27;s late career were his annual guest appearances with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which he conducted in Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; and &quot;Great&quot; symphonies (1995) and Bruckner&#x27;s Fifth (1996), Fourth (1998), Ninth (1998), Seventh (1999) and Eighth (2001) symphonies.

==Artistic style==
As a conductor, Wand was a deep believer in the originality of music, aiming to perform works exactly as annotated. His art was marked by straightforward adherence to the score.

As still a young conductor, a journalist asked him how he&#x27;d consider interpreting Beethoven&#x27;s ninth symphony, more like Arturo Toscanini or rather like Wilhelm Furtwängler. Wand answered laconically: &quot;Like Beethoven&quot;.

==Repertoire==
In his late years, Wand restricted his repertoire almost exclusively to the symphonies of Anton Bruckner (which he had never conducted until he was over 60), Schubert, Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart. Earlier in his career, however, he was a devoted interpreter of the contemporary music of such composers as Frank Martin, György Ligeti, Edgard Varèse, Olivier Messiaen, and initially Bernd Alois Zimmermann as well.

Wand regarded Bruckner as the &quot;most important symphonist after Beethoven&quot;. Wand&#x27;s biographer Wolfgang Seifert wrote that &quot;it is no exaggeration to say that Günter Wand has made an indispensable contribution toward the understanding of Bruckner in our time.&quot;

==Compositions==
Wand also composed music, mostly songs with orchestral accompaniment and music for ballet. One composition was his concertino &quot;Odi et amo&quot;, for soprano and chamber orchestra, which Wand wrote for his wife, the soprano Anita Westhoff. Anita Wand (Westhoff) died on 29 December 2009 at Ulmiz (CH), at the age of 89 years.

==Awards==
During his over 65-year-long career as conductor, Günter Wand received several important prizes, including German Record Award, the German Record Critic&#x27;s Prize, the Echo Award and twice the internationally significant Diapason d&#x27;Or, which he received for his Schubert and Bruckner recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1996 Wand received the rarely awarded Hans von Bülow Medal.

<doc id="373545" wikidata="Q38876" url="?curid=373545" title="Barbican tube station">
<text>Barbican is a London Underground station situated near the Barbican Estate, on the edge of the ward of Farringdon Within, City of London. It has been known by various names since its opening in 1865, mostly in reference to the neighbouring ward of Aldersgate.

The station is on the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines between Farringdon and Moorgate stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 1. Platform 2, serving westbound trains, is connected by a single lift to station on the Elizabeth line. Until 2009, Barbican was additionally served by Thameslink services to and from Moorgate.

==Location==
Barbican station lies in an east–west-aligned cutting with cut-and-cover tunnels at either end. The modern entrance gives access from Aldersgate Street, through a 1990s building, to a much older footbridge leading to the eastern end of the platforms. To the north of the station are the backs of buildings which face onto Charterhouse Street, Charterhouse Square and Carthusian Street. To the south are the backs of buildings which face onto Long Lane, and to the west is Hayne Street. The station is close to the Barbican Estate, Barbican Centre, City of London School for Girls, St Bartholomew-the-Great, and Smithfield. The Eastern Ticket Hall entrance to Elizabeth line station is one street west of the station entrance, on the corner of Long Lane and Lindsey Street. A single lift connects directly from the Elizabeth line onto the westbound platform at Barbican.

==History==
The station was opened with the name Aldersgate Street on 23 December 1865 on the Moorgate extension from Farringdon. It was built on the site of an earlier building at 134 Aldersgate Street, which for many years had a sign claiming &quot;This was Shakespeare&#x27;s House&quot;. The building was very close to the nearby Fortune Playhouse, and a subsidy roll from 1598 shows a &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; as the owner of the property, however, there is no documentary evidence indicating they and the playwright were the same person.

The station, which has no surface building, had its name shortened to Aldersgate on 1 November 1910 and was renamed again on 24 October 1924 as Aldersgate &amp; Barbican, although tube maps and London A to Zs continued to show it as Aldersgate. On 1 December 1968 the station&#x27;s name was simplified to Barbican.

Train services were disrupted during the Second World War when the station suffered severe bomb damage during the Blitz, particularly in December 1940. This led to the removal of the upper floors, and in 1955 the remainder of the street-level building was also demolished and the glass roof was replaced with awnings. This urged John Betjeman to write his poem &quot;Monody on the Death of Aldersgate Station&quot;.

Increasing traffic by other companies, including goods traffic, led to the track between King&#x27;s Cross and Moorgate being widened to four tracks in 1868; the route was called the &#x27;City Widened Lines&#x27;. Suburban services from the Midland Railway ran via Kentish Town and the Great Northern Railway ran via Kings Cross. British Rail services to Moorgate were initially steam operated before being converted to Cravens-built diesel multiple units and British Rail Class 31 locomotives class hauling non-corridor stock which remained in operation until the mid-1970s.

Passenger trains from the Great Northern line, via the York Road and Hotel curves at King&#x27;s Cross to the Widened Lines, ran until the Great Northern&#x27;s electrification on 1976. The City Widened Lines were renamed the Moorgate line when overhead electrification was installed in 1982, allowing the Midland City Line service to run from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to Moorgate on the Thameslink service. The Thameslink platforms at Barbican were closed again in March 2009 as part of the Thameslink Programme to allow to have its main line platforms extended across Thameslink&#x27;s Moorgate branch. As a result, Barbican now serves Underground lines only.
The modern station is mostly open to the elements, though there are some short canopies. The remains of the supporting structure for a glass canopy over all four platforms (removed in the 1950s) may still be seen. At the west end of the platforms may be seen the beginnings of the complex of tunnels leading under Smithfield meat market. Livestock for the market was at one time delivered by rail and there was a substantial goods yard under the site of the market.

Platform 1 is the most northerly, serving eastbound London Underground services. Platforms 2 and 3 form an island platform, with platform 2 serving westbound services. Platform 2 contains a lift to the Elizabeth line platforms; it is the only platform with step-free access. Platforms 3 and 4 are out of use. A display on the history of the station, including text and photographs, is just inside the barriers, on the southern side of the main entrance corridor.

The station has a commemorative plaque affixed to one of its walls in memory of the station&#x27;s deceased cat Pebbles.

==Incidents and accidents==
On 16 December 1866, three passengers were killed, a guard was seriously injured, and one other person suffered shock when a girder collapsed onto a passenger train in the station. The accident was the first to include multiple passengers on the underground network. Four people died during the accident, and a fifth (a workman involved in the accident) died while awaiting trial. Service on the line was running again only 30minutes afterwards.

On 26 April 1897, a bomb exploded under a seat in a first-class carriage in the station, injuring ten people of whom two died later. The perpetrators were never identified, but it was believed to have been part of a Fenian campaign following three other bombs in 1883–1885.

==Services==

The station is served by the Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines. All three lines share the same pair of tracks from Baker Street Junction to Aldgate Junction making this section of track one of the most intensely used on the London Underground network.

===Circle line===

The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6 tph clockwise to Edgware Road via Liverpool Street and Victoria
* 6 tph anti-clockwise to Hammersmith via Kings Cross St Pancras and Paddington

===Hammersmith &amp; City line===

The typical service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6 tph Eastbound to Barking
* 6 tph Westbound to Hammersmith via Paddington

===Metropolitan line===

The Metropolitan Line is the only line to operate express services, though currently this is only during peak times (Eastbound 06:30–09:30 / Westbound 16:00–19:00). Fast services run non-stop between Wembley Park, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park, Semi-fast services run non-stop between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 12 tph Eastbound to Aldgate
* 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (all stations)
* 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (all stations)
* 8 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations)
Off-peak services to/from Watford terminate at Baker Street

The typical peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 14 tph Eastbound to Aldgate
* 2 tph Westbound to Amersham (fast in the evening peak only)
* 2 tph Westbound to Chesham (fast in the evening peak only)
* 4 tph Westbound to Watford (semi-fast in the evening peak only)
* 6 tph Westbound to Uxbridge (all stations)

===Elizabeth line===
&#x27;s Barbican ticket hall for the Elizabeth line is just to the west of Barbican station along Long Lane. This construction involved significant changes at the western end of the station, including the demolition of the former signal box to construct a lift shaft from the Elizabeth line station to the westbound Underground platform only. The original plan of a new footbridge spanning the tracks to the eastbound platform was not proceeded with on the grounds of engineering difficulties. Work was anticipated to be completed in 2018, but was completed in May 2022.

<text>St James&#x27;s Park is a London Underground station near St James&#x27;s Park in the City of Westminster, England. It is served by the Circle and District lines between Victoria and Westminster stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 1.

The station building is incorporated into 55 Broadway, formerly the headquarters of Transport for London, and has entrances both on the junction of 55 Broadway and Petty France and on Palmer Street, opposite Starbucks. The station is close to several government offices. The station is not wheelchair accessible.

==History==
The station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) when the company opened the first section of its line between South Kensington and Westminster stations. The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) which it connected to at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) close to Liverpool Street station in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House, the new eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through St James&#x27;s Park running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road then, via a now demolished link, to the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR.

On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908 the Outer Circle service was also withdrawn.

The station has been reconstructed twice. In the first decade of the 20th century the original DR station was reconstructed in conjunction with the building of Electric Railway House a headquarters building for the DR&#x27;s owners the London Electric Railway. The station was then rebuilt again between 1927 and 1929 as part of the construction of 55 Broadway the company&#x27;s new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden and featuring statues and carved stone panels including ones by Sir Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill, and Henry Moore.

The platforms feature the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme first used for the reconstruction and extension to Morden of the City &amp; South London Railway (now the Northern line) also designed by Holden and opened between 1924 and 1926.

In 1949, the Metropolitan line operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.

The separate Palmer Street entrance and booking hall were rebuilt as part of a further redevelopment in the 1960s.

Together with 55 Broadway, the station is a Grade I listed building.

==Name==
Over time, the station name has been spelt and punctuated differently, illustrating changing practice in punctuation. Tube maps up to the early 1930s show the name as &quot;St. James&#x27; Park&quot;. From Harry Beck&#x27;s first map in 1933 until the early 1950s the name was shown as &quot;St. James Park&quot;. From 1951, it was &quot;St. James&#x27;s Park&quot;. Current practice on tube maps is &quot;St James&#x27;s Park&quot; without the full stop after the &quot;St&quot;.

Originally installed in the late 1920s when the first version of the name was in use, the station name displayed in the platform roundels exhibit modification to account for this change. One of the roundels on the eastbound platform still reads &quot;St. James&#x27; Park&quot;, the rest have had new name plates affixed giving the spelling and punctuation as &quot;St. James&#x27;s Park&quot;.

<text>Knightsbridge () is a London Underground station in Knightsbridge, London. It is on the Piccadilly line between South Kensington and Hyde Park Corner stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 1.

==History==

The station was opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, now the Piccadilly line). When opened, the platforms were accessed in the standard manner by four lifts and an emergency staircase connecting to parallel passageways and bridges to midway along the platforms. The original station building designed by Leslie Green was located on Brompton Road a short distance west of its junction with Knightsbridge and Sloane Street. A rear entrance was located on Basil Street.

The location of the station in a busy and fashionable shopping district meant that patronage at the station was high from the beginning, particularly due to the presence locally of the Harrods and Harvey Nichols emporiums. This contrasted with the next station on the line westward — Brompton Road — where passenger numbers were so low that from soon after its opening many trains were timetabled not to stop there.

===1930s reconstruction===

In the early 1930s, the availability of government grants to stimulate the depressed economy enabled the Underground Group to carry out a major modernisation programme, during which many central London stations were brought up to date with escalators to replace the original lifts. Knightsbridge was one of the Piccadilly line stations to benefit from the installation of escalators.

To enable the escalators to reach the existing platforms without excessive below ground reconstruction or interference with station operations a new ticket hall was constructed under the Brompton Road/Knightsbridge/Sloane Street junction and new circulation passages were constructed at the lower level. A new station entrance was inserted into the existing building on the corner of Brompton Road and Sloane Street. Subway entrances on the other corners of the junction enabled pedestrians to avoid the traffic on the busy junction. The original entrances in Brompton Road and Basil Street were closed. The Brompton Road building was subsequently demolished, but the rear entrance at the corner of Basil Street and Hoopers Court remains, although converted for use as offices.

To ease congestion, it was also decided to provide an additional entrance to the western end of the platforms closer to Harrods. The additional exit would further diminish the passenger numbers at Brompton Road so this station was scheduled to close. A separate ticket hall was provided for the western escalators which is accessed by a long subway from the surface entrance at the corner of Hans Crescent. This narrow subway was to be a regular problem, often becoming congested with groups of passengers trying to pass each other in the confined space.

Eventually in 2004, this congestion was solved by the expansion of this exit into a large circular area, under the road towards Harrods, with the way out of the station being by a stairway in the midst of the road.

== Early 21st century station upgrades ==
In recent years, several piecemeal improvements to the station have occurred. The platforms were refurbished in 2005, with the 1930s cream-coloured tiles being concealed behind a modern metal cladding system. In December 2010, a new entrance was opened across the road from the station, as part of the One Hyde Park residential development.

In 2017, a major upgrade to the station was announced, with two new entrances constructed on Brompton Road and Hooper&#x27;s Court. The new Hooper&#x27;s Court entrance will have two large lifts, which will allow for step-free access throughout the station. This entrance will also re-open some areas of the station that were closed in the early 1930s when escalators were installed. 

Previously expected to open in 2021, the stepped entrance on Brompton Road, which replaced a smaller entrance on the corner of Sloane Street that was becoming unsafe due to overcrowding and a narrow pavement outside, opened in October 2022. Originally planned to open in 2023, the opening of the step-free entrance in Hoopers Court is currently delayed due to power supply issues.

Most of the upgrade costs are being paid for by Knightsbridge Estate and developers Chelsfield, who own the property above the station and are responsible for the redevelopment. TfL are contributing £12m, enabling step-free access to be extended to platform level.

==In popular culture==

The station appeared in a 1992 episode of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; (&quot;Rumpole and the Children of the Devil&quot;), as Horace Rumpole and his wife Hilda travel there separately from Temple and Gloucester Road stations respectively. They exit Knightsbridge station from the stairs at the former street level portico on the corner of Hans Crescent and Brompton Road, which has since been redeveloped as the main entrance to a Zara fashion shop at 79 Brompton Road.

The opening scene of the 1997 film version of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; was set on the east-bound platforms at both Dover Street and Knightsbridge stations, both represented by the same studio mock-up, complete with a working recreation of a 1906 Stock train.

<doc id="373555" wikidata="Q7801858" url="?curid=373555" title="Tik-Tok of Oz">
<text>Tik-Tok of Oz is the eighth book in the Oz series written by L. Frank Baum, published on June 19, 1914. The book has little to do with Tik-Tok and is primarily the quest of the Shaggy Man (introduced in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;) to rescue his brother, and his resulting conflict with the Nome King. The book was based on Baum&#x27;s play &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;, which was produced in Los Angeles in spring 1913. It was followed by &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915).

The endpapers of the first edition held maps: one of Oz itself, and one of the continents on which Oz and its neighboring countries belonged. These were the first maps printed of Oz.

==Plot summary==
Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo, a small monarchy separated from the rest of Oz&#x27;s Winkie Country, sets out to raise an army to conquer Oz. 

Betsy Bobbin, a girl who is a year older than Dorothy Gale, and her loyal mule Hank have washed ashore during a storm. They arrive at a large greenhouse that is the domain of the Rose Kingdom, where the roses tell them that no strangers are allowed. Just as the Royal Gardener is about to pass sentence on Betsy and Hank, the Shaggy Man falls through the greenhouse&#x27;s roof, and charms the Gardener into sparing all of their lives with his Love Magnet. The travelers leave, taking with them the newly plucked Rose Princess Ozga, a cousin of Ozma, the ruler of Oz.

The Shaggy Man relates how Ozma sent him here via the Magic Belt because he wanted to find his brother, who went digging underground in Colorado and disappeared. He surmised that the Nome King, ruler of the underground Nome Kingdom, captured him. They meet up with Polychrome the Rainbow&#x27;s Daughter, and they rescue Tik-Tok from the well where the Nome King had tossed him. Once Tik-Tok is wound up, he accompanies Betsy, Hank, the Shaggy Man, Ozga, and Polychrome to their chance encounter with Queen Ann and her army. When Queen Ann learns of the riches to be found in the Nome King&#x27;s underground kingdom, she calms down and accepts the services of Tik-Tok as her new private.

The Nome King is aghast at this group coming toward his underground kingdom. Since no one can be killed in Oz, the Nome King seeks to discourage them, first by taking them through the Rubber Country, and then disposing of them by dropping them through the Hollow Tube, a conduit leading to the other side of the world. There the party enters the jurisdiction of the immortal called Tititi-Hoochoo, the Great Jinjin, who vows to punish the Nome King for using the Hollow Tube. He sends Tik-Tok and the others back with his Instrument of Vengeance, a lackadaisical dragon named Quox. 

When Quox bursts through the Nome King&#x27;s cavern, the Nome King sees the ribbon around Quox&#x27;s neck and forgets all the magic he ever knew. The Nome King is driven out of his kingdom when Quox releases six eggs from the padlock around his neck. The eggs, poisonous to Nomes, follow the Nome King to the Earth&#x27;s surface and confine him there.

The new Nome King, the former chief steward Kaliko, vows to help the Shaggy Man find his brother, whom he knows is in the Metal Forest. The Shaggy Man meets his brother in the center of the Forest, but the brother is cursed with a charm of ugliness by the former Nome King. The fairy Polychrome&#x27;s kiss restores the Shaggy Man&#x27;s brother to his former self.

There is a banquet of rejoicing in the Nome Kingdom, and the former Nome King earnestly pleads to be let back into the underground lair. Once on the surface again, Polychrome ascends her rainbow and Ozma uses the magic belt to send the citizens of Oogaboo back home. The Shaggy Man only agrees to return when his brother, Betsy, and Hank are allowed to enter Oz too. Betsy decides to stay in Oz forever.

==Commentary==
In 1913, Baum&#x27;s long-delayed and heavily-adapted stage version of &quot;Ozma of Oz,&quot; re-titled &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;, was produced in Los Angeles, with moderate success. The music was composed by Louis F. Gottschalk, Baum&#x27;s favorite composer, who would also be the dedicatee of the &quot;Tik-Tok&quot; novel a year later. Baum adapted some of the material from the stage production for the novel. As in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, a shipwreck precipitates the heroine into her adventure, and the quest of the Shaggy Man for his brother, who was named Wiggy in the play, is another attempt to rescue a prisoner of the Nome King. The picking of Ozga is a motif found in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;.

The book has several continuity errors with earlier books in the series, particularly &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;. Whereas Polychrome met the Shaggy Man in that book, this point is neglected by Baum in &quot;Tik-Tok&quot;. Also, whereas the Shaggy Man merely needs to carry the Love Magnet on his person for it to work in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, in this book it is necessary for him to remove it from his pocket and physically show it to those he wishes to love him.

&quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; was more modestly produced than earlier Oz books, with twelve color plates instead of sixteen. Its first edition sold a little over 14,000 copies — a respectable figure, but 3,000 fewer than &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; had done the year before. Baum&#x27;s books were facing stiff new competition — from his own earlier books. The reprint house M. A. Donohue &amp; Co. had purchased the rights to several early Baum works from Bobbs-Merrill, and was marketing cut-rate editions. People were less willing to pay the usual $1.25 for a new Oz book when the original &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; was selling for $0.35.

&quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; also contained the first map of Oz and its neighboring countries, which proved to be a very popular feature. Unfortunately for the principle of consistency, this initial map of Oz was drawn backwards, with the Munchkin Country on the left and the Winkie Country in the right, with the compass rose reversed to keep the Munchkin Country in the east and the Winkie Country in the west. [See: &quot;Land of Oz&quot;.] Subsequent maps from the publisher &quot;corrected&quot; the compass rose, but not the locations. This may explain why Ruth Plumly Thompson reversed the locations from Baum&#x27;s -- in her books the Munchkin country is west; and her Winkies East (see for instance &quot;Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz&quot; but also in several other books). James E. Haff and Dick Martin ultimately corrected these in new maps designed for The International Wizard of Oz Club. A squarish map that largely follows Haff and Martin appears in &quot;The Dictionary of Imaginary Places&quot;. The presence of a &quot;Davy Jones Island&quot; on this map indicates that the inclusion of the character Davy Jones, a wooden whale, as a decoration on the map, was misinterpreted by the book&#x27;s recartographers, as no such place appears in any Oz books up to that book&#x27;s publication.

The 1993 novel &quot;Queen Ann in Oz&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;.

<text>Shoreditch was a London Underground station located in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in east London. Originally opened by the East London Railway in 1876, the station was permanently closed in 2006 being replaced directly to the west of the site by Shoreditch High Street station in 2010.

The station was the northern terminus of the East London Line, with latterly a single platform alongside a single track that ran next to the disused Bishopsgate goods yard. Until the late 1960s the East London Line connected with the main line railway to Liverpool Street just north of Shoreditch station. The site of the link was visible from the end of the platform and still is visible from main line trains travelling between Stratford and Liverpool Street. The station was one of only a handful on the network with a single platform and a single-track layout, though it originally had two tracks and two platforms. The preceding station was Whitechapel, which after Shoreditch&#x27;s closure was the northern terminus of the East London Line until the line closed for extension in 2007.

== History ==
Shoreditch station opened in April 1876 as a stop on the East London Railway from Liverpool Street to points south. The passenger service between Shoreditch and Liverpool Street was withdrawn in 1885. Shoreditch joined the Underground network on 31 March 1913 as part of the Metropolitan Railway in conjunction with an electrification of the line.

Goods services from Liverpool Street continued to pass through Shoreditch until April 1966; after then the track connection was severed in order to improve access to Liverpool Street for other trains. The station was closed from March 1995 to September 1998 during the renovation of the East London Line, reopening six months after the rest of the line.


== Usage ==

Before its closure, Shoreditch was one of the least-used stations on the network, with only about 1,100 passengers per day. On weekdays it was open only at rush hour; it was closed on Saturdays, and open for only a few hours on Sundays for the nearby Brick Lane Market. Prior to the 1990s the station was also closed on Sundays.

*2006: 800,000 passenger entries and exits
*2005: 748,000
*2004: 415,000
*2003: 380,000

== Today ==
Shoreditch station closed permanently on 9 June 2006 to allow work to begin on the East London line extension. It has been replaced by a new station called Shoreditch High Street. The new line and station form part of the London Overground network, a suburban railway operated by Transport for London (TfL) but separate from the Underground network.

Unlike other closed stations, TfL provided a temporary service to Shoreditch until the new line fully opened in 2010 in the form of a non-stop bus service connecting Shoreditch with Whitechapel using the station&#x27;s previous limited opening hours.

The cutting in and around the station area was filled in and partly reused for the line from Whitechapel (also in a cutting) to the replacement Shoreditch High Street station (on a viaduct). The station building still exists and was put up for sale by TfL in February 2010. In February 2011 the building was sold at auction for £665,000. Current plans call for the station building to be demolished and the bricks to be reused for a six-storey block of flats.

In 2014 the building was used as a &quot;pop-up&quot; cinema: in summer the auditorium was furnished with six-person hot tubs from which to watch the films while in winter the concept was &quot;bring your own pillow&quot; to use on bean bag style beds.

== In popular culture ==
The station was used for a segment in the 1999 film &quot;Tube Tales&quot;.

<text>Wapping is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located on the northern bank of the River Thames in Wapping within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The station is between and stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

After temporary closures for remodelling, the station reopened for preview services on 27 April 2010 for services to and , and from 23 May 2010 trains to and from New Cross Gate were extended to West Croydon and .

==History==

===Construction===

The station occupies the north end of the former Thames foot tunnel built by Marc Isambard Brunel between 1825 and 1843, and subsequently adapted for railway traffic. Access to the station is by lift or a flight of stairs built into one of the original access shafts of the Thames Tunnel.

===London, Brighton and South Coast Railway===

The station was originally opened as the northern terminus of the East London Railway on 7 December 1869 as &quot;Wapping and Shadwell&quot;, and the station was renamed &quot;Wapping&quot; on 10 April 1876, when the line was extended northwards to , via a new station at . The earliest trains were provided by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, whose system connected with the line at .

===London Underground===
Underground trains of the Metropolitan and the District Railways first served the station on 1 October 1884, but the station was last served by District trains on 31 July 1905.

In 1980 a London Underground plan to extend the Jubilee line to Woolwich Arsenal and Beckton was approved by Parliament. This included a station at Wapping, but was never built. The extension constructed in the 1990s followed a different route to the south of the River Thames.

The station was extensively remodelled between 1995 and 1998, when the entire East London line — including Wapping station — was closed due to repair work on the tunnels under the Thames. Vitreous enamel panels by Nick Hardcastle, showing the station and the area in former and modern times, were installed on the platforms.

===London Overground===
The East London line of the Underground closed on 22 December 2007, and reopened on 27 April 2010 when it became part of the new London Overground system. During this time the station was heavily refurbished.

The proposed extension of the East London line raised concerns that the station would have to be closed due to its platforms being too short (only four cars long) to accommodate the new rolling stock planned for the extended line (which could be six or eight cars long). The narrowness of the platforms was also a concern. The station does not fully meet the safety standards for an underground station but is permitted to operate under a derogation from His Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate. Despite this, on 16 August 2004 then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone announced that the station would remain open.

The station is served by National Rail London Overground services under the control of the London Rail division of Transport for London, however there is no standard red National Rail &quot;double arrow&quot; logo signage located at the station, instead only the Overground roundel.

==Services==

All times below are correct as of the December 2010 timetables.

===London Overground===
====Windrush line====
Wapping is served by the Windrush line of the London Overground. On Mondays to Saturdays there is a service every 5–10 minutes throughout the day, while on Sundays before 13:00 there is a service every 5–9 minutes, changing to every 7–8 minutes until the end of service after that. Current off peak frequency is:

*8 northbound to Highbury &amp; Islington
*8 northbound to 
*4 southbound to via 
*4 southbound to via 
*4 southbound to 
*4 southbound to West Croydon via 

==Connections==

<text>Rotherhithe is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located on the southern bank of the River Thames at Rotherhithe within the London Borough of Southwark. The station is between and stations, and is in fare zone 2. The station re-opened for a preview service on 27 April 2010 to and , and 23 May 2010 for full service to West Croydon and . On 9 December 2012, the line was extended to serve Clapham Junction via Peckham Rye.

==History==
The station was originally opened on 7 December 1869, when the first section of the East London Railway was opened. On 1 October 1884, the Metropolitan and District Railways began running services along the East London Railway, which called at Rotherhithe. It was served by electric passenger trains from 31 March 1913, when the line was electrified. Goods trains from station continued to pass through until April 1966.

The original station entrance was located in Albion Street, which meant that access to platforms was at the opposite end of the platforms from the present access.

Decorative vitreous enamel panels were added to the platforms. The station was then closed between 1995 and 1998 due to repair work on the Thames Tunnel and from 22 December 2007 to 27 April 2010 for the extension of the East London line.

The present surface building is located a short distance to the south of the original entrance shaft to the Thames Tunnel. It was extensively remodelled between March 1995 and March 1998, in conjunction with the renovation of the East London line. The building was heavily refurbished for the re-opening of the ELL, with the entrance being enlarged by replacing two of the windows with arches.

===London Overground===

The station&#x27;s future was in doubt for a while after the announcement of the East London line extension, as Rotherhithe&#x27;s platforms can only take four-car trains and cannot be lengthened. Thus it was initially thought that Rotherhithe station might have to close when the line was extended. However, on 16 August 2004 the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, announced that the station would remain open.

==Layout==

Rotherhithe station has two platforms (northbound and southbound) and is accessed by two escalators (one up, one down) and a flight of stairs to a landing, then stairs only to platform level.

There are ticket barriers in the ticket office controlling access to the platforms.

The station platforms are situated close to the southern end of the 1843 Thames Tunnel built by the Brunels, and some of the tunnel&#x27;s original brickwork can be seen from the north end of the platforms. A better view of the Thames Tunnel portals can be seen from the platforms at Wapping railway station on the opposite side of the river.
At the southern end of the Rotherhithe station platforms, the approach ramp for the 1908 Rotherhithe Tunnel passes above the railway on a low and angled road bridge which is highly unusual for being located below water level. The bridge structure is easily visible (pictured, left) and is currently painted blue. The Rotherhithe Tunnel portal is also visible when looking up from the southern end of the northbound platform.

<text>Georg Tintner, (22 May 19172 October 1999) was an Austrian conductor whose career was principally in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. Although best known as a conductor, he was also a composer (he considered himself a composer who conducted).

As a child he was a singer in the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir, the first Jew ever to be accepted; at that time the choir was directed by Franz Schalk. At the Vienna State Academy he studied composition with Joseph Marx and conducting with Felix Weingartner. Soon he was assistant conductor of the Vienna Volksoper.

Due to the persecution of Jews, Tintner moved out of Vienna in 1938, arriving in Auckland, New Zealand in 1940. En route, he was falsely accused of being a German spy and arrested in Australia. He conducted a church choir until after the war, when he took over the Auckland Choral Society in 1947, and the Auckland String Players in 1948. He became a New Zealand citizen in 1946. In 1954, he went to Australia and became resident conductor of the National Opera of Australia (a private company) before joining the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera in 1957. Tintner is credited with pioneering televised opera in Australia.

He spent a year with the Cape Town Municipal Orchestra (1966–67) and three years with Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera (1967–70) before returning to Australia as music director of the West Australian Opera. In 1974, he rejoined the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera, by then known as the Australian Opera. He became music director of the Queensland Theatre Orchestra in 1976.

In 1987 he moved to Canada, where he became director of Symphony Nova Scotia. In 1998, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. On 2 October 1999, after a six-year struggle with cancer, he jumped to his death from the balcony of his 11th-storey Halifax apartment.

Tintner was described as &quot;one of the greatest living Bruckner conductors.&quot; He recorded a much-praised complete cycle of Bruckner symphonies for the Naxos CD label shortly before the end of his life (recording sessions: 1995–98). In addition to the eleven symphonies this cycle includes the 1876 Adagio and the 1878 &#x27;Volksfest Finale&#x27;.

Naxos is also releasing a &quot;Tintner Memorial Edition&quot; comprising re-releases of some of his earlier recordings of composers other than Bruckner. A disc of Tintner&#x27;s piano music has also been released by the same label, valuably revealing a side of the man long-forgotten since his student days. Some of his own early compositions have been recorded: Violin Sonata, Piano Sonata, &quot;Trauermusik&quot;, &quot;Chopin Variations&quot;, and Prelude.

His daughter was the dancer Hephzibah Tintner (1971–2001), whom he named after the pianist Hephzibah Menuhin. She was the partner of then Lord Mayor of Sydney and later NSW (Labor Party) state politician Frank Sartor.

<text>Surrey Quays is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located in Rotherhithe in the London Borough of Southwark. Situated in Travelcard Zone 2, the next station to the north is ; to the south, the line splits into branches to , , and . Closed in late 2007 as a London Underground station, it was refurbished and reopened as part of the London Overground network on 27 April 2010.

==History==

The station was built by the East London Railway Company and opened on 7 December 1869; it was originally known as Deptford Road. On 17 July 1911 it was renamed Surrey Docks in reference to the nearby Surrey Commercial Docks (which closed in the 1960s), and further renamed Surrey Quays on 24 October 1989, following the construction of the nearby Surrey Quays Shopping Centre. This was a somewhat controversial move, for some of the local community felt that their heritage was being eroded. However, the name stuck, and the Surrey Docks part of Rotherhithe is now often referred to as Surrey Quays.

In the 1950s and 1960s, London Underground planned a new line connecting north-west and south-east London. Approval for the first stage of the Fleet line (renamed the Jubilee line in 1975) to Charing Cross was granted in 1969, with second and third stages approved in 1971 and 1972. The station was planned to be part of phase 3 running to Lewisham. New tunnels to and from the City of London would have come to the surface north of the station. East London line trains would have terminated at Surrey Docks with London Underground services to New Cross and New Cross Gate being taken over by the new line. Phases 2 and 3 were not carried out due to a lack of funds. Eventually, due to changing land usage and the growth of Canary Wharf, the Jubilee line was extended via Canada Water instead.

For much of its history, the station&#x27;s importance lay in its proximity to the Surrey Commercial Docks; it was at the south end of Canada Dock (now Canada Water) and a few hundred yards from the principal entrance to the docks. Its usage fell considerably after the docks closed, but revived following the redevelopment of the London Docklands in the 1980s and 1990s.

The service was closed between 1995 and 1998 due to repair work on the East London line&#x27;s Thames Tunnel. The East London line closed permanently as an Underground line on 22 December 2007. It reopened for preview services on 27 April 2010 to and and 23 May 2010 for full service to New Cross, West Croydon and , becoming part of the London Overground system. On 9 December 2012, Phase 2 of East London line extension opened to the public, and was launched the next day by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. It provides services to via , thus completing the London Overground Orbital link.

, Transport for London is planning to upgrade the station with a new entrance and ticket hall, improving capacity and introducing step-free access. On 2 February 2023, TfL awarded the contract to start construction, with works due to start in the summer.

<text>New Cross Gate is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southern, located in New Cross, London. It is on the Brighton Main Line, down the line from . It is in Travelcard Zone 2.

There is an out-of-station interchange with station, also on the Windrush line of the London Overground, around away to the west. 

==History==
England&#x27;s railway boom of the 1830s led to two competing companies driving lines through the area. The first, the London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR), established a station on New Cross Road close to Hatcham in 1839. The second, the South Eastern Railway (SER), established a station near Amersham Way in the heart of New Cross in 1849. After both stations came under the ownership of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923 the former L&amp;CR station was renamed New Cross Gate on 9 July 1923.

During the 19th century, New Cross (Gate) became an important junction where the South London Line, the East London Line, and the Bricklayers Arms Line diverged from the Brighton Main Line to .

===London and Croydon Railway Station===

The original station was officially opened on 1 June 1839 by the London and Croydon Railway. and became fully operational on 5 June 1839. It was intended to become the main freight depot and locomotive workshop for the company. In July 1841 the line (but not the station) was also used by the London and Brighton Railway. The London and Croydon and London and Brighton companies merged to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) in July 1846. Between February and May 1847 the station at New Cross was the northern terminus of the atmospheric propulsion system introduced by the L&amp;CR, but in the latter month the system was abandoned by the new company.

===London Brighton and South Coast Railway Station===

On 1 October 1847 the newly formed LB&amp;SCR closed the existing New Cross station, replacing it with another at Cold Blow Lane 0.25 miles to the north, in an attempt to secure passengers from the planned North Kent Line of the SER. This move was not a success and was subject to much local criticism, so on 1 May 1849 the LB&amp;SCR rebuilt and re-opened New Cross on the original site.

The current station therefore dates from 1849 but was again rebuilt in 1858 to allow for the quadrupling of the Brighton Main Line. Further rebuilding was undertaken in 1869 when the East London Railway opened a line to Whitechapel and .

The line through the station was electrified in 1928 by the Southern Railway using the third rail system, although the majority of services continued to be steam hauled until the electrification of the Brighton main line in 1932.

===East London Railway Station===
On 7 December 1869 a separate station for East London Railway services was opened adjacent to the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway station. It was closed on 1 September 1886 when services were diverted to the LB&amp;SCR station. Soon after closure the station was demolished and the land used for sidings.

===East London Railway===
The East London Railway (ELR) was owned by a consortium of railway companies. Passenger services were operated by the LB&amp;SCR between Croydon and Liverpool Street, and from 1884 by the District Railway between New Cross (Gate) and Shoreditch. LB&amp;SCR services ceased on 31 March 1913, when the line was electrified using the fourth rail system and thereafter all passenger services were operated by the Metropolitan Railway. For the opening of the ELR a separate ELR station was built in 1869 adjacent to the LB&amp;SCR station. It was closed in 1876 and the trains were diverted to the adjacent LB&amp;SCR station. It was reopened in 1884 for additional Metropolitan District Railway services only for it to close two years later. The ELR station was then demolished around 1900 and the site used for sidings.

In 1933 the Metropolitan railway was taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board, which operated services as part of the London Transport Metropolitan line. London Transport was superseded by Transport for London (TfL).

===Freight yard===
The London and Croydon planned to use New Cross as the London terminal for its freight traffic, as the station had good access to the Grand Surrey Canal. It therefore built extensive sidings for this purpose. After 1849 the principal freight-handling facility in the area was moved to Willow Walk on the Bricklayers Arms site, but the sidings continued to be used for the storage of carriages. An Ordnance Survey map for 1871 shows a substantial carriage shed on the west side of the main line, north of the station, but this was no longer shown on the 1894 map. It had been replaced by a combined carriage and locomotive shed on the east side of the line in 1894, but this closed in 1906.

Cross-London freight services were operated to the yard by the Great Eastern Railway, which maintained its own goods depot on the site from the 1870s. These services were continued by the London and North Eastern Railway from 1923, and after 1948 by the Eastern Region of British Railways. They ceased to operate in 1962.

===Locomotive depot and repair workshops===
The L&amp;CR opened a motive power depot and a locomotive repair facility here in 1839, the former of which appears to have been particularly accident prone. The original building, one of the earliest roundhouses, burned down in 1844. A replacement was built in 1845, and a straight shed built by the LB&amp;SCR in 1848 was blown down in a gale in October 1863. Two further buildings were constructed by the LB&amp;SCR in 1863 and 1869. By 1882 the second (1845) &quot;Croydon shed&quot; was derelict and in that year was replaced by &quot;the new shed&quot;, which was rebuilt with a new roof by the Southern Railway (SR) prior to 1929.

The various running sheds began to be run down during the 1930s as part of a re-organisation scheme involving new developments at Norwood Junction, but the onset of war meant that they were not formally closed until 1947 and were used for stabling locomotives until 1951. They were demolished in 1957 together with the repair workshops, and replaced by sidings for the storage of electric multiple units.

The locomotive workshops established by the L&amp;CR continued to undertake minor repairs on locomotives in the London area for the LB&amp;SCR and the SR, and also briefly for British Railways. They were closed in 1949.

===London Overground===
The East London line closed on 22 December 2007 and reopened on 27 April 2010 as part of the new London Overground system. The service was also closed between 1995 and 1998 due to repair work on the tunnel under the River Thames. The East London line extension included a flyover north of New Cross Gate allowing trains to run through from West Croydon, plus the construction of a train servicing facility nearby. Platform 1 and adjacent track (southbound) were refurbished, with the line continuing under New Cross Road, before merging with the down slow line. Overground services terminated here until 23 May 2010 when services were extended south. Ticket barriers were installed to all platforms in time for the London Overground services to commence.

===Bakerloo line extension===
TfL has proposed future London Underground services at this station as part of the Bakerloo line Extension. Due to financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, work to implement the extension is currently on hold.

==Services==
New Cross Gate is on the Windrush line of the London Overground, with services operated using EMUs. Additional services are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to 
* 8 tph to via (Windrush line)
* 2 tph to via 
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)

The station is also served by a single early morning and late evening service to via , with the early morning service continuing to and .

==Platform layout==
The layout is:
*Platform 1 is used by Windrush line (London Overground) trains to and 
*Platform 2 is used by stopping Southern trains to and Coulsdon Town
*Platform 3 is used by fast Thameslink and Southern trains towards East Croydon
*Platform 4 is used by fast Thameslink and Southern trains towards London Bridge
*Platform 5 is used by Windrush line (London Overground) trains to and stopping Southern trains to 

Thameslink trains and other Southern services regularly pass through and occasionally stop at the station.

<text>Ryan Michael Malcolm (born October 13, 1979) is a Canadian singer and realtor best known as the winner of the first season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;.

In 2003, he released his debut solo album &quot;Home&quot; which was certified Platinum in Canada. In 2006, Malcolm formed a new alternative rock band, Low Level Flight.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ryan grew up in Amherstview, a small town just west of Kingston. The son of John and Sharron Malcolm, Ryan had two older siblings, Kim and Sean. At the age of nine, Ryan&#x27;s parents were divorced and then John remarried. His wife Deborah had three children, and Ryan had three new step-siblings, Jordan, Reagan, and Grayson. Throughout the 1990s, Ryan&#x27;s father owned and operated many restaurants, where Ryan worked as a waiter, setting up his nickname on idol as &quot;waiter boy&quot;, in reference to the pop singer Avril Lavigne&#x27;s song &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. Both Malcolm and Lavigne attended the same high school in Napanee. Ryan had his musical debut singing at guest appearance with his Dad John, who had a solo vocal act. When John and his step-mom Deb opened their restaurant in Napanee, Ryan, 13 at the time, started singing regularly with his Dad. Later brother Reagan joined the act, and the band &quot;A Bit of Nostalgia&quot; was born.

Ryan continued singing with &quot;A Bit of Nostalgia&quot; until he won Idol. Presently, he enjoys coming home for reunion shows with his Dad and brother Reagan, for special events. Before entering &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, he also worked as a waiter at the Lone Star Texas Grill in Kingston.

===Canadian Idol===

Malcolm did not crack the top 10 in his first attempt but was awarded a spot on the wildcard show after which, because the vote was so close, he became the 11th contestant in the final group. His consistency throughout the final phase of the competition and his great song choices won him many fans and eventually the &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; crown.

=== After Idol ===
His debut single, &quot;Something More&quot; was released on radio the day after his win and to the public on September 30. It went four times platinum on the first day of its release and stayed at #1 on the Canadian Singles Chart for 13 consecutive weeks.

On December 9, 2003, Malcolm&#x27;s debut album &quot;Home&quot; was released. It debuted and peaked at #4 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was certified platinum, selling 170,000 copies and earning a Juno nomination for &quot;Best Pop Album&quot;.

Later that month, Malcolm participated in World Idol and shared the stage with Elton John and Victoria Beckham. Alongside fellow idol friend Kelly Clarkson, he placed sixth. He followed this with a tour of Eastern Canada with various guests, including Jacynthe, Gary Beals, and Audrey de Montigny. He returned to Europe two more times that year to perform with Annie Lennox at Royal Albert Hall in London as well as to perform in Prague.

He represented Canada at the National Children&#x27;s Peace Concert in the Czech Republic. He sang the national anthem at the 2004 Grey Cup.

He made his acting debut in the Ross Petty pantomime &quot;Snow White and the Group of Seven&quot; at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto with fellow finalists Gary Beals and Billy Klippert, as well as season two finalist Elena Juatco. Ryan also spent some time traveling in Africa and South America, where many of LLF&#x27;s songs were inspired. In 2006 and 2007 he was a two-time host of Toronto&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;Sunday Night Live&quot;.

Malcolm and his girlfriend briefly ran a restaurant in El Castillo, Costa Rica.

== Low Level Flight ==

In 2006, Malcolm formed and fronted a new five-piece alternative rock band &quot;Low Level Flight&quot;. On March 27, 2007, the band released their debut album &quot;Urgency&quot;. The band spent much of 2007 touring across Canada and later toured Mexico and the United States, promoting their debut album. In September 2007, LLF performed their second single from the album &quot;Say&quot; on the top three results show of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. In 2009, LLF signed a record deal with Times Of India, and toured throughout India. LLF released their second studio album &quot;Through These Walls&quot; in 2011. And toured UK and Europe twice in support of the release. They are currently on their third single &quot;TSK TSK&quot;. The band will return to India in early 2013 for more tour dates.

Along with fronting LLF, Malcolm is a CEO of I Heart Records, a Toronto-based record label.

<doc id="373579" wikidata="Q3044742" url="?curid=373579" title="Department of Health and Social Care">
<text>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for government policy on health and adult social care matters in England, along with a few elements of the same matters which are not otherwise devolved to the Scottish Government, Welsh Government or Northern Ireland Executive. It oversees the English National Health Service (NHS). The department is led by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care with three ministers of state and three parliamentary under-secretaries of state.

The department develops policies and guidelines to improve the quality of care and to meet patient expectations. It carries out some of its work through arms-length bodies (ALBs), including executive non-departmental public bodies such as NHS England and the NHS Digital, and executive agencies such as the UK Health Security Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The DHSC also manages the work of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).

The expenditure, administration and policy of the department are scrutinised by the Health and Social Care Select Committee.

==History==
Like many others, the department with responsibility for the nation&#x27;s health has had different names and has included other functions at different times.

In the 19th century, several bodies were formed for specific consultative duties and were dissolved when they were no longer required. There were two incarnations of a Board of Health, in 1805 and 1831, and from 1854 to 1858 a General Board of Health reported directly to the Privy Council. Responsibility for health issues was also in part vested in local health boards, which existed from 1848 to 1894. In 1871, the Local Government Board was created to supervise such local functions as health and sanitation and also took over the functions of the Poor Law Board, which was abolished. The Public Health Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 55) designated sanitary districts, which by the Local Government Act 1894 became rural and urban district councils. With the emergence of modern local government, some of its supervision was done by the Local Government Act Office, part of the Home Office.

The Ministry of Health Act 1919 abolished the Local Government Board and transferred its powers and duties to a new department called the Ministry of Health, which consolidated under a single authority the medical and public health functions of central government. This took on the medical duties of the Board of Education, the duties of the Privy Council under the Midwives Acts, the powers of the Home Secretary in relation to the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67), and the duties of the Insurance Commissioners and the Welsh Insurance Commissioners. In the early part of the 20th century, medical assistance had been provided through these National Health Insurance Commissions. Most of the Local Government Board staff transferred to the new ministry.

The co-ordination of local medical services was expanded in connection with emergency and wartime services, from 1935 to 1945, and these developments culminated in the establishment of the NHS in 1948. 

In 1968, the Ministry of Health was dissolved and its functions transferred (along with those of the similarly dissolved Ministry of Social Security) to the newly created Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). Twenty years later, in 1988, these functions were split back into two government departments, forming the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Department of Health, formally created in through The Transfer of Functions (Health and Social Security) Order 1988.

Following the 2018 British cabinet reshuffle, the department was renamed the Department of Health and Social Care.

==Location==
The department&#x27;s headquarters and ministerial offices are at 39 Victoria Street, London. The department moved from its previous location in Richmond House, Whitehall in November 2017. Its other principal offices are Skipton House (Elephant and Castle), Wellington House near Waterloo station and Quarry House in Leeds. Wellington House is now mainly occupied by staff from the department&#x27;s arms-length bodies. New King&#x27;s Beam House near Blackfriars Bridge was formerly a Department of Health office prior to the expiry of its lease in October 2011. Alexander Fleming House, Hannibal House and Eileen House (all in Elephant and Castle) were previously used by the department. The archives are at Nelson, Lancashire.

==Ministers==
The Department of Health and Social Care&#x27;s ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:
==Permanent secretary==
The permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care is Sir Christopher Wormald KCB, who was appointed in 2016.
Previous permanent secretaries:
* Dame Una O&#x27;Brien 2010–2016
* Sir Hugh Taylor KCB 2006–2010
* Sir Nigel Crisp KCB 2000–2006
* Sir Christopher Kelly KCB 1997–2000
* Sir Graham Hart KCB 1992–?
* Sir Christopher France GCB (DHSS including social security: 1987–1988, DH: 1987–1992)
* Sir Kenneth Stowe GCB CVO 1981–1987 (DHSS)

Following the resignation of Sir Nigel Crisp in March 2006, a separate post of Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England was created, held by Sir David Nicholson. Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and the creation of the independent NHS Commissioning Board, known as NHS England, this post has evolved into Chief Executive of the new organisation.

==Chief professional officers==
The department has six chief professional officers who provide it with expert knowledge and also advise the Ministers, other government departments and the Prime Minister. The Chief Medical Officer and Chief Nursing Officer are also directors of the department&#x27;s board.
==Arms-length bodies (ALBs)==
The department acts as a &#x27;steward&#x27; for the health and adult social care system in England and oversees fifteen arms-length bodies (ALBs):

===Executive agencies===
The department has two executive agencies:
* The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has the specialist role of assessing, licensing and regulating medicines and medical devices for use in the United Kingdom.
* Until April 1, 2021, Public Health England was responsible for delivering public health improvement through prevention and awareness raising and protection. It was replaced by a new agency UK Health Security Agency since April 2021, and became fully operational in October 2021.

===Executive non-departmental public bodies===
The department has thirteen executive non-departmental public bodies:
;United Kingdom
* The Human Tissue Authority regulates the use of human tissue in research and therapeutic treatments across the United Kingdom.
* The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which regulates and inspects in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination and the storage of human eggs, sperm or embryos. It also regulates human embryo research.
;England and Wales
* NHS Blood and Transplant, which is responsible for the supply of blood, organs, tissues and stem cells; their donation, storage and transportation.
* The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which provides advice on treatment procedures and assesses healthcare interventions for cost-effectiveness.
* The NHS Business Services Authority provides business support services to NHS organisations, including the administration of the NHS pension scheme.
;England only
* The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has the primary function of inspecting providers of health and adult social care in England, ensuring that they meet essential standards of safety and quality.
* NHS Digital, which provides statistical information and informatics support to the health and care system in England.
* Health Education England is responsible for ensuring enough high-quality training is available to develop the healthcare workforce.
* NHS England oversees the NHS in England, commissions specialised healthcare services and primary care services and oversees clinical commissioning groups and as of 1 April 2019 (formalised in June 2022,) oversees NHS trusts and foundation trusts in England, due to a merger with NHS Improvement which itself was only formed in April 2016 by combining:
** Monitor, which oversaw foundation trusts and applications from NHS trusts seeking foundation trust status. It also had the new role of examining pricing and competition in the NHS.
** The NHS Trust Development Authority had the function of helping NHS trusts achieve successful applications for foundation trust status.
* The Health Research Authority protects and promotes the interests of patients and the public in health research.
* NHS Resolution, handles negligence claims and helps the NHS learn lessons from claims to improve patient and staff safety.
* The NHS Counter Fraud Authority, tasked with leading the fight against NHS Fraud and corruption.

==Criticism==
===Introduction of user charges for NHS services===
The publication of Professor Lord Darzi&#x27;s review of the NHS prompted criticism of the government and the Department of Health, claiming that it paved the way for user charging, and so contradicting the NHS Plan 2000 which stated that &quot;user charges are unfair and inequitable in they increase the proportion of funding from the unhealthy, old and poor compared with the healthy, young and wealthy&quot;. The report also introduces the concept of personal budgets.

===Fragmentation of NHS services===
Darzi&#x27;s report splits previously integrated services into &#x27;core&#x27;, &#x27;additional&#x27; and &#x27;enhanced&#x27; services, which critics say will lead to abandoning the open-ended duty of care on which the NHS was founded.

===&quot;Superbugs&quot; and PFI===

Fatal outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (&quot;superbugs&quot;), such as methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, in NHS hospitals has led to criticism in 2008 of the department&#x27;s decision to outsource cleaning via private finance initiative contracts as &quot;cutting corners on cleaning&quot;.

A &quot;Deep Clean&quot; initiative announced by the Department of Health was criticised by infection control experts and by the Lancet as a gimmick which failed to address the causes of in-hospital infections, by the firms doing the work as an attempt to avoid paying for regular better cleaning, and by NHS managers as ineffective.

It also attracted criticism because only a quarter of the £60m funding for the scheme went to hospitals, and because a number of hospitals missed the completion target, and as of June 2008 one in four NHS trusts was not meeting the government&#x27;s standards on hygiene.

===Prescribing===
Its advice to primary care on prescribing drugs such as proton pump inhibitors has been criticised as wasteful.

===Medical training===
The DH has attracted criticism for its handling of the outcome of Modernising Medical Careers, in particular in the changes it made to the specialist training of doctors and the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS). These changes left &quot;29,193 junior doctors from the UK and overseas... chasing 15,600 posts...&quot; and resulted in accusations that the DH had broken the law by refusing to reveal scores to candidates. Ultimately there was a judicial review and a boycott of the system by senior doctors across the country. MTAS was eventually scrapped and Patricia Hewitt, the then Secretary of State for Health, resigned following accusations that she had lied to the House of Commons over the system. Even after the abolition of MTAS, anger among the medical profession continued, with the British Medical Association commenting of the DH response that &quot;Not only is this response too late, it does not go far enough&quot;.

The official government inquiry into MMC recommended that the responsibility for medical training be removed from the DH.

===Recurrent NHS reorganisation===
Successive DH ministerial teams have been criticised for repeated reorganisations of the NHS in England, where primary care commissioning responsibility, in particular, has been allocated to four different sets of organisations in the last ten years: PCGs, small area primary care trusts (PCTs) (e.g. covering a rural local authority district or part of a city), larger-area PCTs (e.g. covering a whole county), PCT clusters (e.g. quarter of London or South of Tyne and Wear) and the currently unspecified Clinical Commissioning Groups. The tendency to introduce each reorganisation before its predecessor has had time to settle down and generate improved performance has attracted censure amongst healthcare professions in the UK and beyond, including reference to the ironic concept of &#x27;redisorganization&#x27;.

Andrew Lansley&#x27;s promise before the 2010 general election not to impose top-down reorganisation, followed by the instigation from ministerial level of one of the most fundamental NHS reorganisations yet envisaged, has generated especially widespread opprobrium, although some commentators have also suggested that this is to some extent completing the job started under the Blair administration. The NHS as of 1 April 2013 is no longer situated within the DH, as NHS England also went &#x27;live&#x27; at the same time. Therefore, the DH has a further scrutiny role of NHS services and commissioning.

==Information technology==
In recent years the Department of Health and the NHS have come under considerable scrutiny for its use of IT. Since being elected to power in 1997 the Labour government had sought to modernise the NHS through the introduction of IT. Although the policy is correct in aim, many claim its execution is lacking.

In September 2008 a new leadership team was established, CIO for Health, Christine Connelly, and director of programme and system delivery Martin Bellamy. Previous CIO Richard Granger was believed to have been the most highly paid civil servant in the UK and was a controversial figure. Connelly left the DH for a position in the Cabinet Office in June 2009 and was replaced by Tim Donohoe and Carol Clarke.

Connelly&#x27;s role was to &quot;deliver the Department&#x27;s overall information strategy and integrating leadership across the NHS&quot;, according to the DH&#x27;s website. That strategy, known as the National Programme for IT, is intended to do nothing less than revolutionise NHS information workflow and is costed at about £12.7bn. The success or otherwise of Connelly&#x27;s reign will be based on her promise to end delays of electronic medical records. She has said that if there is not clear progress by November 2009, a new plan could be hatched.

On the eve of the departure of Fujitsu as an outsourcing partner, Connelly said in April 2009 that she would open up sourcing to competition at &quot;acute&quot; sites in the south of England and offer toolkits by March 2010 to allow more local configuration of systems.

In January 2009, MPs criticised DH for its confidentiality agreement with key supplier CSC and in March the department was admonished by the Information Commissioner for its records management. In May 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he was considering scrapping the project.

In 2022 Sajid Javid launched the &quot;Plan for Digital Health and Social Care&quot;, which includes &quot;regulatory levers&quot; will be used to: &quot;signal that digitisation is a priority, identify the non-negotiable standards of digital capability, [and] explain how we will monitor and support compliance&quot;. Integrated care systems will be required to put in place a joined-up health and social care record by March 2025 in which all clinical teams will have access to a complete view of a person&#x27;s record that they can contribute to. In 2022 86% of trusts had &quot;some form of electronic patient record&quot; but only 45% of social care providers used a digital social care record, and 23% of care home staff cannot access the internet consistently. The NHS app is to be a &quot;digital front door&quot; for patients, with increasing functionality to be added and remote consultations with GPs are to be encouraged. £25 million is to be provided in 2022/23 to support the rapid digitisation of social care, including adopting Digital Social Care Records.

==2010–11 staffing cuts==
In response to Government spending reduction targets following the 2008-9 international financial crisis and subsequent recession, DH in common with several other Government Departments resorted to large-scale staffing reductions. In order to minimise redundancy costs, the predominant impact was upon DH staff not employed through a traditional civil service &#x27;headcount&#x27; contract, with a resultant emphasised effect upon more recent or innovative work-streams dependent upon seconded or externally hosted staff. This has attracted criticism from several of the professional and patient communities of interest concerned, for instance as regards the impact upon Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and the withdrawal of the practical assistance available to the NHS and local authorities via the national support teams.

==Devolution==
Most health policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved to the department&#x27;s counterparts:
* the Scottish Government Health and Wellbeing Directorate
* the Welsh Government
* the Department of Health, Northern Ireland Executive

The comparability factor (the proportion of spending in this area which is devolved) was 99.5% for all three countries for 2021/22.

A number of health issues are, however, wholly or partly reserved to Westminster:

===Scotland===
* regulation of the health professions
* xenotransplantation
* embryology, surrogacy and human genetics
* human fertilisation
* medicines, medical supplies and poisons
===Northern Ireland===
* xenotransplantation
* surrogacy
* human fertilisation and embryology
* human genetics
In Northern Ireland, abortion law is a criminal justice matter and is devolved.

===Wales===
* regulation of the health professions
* abortion
* xenotransplantation
* embryology, surrogacy and human genetics
* medicines, medical supplies and poisons

<doc id="373581" wikidata="Q801253" url="?curid=373581" title="New Cross railway station">
<text>New Cross is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southeastern, located in New Cross in south-east London. It is down the line from and is in London fare zone 2. It is a southern terminus of some Windrush line services from .

There is an out-of-station interchange with station, also situated on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located walk away. To avoid confusion with those at New Cross Gate, the platforms at New Cross are lettered rather than numbered. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms.

==History==
In the early Victorian railway boom two companies constructed lines through the area. The London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR) built a station on the New Cross Road close to Hatcham in 1839.

On 14 October 1844 a large fire that broke out in a paint shop destroyed carriage and engine sheds and workshops adjacent to the station. The fire was witnessed by Louis Philippe I, King of France who was travelling from the station to Dover.

On 30 July 1849 the South Eastern Railway (SER) opened a station at North Kent Junction when the North Kent line opened linking Strood with the London and Greenwich Railway route to London Bridge. This station proved inconvenient so a new station called New Cross &amp; Naval School was opened by the SER in October 1850 located adjacent to the New Cross Road in the heart of New Cross. In 1854 the station was renamed New Cross. Accordingly, both the South Eastern Railway (SER) and the London Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway had stations named New Cross which caused confusion until the two companies were absorbed under the 1923 grouping into the Southern Railway and the name of the older station was changed to New Cross Gate; the ex-South Eastern station remained New Cross.

On 7 December 1869 the East London Line opened serving the LBSCR New Cross station but it was not until 1 April 1880 that services (which started at Addiscombe and worked through to Liverpool Street) started operation via New Cross SER. Freight trains also operated via the East London Line and were hauled by Great Eastern Railway locomotives through to Hither Green Goods Yards. From 30 June 1911 East London Line passenger services south of New Cross ceased.

On 31 March 1913 electric passenger services operated by the Metropolitan Railway started operation from New Cross and worked through to Kensington Addison Road via Kings Cross.

After World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station was part of British Railways Southern Region.

The East London Line was closed to goods traffic in 1962.

In the 1950s and 1960s, London Underground planned a new line connecting north-west and south-east London. Approval for the first stage of the Fleet line (renamed the Jubilee line in 1975) to Charing Cross was granted in 1969, with second and third stages approved in 1971 and 1972. New Cross station was to be the penultimate station of phase 3 running to Lewisham. Southbound trains were to serve one of the existing platforms and northbound trains would have served a new platform in tunnel beneath the station. Although phases 2 and 3 were not carried out due to a lack of funds, a section of the northbound tunnel was constructed near New Cross in 1972 to test new tunnelling techniques.

The station was rebuilt in the 1970s and the original station buildings on the road bridge were replaced in 1975 by a wooden building which opened in Amersham Vale. Platforms on the down and up fast lines were closed and demolished and a new track layout was introduced at this time in connection with the wider London Bridge re-signaling scheme.

In 1985, the present buildings in Amersham Vale opened.

Until 22 December 2007 London Underground used to serve this station as the southern terminus to their East London line. This closed for major engineering work to convert the East London line to standard 750 V third rail electrification. The line reopened on 27 April 2010 with services now operated by London Overground using &quot;Capitalstar&quot; units.

==Carriage Shed==
A 6 siding carriage shed was located just north of the station. Built by the East London Railway the shed was leased by the Metropolitan Railway and continued in service until the line closed in 2007. When the line re-opened the new Capitalstar units were maintained at a new depot at New Cross Gate.

==Services==
New Cross is a southern terminus of the Windrush line of the London Overground, with services operated using EMUs. Additional services at the station are operated by Southeastern using , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 6 tph to London Cannon Street
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via , continuing to London Cannon Street via Woolwich Arsenal and 
* 4 tph to via (Windrush line)

Additional services, including trains to and from London Cannon Street via call at the station during the peak hours.

==Gallery==
==Connections==
London Buses routes 53, 177, 225, 453 and night routes N53 and N89 serve the station.

==Accidents==
*The Spa Road Junction rail crash occurred outside the station on 8 January 1999.
*On 10 January 2022, a passenger train ran into the buffer stop at New Cross.

<doc id="373601" wikidata="Q92062" url="?curid=373601" title="Motte-and-bailey castle">
<text>A motte-and-bailey castle is a European fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised area of ground called a motte, accompanied by a walled courtyard, or bailey, surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade. Relatively easy to build with unskilled labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire, as well as the Low Countries it controlled, in the 11th century, when these castles were popularized in the area that became the Netherlands. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By the end of the 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.

==Architecture==

===Structures===
A motte-and-bailey castle was made up of two structures: a motte (a type of mound – often artificial – topped with a wooden or stone structure known as a keep); and at least one bailey (a fortified enclosure built next to the motte). The constructive elements themselves are ancient, but the term &quot;motte-and-bailey&quot; is a relatively modern one and is not medieval in origin. The word is the French version of the Latin , and in France, the word , generally used for a clump of turf, came to refer to a turf bank, and by the 12th century was used to refer to the castle design itself. The word &quot;bailey&quot; comes from the Norman-French , or , referring to a low yard. In medieval sources, the Latin term was used to describe the bailey complex within these castles.

One contemporary account of these structures comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130, describing the Calais region in northern France. De Colmieu described how the nobles would build &quot;a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible. The space on top of the mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs, strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide. Inside the enclosure is a citadel, or keep, which commands the whole circuit of the defences. The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reaches to the top of the mound&quot;. At Durham Castle, contemporaries described how the motte-and-bailey superstructure arose from the &quot;tumulus of rising earth&quot; with a keep rising &quot;into thin air, strong within and without&quot; with a &quot;stalwart house ... glittering with beauty in every part&quot;.

====Motte====

Mottes were made out of earth and flattened on top, and it can be very hard to determine whether a mound is artificial or natural without excavation. Some were also built over older artificial structures, such as Bronze Age barrows. The size of mottes varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10–100 feet), and from in diameter. This minimum height of for mottes is usually intended to exclude smaller mounds which often had non-military purposes. In England and Wales, only 7% of mottes were taller than high; 24% were between , and 69% were less than tall. A motte was protected by a ditch around it, which would typically have also been a source of the earth and soil for constructing the mound itself.

A keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of the motte. Some walls would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight; this was called a &quot;garillum&quot;. Smaller mottes could support only simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building. Many wooden keeps were designed with bretèches, or brattices, small balconies that projected from the upper floors of the building, allowing defenders to cover the base of the fortification wall. The early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep on top of the motte at the castle of Ardres, where the &quot;first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living rooms of the residents in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept ... In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms ... In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep&quot;. Wooden structures on mottes could be protected by skins and hides to prevent their being easily set alight during a siege.

====Bailey====
The bailey was an enclosed courtyard overlooked by the high motte and surrounded by a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch. The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was the centre of the castle&#x27;s economic activity. The bailey was connected to the motte by a bridge, or, as often seen in England, by steps cut into the motte. Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle. Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.

In practice, there was a wide number of variations to this common design. A castle could have more than one bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Tump (Herefordshire). Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.

===Construction and maintenance===

Various methods were used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an artificial mound, but more commonly much of the motte would have to be constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.

Regardless of the sequencing, artificial mottes had to be built by piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks as well in the later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as that of Thetford Castle, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.
The type of soil would make a difference to the design of the motte, as clay soils could support a steeper motte, whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline. Where available, layers of different sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength to the design. Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength. Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive. Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, &quot;almost indestructible&quot;, they required frequent maintenance. Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them. Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.

Although motte-and-bailey castles are the best-known castle design, they were not always the most numerous in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built on top of a raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the &quot;terpen&quot; in the Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.

==History==

===Emergence of the design===

The motte-and-bailey castle is a particularly western and northern European phenomenon, most numerous in France and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond. European castles first emerged between the Loire river and the Rhine in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse. Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across western and northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design. One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack – the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers. Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Norman style, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Anjou. The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian André Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.

An alternative approach focuses on the links between this form of castle and what can be termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged as a result of the pressures of space on ringworks and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.

===Initial development, 10th and 11th centuries===

The earliest purely documentary evidence for motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy and Angers comes from between 1020 and 1040, but a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence pushes the date for the first motte and bailey castle, at Vincy, back to 979. The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060. Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards, belying the power and prestige of their builders. William the Conqueror, as the Duke of Normandy, is believed to have adopted the motte-and-bailey design from neighbouring Anjou. Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the &quot;Consuetudines et Justicie&quot;, with his legal definition of castles centring on the classic motte-and-bailey features of ditching, banking and palisading.

By the 11th century, castles were built throughout the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically took the form of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German &quot;Bergfried&quot;). The largest castles had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France during the first half of the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local &quot;gród&quot;, or town. motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the more prestigious &quot;Höhenburgen&quot; built on high ground, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.
In England, William invaded from Normandy in 1066, resulting in three phases of castle building in England, around 80% of which were in the motte-and-bailey pattern. The first of these was the establishment by the new king of royal castles in key strategic locations, including many towns. These urban castles could make use of the existing town&#x27;s walls and fortification, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them. This could cause extensive damage: records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed in the construction of Lincoln Castle, and that 113 were destroyed for the castle in Norwich and 27 for the castle in Cambridge. The second and third waves of castle building in the late-11th century were led by the major magnates and then the more junior knights on their new estates. Some regional patterns in castle building can be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches, for example; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of unfree labour for constructing mottes. In Wales, the first wave of the Norman castles was again predominantly made of wood in a mixture of motte-and-bailey and ringwork designs. The Norman invaders spread up the valleys, using this form of castle to occupy their new territories. After the Norman conquest of England and Wales, the building of motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy accelerated as well, resulting in a broad swath of these castles across the Norman territories, around 741 motte-and-bailey castles in England and Wales alone.

===Further expansion, 12th and 13th centuries===

Having become well established in Normandy, Germany and Britain, motte-and-bailey castles began to be adopted elsewhere, mainly in northern Europe, during the 12th and 13th centuries. Conflict through the Low Countries encouraged castle building in a number of regions from the late 12th century to the 14th century. In Flanders, the first motte and bailey castles began relatively early at the end of the 11th century. The rural motte-and-bailey castles followed the traditional design, but the urban castles often lacked the traditional baileys, using parts of the town to fulfil this role instead. Motte-and-bailey castles in Flanders were particularly numerous in the south along the Lower Rhine, a fiercely contested border. Further along the coast in Friesland, the relatively decentralised, egalitarian society initially discouraged the building of motte and bailey castles, although &quot;terpen&quot;, raised &quot;dwelling mounds&quot; which lacked towers and were usually lower in height than a typical motte, were created instead. By the end of the medieval period, however, the &quot;terpen&quot; gave way to &quot;hege wieren&quot;, non-residential defensive towers, often on motte-like mounds, owned by the increasingly powerful nobles and landowners. On Zeeland the local lords had a high degree of independence during the 12th and 13th centuries, owing to the wider conflict for power between neighbouring Flanders and Friesland. The Zeeland lords had also built &quot;terpen&quot; mounds, but these gave way to larger &quot;werven&quot; constructions–effectively mottes–which were later termed &quot;bergen&quot;. Sometimes both &quot;terpen&quot; and &quot;werven&quot; are called &quot;vliedburg&quot;, or &quot;refuge castles&quot;. During the 12th and 13th centuries a number of &quot;terpen&quot; mounds were turned into &quot;werven&quot; mottes, and some new &quot;werven&quot; mottes were built from scratch. Around 323 known or probable motte and bailey castles of this design are believed to have been built within the borders of the modern Netherlands.
In neighbouring Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat later in the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due to the less feudal society. Except for a handful of motte and bailey castles in Norway, built in the first half of the 11th century and including the royal residence in Oslo, the design did not play a role further north in Scandinavia.

The Norman expansion into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing threat to the remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.
Motte-and-bailey castles in Scotland emerged as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the 12th century. David I encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland, introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested lowlands. The quasi-independent polity of Galloway, which had resisted the rule of David and his predecessors, was a particular focus for this colonisation. The size of these Scottish castles, primarily wooden motte and bailey constructions, varied considerably, from larger designs such as the Bass of Inverurie to smaller castles like Balmaclellan.
Motte-and-bailey castles were introduced to Ireland following the Norman invasion of Ireland that began between 1166 and 1171 under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with the occupation of southern and eastern Ireland by a number of Anglo-Norman barons. The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages; their cavalry enabled Norman successes in battles, and castles enabled them to control the newly conquered territories. The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions; most of these were motte-and-bailey constructions, many of them strongly defended. Unlike Wales, the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period. Between 350 and 450 motte-and-bailey castles are believed to remain today, although the identification of these earthwork remains can be contentious.

A small number of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of northern Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came to refer to a range of different castle types as &quot;motta&quot;, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought on the basis of the documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.

===Conversion and decline, 13th–14th centuries===

Motte-and-bailey castles became a less popular design in the mid-medieval period. In France, they were not built after the start of the 12th century, and mottes ceased to be built in most of England after around 1170, although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches. Many motte-and-bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly; in England, many had been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by the 12th century. In the Low Countries and Germany, a similar transition occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries.

One factor was the introduction of stone into castle buildings. The earliest stone castles had emerged in the 10th century, with stone keeps being built on mottes along the Catalonia frontier and several, including Château de Langeais, in Angers. Although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought, stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep and the gatehouse usually the first parts to be upgraded. Shell keeps were built on many mottes, circular stone shells running around the top of the motte, sometimes protected by a further chemise, or low protective wall, around the base. By the 14th century, a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses.
Newer castle designs placed less emphasis on mottes. Square Norman keeps built in stone became popular following the first such construction in Langeais in 994. Several were built in England and Wales after the conquest; by 1216 there were around 100 in the country. These massive keeps could be either erected on top of settled, well-established mottes or could have mottes built around them – so-called &quot;buried&quot; keeps. The ability of mottes, especially newly built mottes, to support the heavier stone structures, was limited, and many needed to be built on fresh ground. Concentric castles, relying on several lines of baileys and defensive walls, made increasingly little use of keeps or mottes at all.

Across Europe, motte-and-bailey construction came to an end. At the end of the 12th century, the Welsh rulers began to build castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales and usually along the higher peaks where mottes were unnecessary. In Flanders, a decline came in the 13th century as feudal society changed. In the Netherlands, cheap brick started to be used in castles from the 13th century onwards in place of earthworks, and many mottes were levelled, to help develop the surrounding, low-lying fields; these &quot;levelled mottes&quot; are a particularly Dutch phenomenon. In Denmark, motte and baileys gave way in the 14th century to a &quot;castrum-curia&quot; model, where the castle was built with a fortified bailey and a fortified mound, somewhat smaller than the typical motte. By the 12th century, the castles in Western Germany began to thin in number, due to changes in land ownership, and various mottes were abandoned. In Germany and Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles also provided the model for the later &quot;wasserburg&quot;, or &quot;water castle&quot;, a stronghold and bailey construction surrounded by water, and widely built in the late medieval period.

===Today===
In England, motte-and-bailey earthworks were put to various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes were turned into garden features in the 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War. Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, with one of the few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents. Another example is Durham Castle in northern England, where the round tower is used for student accommodation.

The landscape of northern Europe remains scattered with mottes and their earthworks, and many form popular tourist attractions.

<doc id="373603" wikidata="Q741745" url="?curid=373603" title="Booster (rocketry)">
<text>A booster is a rocket (or rocket engine) used either in the first stage of a multistage launch vehicle or in parallel with longer-burning sustainer rockets to augment the space vehicle&#x27;s takeoff thrust and payload capability. Boosters are traditionally necessary to launch spacecraft into low Earth orbit (absent a single-stage-to-orbit design), and are especially important for a space vehicle to go beyond Earth orbit. The booster is dropped to fall back to Earth once its fuel is expended, a point known as &quot;booster engine cut-off&quot; (BECO).

Following booster separation, the rest of the launch vehicle continues flight with its core or upper-stage engines. The booster may be recovered, refurbished and reused, as was the case of the steel casings used for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters.

==Drop-away engines==
The SM-65 Atlas rocket used three engines, one of which was fixed to the fuel tank, and two of which were mounted on a skirt which dropped away at BECO. This was used as an Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM); to launch the crewed Project Mercury capsule into orbit; and as the first stage of the Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur launch vehicles.

==Strap-on==

Several launch vehicles, including GSLV Mark III and Titan IV, employ strap-on boosters. NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle was the first crewed vehicle to use strap-on boosters. Launch vehicles like Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy employ strap-on liquid rocket boosters.

==Recoverable ==
The booster casings for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters were recovered and refurbished for reuse from 1981 to 2011 as part of the Space Shuttle program.

In a new development program initiated in 2011, SpaceX developed reusable first stages of their Falcon 9 rocket. After launching the second stage and the payload, the booster returns to launch site or flies to a drone ship and lands vertically. After landing multiple boosters both on land and on drone ships in 2015–2016, a landed stage was first reflown in March 2017: Rocket core B1021 that had been used to launch a re-supply mission to the ISS when new in April 2016 was subsequently used to launch the satellite SES-10 in March 2017. The program was intended to reduce launch prices significantly, and by 2018, SpaceX had reduced launch prices on a flight-proven boosters to , the lowest price in the industry for medium-lift launch services.

By August 2019, the recovery and reuse of Falcon 9 boosters had become routine, with booster landings/recovery being attempted on more than 90 percent of all SpaceX flights, and successful landings and recoveries occurring 65 times out of 75 attempts. In total 25 recovered boosters have been refurbished and subsequently flown a second time by late 2020, with several having been flown a third time as well.

In late 2020, Rocket Lab guided the booster of their Electron rocket for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean with a parafoil after launching the Return to Sender mission, as part of a program to catch the booster with a helicopter and reuse it on later missions.

==Use in aviation==
Rocket boosters used on aircraft are known as jet-assisted take-off (JATO) rockets.

Various missiles also use solid rocket boosters. Examples are:
*2K11 (SA-4) which uses SRBs as a first stage, and then a ramjet.
*S-200 (SA-5) which uses SRBs as the first stage, followed by a liquid fuel rocket.
*Surface and submarine launched versions of the turbojet-powered Boeing Harpoon and many other cruise missiles use an SRB.

* Booster Systems Engineer - a support position at NASA&#x27;s mission control, referred to by call sign &quot;BOOSTER&quot;
*Falcon 9 B1060

<text>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is an art museum located on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile vicinity of Los Angeles. LACMA is on Museum Row, adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits (George C. Page Museum).

LACMA was founded in 1961, splitting from the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art. Four years later, it moved to the Wilshire Boulevard complex designed by William Pereira. The museum&#x27;s wealth and collections grew in the 1980s, and it added several buildings beginning in that decade and continuing in subsequent decades.

LACMA is the largest art museum in the western United States. It attracts nearly a million visitors annually. It holds more than 150,000 works spanning the history of art from ancient times to the present. In addition to art exhibits, the museum features film and concert series.

==History==
===Early years===

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was established as a museum in 1961. Prior to this, LACMA was part of the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art, founded in 1910 in Exposition Park near the University of Southern California.

Edward W. Carter helped orchestrate the fundraising effort for LACMA in response to J. Paul Getty&#x27;s increasing reluctance to donate any more artworks to Los Angeles County. Getty had donated a few excellent artworks such as the Ardabil Carpet and Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Martin Looten&quot;, but then became aware of their shabby and disorganized presentation in the county&#x27;s aging multipurpose museum and chose to establish his own art museum next to his house.

Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr., Anna Bing Arnold and Bart Lytton were the first principal patrons of the new county art museum. Ahmanson made the lead donation of $2 million, convincing the museum board that sufficient funds could be raised to establish the new museum. In 1965 the museum moved to a new Wilshire Boulevard complex as an independent, art-focused institution, the largest new museum to be built in the United States after the National Gallery of Art.

===William Pereira Buildings===
The museum, built in a style similar to Lincoln Center and the Los Angeles Music Center, consisted of three buildings: the Ahmanson Building, the Bing Center, and the Lytton Gallery (renamed the Frances and Armand Hammer Building in 1968). The board selected LA architect William Pereira over the directors&#x27; recommendation of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the buildings. According to a 1965 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; story, the total cost of the three buildings was $11.5 million. Construction began in 1963, and was undertaken by the Del E. Webb Corporation. Construction was completed in early 1965. At the time, the Los Angeles Music Center and LACMA were concurrent large civic projects which vied for attention and donors in Los Angeles. When the museum opened, the buildings were surrounded by reflecting pools, but they were filled in and covered over when tar from the adjacent La Brea Tar Pits began seeping in.

===1980s===
Money poured into LACMA during the boom years of the 1980s, a reportedly $209 million in private donations during director Earl Powell&#x27;s tenure. To house its growing collections of modern and contemporary art and to provide more space for exhibitions, the museum hired the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates to design its $35.3-million, 115,000-square-foot Robert O. Anderson Building for 20th-century art, which opened in 1986 (renamed the Art of the Americas Building in 2007). In the far-reaching expansion, museum-goers henceforth entered through the new partially roofed central court, nearly an acre of space bounded by the museum&#x27;s four buildings.

The museum&#x27;s Pavilion for Japanese Art, designed by maverick architect Bruce Goff, opened in 1988, as did the B. Gerald Cantor Sculpture Garden of Rodin bronzes.

In 1999, the Hancock Park Improvement Project was complete, and the LACMA-adjacent park (designed by landscape architect Laurie Olin) was inaugurated with a free public celebration. The $10-million renovation replaced dead trees and bare earth with picnic facilities, walkways, viewing sites for the La Brea tar pits and a 150-seat red granite amphitheater designed by artist Jackie Ferrara.

Also in 1994, LACMA purchased the adjacent former May Company department store building, an impressive example of streamline moderne architecture designed by Albert C. Martin Sr. LACMA West increased the museum&#x27;s size by 30 percent when the building opened in 1998.

===Renzo Piano Buildings===
In 2004 LACMA&#x27;s board of trustees unanimously approved a plan for LACMA&#x27;s transformation by architect Rem Koolhaas, who had proposed razing all the current buildings and constructing an entirely new single, tent-topped structure, estimated to cost $200 million to $300 million. Kohlhaas edged out French architect Jean Nouvel, who would have added a major building while renovating the older facilities. The list of candidates had previously narrowed to five in May 2001: Koolhaas, Nouvel, Steven Holl, Daniel Libeskind and Thom Mayne.

However, the project soon stalled after the museum failed to secure funding. In 2004 LACMA&#x27;s board of trustees unanimously approved plans to transform the museum, led by architect Renzo Piano. The planned transformation consisted of three phases.

Phase I started in 2004 and was completed in February 2008. The renovations required demolishing the parking structure on Ogden Avenue and with it LACMA-commissioned graffiti art by street artists Margaret Kilgallen and Barry McGee. The entry pavilion is a key point in architect Renzo Piano&#x27;s plan to unify LACMA&#x27;s sprawling, often confusing layout of buildings. The BP Grand Entrance and the adjacent Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) comprise the $191 million (originally $150 million) first phase of the three-part expansion and renovation campaign. BCAM is named for Eli and Edy Broad, who gave $60 million to LACMA&#x27;s campaign; Eli Broad also served on LACMA&#x27;s board of directors. BCAM opened on February 16, 2008, adding of exhibition space to the museum. In 2010 the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion opened to the public, providing the largest purpose-built, naturally lit, open-plan museum space in the world.

The second phase was intended to turn the May building into new offices and galleries, designed by SPF Architects. As proposed, it would have had flexible gallery space, education space, administrative offices, a new restaurant, a gift shop and a bookstore, as well as study centers for the museum&#x27;s departments of costume and textiles, photography and prints and drawings, and a roof sculpture garden with two works by James Turrell. However, construction of this phase was halted in November 2010. Phase two and three were never completed.

===Zumthor proposal===
Specifics about the third phase, which initially was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed. In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA&#x27;s director Michael Govan was working with Swiss architect and Pritzker Prize laureate Peter Zumthor on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus, the Perreira Buildings between the two new Renzo Piano buildings and the tar pits. Architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill collaborated with Zumthor on the building&#x27;s design. With an estimated cost of $650 million, Zumthor&#x27;s first proposal called for a horizontal building along Wilshire Boulevard. It would have been wrapped in glass on all sides and its main galleries lifted one floor into the air. The wide roof would have been covered with solar panels. In a later concession to concerns raised by its neighbor, the Page Museum, LACMA had Zumthor alter the shape of his proposed building to stretch across Wilshire Boulevard and away from the La Brea Tar Pits.

In June 2014, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved $5 million for LACMA to continue its proposed plans to tear down the structures on the east end of its campus for a single museum building. Later that year, they approved in concept a plan that would provide public financing and $125 million toward the $600-million project.

On April 8, 2019, the Zumthor-designed building was approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The final approved building designed was scaled back from the original to , with gallery space shrinking from to . The new proposal also dropped the black form aesthetics, reducing it to a one-level, aboveground, glass-enclosed, sand-colored concrete building, to save costs. The design still calls for an arm above Wilshire Boulevard.

Other than necessary mechanical systems and bathrooms, the building&#x27;s entire second story will be devoted to gallery space. Arranged in four broad clusters around the building, each one of the twenty-six core galleries is designed in the form of a square or a rectangle at various scales. Other services, among them the museum&#x27;s education department, shop and three restaurants, will be at ground level, as will a 300-seat theater in the section of the building on the southern side of Wilshire Boulevard.

The total cost was estimated to be at $650 million, with LA county providing $125 million in funds and the rest raised by fundraising. LACMA raised $560 million by 2019 and $700 million by 2022. The total estimate is now at $750 million by 2023.

In 2020, four buildings on the campus were demolished to make way for a reconstructed facility. His design drew strong community opposition and was lambasted by architectural critics and museum curators, who objected to its reduced gallery space, poor design, and exorbitant costs. The re-designed final building was criticized by some local architects, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial architect Christopher Knight, calling the plans &quot;half baked&quot;. Antonio Pacheco called the plans an &quot;affront to L.A.&#x27;s architectural and cultural heritage.&quot; Especially criticized was the plan&#x27;s reduction in gallery space. The plans raised significant controversy from Angelenos as well, prompting a &quot;Save LACMA&quot; campaign. Los Angeles owns air rights above Wilshire, so the city council must give approval to the project, since part of the structure goes over the street.

Demolition of the Pereira buildings began in April 2020. The demolition was completed in October of that same year. By 2021, construction slowed with the discovery of on-site fossil finds. In the meantime, the Zumthor building opening was pushed back to 2024, and eventually, 2026. 

==Partnerships==
===Watts Towers===
In 2010 LACMA partnered with the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department in an effort to ensure the preservation of the Watts Towers, offering its staff, expertise, and fundraising assistance. As of 2018, LACMA is working with Los Angeles County to develop a site at the Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson Park, which is close to Watts Towers.

===South Los Angeles Wetlands Park site===
In 2018, LACMA secured a 35-year lease on an 80,000-square-foot, city-owned former Metro maintenance and storage yard from 1911 in the South Los Angeles Wetlands Park area.

===Las Vegas Museum of Art===
In 2023, LACMA and the foundation of the philanthropist Elaine Wynn announced their partnership to launch the Las Vegas Museum of Art (LVMA). That same year, the Las Vegas council approved negotiations to dedicate a parcel of land for the proposed 90,000-square-foot, three-story building of the Las Vegas Museum of Art in Symphony Park.

===&quot;Local Access&quot;===
With the support of a 2021 grant provided by Art Bridges and the Terra Foundation for American Art, LACMA launched a collaboration called Local Access, in which the museum shares portions of its collection with the Lancaster Museum of Art and History, Riverside Art Museum, Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College, and California State University, Northridge, Art Galleries.

==Exhibitions==
In 1971, curator Maurice Tuchman&#x27;s revolutionary &quot;Art and Technology&quot; exhibit opened at LACMA after its debut at the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka, Japan. The museum staged its first exhibition by contemporary black artists later that year, featuring Charles Wilbert White, Timothy Washington and David Hammons, then little known. The museum&#x27;s best-attended show ever was &quot;Treasures of Tutankhamun&quot;, which drew 1.2 million during four months in 1978. The 2005 &quot;Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs&quot; drew 937,613 during its 137-day run. A 1999 show of Vincent van Gogh masterpieces from the artist&#x27;s eponymous Amsterdam museum is the third most successful show, and a 1984 exhibition of French Impressionist works is fourth. In 1994, &quot;Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar&quot; opened to rave reviews and large crowds, drawing more than 153,000 visitors.

Since the arrival of current director Michael Govan, about 80% of just over 100 featured temporary exhibitions have been of Modern or contemporary art while the permanent exhibitions feature work dating from antiquity, including pre-Columbian, Assyrian and Egyptian art through contemporary art.

More recent exhibits, focusing on popular culture and entertainment, have also been well-received, both by critics and patrons. Exhibits devoted to the works of movie-directors Tim Burton and Stanley Kubrick drew especially positive reactions and responses.

==Collections==

LACMA&#x27;s more than 120,000 objects are divided among its numerous departments by region, media, and time period and are spread amongst the various museum buildings.

===Modern and Contemporary Art===

The Modern Art collection is displayed in the Ahmanson Building, which was renovated in 2008 to have a new entrance featuring a large staircase, conceived as a gathering place similar to Rome&#x27;s Spanish Steps. Filling the atrium at the base of the staircase is Tony Smith&#x27;s massive sculpture &quot;Smoke&quot; (1967). The plaza level galleries also house African art and a gallery highlighting the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies.

The modern collection on the plaza level displays works from 1900 to the 1970s, largely populated by the Janice and Henri Lazarof Collection. In December 2007, Janice and Henri Lazarof gave LACMA 130 mostly modernist works estimated to be worth more than $100 million. The collection includes 20 works by Picasso, watercolors and paintings by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky and a considerable number of sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Constantin Brâncuși, Henry Moore, Willem de Kooning, Joan Miró, Louise Nevelson, Archipenko, and Arp.
The Contemporary Art collection is displayed in the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM), opened on February 16, 2008. BCAM&#x27;s inaugural exhibition featured 176 works by 28 artists of postwar Modern art from the late 1950s to the present. All but 30 of the works initially displayed came from the collection of Eli and Edythe Broad (pronounced &quot;brode&quot;). Long-time trustee Robert Halff had already donated 53 works of contemporary art in 1994. Components of that gift included Joan Miró, Jasper Johns, Sam Francis, Frank Stella, Lari Pittman, Chris Burden, Richard Serra, John Chamberlain, Matthew Barney, and Jeff Koons. It also provided LACMA with its first drawings by Claes Oldenburg and Cy Twombly.

&quot;Back Seat Dodge &#x27;38&quot; (1964), by Edward Kienholz, is a sculpture portraying a couple engaged in sexual activity in the back seat of a truncated 1938 Dodge automobile chassis. The piece won Kienholz instant celebrity in 1966 when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors tried to ban the sculpture as pornographic and threatened to withhold financing from LACMA if it included the work in a Kienholz retrospective. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture&#x27;s car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, &quot;Back Seat Dodge &#x27;38&quot; has drawn crowds.

===American and Latin American art===
The Art of the Americas Building has American, Latin American, and pre-Columbian collections displayed on the second floor and temporary exhibition space on the first floor. Formerly known as the Anderson Building, the Art of the Americas Building comprises galleries for art from North, Central, and South America.

From 1972 to 1976, Donelson Hoopes served as Senior Curator of American Art.

LACMA&#x27;s Latin American Art galleries reopened in July 2008 after several years renovation. The Latin American collection includes pre-Columbian, Spanish Colonial, Modern, and contemporary works. Many recent additions to the collection were financed by sales of works from an 1,800 piece holding of 20th century Mexican art compiled by dealer-collectors Bernard and Edith Lewin and given to the museum in 1997.

The pre-Columbian galleries were redesigned by Jorge Pardo, a Los Angeles artist who works in sculpture, design, and architecture. Pardo&#x27;s display cases are built from thick, stacked sheets of medium-density fiberboard (MDF), with spacing of equal thickness in between the 70-plus layers. The laser-cut organic forms undulate and swell out from the walls, sharply contrasting to the rectangular display cases found in most art museums.

The museum&#x27;s pre-Columbian collection began in the 1980s with the first installment of a 570-piece gift from Southern California collector Constance McCormick Fearing and the purchase of about 200 pieces from L.A. businessman Proctor Stafford. The holdings recently jumped from about 1,800 to 2,500 objects with a gift of Colombian ceramics from Camilla Chandler Frost, a LACMA trustee and the sister of Otis Chandler, former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher, and Stephen and Claudia Muñoz-Kramer of Atlanta, whose family built the collection. A sizable portion of LACMA&#x27;s pre-Columbian collection was excavated from burial chambers in Colima, Nayarit and other regions around Jalisco in modern-day Mexico. LACMA boasts one of the largest collections of Latin American art due to the generous donation of more than 2,000 works of art by Bernard Lewin and his wife Edith Lewin in 1996. In 2007 the museum signed an agreement with the Fundación Cisneros for a loan of 25 colonial-style works, later extended until 2017.

The Spanish Colonial collection includes work from 17th and 18th century Mexican artists Miguel Cabrera, José de Ibarra, José de Páez, and Nicolás Rodriguez Juárez. The collection has galleries for Diego Rivera and Rufino Tamayo. The Latin American contemporary gallery highlights works Francis Alÿs.

===Asian art===

The Hammer Building houses the Chinese and Korean collections. The Korean art collection began with the donation of a group of Korean ceramics in 1966 by Bak Jeonghui, then president of the Republic of Korea, after a visit to the museum. LACMA today claims to have the most comprehensive holding outside of Korea and Japan. The Pavilion for Japanese Art displays the Shin&#x27;enkan collection donated by Joe D. Price. In 1999 LACMA trustee Eric Lidow and his wife, Leza, donated 75 ancient Chinese works valued at a total of $3.5 million, including important bronze objects and prime examples of Buddhist sculpture.
LACMA also has a rich collection of relics from India, mostly consisting of sculptures of Jain Tirthankaras, Buddha and Hindu deities. Many Paintings from India are also present in the LACMA. 
===Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art===
The second floor of the Ahmanson Building has Greek and Roman Art galleries. A large portion of the museum&#x27;s ancient Greek and Roman art collection was donated by William Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

===Islamic art===
The museum&#x27;s Islamic galleries include over 1700 works from ceramics and inlaid metalwork to enameled glass, carved stone and wood, and arts of the book from manuscript illumination to Islamic calligraphy. The collection is especially strong in Persian and Turkish glazed pottery and tiles, glass, and arts of the book. The collection began in earnest in 1973 when the Nasli M. Heeramaneck Collection was gifted to the museum by philanthropist Joan Palevsky.

===Decorative arts and design===
In 1990 Max Palevsky gave 32 pieces of Arts and Crafts furniture to LACMA; three years later, he added an additional 42 pieces to his gift. In 2000, he donated $2 million to LACMA for Arts and Crafts works. He supplied about a third of the 300 objects displayed in a 2004–05 LACMA exhibit, &quot;The Arts and Crafts Movement in Europe and America: 1880–1920&quot; and in 2009, the museum presented &quot;The Arts and Crafts Movement: Masterworks From the Max Palevsky and Jodie Evans Collection&quot;. With a single acquisition in 2009, LACMA became a major center for the study and display of 18th- and 19th-century European clothing when it bought the holdings of dealers Martin Kamer of London and Wolfgang Ruf of Beckenried, Switzerland—about 250 outfits and 300 accessories created between 1700 and 1915, including men&#x27;s three-piece suits, women&#x27;s dresses, children&#x27;s garb, and a vast array of shoes, hats, purses, shawls, fans, and undergarments.

===Permanent art installations===
Los Angeles sculptor Robert Graham created the towering, bronze &quot;Retrospective Column&quot; (1981, cast in 1986) for the entrance of the Art of the Americas Building. A new contemporary sculpture garden was opened directly east of the museum&#x27;s Wilshire Boulevard entrance in 1991, including large-scale outdoor sculptures by Alice Aycock, Ellsworth Kelly, Henry Moore, and others. The centerpiece of the garden is Alexander Calder&#x27;s three-piece mobile &quot;Hello Girls&quot;, commissioned by a women&#x27;s museum-support group for the museum&#x27;s opening in 1965. Situated in a curving reflecting pool, the mobile has brightly colored paddles that are moved by jets of water.

The Ahmanson Building&#x27;s atrium was remodeled to hold Tony Smith&#x27;s &quot;Smoke&quot;, which had not been displayed since its original 1967 presentation at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Corcoran Gallery of Art. The massive black painted aluminum artwork is made up of 43 piers and is long, wide, and high. The newly fabricated work was initially on loan from the artist&#x27;s estate, but in 2010, after several months of intense fundraising efforts, &quot;the museum acquired the work for an undisclosed amount reported to exceed $3 million and [with an insurance valuation of] &#x27;over $5 million. The purchase was &quot;made possible by The Belldegrun Family&#x27;s gift to LACMA in honor of Rebecka Belldegrun&#x27;s birthday&quot;, per the museum.

Eli and Edythe Broad contributed $10 million to fund the purchase of Richard Serra&#x27;s &quot;Band&quot; sculpture, on display on the first floor of BCAM when the building opened.
Surrounding the BCAM building and LACMA&#x27;s courtyard is a 100 palm tree garden, designed by artist Robert Irwin and landscape architect Paul Comstock. Some of the 30 varieties of palms are in the ground, but most are in large wooden boxes above ground. Directly in front of the new entrance to LACMA on Wilshire Boulevard, where Ogden Drive once bisected the 20-acre campus between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street, is Chris Burden&#x27;s &quot;Urban Light&quot; (2008), an orderly, multi-tiered installation of 202 antique cast-iron street lights from various cities in and around the Los Angeles area. The street lights are functional, turn on in the evening, and are powered by solar panels on the roof of the BP Grand Entrance.

Originally Jeff Koons&#x27; &quot;Tulips&quot; (1995–2004) sculpture was inside the Grand Entrance building and Charles Ray&#x27;s &quot;Fire Truck&quot; (1993) was outside in the courtyard, both lent by the Broad Art Foundation. Both sculptures were removed after being on display for 3 months due to unexpected damage from patrons and wear.

On February 2, 2007, Michael Govan, with Koons, revealed plans for a -tall Koons sculpture featuring an operational 1940s locomotive suspended from a crane. The sculpture would be located at the entrance on Wilshire Boulevard, between the Ahmanson Building and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. By 2011, after &quot;the fundraising climate soured and Koons&#x27; California fabricator, Carlson &amp; Co, went out of business after completing a $2.3-million feasibility study&quot; and a $25 million estimated cost, Govan said &quot;We don&#x27;t have a final method of construction, and I don&#x27;t have a final fundraising plan.&quot; Koons said they are now working with the German fabricator Arnold, outside of Frankfurt, to do an additional engineering study, and Govan says he has committed to spending half a million dollars for that study. The museum has &quot;J.B. Turner Engine&quot; (1986), a small Koons piece which was shown in the 2006–2007 &quot;Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images&quot; exhibition.

&quot;Levitated Mass&quot; by artist Michael Heizer is the latest project at LACMA. On December 8, 2011, this 340-ton boulder, wide and in height, was ready to leave its quarry in Riverside County, after months of postponements. It sits atop the 456-foot-long trench which allows people to walk under and around the massive rock. The move started on February 28, 2012, and completed on March 10, 2012. The art piece was opened on June 24, 2012, by Heizer, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, and Los Angeles City Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

===Photography===
The Wallis Annenberg Photography Department was launched in 1984 with a grant from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. It has holdings of more than fifteen thousand works that span the period from the medium&#x27;s invention in 1839 to the present. Photography also is integrated into other departments. Although LACMA&#x27;s photo collection encompasses the entire field, it has many gaps and is far smaller than that of the J. Paul Getty Museum. In 1992 Audrey and Sydney Irmas donated their entire photography collection, creating what is now the Los Angeles County Museum of Art&#x27;s Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection of Artists&#x27; Self-Portraits, a large and highly specialized selection spanning 150 years. The couple donated the collection two years before a major exhibition of the collection was mounted at LACMA; the display included photos of and by artistic photographers ranging from chemist Alphonse Poitevin in 1853 to Robert Mapplethorpe in 1988. Among other self-portraits in the collection were those of Andy Warhol, Lee Friedlander, and Edward Steichen. Audrey Irmas continues to buy for the collection, but now all the additions are gifts to LACMA. In 2008 LACMA announced that the Annenberg Foundation was making a $23 million gift for the acquisition of the Marjorie and Leonard Vernon collection of 19th- and 20th-century photographs. Among the 3,500 master prints are works by Steichen, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Eugène Atget, Imogen Cunningham, Catherine Opie, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Ave Pildas and Man Ray. The gift also provided an endowment and capital to help build storage facilities for the museum&#x27;s photographic holdings, leading to its photography department being renamed the Wallis Annenberg Department of Photography. In 2011 LACMA and the J. Paul Getty Trust jointly acquired Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s art and archival material, including more than 2,000 works by the artist.

===Film===
LACMA&#x27;s film program was founded by Phil Chamberlin in the late 1960s. In 2009 LACMA announced plans to cancel its 41-year-old film series, citing declining attendance and funding. The decision drew widespread criticism from cinephiles, including film director Martin Scorsese, who wrote an open protest letter that was published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In response, the museum expanded its movie offerings and partnered with Film Independent to launch a new series. In 2011 LACMA and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced partnership plans to open a movie museum within three years in the former May Co. building. The Academy Museum opened in 2022.

==Acquisitions and donors==

===Individual donors===
In 2014, LACMA received a $500 million donation of art from businessman Jerry Perenchio. The 47-piece collection contains works by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, René Magritte, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, and Pablo Picasso. LACMA executive director Michael Govan said it was the biggest gift in the museum&#x27;s history, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;conceivably one of the greatest art gifts ever, to any museum&quot;. Perenchio&#x27;s donation, which becomes effective upon his death, occurs only if the museum completes construction of the new building designed by Peter Zumthor.

The $54 million Resnick Pavillon was made possible by a $45 million gift from the philanthropists for whom it is named. On March 6, 2007, BP announced a $25 million donation to name the entry pavilion under construction as part of LACMA&#x27;s renovation campaign the &quot;BP Grand Entrance&quot;. The $25 million gift matches Walt Disney Co.&#x27;s 1997 gift for Disney Hall as the biggest corporate donation to the arts in Southern California. Previously, in 2006, LACMA had announced that the new entrance would be called the &quot;Lynda and Stewart Resnick Grand Entrance Pavilion&quot;, in honor of their $25 million gift.

On January 8, 2008, Eli Broad revealed plans to retain permanent control of his roughly 2,000 works of modern and contemporary art in the independent Broad Art Foundation, which loans works to museums, rather than giving the art away. Broad, as recently as a year prior, had said that he planned to give most of his holdings to one or several museums, one of which was assumed to be LACMA. However, LACMA remains the &quot;preferred&quot; museum to receive works from the foundation.

Broad, previously vice chairman of LACMA&#x27;s board of directors, financed the $56-million Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) building at LACMA; he also provided an additional $10 million to buy two works of art to be displayed in it. BCAM displayed 220 pieces borrowed from Broad and his Broad Art Foundation when it opened in February 2008. In 2001 LACMA was criticized for hosting a major exhibition of Broad&#x27;s collection without having secured a promised gift of the works, an act that is prohibited at many prominent art institutions because it can increase the market value of the collection.

In 2002 the Annenberg Foundation gave the museum $10 million to establish a special endowment fund to support exhibitions, art acquisitions and educational programs at the discretion of its director. In recognition of the gift, LACMA named its leadership position the Wallis Annenberg directorship. In 2001 Wallis Annenberg endowed a curatorial fellowship program with a $1-million gift. In 1991, the foundation contributed $10 million to LACMA&#x27;s endowment and in 1999 it donated $100,000 to provide arts education training for Los Angeles elementary school teachers.

In 2001 the museum lost out on the modern art collection of Nathan and Marian Smooke, a former museum trustee and industrial real-estate developer whose heirs sold much of his collection at auction rather than donating it.

In 1996 the museum suffered yet another serious blow when the Gilbert Collection of Italian mosaics and other decorative objects, promised as an eventual bequest, and parts of which had been on display for decades, was withdrawn. The would-be donor claimed that the Museum had reneged on a written agreement to provide more exhibit space for it. The collection is considered one of the finest in the world of its kind. Moreover, unlike the Hammer and Simon collections, it did not remain in the Los Angeles area but was removed to the United Kingdom.

Armand Hammer was a LACMA board member for nearly seventeen years, beginning in 1968, and during this time continued to announce the museum would inherit his whole collection. Hammer&#x27;s collection included works from Van Gogh, John Singer Sargent, Thomas Eakins, Gustave Moreau, Edgar Degas, and Paul Cézanne. When LACMA was offered a collection of works by Honoré Daumier, Hammer bought the works on the promise that he would give them to the museum. To LACMA&#x27;s surprise, Hammer instead founded the Hammer Museum, built adjacent to Occidental&#x27;s headquarters in Los Angeles.

Between 1972 and 2020, the Ahmanson Foundation spent about $130 million to finance the museum&#x27;s acquisitions of 99 artworks, including masterpieces like &quot;Magdalene with the Smoking Flame&quot; by Georges de La Tour, others by Rembrandt, Watteau and Bernini, and a suite of 42 French oil sketches. The donations were not made with any contractual stipulations that the works remain on view. In 2020, the foundation suspended the acquisition program.

In the early 1970s Norton Simon, the chairman of Norton Simon, Inc., which owned Avis Car Rental, Hunt&#x27;s Foods, Max Factor Cosmetics, Canada Dry Corp., and McCall&#x27;s Publishing, among other interests, agreed to take the financial responsibility of the troubled Pasadena Museum of Art. Norton Simon Museum He subsequently donated his extensive collection to the new entity, now the Norton Simon Museum of Art. He had earlier made some indication of donating the work to LACMA.

From 1946 to his death in 1951, William Randolph Hearst was LACMA&#x27;s largest benefactor. He remains the largest donor to the museum in number of objects. His donations formed the museum&#x27;s collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, medieval and early Renaissance sculptures, and much of the collection of European decorative arts.

===Art councils===
Over the course of the LACMA&#x27;s history, ten art councils—each supporting a specific area of the collection—have acquired or helped acquire nearly 5,000 works of art for the museum. The art councils comprise groups of art enthusiasts and professionals who pay a minimum of $400 a year in dues and organize projects to raise money for a favorite department. Founded in 1952, the Art Museum Council is LACMA&#x27;s first volunteer support council and supports the whole of the museum&#x27;s endeavors. The Modern and Contemporary Art Council, founded in 1961, is the longest-running support group for contemporary art at any museum in the country. In 1980, the museum&#x27;s then active Black Historical Advisory Group, led by former trustee Robert Wilson, drove the museum to acquire Extended Forms (1975) by one of America&#x27;s foremost sculptors Richard Hunt. In 1986 the Annual Collectors Committee weekends were started and have raised a total of $16 million for the purchase of 157 works, valued at $75 million. The Photographic Arts Council, founded in 2001, is the youngest of ten 10 support groups, offering its members visits to artists&#x27; studios and private collections, curator-led tours of exhibitions and lectures about the care and conservation of photographs.

===Collectors Committee===
Each year a distinguished group of donors contributes directly to the enrichment of LACMA&#x27;s permanent collection through participation in the Collectors Committee, creating a fund to spend on art through purchasing tickets ranging between $15,000 and $60,000 for the event. Once a year, the Collectors Committee members meet at the museum to hear acquisition proposals from the various curators. Each curator has roughly five minutes to plead their case to the patrons, who vote later that day at a black-tie gala event at the museum on which artworks should become the next acquisitions for the permanent collection. The 2012 gala raised more than $2.8 million. Since its inception in 1986, the event has brought some 170 works of art into the museum&#x27;s collection.

===LACMA Art + Film Gala===
Inaugurated in 2011, the annual Art + Film Gala dinner features entertainment by international artists and is designed to help the museum shore up support from Hollywood leaders. Gala prices range from $5,000 for an individual gold ticket to $100,000 for a platinum table. The 2022 gala raised more than $5.1 million for the museum&#x27;s operations and collections, up from approximately $4.5 million in 2018, $4.1 million in 2013 and just under $3 million in 2011.

Gala honorees have included Judy Baca and David Fincher in 2023; Helen Pashgian and Park Chan-wook in 2022; Betye Saar and Alfonso Cuaron in 2019; Catherine Opie and Guillermo del Toro in 2018; Mark Bradford and George Lucas in 2017; Kathryn Bigelow and Robert Irwin in 2016; Alejandro González Iñárritu and James Turrell in 2015; Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino in 2014; Martin Scorsese and David Hockney in 2013; the late Stanley Kubrick and Ed Ruscha in 2012; and Clint Eastwood and John Baldessari in 2011.

===Deaccessioning===
Along with other museums that have consigned works to auction in the past, LACMA has been sharply criticized for pruning its art holdings. In 2005, on the occasion of the expansion, reorganization and reinstallation of its collection in 2007, LACMA auctioned 43 works at Sotheby&#x27;s. The works sold included paintings by Amedeo Modigliani, Camille Pissarro and Max Beckmann, sculptures by Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore, and works on paper by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Edgar Degas. The biggest sale of works by the museum since the early 1980s, it was expected to fetch $10.4 million to $15.4 million; it eventually resulted in a total of $13 million. Among the most valuable was a Modigliani portrait of the Spanish landscape painter Manuel Humbert, which sold for $4.9 million.

==Programs==
In 1966 Maurice Tuchman, then curator of modern art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, introduced the Art and Technology (A&amp;T) program. Within the program, artists like Robert Irwin and James Turrell were placed, for example, at the Garrett Corporation, to conduct research into perception. The program yielded an exhibition that ran at LACMA and traveled to Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, Japan. It also contributed to the development of the Light and Space movement.

In 2014, the museum opened its Art + Tech Lab, building on the legacy of the original Art and Technology program and its associated 1971 exhibition. Since then, the Art + Tech Lab has presented an annual series of artists’ projects that engage with contemporary technology.

==Management==

===Funding===
Andrea Rich won praise for doubling the museum&#x27;s endowment, to more than $100 million, and for increasing attendance and pursuing programs and acquisitions that might appeal to the varied segments of the city&#x27;s diverse population, like Islamic, Latin American and Korean art. Rich resigned in part because of disputes with Eli Broad, including one over hiring a curator for the new Broad contemporary art center. In 2008, LACMA made a formal offer to merge with MOCA and to help that museum raise new money from donors.

Per the Los Angeles County Code and various operating agreements, Museum Associates, a nonprofit public benefit corporation organized under the laws of the state of California, manages, operates, and maintains the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2011, LACMA reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of $300 million. That year, the museum&#x27;s endowment grew from $99.6 million to $106.8 million. By issuing $383 million in tax-free construction bonds, the museum paid for its ongoing expansion and renovation, which has yielded the new Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the Resnick Exhibition Pavilion as well as other improvements. The Los Angeles County provides around $29 million a year, covering more than a third of the museum&#x27;s operating expenses.

LACMA typically raises around $40 million from donations and membership dues, which are accounted for as gifts, paying for almost half of LACMA&#x27;s average expenses of about $92 million.

===Attendance===
Although attendance has grown in recent years, it still remained at 914,356 visitors in 2010. In 2011, around 1.2 million visitors went to LACMA, making it the first time the museum broke the one million mark. In 2015, attendance reached 1.6 million.

*Between 1993 and 1995, Chief Deputy Director Ronald B. Bratton was handling financial and administrative activities and Stephanie Barron, chief curator of modern and contemporary art, was coordinating curatorial affairs.
*Graham W. J. Beal – 1996 – 1999
*Andrea L. Rich – 1999 – 2005
*Michael Govan – 2006–present

In 1996, LACMA&#x27;s board of trustees decided that the traditional dual role of director as chief administrator/artistic director should be split, and appointed Andrea Rich as president and chief executive officer of the museum, while Graham W. J. Beal ran its artistic programs. As part of a 2005 restructuring, the president position was again made the second-ranking job in the institution.

LACMA provides a home to the director. For that purpose, it has owned a Hancock Park property since 2006. In 2020, Museum Associates acquired a house on a lot in Mid-Wilshire for $2.2 million.

===Board of trustees===
LACMA is governed by a board of trustees which sets policy and determines the museum&#x27;s strategic direction. Board membership is one of the few concrete ways to measure philanthropy in the museum world. LACMA costs $100,000 to join; each board member commits to donating or raising at least another $100,000 a year for the nonprofit museum. The museum currently has over 50 active board members; 30 of them have joined since 2006. Since 2015, the board has been co-chaired by Elaine Wynn and Tony Ressler.

Notable current trustees include the following:
* Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (since 2021)
* Nicole Avant (since 2014)
* Willow Bay
* Colleen Bell (2011–2014, since 2019)
* Thelma Golden (since 2016)
* Mellody Hobson (since 2019)
* Bobby Kotick (since 2004)
* Lee Boo-jin (since 2023)
* Cheech Marin (since 2022)
* Rich Paul (since 2022)
* Lionel Richie (since 2021)
* Carole Bayer Sager
* Ryan Seacrest (since 2014)
* Casey Wasserman (since 2004)
* Elaine Wynn (since 2011)
* Dasha Zhukova (since 2009)

Notable past trustees include:

* Bryan Lourd (from 2011)
* Michael Lynton (since 2007)
* Lynda Resnick (from 1992)
* Barbra Streisand (2007–2014)

Notably, Tom Gores stepped down from his post as a board trustee in 2020, after advocacy groups Worth Rises and Color of Change had called for his removal over his investment in Securus Technologies.

<doc id="373616" wikidata="Q8037065" url="?curid=373616" title="Worshipful Company of Masons">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Masons is one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London, number 30 in the order of precedence of the 111 companies. It was granted Arms in 1472, during the reign of King Edward IV; its motto is “God Is Our Guide”. It is not affiliated with fraternal Freemasonry.

The Masons’ Company emerged in the late Middle Ages, and played an important role in medieval and early modern London. It regulated the craft of stonemasonry, for example by ensuring that standards and the training of apprentices were properly maintained, at first just in the City of London, but subsequently also in the City of Westminster and seven miles from each. It was also an important social organisation in the lives of its members. Like most Livery Companies, it maintains its social function, but the Company’s economic and administrative role has changed over time and it no longer oversees the craft in this traditional way, although it remains actively involved in supporting those training in stonemasonry and in promoting the use of natural stone. It remains one of the few Livery Companies today whose craft, particularly its tools, would be recognisable to its early members. Of all the ancient crafts used in Britain, masons have left the most impressive and most permanent evidence of their work. Members of the Company are known to have taken part in the construction of many of these famous structures, for example, the London Guildhall, and St Paul’s Cathedral.

== History ==
Although a ‘mistery’ (i.e. craft) of masons may have existed beforehand, the elections to the Common Council in 1376 provide the first secure evidence for the existence of an organised guild of masons in London, and by 1389, if not earlier, there was a fraternity of masons in London too, so the roots of the company were embedded at that time and developed during the following century into the company we would recognise today. By 1463, the Masons’ Hall was established near the Guildhall; the sale of the Company’s Hall was agreed in 1865, and a plaque now marks the place where the Hall stood in Masons’ Avenue. In 1472, the Company was granted armorial bearings, and in 1481 they ratified a set of ordinances before the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London. At the behest of King James I, in 1609-10 the City livery companies were required to form associations to provide funds for use in the Ulster Plantation. Although this venture passed into history a long time ago, over 400 years later the Masons Company maintains its friendly relationships with the Mercers’, Cooks’ and Broderers’ companies that formed the Association at the time. In June 1675, Thomas Strong, a liveryman and subsequently Court Assistant of the Masons’ Company, laid the foundation stone of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and thirty-three years later, in 1708, his brother Edward Strong, a Past Master of the Company, laid the last stone on the lanthorn of the Cathedral. In 1677, the Company was formally incorporated by Royal Charter.

Moving forward to the twentieth Century, to mark the 500th anniversary of the Grant of Arms, in 1972, there was a new exemplification of the coat of arms by the College of Arms. The Natural Stone Craft Awards were presented by HRH The Duke of Gloucester (a Liveryman of the Company) for the first time in 1986. In 1990, The Company formed an Association with the Corps of Royal Engineers. 2004 saw the re-siting and restoration of Temple Bar to Paternoster Square, having been originally built by Master Masons’ Edward and Joshua Marshall in 1673.

== Membership ==
The Masons’ Company is currently limited to 250 Liverymen and 50 Freemen.

Yeoman Masons, a category of membership that was re-constituted in 2008, has no limit, but currently stands at over 60 members.

== Current activities / fellowship and social activities ==
The two key annual events are the Master’s Banquet, often at Mansion House in March and the Livery Dinner with the Associated Companies in November. The Company’s wide social programme involves talks and visits to places of historical and architectural interest throughout the year, along with various fellowship events.

The Company’s support for the craft of stonemasonry continues with the Duke of Gloucester Awards for Excellence in the Craft of Stonemasonry, which take the form of a Certificate and cash prize.

== Affiliations / organisations with which the Company has links ==
The Masons’ Company maintains direct contact with those involved in stonemasonry, training, the construction industry, and the City Civic. These include the Council of City and Guilds, the Cathedrals’ Workshop Fellowship, the Stone Federation of Great Britain, the Building Crafts College, the City and Guilds of London Art School, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, the Weald and Downland Living Museum, the Incorporation of Masons of Glasgow, and the Construction Livery Group representing 18 livery companies. In common with many other livery companies, the military is also well supported, including HMS Portland, 36 (Engineer) Regiment, No.14 Squadron RAF, Royal Regiment of Scotland and 15 Company, South West London Army Cadet Force.

== Charities ==
The Masons’ Company Charitable Trust and the Masons’ Company Craft Fund are the two independent charities which work in parallel with the Company.

The Craft Fund is primarily interested in fostering the craft of stonemasonry, focussing on those studying at a selection of recognised colleges across the country in addition to working with the Cathedrals’ Workshop Fellowship in the delivery of apprenticeships.

The Charitable Trust has a wider remit and provides funding for educational projects, donations to heritage and stone related projects and the City of London’s and Lord Mayor’s charitable projects.

South London originally emerged from Southwark, first recorded as &quot;Suthriganaweorc&quot;, meaning &#x27;fort of the men of Surrey&#x27;. From Southwark, London then extended further down into northern Surrey and western Kent.

==Emergence and growth==

South London began at Southwark at the southern end of London Bridge, the first permanent crossing over the River Thames. The early development of the area was a direct result of the existence and location of the bridge.


Southwark was first known as &quot;Suthriganaweorc&quot;, the fortress of the men of Surrey, mentioned in the Burghal Hidage as part of military system created by Alfred the Great to defeat the Great Heathen Army of the Vikings. Southwark was also known as &quot;the Borough&quot; due to its being an incorporated (nationally represented) Borough from 1295. From 1550 to 1899 it was administered as part of the City of London and referred to as the ward of Bridge Without.

In 1720, John Strype&#x27;s &#x27;Survey of London&#x27; described Southwark as one of the then four distinct areas of London; in it he describes the City of London, Westminster (West London), Southwark (South London), and &#x27;That Part Beyond the Tower&#x27; (East London). The area now usually referred to as North London developed later.
As late as the mid-18th century, there were no other bridges crossing the river and hence urban growth was considerably slower in the south than in areas north of the Thames.

The opening of Westminster Bridge and other subsequent bridges to the west encouraged growth in the south-west, but only Tower Bridge was built to the east of London Bridge, so south-east London grew more slowly, at least until the Surrey Commercial Docks were built.

The development of a dense network of railway lines in the mid-nineteenth century significantly accelerated growth. The County of London was formed in 1899, which incorporated these boroughs south of the river: Wandsworth, Lambeth, Battersea, Camberwell, Southwark, Bermondsey, Deptford, Lewisham, Greenwich and Woolwich. During the first half of the 20th century, towns in the Home Counties such as Kingston, Croydon and Bromley gradually coalesced with South London, until Greater London was formed in 1965.

==Transport==
A significant feature of south London&#x27;s economic geography is that while there are more than thirty bridges linking the area with West London and the City, there is only one, Tower Bridge, linking the area with East London.

Very little of London&#x27;s underground rail network lies south of the river, largely due to the challenging geology; however, 21st-century technology makes tunnelling much cheaper (though stations are still expensive) and this may lead to an improved underground provision in south London with the Crossrail 2 line proposed alongside extensions to the Northern and Bakerloo Lines.

South London contains an extensive overground rail network and all of London&#x27;s trams operate within the area.

==List of boroughs==
The 12 boroughs included, in whole or part are:

A small area of land, on which the southern end of Blackfriars Bridge stands, is not part of Southwark. It forms part of the City of London, a sui generis local authority which is mainly located north of the Thames.

==Formal use==
The term &#x27;south London&#x27; has been used for a variety of formal purposes with the boundaries defined according to the purposes of the designation.

===Constituency review, 2017===
In 2017 the government asked the Boundary Commission for England to reconsider the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies. The commission&#x27;s study, was to start with existing regions of England and then group the local authorities within that area into sub-regions for further sub-division. The south London sub-region included the 11 boroughs which lay south of the river, plus the parts of cross-river Richmond upon Thames that did so.

An earlier 2013 study, whose recommendations were not adopted, took a different approach by including all of Richmond in its south London sub-region.

===Sub-region policy===
For the purposes of progress reporting on the London Plan, there was a south London sub-region in operation from 2004 to 2008 consisting of Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Richmond and Sutton. In 2001 this area had a population of 1,329,000. This definition is used by organisations such as Connexions.

Between 2008 and 2011 it was replaced with a South East sub-region consisting of Southwark, Lewisham, Greenwich, Bexley and Bromley and a South West sub-region consisting of Croydon, Kingston, Lambeth, Merton, Sutton, Richmond and Wandsworth.

In 2011 a new south London region was created consisting of Bromley, Croydon, the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, Richmond upon Thames, Merton, Sutton, Wandsworth, Bexley, Greenwich and Lewisham.

==Climate==

South London has, like other parts of London and the UK in general, a temperate maritime climate according to the Köppen climate classification system. Three Met Office weather stations currently collect climate data south of the river: Kew, Hampton, and Kenley Airfield, on the southern edge of the urban area. Long-term climate observations dating back to 1763 are available for Greenwich, although observations ceased there in 2003.

Temperatures increase towards the Thames, firstly because of the urban warming effect of the surrounding area, and secondly due to altitude decreasing towards the river, meaning the southern margins of south London are often a couple of degrees cooler than those areas adjacent to the Thames. Often snow can be seen to lie on the North Downs near Croydon when central London is snow-free.

The record high temperature at Greenwich is recorded during August 2003. Sunshine is notably lower than other London area weather stations (by about 50–100 hours a year), suggesting Greenwich may be a fog trap in winter, and that the hillier land to the south may obscure early morning and late evening sunshine.

The highest temperature recorded across south London was on the same occasion at Kew Gardens. Although the Met Office accepts a higher reading from Brogdale in Kent, many have questioned the accuracy of this and regard the Kew reading as the most reliable highest UK temperature reading.

<doc id="373624" wikidata="Q3328608" url="?curid=373624" title="Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>Like the surrounding Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a turbulent past marked by frequent foreign invasions and occupation. As a result, Bosnian music is now a mixture of Slavic, Turkish, Central European, Mediterranean, and other influences.

==History==
During its period as a part of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina was covered in state-supported amateur musical ensembles called Cultural-Artistic Societies (&quot;Kulturno-Umjetnička Društva&quot;, KUDs) which played Bosnian root music and released a few recordings on local labels.

==Traditional music==

===Original Bosnian music===

Rural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, polyphonic ganga and &quot;ravne pjesme&quot; (&quot;flat song&quot;) styles, as well as instruments like a droneless bagpipe, wooden flute and šargija. The gusle, an instrument found throughout the Balkans, is also used to accompany ancient Slavic epic poems. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the Ladino language, derived from the area&#x27;s Jewish population.

&quot;Bosnian roots music&quot; came from Middle Bosnia, Posavina, the Drina valley and Kalesija. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a šargija player. These bands first appeared around World War I and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the sevdalinka and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, saz, drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it&#x27;s maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.

Studio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from Živinice together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the Tuzla Canton and the cradle of this music city Živinice was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a diphthong, the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.

===Sevdalinka===

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably Bosnian of music, &quot;Sevdalinka&quot; is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a saz, a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins. Sevdalinkas are unique to Bosnia and Herzegovina. They arose in Ottoman Bosnia as urban Bosnian music with often oriental and sometimes Sefardi influences. Examples are &quot;Kad ja pođoh na Benbašu&quot;, the unofficial anthem of the city of Sarajevo, and &quot;Kraj Tanana Sadrvana&quot;. Though not as common as it once was, traditional Sevdalinka singers like Kadir Kurtagić, Emina Ahmedhodžić, Hašim Muharemović and Muhamed Mešanović-Hamić are still popular to the extent that their recordings are available.

More modern performers Beba Selimović, Zehra Deović, Silvana Armenulić, Safet Isović, Himzo Polovina, Zaim Imamović and Hanka Paldum have used non-native instruments, including the accordion, clarinet, violin and guitar.

===Ilahije i Kaside (&quot;Religious Songs&quot;)===

Ilahije (Anasheed) are religious songs that came after or before sevdalinkas. These songs usually deal with religion, but some of them tell tales of how two lovers (male and female) come together.

===Modern folk===
&quot;Modern&quot; folk was referred to as &quot;novokomponovana narodna muzika&quot; (&quot;newly composed folk music&quot;) for a while, although the term went out of use in favor of simply &quot;narodna&quot; or &quot;folk&quot;. It is based on various influences, sevdah stories with music of Serbia and/or Turkey often with incorporated elements of pop music. During the time of Yugoslavia, the genre developed jointly in Bosnia and Serbia, and performers from both sides of today&#x27;s borders still enjoy certain popularity on the other side.

<text>The music of Belgium is a cultural mix where Flemish Dutch-speaking and Walloon French-speaking traditions mix with those of German minorities and of immigrant communities from Democratic Republic of the Congo or other distant countries.

==Early and classical music==
Many of the major 15th- and 16th-century composers of the Franco-Flemish School—a current of vocal polyphony that played a central role in European art music of the time—were born and bred in the portion of the Low Countries that is situated in present-day Belgium, often in Hainaut. The late medieval composer and music theorist Johannes Ciconia (c. 1370–1412) had been born in Liège, but like many later Flemish polyphonists he spent much of his life working in Renaissance Italy. While it remains unclear why Flemish and other Netherlandish musicians exerted such a strong influence on Renaissance music throughout Europe (with a particularly strong axis developing between Liège and Rome), one possibility is the emphasis that was placed locally on music theory. Guillaume Dufay (c. 1397–1474), who was born near Brussels (he moved as a child to Cambrai, and also worked in Italy), was a key figure of the early 15th-century Burgundian School, and he was considered by his contemporaries to be the leading composer of the age. Another influential figure was Gilles Binchois (c. 1400–1460): probably born in Mons (or nearby Binche) he moved to Lille, the largest city of what is now French Flanders, and unlike many of his contemporaries, he maintained professional connections with the Burgundian court throughout his life. Johannes Ockeghem (c. 1410–1497) is also considered one of the leading composers of the 15th century; a native of Hainaut, he spent most of his career working for the French court.

The migration and influence of Netherlandish composers reached its height roughly between 1480 and 1520, in a period when talented musicians from Low Countries were recruited in courts and cathedrals across the continent, effectively providing the music school of Europe. The music of Josquin des Prez (c. 1450–1521) was considered an aesthetic model for much of the 16th-century High Renaissance; although referred to in his lifetime as a Frenchman (he worked in both France and Italy) he was probably born in Hainaut. Other influential composers of the period whose origins can be traces to the Belgian area of the Low Countries include Jacob Obrecht (c. 1457–1505), Pierre de La Rue (c. 1452–1518), Alexander Agricola (c. 1445–1506), and Gaspar van Weerbeke (c. 1445–c. 1516). Although the emigration of musicians from the Low Countries continued into the second half of the 16th century, the hegemony of Netherlandish influence was on the wane. One of the last truly influential figures of the era was Orlande de Lassus (c. 1532–1594). Another native of Mons, Lassus became one of the most versatile composers of the century, and (according to his entry in &quot;Grove&quot;) &quot;the best-known and most widely admired musician in Europe.&quot;

André Ernest Modeste Grétry was the most famous composer - born in what is now called Belgium - of the 18th century. The 19th century supplied composers like Henri Vieuxtemps, César Franck, Guillaume Lekeu and Eugène Ysaÿe. At the end of the 20th century the most notable Belgian composers were Piet Swerts and Wim Mertens. One of Belgium&#x27;s most prized people is Adolphe Sax. Adolphe Sax was born in Belgium and created what people know as the saxophone.

In the field of opera, baritones Jules Bastin and José van Dam have become the most famous and internationally successful Belgian opera singers. In the lighter classical genre, Flemish singer Helmut Lotti reached international success with his interpretations of popular opera songs for large audiences.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Belgian artists like Wieland Kuijken and Marcel Ponseele contributed to the Historically informed performance of baroque music, with their ensembles La Petite Bande and il Gardellino.


==Jazz and blues==

One of the most famous jazz instruments, the saxophone, was invented by a Belgian: Adolphe Sax.

Some known Belgian blues artists are Elmore D (who sings in English and Walloon dialect), and the Flemish Roland van Campenhout (also known as Roland).

In the 1930s, the Belgian romani guitarist Django Reinhardt became one of the first important jazz musicians to be born in Europe, and one of the most important jazz guitarists of all time. In 1949 Toots Thielemans joined a jam session in Paris with Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Max Roach and others. He moved to the US in 1952 where he was a member of Charlie Parker&#x27;s All-Stars. Toots Thielemans is often credited by jazz aficionados and jazz critics to be the greatest jazz harmonica player of the century. His music has been used in films like Midnight Cowboy and Turkish delight, and television series such as Sesame Street and Baantjer. 
Other well known Belgian artists are Aka Moon, Bobby Jaspar, Bert Joris, Philip Catherine, Steve Houben, Octurn and René Thomas, and the first quartertone jazzpianist Seppe Gebruers (b. 1990). He is well known for his experimental approach and exploring microtonality in jazz. In his project &#x27;Playing with standards&#x27; he plays with two grandpianos tuned a quartertone apart, and with the well known jazzstandards.

==Folk and other traditional music==
Bobbejaan Schoepen has been a pioneer in Belgian vaudeville and pop music since the late 1940s. Not only was he the first Belgian singer to manage an international breakthrough, he was also the first to use modern equipment, a personal tourbus and a system of artist sponsoring. He also introduced the first country &amp; western recordings in the Low Countries and Germany. In the 1950s Bobbejaan Schoepen recorded his own absolutely crazy folk music often singing in Flemish dialect. He was also a virtuoso whistler.

From the late 1960s, Flanders saw a vivid revival of traditional music (and, to a lesser degree, of traditional dances) through the efforts of musicians like Wannes Van de Velde, Willem Vermandere, Walter De Buck, Hubert Boone, Herman De Wit and many more. They inspired a new generation of folk musicians through their written and recorded publications, and through festivals and regular summer academies and master classes.

Walloon folk music has not had as vibrant a revival as Flemish, but artists like Coïncidence, Remy Dubois, Luc Pilartz, Rue du Village and Claude Flagel have kept the folk traditions alive.

Contrary to general evolution, there has always been great openness across the so-called linguistical barriers - there are many collaborations between Belgian musicians of different language.

==Chanson==
The greatest Belgian chansonnier was Jacques Brel, whose classic songs have been covered by several international artists such as David Bowie, Frank Sinatra, Scott Walker and Terry Jacks. Despite his mainly French-language oeuvre, Salvatore Adamo achieved worldwide success from the 1960s onwards. Others like Pierre Rapsat, Arno, Maurane, Axelle Red and Lara Fabian have also enjoyed some success in other French-speaking countries.

The French chanson style also inspired some Dutch-speaking singers like Kor Van der Goten and Jan De Wilde.

==Dialect singing==
With the 1960s folk revival came a new interest into dialect singing. Pioneer Wannes Van de Velde soon got a following, mostly in the folk and traditional styles, but eventually extending into the comedy rock of The Clement Peerens Explosition and the hip-hop of Flip Kowlier. Others, while mostly performing in standard Dutch, will include an occasional phrase or even a complete song in dialect (ex. Johan Verminnen, &quot;Rue des Bouchers&quot; and Raymond van het Groenewoud, &quot;Je veux de l&#x27;amour&quot;).

==Pop and rock==
During 1950 through 1960 and following decades the most popular, enduring, commercial and critical successful Flemish singer was Will Tura, whose most well known hit in Flanders is &quot;Eenzaam zonder jou&quot; (1963) (&quot;Lonely without you&quot;).

The most popular and enduring artists in Flanders and the Netherlands who sing in either their Flemish dialect or standard Dutch are Eddy Wally, Raymond van het Groenewoud, Willem Vermandere, De Kreuners, Clouseau, Gorki (band), Noordkaap, and De Mens.

In 1959 the Belgian singer of Italian descent Rocco Granata scored a big European hit with &quot;Marina&quot;. The singing nun Soeur Sourire had an international number one hit in 1963 with Dominique. She won a Grammy Award for best gospel recording in 1964 for the song, and was nominated for several other categories, including Album of the Year. When folk and hippie culture finally hit a chord around the world the groups The Pebbles (&quot;Seven Horses in the Sky&quot;, &quot;I Get Around&quot;) and The Wallace Collection (&quot;Daydream&quot;) had considerable international success. Irish Coffee, a hard rock band from Aalst also achieved considerable local success in the same era. Due to a lack of really professional management these few pop groups failed to build out a durable international career, a trend which continued during the 1970s when the most successful artists sang in their native tongue. The only real new international successful artist was Plastic Bertrand. (See &quot;Punk&quot; below). 

Real international success for Belgian acts began in 1980 with the rock group TC Matic. They were quite popular in the rest of Europe with numbers like &quot;Oh La La La&quot; and &quot;Putain putain&quot;. Lead singer Arno later started his own successful solo career. Many groups and artists had considerable success in other countries, but they usually did not reach out much further than West Europe. Notable exceptions were Maurane, Jo Lemaire, Soulsister (&quot;The Way To Your Heart&quot;, 1987) and Vaya Con Dios (&quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, 1988, &quot;What&#x27;s a Woman?&quot;, 1990).

===Indie rock===
In the early 1990s many alternative rock bands finally started to achieve larger international acclaim and success. In Antwerp, a lively indie rock scene sprouts where dEUS is probably the most famous, next to other people and groups like Zita Swoon (formerly Moondog Jr), Evil Superstars, Kiss My Jazz, Dead Man Ray, K&#x27;s Choice (&quot;Not an Addict&quot;), Admiral Freebee, and Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung. In the noise genre Antwerp houses the pioneer band Club Moral. Ghent also has a booming indie scene: Absynthe Minded, Das Pop, Millionaire, Zornik, Awaken and the successful Soulwax bring indie rock with a slightly rougher edge than their Antwerp fellows, while The Vogues (Brussels) have a British-influenced sound. Other popular artists are Triggerfinger, Gabriel Ríos and Ghinzu.

===Punk===
The most well-known Belgian punk bands are Chainsaw, The Kids (&quot;Fascist Cops&quot;, &quot;There will be no Next Time&quot;), Janez Detd, Funeral Dress and Plastic Bertrand who had a worldwide hit with &quot;Ça Plane Pour Moi&quot; (1978). Lou Deprijck, the song&#x27;s co-writer and producer, later also turned out to be the actual singer of the song. He previously already had international fame with his band Two Man Sound (&quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Disco Samba&quot;).

West Flanders was home to the &quot;H8000&quot; (pronounced &quot;Hate-Thousand&quot;) underground hardcore punk scene during the 1990s. Bands within the scene took heavily from heavy metal, and followed straight edge and vegan lifestyles. Some bands helped to pioneer the development of metalcore and then later on melodic metalcore and deathcore. Some groups from the scene include Congress, Liar, Blindfold, Shortsight, Regression and Spirit of Youth. Good Life Recordings signed and released much of the music for the scene.

===Metal===
The most well-known Belgian metal bands include death metallers Aborted, Ostrogoth, Killer, Emeth, Fractured Insanity, Warbeast Remains and Serial Butcher, grindcore quartet Leng Tch&#x27;e, Agathocles, black metal bands Enthroned, Saille and Ancient Rites, folk metal band Ithilien, heavy metal band Channel Zero and melodic black/doom metal band Amenra.

==Hip-hop==
Belgium&#x27;s hip hop scene is partly rooted in the immigrant communities from Africa and Italy. Belgium, like neighbouring France, controlled African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), Rwanda, and Burundi until the early 1960s. Like in France, immigrants from these countries started to study and live in Belgium.

Today, the Belgian hip hop scene is growing. Rappers like Coely, Roméo Elvis, Stromae and Damso are achieving commercial success in their country and abroad. Other contemporary rappers/formations are Stikstof, Woodie Smalls, L&#x27;Or Du Commun and .

Hooverphonic is a famous Belgian trip hop band, which scored hits with &quot;Eden&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot;.

==Electronic music==
The earliest Belgian electronica act was Telex (&quot;Moskow Diskow&quot;, &quot;Euro-Vision&quot;). Frontman Marc Moulin was later moved on to pursue a solo career.

At the end of the 1980s Belgium started to play a very important role in the development of Techno music. The group Technotronic had a massive international hit with &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot;. A new genre, new beat was created and scored international hits with acts like The Confettis (&quot;The Sound of C.&quot;, 1988). Bands like Front 242, Snowy Red, Public Relation and A Split-Second played a part in making the music genre EBM popular.

In the 1990s, acts like the partially Dutch-Belgian 2 Unlimited (&quot;No Limit&quot;) and the Flemish Lords of Acid and Praga Khan, were internationally successful. Other internationally renowned Belgian dance acts are 2 Many Dj&#x27;s (a spin-off from the group Soulwax), The Glimmers (formerly Mo &amp; Benoelie), Junior Jack &amp; Kid Creme, Sylver, Milk Inc., Kate Ryan, Lasgo, Ian Van Dahl, and Vive La Fête. The 2000s saw a proliferation of experimental electronic Belgian artists. Acts like Köhn, Ovil Bianca &amp; Tuk got international acclaim and pioneered in the area of experimental electronic music in Belgium around the turn of the century. Jan Robbe, Kaebin Yield and Sedarka are key innovators of the &quot;flashcore&quot; sound, and others including Sickboy of the Belgian Breakcore Gives Me Wood collective were crucial in the development of breakcore and Mashup. Nowadays, singer Stromae has been a musical revelation in Europe and beyond, having great success. In 2015 Lost Frequencies had an international hit with his reworked version of Are You with Me, a song originally by Easton Corbin. Lately Angèle has also arisen to the international stage.

==African music==
Since the early 1980s, African musicians have played an important part on the Belgian scene, especially those from the former Belgian colony of Congo. Congolese-Belgian Princesse Mansia M&#x27;Bila, Rwandan-Belgian Cécile Kayirebwa and Dieudonné Kabongo led this wave that soon incorporated Argentine tango music, Moroccan oud and other music from around the world. The 1990s saw the emergence of Zap Mama, a group of Congolese-Belgian women who played a fusion of Pygmy and other African music with European influences.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Plumbers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The organisation received the right to regulate medieval plumbers, who were, among other things, responsible for fashioning cisterns, in 1365. It was incorporated under a royal charter in 1611. Today, the company is no longer a trade association, instead existing as a charitable institution. (The company retains a link to plumbing by awarding medals and prizes in the general building industry.)

The Plumbers&#x27; Company ranks thirty-first in the order of precedence of Livery Companies. Its mottoes are &quot;Justicia Et Pax&quot;, Latin for &quot;Justice and Peace&quot;, and &quot;In God Is All Our Hope&quot;.

Court members have included Fiona Woolf and Paul Flatt.

<text>New Cross is an area in south-east London, England, south-east of Charing Cross in the London Borough of Lewisham and the SE14 postcode district. New Cross is near St Johns, Telegraph Hill, Nunhead, Peckham, Brockley, Deptford and Greenwich, and home to Goldsmiths, University of London, Haberdashers&#x27; Hatcham College and Addey and Stanhope School.

New Cross Gate, on the west of New Cross, is named after the New Cross tollgate, established in 1718 by the New Cross Turnpike Trust. It is the location of New Cross station and New Cross Gate station. New Cross Gate corresponds to the manor and district formerly known as Hatcham.

==History==

The area was originally known as Hatcham (the name persists in the title of the Anglican parishes of St. James, Hatcham along with its school, and All Saints, Hatcham Park). The earliest reference to Hatcham is the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hacheham&quot;. It was held by the Bishop of Lisieux from the Bishop of Bayeux. According to the entry in the Domesday Book Hatcham&#x27;s assets were: 3 hides; 3 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 3 hog and rendered £2.

Hatcham tithes were paid to Bermondsey Abbey from 1173 until the dissolution of the monasteries. A series of individuals then held land locally before the manor was bought in the 17th century by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, a wealthy livery company that was instrumental in the area&#x27;s development in the 19th century. Telegraph Hill was for many years covered by market gardens also owned by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. Until the creation of the London County Council in 1889, the area was a part of the counties of Kent and Surrey.

New Cross is believed to have taken its name from a coaching house originally known as the Golden Cross, which stood close to the current New Cross House pub. The diarist John Evelyn, who lived in Deptford, wrote in 1675 that he met a friend at &#x27;New Crosse&#x27; in his coach before travelling down through Kent and on to France.

In the later 19th century, the area became known as the &quot;New Cross Tangle&quot; on account of its numerous railway lines, workshops and two stations — both originally called New Cross (one was later renamed New Cross Gate).

Hatcham Iron Works in Pomeroy Street was an important steam locomotive factory, the scene of a bitter confrontation in 1865 between its manager, George England, and the workers. The Strike Committee met at the Crown and Anchor pub in New Cross Road, now the site of Hong Kong City Chinese restaurant. George England&#x27;s house, Hatcham Lodge, is now 56 Kender Street.

New Cross bus garage was formerly the largest tram depot in London, opening in 1906. During the 1926 General Strike in support of the miners, strikebreakers were brought in to drive trams from the depot. On 7 May, police baton charges were launched to clear a crowd of 2–3,000 pickets blockading the entrance (reported as &quot;Rowdyism in New Cross&quot; by the &quot;Kentish Mercury&quot;).

The last London tram, in July 1952, ran from Woolwich to New Cross. It was driven through enormous crowds, finally arriving at its destination in the early hours of 6 July.

On 25 November 1944 a V-2 rocket exploded at the Woolworths store in New Cross Road (on the site later occupied by an Iceland supermarket), 168 people were killed, and 121 were seriously injured. It was London&#x27;s most devastating V-bombing of the entire war. On 25 November 2009 a new commemorative plaque was unveiled on the site by the Mayor of Lewisham, marking the 65th anniversary of the explosion.

On 13 August 1977, the area saw the so-called Battle of Lewisham, during which the far-right British National Front were beaten back by militant anti-fascists and local people.

On 18 January 1981, 13 young black people were killed in a house fire at a party. Suspicions that the fire was caused by a racist attack, and accusations of police indifference to the deaths, led to the largest ever political mobilisation of black people seen in the UK.

29 June 2008, two university students from France were stabbed to death in a house.

==Culture==

===Comedy===
During the 1980s, the Goldsmiths Tavern hosted alternative cabaret nights, including &quot;the Parrot Cafe&quot; organised by Emma Cafferty and Nikky Smedley. It was the original venue of &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, a live comedy night he started there in 1986 before moving it to the Albany Empire in 1988, and also where Reeves met future comedy partner Bob Mortimer. Paul O&#x27;Grady would also perform there.

A long-running comedy night named Happy Mondays runs at the Amersham Arms fortnightly. Comedians to have performed at the night include Stewart Lee, Cardinal Burns, Russell Howard, Shaparak Khorsandi, Andy Parsons, Andi Osho, Arthur Smith, Sarah Millican, Greg Davies, Milton Jones, Dane Baptiste, Robin Ince, and Al Murray.

===Music===
Goldsmiths&#x27; Students&#x27; Union had a reputation for putting on established and up and coming bands of the late 1970s and 1980s including Japan, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, Wet Wet Wet and Levellers. Blur, some of the members of which met whilst studying at the university, played their second ever gig there while still called Seymour.

In the 1990s nightclub The Venue on Clifton Rise was central to the Indie rock and Brit Pop scenes and played host to gigs by Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, The Verve, and Ocean Colour Scene. 

Urban music magazine, &quot;Touch&quot;, and The Platform Magazine, an Islamic Hip-Hop journal are based in New Cross.

During the mid to late 2000s, around the time of new rave&#x27;s popularity in the music press and the Angular Recording Corporation bringing attention to the area, the press briefly referred to &quot;The New Cross Scene&quot;. With bands such as Bloc Party, Art Brut, and The xx playing at pubs in the area early in their careers. Klaxons also formed whilst living in the area, and their original drummer&#x27;s later band Hatcham Social were named after an old name for the area via a Liberal club on the New Cross end of the part of the A202 named Queen&#x27;s Road.

In the 2010s and early 2020s the area was known for being a focal point of the London jazz revival scene, with club night &quot;Steam Down&quot;, and musicians like Nubya Garcia having gigged there and in nearby Deptford.

The area supports a fledgling student opera company, Opera Gold, run by Goldsmiths, University of London.

===Sport===

Millwall Football Club, founded by mainly Scottish workers at J.T. Morton, a cannery and food processing plant in Millwall on the Isle of Dogs in 1885, was based at The Den in Cold Blow Lane from 1910 to 1993. The ground attracted crowds of more than 45,000 at its peak, but by the 1980s was notorious for the club&#x27;s repeated incidents of football hooliganism. Millwall moved a short distance to a new stadium, The New Den, situated off Ilderton Road and just within Bermondsey, at the start of the 1993–94 season. The club remains within the New Cross electoral ward.

Speedway racing was staged at the New Cross Speedway and Greyhound Stadium, situated at the end of Hornshay Street, off Ilderton Road. The venue became home to the New Cross Rangers in 1934 when the Crystal Palace promotion moved en bloc. The track, reputed to be one of the shortest and known as &quot;The Frying Pan Bowl&quot;, operated until 1939 and re-opened in 1946 running until the early 1950s. The track re-opened for a short spell 1959 - 1961 and closed its doors to the sport for the last time mid season 1963. The stadium was also the scene of the UK&#x27;s first stock car race at Easter 1954, with 26,000 in the crowd and thousands more locked outside. The stadium site is now an open space, Bridge House Meadows. The 1949 speedway film &quot;Once a Jolly Swagman&quot;, starring Dirk Bogarde, was filmed at New Cross.

===Dance===

For many years New Cross was home to the Laban Centre, now Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance which was based at Laurie Grove producing choreographers such as Matthew Bourne and Lea Anderson. In 2002 Laban moved to new studios in Deptford. However, it still uses its New Cross campus, where studios have since been refurbished.

=== Literature ===
Its library, New Cross Learning, which was formerly known as the New Cross People&#x27;s Library, was saved from permanent closure after government cuts. A series of protests in 2011, namely from the ‘Save New Cross Library Campaign’ and the subsequent media coverage, garnered enough support to see it re-open in 2013 as a community led library. It now offers learning activities and workshops, and has a lending catalogue of over 5,000 books.

==Demography==
The New Cross ward of Lewisham has the lowest female life expectancy of all the wards of Greater London: 77.6 years. For males the rate was 74.3 years, tied with Camberwell Green in Southwark and only higher than Selhurst ward in Croydon.

==Buildings==

The proximity of New Cross to Deptford and Greenwich, both of which have strong maritime connections, led to the establishment of the Royal Naval School in New Cross in 1843 (designed by architect John Shaw Jr, 1803–1870) to house &quot;the sons of impecunious naval officers&quot;. The school relocated further south-east to Mottingham in 1889, and the former school building was bought by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, who opened the Goldsmiths’ Company&#x27;s Technical and Recreative Institute in 1891. This was in turn handed over to the University of London in 1904 and is now Goldsmiths, University of London.

The former Deptford Town Hall building in New Cross Road, now also used by Goldsmiths, was built in the Edwardian Baroque style by Lanchester and Rickards, 1903–5. Nautical references include carvings of Tritons, statues of admirals and a sailing ship weathervane on the clock turret.

New Cross Fire Station is a Grade II listed building at 266 Queens Road, built in 1893–94 to a design by the architect Robert Pearsall.

The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses was once the South East London Synagogue. It was established in 1888 by Ashkenazi Jews who had emigrated to Britain from Eastern Europe. It was refused membership of the United Synagogue, but was admitted to the Federation of Synagogues. Immanuel Jakobovits was the rabbi just after the Second World War. The synagogue&#x27;s first premises was a house at 452 New Cross Road. The first purpose-built synagogue was consecrated in March 1905 and was destroyed by a German air raid on 27 December 1940. After this the congregation moved temporarily to 117 Lewisham Way, returning to its original site at New Cross Road in 1946 – first to a temporary hut and then to a new purpose-built synagogue in 1956. During the period from 1945 to 1947 Immanuel Jakobovits, who later became the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, and was created a life peer in 1988, as Baron Jakobovits, was the rabbi. However, the congregation went into decline and the synagogue closed in 1985, by which time it only had 56 male members compared with 294 in 1939.

The Venue nightclub in New Cross Road has a long history as a place of entertainment. It opened as the New Cross Super Kinema in 1925, with a cinema on the ground floor and the New Cross Palais de Danse above, as well as a cafe. The name was shortened to New Cross Kinema from 1927, the plain Kinema in 1948, and finally Gaumont in 1950. It closed in August 1960, and remained derelict for some time. Part of the building was demolished before the old dancehall became The Harp Club and then The Venue in the late 1980s. The Venue nightclub briefly renamed itself &#x27;One For The Road&#x27; and following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and for a little while functioned less as a nightclub and more as a bar, before ultimately closing. 

Also, the Duke of Albany public house (converted to flats in 2008) was the facade for The Winchester pub in the film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;.

<text>The Utility Data Center, or UDC, was a product of Hewlett-Packard. It was arguably the first attempt to sell a private cloud. It featured a graphical interface that allowed the user to construct a server &quot;farm,&quot; including servers, OS provisioning, networking, firewalls, load balancers, and storage.

The product began in 2002 as an intellectual property acquisition, from a small services vendor, Terraspring, that had used the product to manage their own data center.
Originally termed project slinky, it was largely based out of the Fort Collins campus, and spent the first few releases porting the original solution from a stack based upon Solaris, Cisco switches, and WebSphere, to one based on HP-UX, HP Procurve, and Bluestone&#x27;s Application server. Then the team spent considerable effort improving reliability, improving security, and creating packaging, procedures and documentation to make the solution salable as a product.

HP was on its second beta release when Sun Microsystems acquired Terraspring entirely, forming the basis for the Sun N1 Grid Engine.

The project was notable, in that it was a private cloud offering, based not on the manipulation of VMs, but the allocation of bare-metal servers contained in racks. The storage was distributed to the servers via SAN Brocade switches and the manipulation of the switches via a Java-based application that commanded the infrastructure out of band, largely with SNMP.

The farms were internally represented in an XML called FML (Farm Markup language), and enacted via a Java-based engine that managed provisioning, complete with safe &quot;clean-room&quot; networks for safe disk wipe and load between customer allocations, and one of the first uses of SAN gateway to act as a sort of &quot;SAN firewall&quot; to limit WWN spoofing, that at the time, was less well understood in SANs than the equivalent LAN spoofing. Internal discussions at the time were the inspiration for what later became the introduction of Brocade&#x27;s &quot;Secure Fabric OS&quot; the first SAN switch to introduce the notion of WWN authentication.

Though the product did see three major deployments, the project was canceled on September 27, 2004. Opinions differ on the exact reasons, but there are three likely factors: 1) The $1 million base price for the smallest UDC: a single resource rack, a single XP 128, and a single management rack. 2) The loss of first-mover advantage spending so much time stabilizing the product, and porting to the HP hardware/software ecosystem. 3) When the &quot;dotcom bubble bursting&quot; reached its highest point, a significant portion of the target market segment (ISPs and IDCs) for UDC went bankrupt.

<text>The TiltedTerminatedFolded [[dipole antenna|]]D[[T2FD antenna|ipole]]&quot; (T²FD,T2FD, orTTFD) or Balanced Termination, Folded Dipole&quot; (BTFD) - also known as W3HH antenna - is a general-purpose shortwave antenna developed in the late 1940s by the United States Navy. It performs reasonably well over a broad frequency range, without marked dead spots in terms of either frequency, direction, or angle of radiation above the horizon.

Although inferior in terms of efficiency (at least 30% of the RF power is lost as heat in the resistor ) to antennas specifically designed for given frequency bands, or optimized for directionality, its all-around performance, relatively modest size, low cost, and the fact that it does not require any complicated matching to operate with a standard shortwave transmitter, have made it popular in professional shortwave communications where ERP or gain are not a concern. One example would be clear channel low power HF communications.

==History==
The history of the T²FD antenna divides conveniently into three different phases: It was first developed for use as a general purpose antenna on Naval ships in the 1940s. The design became public in the 1950s and was adopted by radio amateurs, but then fell out of use with the advent of shorter wavelengths and the widespread adoption of low-impedance transmitters and antenna feeds. Recently, with the advent of multiple new frequency bands which are not even-integer multiples of existing bands’ frequencies, it has started to draw renewed attention from radio amateurs.

===Origin===
The T²FD antenna was originally developed during WW II at the San Diego naval base for use on ships at sea, where antenna size is limited, but where the metal hull and salt water under the ship, or seaside station, makes an exceptionally good radio-frequency ground-plane. The design properties of the antenna make it ideal for use in small spaces at long wavelengths, where no short antenna can be aimed in any particular direction, anyway, and where the number of antennas is limited, compared to the large number of operating frequencies with exceedingly different wavelengths.

===Early amateur use===
One of the developers of the original Navy antenna, Captain G.L. Countryman, was an amateur radio enthusiast. He introduced the design to other amateurs at the beginning of the 1950s. It was a popular antenna design during the middle of the 20th century, but fell out of common use during the latter part of the century with the growing popularity of upper HF and VHF frequencies, which needed dipoles with more feasible lengths – only ~ or smaller, as opposed to quarter-wave antennas ~ long needed for the lower &quot;short&quot;-wave bands. Another factor contributing to its fall in popularity was the increasing use of low-impedance 50 Ω antenna feedline, which requires impedance matching at the T²FD feedpoint.

===Recent revival===
Since the late 1980s, amateur radio operators and hobby shortwave listeners have ‘rediscovered’ this antenna, especially for broadcast receiving and for amateur two-way modes such as Morse code and PSK31 where crude signal strength is not as important as a ‘steady’ signal.

There have also been disputed claims that this antenna is comparatively insensitive to man-made radio interference; if true, that would make the design useful in urban environments, where a low noise floor is often more beneficial than high received signal strength. The T²FD is useful for hidden indoor systems, or where several optimized frequency-specific antennas cannot be accommodated. For example, an indoor antenna only 24 feet long will allow operation on all amateur HF bands above 14 MHz on transmit, and down to 7 MHz on receive.

==Construction==
A typical T²FD is built as follows, out of two parallel-wire conductors:

* Span near a half-wavelength of the lowest required frequency.
* Distance between upper and lower conductors equal to of the wavelength. This distance is maintained by a number of insulating dowels.
* At least two dowels at the ends are tied to non-conducting ropes, which in turn are tied to supports.
* The upper and lower ends of the conductors are connected at the ends, by wire sections that follow the end dowels.
* Fed in the middle of the lower conductor, with an impedance in the order of 300 Ω, balanced, through a standard 4:1 balun. This provides an acceptable all-frequency match to commonly available 75 Ω coaxial cable.
* Terminated in the middle of the upper conductor with a 400–480 Ω non-inductive resistor, rated to safely absorb at least of the applied transmitter power. The resistor absorbs a growing portion of the RF power (either captured from the air or supplied by a transmitter) as the operating frequency nears the lower limit of the design range. The resistor can be built of 10 parallel sets of three 1,600 Ω, 1 W resistors, in series.
* In order to make it roughly omnidirectional, the antenna is ideally strung sloping at an angle of 20–40 degrees from horizontal, but will also function satisfactorily if mounted horizontally, as long as it is pulled-out in a reasonably straight line.

The commercially available B&amp;W AC3-30 and B&amp;W DS1.8-30 antennas vary from the above to cover 3–30 MHz using a 90 foot length with an 18 inch spacing of the wires. The balun is a 16:1 ratio, thereby transforming the 50 Ω (ohm) coax to an 800 Ω feed at the antenna. The resistor load is also 800 Ω, non-inductive. This allows the antenna impedance to swing from 400–1,600 Ω over the frequency range intended and thus keep the SWR at the transmitter 2:1 or lower.

==Applications and drawbacks==
An antenna such as the one described above is usable for both local and medium-long-distance communication across a frequency range of about 1:6 . For example, an antenna for the lower portion of shortwave (say, 3–18 MHz) will be roughly 33 m (110 feet) long, with conductors spaced 1 m (3.3 feet). For the higher portion of shortwave (5–30 MHz), this antenna will be roughly 20 m (66 feet) long, with a spacing of 60 cm (24 inches). If such long spans cannot be accommodated, smaller antennas will still give adequate receive-only performance down to about half of their lowest design frequency.

Transmit performance, however, degrades rapidly below a certain point. Tests done by J.S. Belrose (1994) showed that though the conventional T²FD length is close to a full-size 80 meter (3.5–4.0 MHz) antenna, the antenna starts to suffer serious signal loss both on transmit and receive below 10 MHz (30 m), with the 80 meter band signals −10 dB down (90% power loss) from a reference dipole at 10 MHz.

As a broadband antenna, the T²FD will normally display a reasonably low standing wave ratio (SWR) across its entire frequency range. However, at some frequencies the antenna feedpoint may be moderately reactive, so the use of an antenna tuner may be needed when using modern solid-state transmitters at anything approaching their rated power output. 

Note that “low SWR” does &quot;not&quot; mean “high antenna efficiency”. This antenna is not recommended for those wanting to make challenging long-distance signal contacts with limited power (e.g. the new U.K. limit of 1,000 W, or the U.S. amateur limit of 1,500 W). At shortwave frequencies, a dipole cut for the longest used wavelength, fed with ladder line and matched with an antenna tuner, would make better use of the applied power than the T²FD.

Many ready-made commercial versions of the T²FD are available for the professional, military, amateur radio, and hobby listening markets.

<doc id="373672" wikidata="Q207175" url="?curid=373672" title="Bohemianism">
<text>Bohemianism is a social and cultural movement that has, at its core, a way of life away from society&#x27;s conventional norms and expectations. The term originates from the French &quot;bohème&quot; and spread to the English-speaking world. It was used to describe mid-19th-century non-traditional lifestyles, especially of artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.

Bohemian is a 19th-century historical and literary topos that places the milieu of young metropolitan artists and intellectuals—particularly those of the Latin Quarter in Paris—in a context of poverty, hunger, appreciation of friendship, idealization of art and contempt for money. Based on this topos, the most diverse real-world subcultures are often referred to as &quot;bohemian&quot; in a figurative sense, especially (but by no means exclusively) if they show traits of a precariat.

Bohemians were associated with unorthodox or anti-establishment political or social viewpoints expressed through free love, frugality, and—in some cases—simple living, van dwelling or voluntary poverty. A more economically privileged, wealthy, or even aristocratic bohemian circle is sometimes referred to as &quot;haute bohème&quot; (literally &quot;Upper Bohemian&quot;).

The term &quot;bohemianism&quot; emerged in France in the early 19th century out of perceived similarities between the urban Bohemians and the Romani people; &quot;La bohème&quot; was a common term for the Romani people of France, who were thought to have reached France in the 15th century via Bohemia (the western part of modern Czech Republic). &quot;Bohemianism&quot; and its adjective &quot;bohemian&quot; in this specific context are not connected to the native inhabitants of the historical region of Bohemia (the Czechs).

==Origins==

===European bohemianism===
Literary and artistic bohemians were associated in the French imagination with the roving Roma people, often pejoratively referred to as &quot;gypsies&quot;. Romani were called &quot;bohémiens&quot; in French because they were believed to have come to France from Bohemia.

The title character in &quot;Carmen&quot; (1875), a French opera by Georges Bizet set in the Spanish city of Seville, is referred to as a &quot;bohémienne&quot; in Meilhac and Halévy&#x27;s libretto. Her signature aria declares love itself to be a &quot;gypsy child&quot; (&quot;enfant de Bohême&quot;), going where it pleases and obeying no laws.

Henri Murger&#x27;s 1845 collection of short stories, &quot;Scènes de la vie de bohème&quot; (&quot;Scenes of Bohemian Life&quot;), was written to glorify and legitimize the bohemian lifestyle. Murger&#x27;s collection formed the basis of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s 1896 opera &quot;La bohème&quot;.

In England, bohemian in this sense initially was popularised in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1848 novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by George du Maurier&#x27;s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture &quot;Trilby&quot; (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three expatriate English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful Central European musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.

In Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in Ramón del Valle-Inclán&#x27;s 1920 play &quot;Luces de Bohemia&quot;.

In his song &quot;La Bohème&quot;, Charles Aznavour described the Bohemian lifestyle in Montmartre. The 2001 film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; also imagines the Bohemian lifestyle of actors and artists in Montmartre at the turn of the 20th century.

===American bohemianism===
In the 1850s, Bohemian culture started to become established in the United States via immigration. In New York City in 1857, a group of 15 to 20 young, cultured journalists flourished as self-described bohemians until the American Civil War began in 1861. This group gathered at a German bar on Broadway called Pfaff&#x27;s beer cellar. Members included their leader Henry Clapp Jr., Ada Clare, Walt Whitman, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, and actress Adah Isaacs Menken.

Similar groups in other cities were broken up as well by the Civil War and reporters spread out to report on the conflict. During the war, correspondents began to assume the title bohemian, and newspapermen in general took up the moniker. Bohemian became synonymous with newspaper writer. In 1866, war correspondent Junius Henri Browne, who wrote for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, described bohemian journalists such as he was, as well as the few carefree women and lighthearted men he encountered during the war years.

San Francisco journalist Bret Harte first wrote as &quot;The Bohemian&quot; in &quot;The Golden Era&quot; in 1861, with this persona taking part in many satirical doings, the lot published in his book &quot;Bohemian Papers&quot; in 1867. Harte wrote, &quot;Bohemia has never been located geographically, but any clear day when the sun is going down, if you mount Telegraph Hill, you shall see its pleasant valleys and cloud-capped hills glittering in the West...&quot;

Mark Twain included himself and Charles Warren Stoddard in the bohemian category in 1867. By 1872, when a group of journalists and artists who gathered regularly for cultural pursuits in San Francisco were casting about for a name, the term bohemian became the main choice, and the Bohemian Club was born. Club members who were established and successful, pillars of their community, respectable family men, redefined their own form of bohemianism to include people like them who were , sportsmen, and appreciators of the fine arts. Club member and poet George Sterling responded to this redefinition:

Despite his views, Sterling associated with the Bohemian Club, and caroused with artist and industrialist alike at the Bohemian Grove.

Canadian composer Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and poet George Frederick Cameron wrote the song &quot;The Bohemian&quot; in the 1889 opera &quot;Leo, the Royal Cadet&quot;.

The impish American writer and Bohemian Club member Gelett Burgess, who coined the word &quot;blurb&quot;, supplied this description of the amorphous place called Bohemia:

In New York City, the pianist Rafael Joseffy formed an organization of musicians in 1907 with friends, such as Rubin Goldmark, called &quot;The Bohemians (New York Musicians&#x27; Club)&quot;. Near Times Square, Joel Rinaldo presided over &quot;Joel&#x27;s Bohemian Refreshery&quot;, where the Bohemian crowd gathered from before the turn of the 20th century until Prohibition began to bite. Jonathan Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot;, and specifically the song &quot;La Vie Boheme&quot;, portrayed the postmodern Bohemian culture of New York in the late 20th century.

In May 2014, a story on NPR suggested, after a century and a half, some Bohemian ideal of living in poverty for the sake of art had fallen in popularity among the latest generation of American artists. In the feature, a recent graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design related &quot;her classmates showed little interest in living in garrets and eating ramen noodles.&quot;

==People==

The term has become associated with various artistic or academic communities and is used as a generalized adjective describing such people, environs, or situations: bohemian (&quot;boho&quot;—informal) is defined in &quot;The American College Dictionary&quot; as &quot;a person with artistic or intellectual tendencies, who lives and acts with no regard for conventional rules of behavior&quot;.

Many prominent European and American figures of the 19th and 20th centuries belonged to the bohemian subculture, and any comprehensive &quot;list of bohemians&quot; would be tediously long. Bohemianism has been approved of by some bourgeois writers such as Honoré de Balzac, but most conservative cultural critics do not condone bohemian lifestyles.

In &quot;Bohemian Manifesto: a Field Guide to Living on the Edge&quot;, author Laren Stover breaks down the bohemian into five distinct mind-sets or styles, as follows:
*Beat: also drifters, but non-materialist and art-focused
*Dandy: no money, but try to appear as if they have it by buying and displaying expensive or rare items – such as brands of alcohol
*Gypsy: the expatriate types, they create their own Gypsy ideal of nirvana wherever they go
*Nouveau: bohemians that are rich who attempt to join traditional bohemianism with contemporary culture
*Zen: &quot;post-beat&quot;, focus on spirituality rather than art

Aimée Crocker, an American world traveler, adventuress, heiress, and mystic, was dubbed the &quot;queen of Bohemia&quot; in the 1910s by the world press for living an uninhibited, sexually liberated, and aggressively non-conformist life in San Francisco, New York, and Paris. She spent the bulk of her fortune inherited from her father Edwin B. Crocker, a railroad tycoon and art collector, on traveling all over the world (lingering the longest in Hawaii, India, Japan, and China) and partying with famous artists of her time such as Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, the Barrymores, Enrico Caruso, Isadora Duncan, Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, and Rudolph Valentino. Crocker had countless affairs and married five times in five different decades of her life, each man being in his twenties. She was famous for her tattoos and pet snakes and was reported to have started the first Buddhist colony in Manhattan. Spiritually inquisitive, Crocker had a ten-year affair with occultist Aleister Crowley and was a devoted student of Hatha Yoga.

Maxwell Bodenheim, an American poet and novelist, was known as the king of Greenwich Village Bohemians during the 1920s and his writing brought him international fame during the Jazz Age.
In the 20th-century United States, the bohemian impulse was famously seen in the 1940s hipsters, the 1950s Beat generation (exemplified by writers such as William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti), the much more widespread 1960s counterculture, and 1960s and 1970s hippies.

In 2001, political and cultural commentator David Brooks contended that much of the cultural ethos of well-to-do middle-class Americans is Bohemian-derived, coining the oxymoron &quot;Bourgeois Bohemians&quot; or &quot;Bobos&quot;. A similar term in Germany is Bionade-Biedermeier, a 2007 German neologism combining Bionade (a trendy lemonade brand) and Biedermeier (an era of introspective Central European culture between 1815 and 1848). The coinage was introduced in 2007 by Henning Sußebach, a German journalist, in an article that appeared in &quot;Zeitmagazin&quot; concerning Berlin&#x27;s Prenzlauer Berg lifestyle. The hyphenated term gained traction and has been quoted and referred to since. A German ARD TV broadcaster used the title &quot;Boheme and Biedermeier&quot; in a 2009 documentary about Berlin&#x27;s Prenzlauer Berg. The main focus was on protagonists, that contributed to the image of a paradise for the (organic and child-raising) well-to-do, depicting cafés where &quot;Bionade-Biedermeier sips from Fair-Trade&quot;.

<text>The Daily Record is a Scottish national tabloid newspaper based in Glasgow. The newspaper is published Monday–Saturday and its website is updated on an hourly basis, seven days a week. The &quot;Record&quot; sister title is the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;. Both titles are owned by Reach plc and have a close kinship with the UK-wide &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as a result.

The &quot;Record&quot; covers UK news and sport with a Scottish focus. Its website boasts the largest readership of any publisher based in Scotland. The title was at the forefront of technological advances in publishing throughout the 20th century and became the first European daily newspaper to be produced in full colour.

As the &quot;Record&quot; print circulation has declined in line with other national papers, it has focused increasing attention on expanding its digital news operation.

==Foundation and early history==
The &quot;Daily Record&quot; was first published in 1895 in Glasgow as a sister title to the &quot;North British Daily Mail&quot;. 

The &quot;Mail&quot; – which was not linked to the London-based newspaper of the same name – was the first daily newspaper to be published in Glasgow when launched in 1847. It was among the first papers to offer readers in Scotland the latest political and business news direct from London. Publishers based outside the UK capital were then reliant on correspondents sending information in the post, which could take days to arrive.

The rapid expansion of the British railway network in the 1840s revolutionised the postal service as letters could now be sent from London to Scotland overnight, making daily newspapers produced outside of the south-east commercially viable.

Sir Charles Cameron, one of the most celebrated Scottish journalists of his day, became editor of the &quot;Mail&quot; in 1864 and oversaw its expansion.

By 1895 Glasgow was a global industrial centre and its population was approaching one million. The &quot;Daily Record&quot; was launched to meet the increasing appetite for reading material and also to take advantage of the huge demand for advertising space from the city&#x27;s booming commercial sector.

The &quot;Record&quot; was a product of the Amalgamated Press company established by Alfred Harmsworth, the press baron who would become Lord Northcliffe. The paper was first printed at a factory in Frederick Lane.

The daily edition of the &quot;Mail&quot; ceased publication in 1901 and was incorporated into the &quot;Record&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Daily Record and Mail&quot;. The separate &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; continued publication and survives to this day.

In 1904, the paper&#x27;s growing success was reflected when the &quot;Record&quot; moved into a purpose-built headquarters at Renfield Lane in Glasgow city centre. The five-storey building was designed by the eminent Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

Charles Mackintosh wanted to maximise light in the poorly-lit lane and adopted a striking use of colour on the exterior, combining yellow sculpted sandstone with blue and white glazed reflective bricks. The lower floors were used for newspaper production while the upper levels were used by editorial and commercial staff.

Lord Kemsley bought the &quot;Daily Record, Sunday Mail&quot; and another newspaper, the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot;, for £1 million in 1922. He formed a controlling company known as Associated Scottish Newspapers Ltd. Larger premises were required for the three titles and production was switched from the Mackintosh building to a new building at 67 Hope Street in 1926.

The &quot;Record, Sunday Mail&quot; and &quot;Evening News&quot; were all sold to the London-based Mirror Group in 1955. Glasgow was by then still served by three evening newspapers, despite the city&#x27;s population having peaked. The &quot;Evening News&quot; was closed in January 1957.

Production of the &quot;Record&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; moved to a purpose-built office and printing plant at Anderston Quay in 1971.

== Innovation ==
The &quot;Record&quot; made British newspaper history on 7 October 1936 by publishing the first colour advertisement seen in a daily title – a full page advertising Dewar&#x27;s White Label Whisky. It took some time for colour advertisements to become popular across other newspapers as printing techniques of the time could lead to smudging.

In June 1936, the Record also published what was hailed as the first colour photograph to accompany a news story when the paper printed an image of then-exiled Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie upon his visit to the west of Scotland, where he stayed at Castle Wemyss.

In 1971 the &quot;Daily Record&quot; became the first European newspaper to be printed in &quot;full colour&quot; and was the first British national title to introduce computer page make-up technology. This was made by possible by the opening of a purpose-built printing plant at Anderston Quay on the River Clyde.

The switch to colour printing was overseen by editor Derek Webster and saw the paper&#x27;s circulation jump to 750,000 copies per day. Printers from around the world, including a team from Asahi Shimbun in Japan, visited the Record&#x27;s Glasgow plant to learn about the potential of the new printing press.

== Circulation wars ==
By the time of the UK general election of 1970, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; was described as one of &quot;the two best-selling Scottish newspapers&quot; along with the Scottish edition of the &quot;Daily Express.&quot;

The post-war years were a time of intense competition among daily newspapers across the UK to attract both readers and lucrative advertising business. The competition was particularly fierce among the Scottish press, which served a country with an above average number of papers despite a population of just over five million.

The rivalry between the &quot;Record&quot; and the &quot;Express&quot; to be first to publish exclusive stories was at its height during the 1960s and 1970s, an era when most London-based newspapers had yet to establish themselves in Scotland.

The Scottish edition of the rival &quot;Express&quot; was drastically scaled back with large job losses in 1974, by which time the Record had become the biggest-selling newspaper in Scotland.

The &quot;Record&quot; dominance of the daily newspaper market was challenged when Rupert Murdoch launched a well-funded Scottish edition of &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1987. The new title&#x27;s launch editor was Jack Irvine, who was poached from the &quot;Record&quot; by Murdoch.

In 2006 the Scottish edition of &quot;The Sun&quot; claimed to have finally over taken the &quot;Record&quot; in terms of print copies being sold each day. This was the result of aggressive cost-cutting, which saw the &quot;Sun&quot; sold for just 10p per copy – half the cost of the &quot;Record&quot; at the time.

The &quot;Record&quot; and its sister title, the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, were purchased by Trinity Mirror in 1999, from the estate of Robert Maxwell.

==Circulation==
==Archive==
A &quot;Daily Record&quot; newspaper archives website was launched in 2019, with beginning with the first edition from 1895.

Historical copies of the &quot;Daily Record&quot; from the years 1914 to 1918 are available to search and view in digitised form at the British Newspaper Archive.

==&quot;Daily Record PM&quot;==
In August 2006, the paper launched afternoon editions in Glasgow and Edinburgh entitled &quot;Record PM&quot;. Both papers initially had a cover price of 15p, but in January 2007, it was announced that they would become freesheets, which are distributed on the streets of the city centres. It was simultaneously announced that new editions were to be released in Aberdeen and Dundee. The &quot;PM&quot; is no longer published by the &quot;Daily Record&quot;.

==Political stance==
The &quot;Record&quot; endorsed Harold Wilson ahead of the 1964 general election and supported Labour at every subsequent national election for the next forty years. The paper has taken a much more critical stance towards the party in the 21st century, coinciding with Labour&#x27;s decline as an electoral force in Scotland.

The paper is a vigorous promoter of Scottish industries and associated trade unions. It was particularly critical of Margaret Thatcher during her premiership and blamed Conservative Party economic policies for the closure of numerous factories, shipyards and foundries throughout Scotland in the 1980s and 1990s.

The &quot;Record&quot; campaigned doggedly to save the Ravenscraig steel works, a major employer in the west of Scotland, and organised a mass petition of support which was in turn handed in at Downing Street. The plant was ultimately closed in 1992.

Like its sister title the &quot;Mirror&quot;, the &quot;Record&quot; opposed the Conservative Party under the premiership of Boris Johnson.

The &quot;Record&quot; backed Labour&#x27;s policy of creating a Scottish Parliament, despite opposition from the then Conservative Government, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The paper advocated for a &quot;Yes-Yes&quot; vote at the 1997 devolution referendum.

The &quot;Record&quot; was opposed to the Scottish National Party (SNP) and both Scottish independence and urged voters to stick with Labour at the 2007 Holyrood election, which the party lost by one seat.

At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the &quot;Record&quot; accepted the SNP would emerge as the largest party in terms of seats. It called on Nicola Sturgeon to work with Labour if she failed to win an outright majority.

Regarding the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum, the paper said in a pre-election editorial: &quot;If the people of Scotland vote for parties that support another referendum, that is what should happen.&quot;

The &quot;Record&quot; has campaigned for the decriminalisation of drug use in Scotland since 2019. In several special editions, it spoke to doctors, politicians, academics, recovery groups and former drug addicts, with the majority advocating treating drugs as a health matter rather than a criminal one. It suggested that criminal convictions inappropriately punished drug users for their addictions, handing down fines they could not afford to pay or custodial sentences that made their drug problems worse. The paper also highlighted the use of drug consumption facilities, stating that they encourage addicts into treatment, reduce the amount of heroin needles on city pavements, counter the spread of diseases such as HIV and ultimately save lives. However, it stated that there would need to be changes to current law in the UK, such as decriminalising the bringing in of certain drugs to these facilities, before it would be possible to open and effectively run such facilities. The paper said that the biggest route to progress is through properly funding harm reduction and rehab programmes.

<text>Cleanliness is both the state of being clean and free from germs, dirt, trash, or waste, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: &quot;Cleanliness is next to Godliness&quot;, and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty.

The concept of cleanliness emphasizes an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention. In this it differs from , which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension. &quot;Cleanliness&quot;, observed Jacob Burckhardt, &quot;is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection&quot;. A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but ordinarily not purity. Cleanliness is also a characteristic of people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.

Cleanliness is related to hygiene and disease prevention. Washing is one way of achieving physical cleanliness, usually with water and often some kind of soap or detergent. Cleaning procedures are also important in many forms of manufacturing.

As an assertion of moral superiority or respectability, cleanliness has played a role in establishing cultural values in relation to social class, humanitarianism, and cultural imperialism.

==Hygiene==
Since the germ theory of disease, cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other hazardous materials. A reaction to an excessive desire for a germ-free environment began around 1989, when David Strachan put forth the &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot; in the &quot;British Medical Journal.&quot; This hypothesis holds that environmental microbes help develop the human immune system; the fewer germs people are exposed to in early childhood, the more likely they are to experience certain health problems in childhood and as adults. However, the valuation of cleanliness also has a social and cultural dimension beyond the requirements of hygiene for practical purposes.

==Industry==
Certain processes in industry, such as those related to integrated circuit manufacturing, require exceptionally clean conditions, which are maintained by working in cleanrooms. Cleanliness is essential to successful electroplating, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. The industry has developed specialized techniques for parts cleaning, as well as tests for cleanliness. The most commonly used tests rely on the wetting behaviour of a clean hydrophilic metal surface. Cleanliness is important to vacuum systems to reduce outgassing. Cleanliness is crucial for semiconductor manufacturing.

==Ethics==
Some studies show a positive correlation between cleanliness and ethical judgements.

==Religion==
=== In Christianity ===

The Bible contains descriptions of many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, skin disease, death, animal sacrifices, and toilet etiquette. Certain Christian rules of purity have implications for bodily hygiene and observing cleanliness, including sexual hygiene, menstruation and toilet etiquette. In certain denominations of Christianity, cleanliness includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness before prayer, observing days of ritual purification, as well as those concerning diet and apparel. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes several kinds of hand washing, for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory, or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. Women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.

Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene, despite the denunciation of the mixed bathing style of Roman pools by early Christian clergy, as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men, this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Father, Clement of Alexandria. The Didascalia Apostolorum, an early Christian manual, enjoined Christians to bathe themselves in those facilities that were separated by sex. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were sex-segregated near monasteries and pilgrimage sites. The popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on value of bathing as a bodily need. Public bathhouse were common in medieval Christendom larger towns and cities such as Constantinople, Rome, Paris, Regensburg and Naples.

Around the time of Tertullian, an early Church Father, it was customary for Christians to wash their hands (&quot;manulavium&quot;), face (&quot;capitilavium&quot;) and feet (&quot;pedilavium&quot;) before prayer, as well as before receiving Holy Communion. The rite of footwashing employed a basin of water and linen towels, done in the imitation of Christ. A major contribution of the Christian missionaries in Africa, Asia and other places was better health care of the people through hygiene and introducing and distributing the soaps.

=== In Hinduism===

In Hinduism, cleanliness is an important virtue. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; describes it as one of the divine qualities which one must practice. The Sanskrit word for cleanliness is . The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; repeats this word in five slokas at 13.8, 16.3, 16.7, 17.14 and 18.42. &quot;Śrīmad Bhāgavatam&quot; mentioned at 1.16.26, 1.17.24 (as one of the four legs of Satya Yuga or Golden Age), 1.17.42, 3.28.4 (as spiritual practice), 3.31.33 (those who are addicted to sex life will not understand cleanliness), 4.29.84 (purity of ), 7.11.8–12 (one of the thirty qualities to be acquired), 7.11.21 (cleanliness as a characteristic of a Brahmin), 7.11.24 (cleanliness is a quality of the best worker), 11.3.24 (one should learn cleanliness to serve his or her guru), 11.17.16 (cleanliness is a natural quality of a Brahmin), 11.18.36 (cleanliness as a virtue among those who has realised God), 11.18.43 (quality to be practised by a householder), 11.21.14 (means of cleansing one body and mind), 11.19.36–39 (cleanliness means detachment from desire-prompted actions) 12.2.1 (effects of Kali Yuga on cleanliness).

&quot;Śrīmad Bhāgavatam&quot; also recognises cleanliness as one of the thirty qualities which one must acquire to obtain the grace of God and identifies internal and external cleanliness among the twelve regular duties. Cleanliness is also an exalted quality which characterises the Satya Yuga (Golden Age) in Hinduism.

Cleanliness or is both internal and external. Hinduism extols not only external cleanliness but also internal cleanliness or purity. Since the minds of devotees () are constantly absorbed in the all-pure lord, they become internally cleansed from the defects () of lust, anger, greed, envy, ego, etc. In this state of mind, they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well. Thus, in accordance with the old saying, &quot;cleanliness is next to godliness&quot;, they are also externally pure. &quot;Śrīmad Bhāgavatam&quot; explains the internal and external cleanliness as:

In &quot;Śrīmad Bhāgavatam&quot; 11.19.36–39, cleanliness is also defined as detachment from activities prompted by desire. Cleanliness, therefore, means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one&#x27;s skin with water.

Hindus must bathe before entering temples in order to seek blessings, and temples often have tanks of water for this purpose. They also wash their feet before entering the temple. In some Orthodox Hindu households, taking a bath after visiting a funeral () is required by Hindus who believe that a funeral is an inauspicious thing to witness, the inauspiciousness of which will follow those who do not purify themselves.

Hindus must visit the seven sacred rivers. Bathing in these rivers purifies the mind and increases their good merits. To invoke the presence of the holy rivers, the following mantra is chanted before the daily bath:
Hindus clean their homes particularly well in preparing to celebrate Diwali each year as they believe that this brings good luck. Most Hindus also believe that keeping your house clean and great devotion are gestures to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi to their abode to stay. Some orthodox Hindus refrain from cleaning their houses on a Friday as it is a day dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi and cleaning homes on that day is considered inauspicious, so they clean their homes on other days. Tamil people also keep their homes clean in preparation for Diwali, Pongal, or Bhol.

===In Islam===
Islam stresses the importance of cleanliness and personal hygiene. There are many verses in the Quran that discuss cleanliness. For example, &quot;…Truly, Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He &#x27;loves those who keep themselves pure and clean&quot; (2:222). And, &quot;…In mosque, there are men who love to be clean and pure. Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure&quot; (9:108).

The first lessons in Islamic catechisms are often matters of cleanliness, with subjects including: what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and what should they use to clean with. Muslims are required to perform ablution () with clean water before every prayer, and are recommended to stay in the state of ablution at all times. Abolution with dry materials () may be used in exceptional circumstances, such as if clean water is unavailable. A ritual bath () is performed on Fridays before the Friday Prayer (). Ritual baths are recommended for spiritual purity, also after committing a sin, and are necessary for those who have watched a funeral. Special attention is given to cleaning homes before the arrival of guests or before feasts (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha), and holy days and nights.

Islamic hygienical jurisprudence, which dates to the 7th century, has elaborate rules. (ritual purity) involves performing (ablution) for (five daily prayers), as well as regularly performing (bathing), which led to bathhouses being built across the Islamic world. Islamic toilet hygiene also requires washing with water after using the toilet, for purity and to minimize germs.

A basic form of the contagion/germ theory of disease found in the medieval Islamic world, was proposed by Persian physician Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025). He mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath, noted contagion with tuberculosis, and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt. The concept of invisible contagion was eventually widely accepted by Islamic scholars. In the Ayyubid Sultanate, they referred to such contagious substances as (&quot;impure substances&quot;). The scholar Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari (), while discussing Islamic diet and hygiene, gave advice and warnings about how contagion can contaminate water, food, and garments, and could spread through the water supply.

<doc id="373687" wikidata="Q463491" url="?curid=373687" title="Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Gloucester">
<text>Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford, 5th Earl of Gloucester, 1st Lord of Glamorgan, 7th Lord of Clare (1180 – 25 October 1230) was the son of Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford (c. 1153–1217), from whom he inherited the Clare estates. He also inherited from his mother, Amice Fitz William, the estates of Gloucester and the honour of St. Hilary, and from Rohese, an ancestor, the moiety of the Giffard estates. In June 1202, he was entrusted with the lands of Harfleur and Montivilliers in Normandy.

== Life ==

In 1215, Gilbert and his father were two of the barons who made Magna Carta sureties and championed Louis &quot;le Dauphin&quot; of France in the First Barons&#x27; War, fighting at Lincoln under the baronial banner. He was taken prisoner in 1217 by William Marshal, whose daughter Isabel he later married on 9 October, her 17th birthday. 

In 1223, he accompanied his brother-in-law, Earl Marshal, in an expedition into Wales. In 1225 he was present at the confirmation of Magna Carta by Henry III. In 1228, he led an army against the Welsh, capturing Morgan Gam, who was released the next year. 

He then joined in an expedition to Brittany, but died on his way back to Penrose in that duchy. His body was conveyed home by way of Plymouth and Cranborne to Tewkesbury. His arms were: Or, three chevronels gules.

== Issue ==
Gilbert de Clare had six children by his wife Isabel Marshal, great-grandmother of King Robert the Bruce:
*Agnes de Clare (b. 1218)
*Amice de Clare (1220–1287), who married Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon
*Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester (1222–1262)
*Isabel de Clare (1226–1264), who married Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale
*William de Clare (1228–1258)
*Gilbert de Clare (b. 1229)
*Petronilla de Clare, of Instow, Devon (b. abt. 1230 - 1320) Abbess of Canonleigh Abbey, Devon (1318). She married John St. John d. 1303, of Ashleigh, Devon, the younger brother of Roger St. John d. 1265 of Stanton-St. John and the elder half-brother of John Despenser. They acquired his brothers&#x27; lands (Stanton-St. John, Lageham, Swallowfield) after their rebellion and their lands were confiscated following the Battle of Evesham. This John St. John held Instow, Devon, by way of his wife for the Honour of Gloucester.

His widow Isabel later married the King of the Romans &amp; Earl of Cornwall, Richard Plantagenet, of the House of Plantagenet.

<doc id="373696" wikidata="Q1360375" url="?curid=373696" title="Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester">
<text>Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester (2 September 1243 – 7 December 1295) was a powerful English magnate. He was also known as &quot;Red&quot; Gilbert de Clare or &quot;The Red Earl&quot;, probably because of his hair colour or fiery temper in battle. He held the Lordship of Glamorgan which was one of the most powerful and wealthy of the Welsh Marcher Lordships as well as over 200 English manors (172 in the Honor of Clare).

== Lineage ==
Gilbert de Clare was born at Christchurch, Hampshire, the son of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, and of Maud de Lacy, daughter of John de Lacy and Margaret de Quincy. Gilbert inherited his father&#x27;s estates in 1262. He took on the titles, including Lord of Glamorgan, from 1263. Being underage at his father&#x27;s death, he was made a ward of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford.

== Massacre of the Jews at Canterbury ==
During the Second Barons&#x27; War in April 1264, Gilbert de Clare led the massacre of the Jews at Canterbury, as Simon de Montfort&#x27;s supporters had done elsewhere. Gilbert de Clare&#x27;s castles of Kingston and Tonbridge were taken by the King, Henry III. However, the King allowed Clare&#x27;s Countess Alice de Lusignan, who was in the latter, to go free because she was his niece; but on 12 May Clare and Montfort were denounced as traitors.

== The Battle of Lewes ==
Two days later, just before the Battle of Lewes, on 14 May, Simon de Montfort knighted the Earl and his brother Thomas. The Earl commanded the central division of the Baronial army, which formed up on the Downs west of Lewes. When Prince Edward had left the field in pursuit of Montfort&#x27;s routed left wing, the King and Earl of Cornwall were thrown back to the town. Henry took refuge in the Priory of St Pancras, and Gilbert accepted the surrender of the Earl of Cornwall, who had hidden in a windmill. Montfort and the Earl were now supreme and Montfort in effect &quot;de facto&quot; King of England.

== Excommunication ==

On 20 October 1264, Gilbert and his associates were excommunicated by Pope Clement IV, and his lands were placed under an interdict. In the following month, by which time they had obtained possession of Gloucester and Bristol, the Earl was proclaimed to be a rebel. However at this point he changed sides as he fell out with Montfort and the Earl, to prevent Montfort&#x27;s escape, destroyed ships at the port of Bristol and the bridge over the River Severn at Gloucester. Having changed sides, Clare shared the Prince&#x27;s victory at Kenilworth on 16 July, and in the Battle of Evesham, 4 August, in which Montfort was slain, he commanded the second division and contributed largely to the victory. On 24 June 1268, having been reconciled to Prince Edward, he and the prince took the Cross together at Northampton.

== Activities as a Marcher Lord ==
In October 1265, as a reward for supporting Prince Edward, Gilbert was given the castle and title of Abergavenny and the honour and castle of Brecknock. At Michaelmas his disputes with Llewelyn the Last were submitted to arbitration, but without a final settlement. Meanwhile, he was building Caerphilly Castle into a fortress. On 6 October 1265 he received the papal absolution of his excommunication, and on 9 October that year the pardon of the King for his former support of Montfort.

At the end of 1268 he refused to obey the King&#x27;s summons to attend parliament, alleging that, owing to the constant inroads of Llewelyn the Last, his Welsh estates needed his presence for their defence. At the death of Henry III, 16 November 1272, the Earl took the lead in swearing fealty to Edward I, who was then in Sicily on his return from the Crusade. The next day, with the Archbishop of York, he entered London and proclaimed peace to all, Christians and Jews, and for the first time, secured the acknowledgement of the right of the King&#x27;s eldest son to succeed to the throne immediately. Thereafter, he was joint Guardian of England, during the King&#x27;s absence, and on the new King&#x27;s arrival in England, in August 1274, entertained him at Tonbridge Castle.

== The Welsh war in 1282 ==

During Edward&#x27;s invasion of Wales in 1282, Clare insisted on leading an attack into southern Wales. King Edward made Clare the commander of the southern army invading Wales. However, Clare&#x27;s army faced disaster after being heavily defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr. Following this defeat, Clare was relieved of his position as the southern commander and was replaced by William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (whose son had died during the battle).

== Private Marcher War ==
In the next year, 1291, he quarrelled with the Earl of Hereford, Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, grandson of his onetime guardian, about the Lordship of Brecknock, where Bohun accused Clare of building a castle on his land culminated in a private war between them. Although it was a given right for Marcher Lords to wage private war the King tested this right in this case: he first called them before a court of their Marcher peers; then, realising the outcome would be coloured by their likely avoidance of prejudicing one of their greatest rights, they were both called before the superior court, the King&#x27;s own. At this both were imprisoned by the King, both sentenced to having their lands forfeit for life and Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, as the aggressor, was fined 10,000 marks, and the Earl of Hereford 1,000 marks. They were released almost immediately and both of their lands were completely restored to them—however, they had both been taught a very public lesson and their prestige diminished and the King&#x27;s authority shown for all.

== Marriage and succession ==
Gilbert married (1st) Alice de Lusignan, also known as Alice de Valence, daughter of Hugh XI of Lusignan and of the family that succeeded the Marshal family to the title of the Earl of Pembroke in the person of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. They married in 1253 when Gilbert was ten years old. She was of high birth, being a niece of King Henry (Hugh XI was the king&#x27;s half-brother). Gilbert and Alice separated in 1267; allegedly, Alice&#x27;s affections lay with her cousin, Prince Edward. Previous to this, Gilbert and Alice had produced two daughters: 
* Isabel de Clare (10 March 1262 – 1333), after a marriage with Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick having been contemplated, or possibly having taken place and then annulled, married Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley
* Joan de Clare (1264 – after 1302), married (1st) Duncan Macduff, 7th Earl of Fife; (2nd) Gervase Avenel.

After his marriage to Alice de Lusignan was annulled in 1285, Gilbert married (2nd) Joan of Acre, a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife Eleanor of Castile. King Edward sought to bind Clare, and his assets, more closely to the Crown by this means. By the provisions of the marriage contract, their joint possessions and Clare&#x27;s extensive lands could only be inherited by a direct descendant, i.e. close to the Crown, and if the marriage proved childless, the lands would pass to any children Joan may have by further marriage.

On 3 July 1290, the Earl gave a great banquet at Clerkenwell to celebrate his marriage of 30 April 1290 with Joan of Acre (1272 – 23 April 1307) after waiting for the Pope to sanction the marriage. Edward then gave large estates to Gilbert, including one in Malvern. Disputed hunting rights on these led to several armed conflicts with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, that Edward resolved. Gilbert made gifts to the Priory, and also had a &quot;great conflict&quot; about hunting rights and a ditch that he dug, with Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford, that was settled by costly litigation. Gilbert had a similar conflict with Godfrey Giffard, Bishop and Administrator of Worcester Cathedral (and formerly Chancellor of England). Godfrey, who had granted land to the Priory, had jurisdictional disputes about Malvern Priory, resolved by Robert Burnell, the then Chancellor. Thereafter, Gilbert and Joan are said to have taken the Cross and set out for the Holy Land. In September, he signed the Barons&#x27; letter to the Pope, and on 2 November, surrendered to the King his claim to the advowson of the Bishopric of Llandaff.

Gilbert and Joan had one son, Gilbert, and three daughters: Eleanor, Margaret and Elizabeth. 
*Gilbert, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, (1291–1314) succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles, married Maud de Burgh daughter of Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster. He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn. 
*Eleanor de Clare (1292–1337) married (1st) Hugh Despenser the Younger, a favourite of her uncle Edward II. Hugh was executed in 1326, and Eleanor married (2nd) William la Zouche Mortimer. 
*Margaret de Clare (1293–1342) married (1st) Piers Gaveston, a favourite of her uncle Edward II. Piers was executed in 1312, and Margaret later married (2nd) Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester. 
*Elizabeth de Clare (1295–1360) married (1st) in 1308 at Waltham Abbey John de Burgh, (2nd) Theobald of Verdun in 1316, and (3rd) Roger d&#x27;Amory in 1317. Each marriage was brief, each produced one child (a son by the 1st, daughters by the 2nd and 3rd), and each left Elizabeth a widow. When her third and last husband died in 1321/22, Elizabeth was at most 27 years old.

== Death and burial ==
He died at Monmouth Castle on 7 December 1295, and was buried at Tewkesbury Abbey, on the left side of his grandfather Gilbert de Clare. His extensive lands were enjoyed by his surviving wife Joan of Acre until her death in 1307.

<doc id="373697" wikidata="Q1269956" url="?curid=373697" title="User-mode Linux">
<text>User-mode Linux (UML) is a virtualization system for the Linux operating system based on an architectural port of the Linux kernel to its own system call interface, which enables multiple virtual Linux kernel-based operating systems (known as guests) to run as an application within a normal Linux system (known as the host). A Linux kernel compiled for the &quot;um&quot; architecture can then boot as a process under another Linux kernel, entirely in user space, without affecting the host environment&#x27;s configuration or stability.

This method gives the user a way to run many virtual Linux machines on a single piece of hardware, allowing some isolation, typically without changing the configuration or stability of the host environment because each guest is just a regular application running as a process in user space.

== Applications ==

Numerous things become possible through the use of UML. One can run network services from a UML environment and remain totally sequestered from the main Linux system in which the UML environment runs. Administrators can use UML to set up honeypots, which allow one to test the security of one&#x27;s computers or network. UML can serve to test and debug new software without adversely affecting the host system. UML can also be used for teaching and research, providing a realistic Linux networked environment with a high degree of safety.

In UML environments, host and guest kernel versions don&#x27;t need to match, so it is entirely possible to test a &quot;bleeding edge&quot; version of Linux in User-mode on a system running a much older kernel. UML also allows kernel debugging to be performed on one machine, where other kernel debugging tools (such as kgdb) require two machines connected with a null modem cable.

Some web hosting providers offer UML-powered virtual servers for lower prices than true dedicated servers. Each customer has root access on what appears to be their own system, while in reality one physical computer is shared between many people.

libguestfs has supported a UML backend since version 1.24 as an alternative to using QEMU or KVM.

== Integration into the Linux kernel ==
The UML guest application (a Linux binary ELF) was originally available as a patch for some Kernel versions above 2.2.x, and the host with any kernel version above 2.2.x supported it easily in the thread mode (i.e., non-SKAS3).

As of Linux 2.6.0, it is integrated into the main kernel source tree. A method of running a separate kernel address space (SKAS) that does not require host kernel patching has been implemented. This improves performance and security over the old Traced Thread approach, in which processes running in the UML share the same address space from the host&#x27;s point of view, which leads the memory inside the UML to not be protected by the memory management unit. Unlike the current UML using SKAS, buggy or malicious software inside a UML running on a non-SKAS host could be able to read the memory space of other UML processes or even the UML kernel memory.

== Comparison with other technologies ==
User-mode Linux is generally considered to have lower performance than some competing technologies, such as Xen and OpenVZ. Future work in adding support for x86 virtualization to UML may reduce this disadvantage.

Often cited as a strength of Xen (a competing technology) is support for thread-local storage (TLS). This is now also supported in the latest UML kernels. Xen concentrates on virtualizing the whole machine, and thus all systems running on a Xen machine are really virtual machines. In UML, the host machine is not virtualized in any way, and only guest systems are true virtual machines. This allows UML guest direct access to host filesystems and hardware, where it is common to map a host directory (e.g., → ).

== Supported platforms ==

UML was originally designed for the x86 instruction set, but has also been ported to others including IA-64 and PowerPC.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Innholders is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London.

The innholders were originally known as hostellers, but their name had changed by the time it was incorporated under a royal charter in 1514. The company has, over the years, lost its status as an association of traders and businessmen, instead becoming, as have most of the other livery companies, an establishment dedicated primarily to charity.

The Innholders&#x27; Company ranks 32nd in the order of precedence of all the livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Hinc Spes Affulget&quot;, Latin for &quot;Hence Hope Shines Forth&quot;, and it is based at Innholders&#x27; Hall in College Street, between Cannon Street and Upper Thames Street.

<text>The Truce at Bakura is a 1993 &quot;Star Wars&quot; spin-off novel by Kathy Tyers. It takes place immediately after the events depicted in the film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) and before those of the young-reader series &quot;Jedi Prince&quot; (1992–1993).

The book was later adapted as an audiobook, which is read by Anthony Heald. Galoob released models of ships and characters from the novel as part of its Micro Machines line.

==Plot summary==
While recovering from their victory against the Empire at Endor, the Rebel Alliance intercepts an Imperial probe containing a distress call for the Emperor. The message details a lizardlike race of aliens invading the Outer Rim planet Bakura. With Palpatine dead and the Imperial Navy scattered, Luke Skywalker volunteers to lead a force to intercept the alien invasion and save Bakura.

Upon arrival, the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s force has no choice but to ally with the remnants of the Imperial garrison to repel an invasion by the reptilian Ssi-Ruuk race under the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, which seeks to establish a beachhead in the larger galaxy. The Ssi-Ruuk seek to harvest a supply of life forms, whose life energies power their advanced technology through a process known as &quot;entechment&quot;. Luke especially intrigues the Ssi-Ruuk, because they believe his Force powers could allow the Ssi-ruuk to &quot;entech&quot; beings from a distance. Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to Luke and alerts him to the danger of the Ssi-Ruuk if they get into the greater galaxy with this technology. The Ssi-ruuk themselves cannot sense the Force, but they know of it through a captured human, Dev Sibwarra, who is Force-sensitive but untrained (his mother was killed by the Ssi-ruuk) and has been brainwashed into furthering the Ssi-ruuvi agenda.

On a personal level, Luke finds himself consistently distracted by one of Bakura&#x27;s senators, Gaeriel Captison, and by the nascent attraction forming between them, despite her religious objections to the Jedi Order. Princess Leia and Han Solo also struggle to find some time together and hash out their newly formed relationship. Leia, putting diplomatic feelers out into a world that &#x27;joined&#x27; the Empire only three years before, discovers that Bakura chafes under Imperial rule—as do some of the Imperials, notably ranking officer Commander Pter Thanas—though Imperial governor Wilek Nereus is too crafty to let dissension spread too far. Finally, Leia must find a way to cope with the revelation given to her on Endor—that Darth Vader is actually her father, Anakin Skywalker—when she is visited by his spirit, who begs for her forgiveness.

In the end, Nereus attempts to turn Luke over to the Ssi-ruuk in exchange for their retreat, but though the kidnapping succeeds, Luke manages to fight them off and escape. He is also able to free Dev of his brainwashing and decides to take him on as an apprentice, but Dev is injured during the escape and later dies of his wounds. The joint Rebel-Imperial force turns back the Ssi-ruuk, and during the chaos, Bakuran resistance cells overthrow Nereus; in his absence, Bakura decides to join the Rebel Alliance. Commander Thanas defects as well, although he first destroys the Rebel cruiser-carrier &quot;Flurry&quot;. New Republic Intelligence later referred to the battle as the &quot;Bakura Incident&quot;, and believed that it would be best if the New Republic attempted to prevent widespread public knowledge of the Ssi-Ruuk, advice that was taken controversially at best. In addition, Luke finally makes his breakthrough with Gaeriel, though he must shortly leave her when the Alliance forces depart at the end of the novel, to continue the ongoing fight against the Empire.

<doc id="373712" wikidata="Q1632863" url="?curid=373712" title="Rhombic antenna">
<text>A rhombic antenna is made of four sections of wire suspended parallel to the ground in a diamond or &quot;rhombus&quot; shape. Each of the four sides is the same length – about a quarter-wavelength to one wavelength per section – converging but not touching at an angle of about 42° at the fed end and at the far end. The length is not critical, typically from one to two wavelengths (λ), but there is an optimum angle for any given length and frequency. A horizontal rhombic antenna radiates horizontally polarized radio waves at a low elevation angle off the pointy ends of the antenna.

If the sections are joined by a resistor at either of the acute (pointy) ends, then the antenna will receive from and transmit to only the direction the end with the resistor points at. Its principal advantages over other types of antenna are its simplicity, high forward gain, wide bandwidth, and the ability to operate over a wide range of frequencies.

== Description ==
A rhombic antenna consists of one to several parallel wires suspended above the ground in a &quot;rhombus&quot; (diamond) shape. Long versions are typically supported by a pole or tower at each vertex to which the wires are attached by insulators. Each of the four sides is the same length. The length is not critical, typically from one to two wavelengths (λ) end-to-end, but for any given length and frequency, there is an optimum acute angle at which the sections should meet.

A horizontal rhombic antenna radiates horizontally polarized radio waves at a low elevation angle off the acute end of the antenna opposite the feedline. Its principal advantages over other types of antenna are its simplicity, high forward gain and wide bandwidth, the ability to operate over a wide range of frequencies.

It is typically fed at one of the two acute (sharper angle) vertices through a balanced transmission line, or alternatively a coaxial cable with a balun transformer. The end of the wires meeting at the opposite vertex is either left open (unconnected), or is terminated with a non-inductive resistor. When resistor-terminated, the radiation pattern is unidirectional, with the main lobe off the terminated end, so this end of the antenna is oriented toward the intended receiving station or region. When unterminated, the rhombic is bidirectional with two opposite lobes off the two acute ends, but is not perfectly bi-directional.
The rhombic antenna can radiate at elevation angles close to the horizon or at higher angles, depending on its height above ground relative to the operating frequency and its physical construction. Likewise, its beamwidth can be narrow or broad, depending primarily on its length. The shallow radiation angle makes it useful for skywave propagation, the longest distance mode for shortwave, in which radio waves directed into the sky at the horizon reflect from layers in the ionosphere and return to Earth far beyond the horizon.

It is possible to improve the low efficiency and gain of unidirectional rhombics by replacing the termination resistor by a low-loss balanced resonant stub transmission line. This reflects the power that would have been wasted in the termination resistor back into the antenna with the correct phase to reinforce the excitation from the transmitter. This circuit can increase the radiation efficiency of transmitting antennas to the 70-80% range, at the cost of increased complexity.

==History==

The rhombic antenna was designed in 1931 by Edmond Bruce and Harald Friis, It was mostly commonly used in the high frequency (HF) or shortwave band as a broadband directional antenna.
Prior to World War II, the rhombic was one of the most popular point-to-point high frequency antenna arrays. After World War II the rhombic largely fell out of favor for shortwave broadcast and point-to-point communications work, being replaced by log periodic antennas and curtain arrays. Larger log periodics provide wider frequency coverage with comparable gain to rhombics. Distributed feed curtains or HRS curtain arrays provided a cleaner pattern, ability to steer the pattern in elevation and azimuth, much higher efficiency, and significantly higher gain in less space. However, rhombic antennas are used in cases where the combination of high forward gain (despite the losses described above) and large operating bandwidth cannot be achieved by other means, or where a directional antenna is needed, but construction and installation costs must be kept low.

In addition to its use as a simple and effective transmitting antenna (as described above), the rhombic can also be used as an HF receiving antenna with good gain and directivity. For example, BBC Monitoring&#x27;s Crowsley Park receiving station has three rhombic antennas aligned for reception at azimuths of 37, 57 and 77 degrees.

==Advantages and disadvantages ==
The rhombics&#x27; low cost, simplicity, reliability, and ease of construction sometimes outweighs performance advantages offered by other more complex arrays.

Advantages
* Rhombics&#x27; input impedance &amp; radiation pattern are relatively constant over a 2:1 range of frequencies. Their impedance can be made relatively constant over a frequency range 4:1 or more, with the forward gain increasing at 6 dB per octave.
* Multiple rhombic antennas can be connected in an end-to-end fashion to form MUSA (Multiple Unit Steerable Antenna). MUSA arrays can receive long distance, short wave, horizontally polarized downcoming waves.
* The rhombic remains one of the least complex medium-gain options for sustained long distance communications over point-to-point circuits.
* Rhombics also handle considerable transmitter power, since they have essentially uniform voltage and current distribution.

Disadvantages
* A rhombic requires a large area of land – especially if several antennas are installed to serve a variety of geographic regions at different distances or directions or to cover widely different frequencies.
* The rhombic suffers from efficiency problems due to earth losses below the antenna, significant power-wasting spurious lobes, termination losses, and the inability to maintain constant current along the length of the conductors. Typical radiation efficiency is in the order of 40–50%.
* The low efficiency significantly reduces gain for a given main lobe beamwidth when compared to other arrays of the same beamwidth.

<doc id="373717" wikidata="Q614749" url="?curid=373717" title="Richard Wollheim">
<text>Richard Arthur Wollheim (5 May 1923 − 4 November 2003) was a British philosopher noted for original work on mind and emotions, especially as related to the visual arts, specifically, painting. Wollheim served as the president of the British Society of Aesthetics from 1992 onwards until his death in 2003.

He was born and died in London.

==Biography==
Richard Wollheim was the son of Eric Wollheim, a theatre impresario, and Constance (Connie) Mary Baker, an actress who used the stage name Constance Luttrell. He attended Westminster School, London, and Balliol College, Oxford (1941–2, 1945–8), interrupted by active military service in World War II. He obtained two first class BA degrees, one in History in 1946, the other in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1949. The same year, he began teaching at University College London, where he became Grote Professor of Mind and Logic and Department Head from 1963 to 1982.

He retired from that position to take up a professorship at Columbia University (1982–85). He then taught at the University of California at Berkeley (1985–2002). He chaired the Department at UC Berkeley, 1998–2002. Between 1989 and 1996 he split his time between Berkeley and the University of California, Davis, where he was Professor of Philosophy and the Humanities. Additionally, he held visiting positions at Harvard University, the University of Minnesota, Graduate Center, CUNY and elsewhere.

He was elected as a fellow of the British Academy in 1972 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986.

Wollheim gave several distinguished lecture series. He delivered the William James Lectures at Harvard in 1982, published as &quot;The Thread of Life&quot; (1984) and the Ernst Cassirer Lectures at Yale in 1991, upon which were based his &quot;On the Emotions&quot; (1999). He also gave the Andrew W. Mellon lectures in Fine Arts at the National Gallery of Art in 1984 which, with much elaboration, became his &quot;Painting as an Art&quot; (1987).

In 1962, Wollheim published an article &quot;A paradox in the theory of democracy&quot;, in which he argued that a supporter of democracy faces a contradiction when he votes. On the one hand he wants a particular party or candidate to win, but on the other hand he wants whoever wins the most votes to win. This has become known as Wollheim&#x27;s paradox.

His &quot;Art and its Objects&quot; (1968) had a significant impact upon both aesthetics and the philosophy of art.

In a 1965 essay, &#x27;Minimal Art&#x27;, he coined the term Minimalism.

As well as for his work on the philosophy of art, Wollheim was known for his philosophical treatments of depth psychology, especially that of Sigmund Freud, to whose work he had been introduced by his father.

Wollheim was an honorary affiliate of the British Psychoanalytical Society, to whom he gave an Ernest Jones lecture in 1968 and in 1991 he was given an award for his services to psychoanalysis by the International Psychoanalytical Association.

His posthumously-published &quot;Germs: A Memoir of Childhood&quot;, with complementary essays, discloses a good deal about his family background and his life up to early manhood, providing valuable material for understanding his interests and sensibility.

==Personal life==
Wollheim married Anne Barbara Denise (1920–2004), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel George Powell, of the Grenadier Guards, after her divorce from her first husband, the literary critic Philip Toynbee. They had twin sons, Bruno and Rupert. Their marriage was dissolved in 1967. Wollheim married Mary Day Lanier, stepdaughter of Dwight Macdonald, in 1969; their daughter is Emilia.

<text>This is a list of professorships at the [[University of Cambridge]].

During the early history of the University of Cambridge, the title professor simply denoted a doctor who taught in the university, a usage that continues to be found in, for example, US universities. However, from the 16th century onwards in Cambridge it was used to denote those holding &quot;chairs&quot; that had been founded by the university in a particular subject or endowed by a benefaction.

The university historically has made no formal distinction between established (or statutory) chairs and personal (or titular) chairs: all professorships are university offices formally established by a vote, and listed together as one class in the statutes. In practice, professorships can be established for a limited period of time or for a single tenure only, expiring after the first incumbent vacates office. It is common for permanent professorships to have originally been established for a single tenure, before being made permanent at a later date. This article only lists professorships which have had more than one incumbent, or which are not limited in duration.

The Regius Professorships are &quot;royal&quot; professorships, being created by the reigning monarch. The first five Regius Professorships, sometimes referred to as the Henrician Regius Professors, were granted arms and crests in 1590.

<doc id="373733" wikidata="Q315338" url="?curid=373733" title="V. P. Singh">
<text>Vishwanath Pratap Singh (25 June 1931 – 27 November 2008) was an Indian politician who served as the prime minister of India from 1989 to 1990 and the Raja Bahadur of Manda. 

He was educated at Allahabad University and Fergusson College in Pune. In 1969, he joined the Indian National Congress party and was elected as a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. 

In the Rajiv Gandhi ministry, Singh was given various cabinet posts, including Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence. Singh was also the Leader of the Rajya Sabha from 1984 to 1987. During his tenure as Minister of Defence, the Bofors scandal came to light, and Singh resigned from the ministry. In 1988, he formed the Janata Dal party by merging various factions of the Janata Party. In the 1989 elections, the National Front, with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), formed the government and Singh became the prime minister.

During his tenure as prime minister, he implemented the Mandal Commission report for India&#x27;s backward castes, which led to major protests against the act. He also created the Sixty-second Amendment and enacted the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act in 1989. In 1990 the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus happened from the valley of Kashmir. Following his opposition to the Ram Rath Yatra, the BJP withdrew its support for the National Front, and his government lost the vote of no-confidence. Singh resigned on 7 November 1990. His prime ministerial tenure lasted for 343 days.

Singh was the prime ministerial candidate for the National Front in the 1991 elections, but was defeated. He turned down prime ministership after the 1996 Indian general election even through he was the first choice and relinquished the prime ministership to H. D. Deve Gowda. He spoke out against the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. After 1996, Singh retired from political posts, but continued to remain a public figure and political critic. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1998, and ceased public appearances until the cancer went into remission in 2003. He died from complications of multiple myeloma and kidney failure in 2008. He was buried with full state honours.

==Early life and education==
Singh was born on 25 June 1931, the third child of the Hindu Rajput &quot;Zamindar&quot; family of Daiya, which is located on the banks of the Belan River in the Allahabad district. He was adopted by Raja Bahadur Ram Gopal Singh of Manda and became the heir-apparent. He became the Raja Bahadur of Manda at the age of 10 in 1941. His ancestors were rulers of the predecessor state of Manikpur, founded in 1180 by Raja Manik Chand, brother of Raja Jai Chand of Kannauj. His family belonged to the Gaharwal clan of the Manda Zamindar.

He obtained his education from Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, and got his Bachelor of Arts and Law degree from Allahabad University. He was elected the vice president of Allahabad University Students Union and later received a Bachelor of Science in physics from Fergusson College in the Pune University.

== Early political career ==
Singh was elected from Soraon to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1969 as a member of the Congress Party and became the chief whip for the legislative party. He got elected to the Lok Sabha in 1971 and was appointed a Deputy Minister of Commerce by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1974. He served as the Minister of Commerce in 1976–77.

=== Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh ===
He was appointed as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1980 when Indira Gandhi was re-elected after the Janata interlude. As Chief Minister (1980–82), he cracked down hard on dacoity, a problem that was particularly severe in the rural districts of the southwest Uttar Pradesh. He received much favourable national publicity when he offered to resign following a self-professed failure to stamp out the problem, and again when he personally oversaw the surrender of some of the most feared dacoits of the area in 1983. The Behmai massacre provoked outrage across the country thereby causing V. P. Singh to resign in the wake of the killings. as he was the under whom Phoolan Devi surrendered as he saved her life by instructing the police officers to not kill her in the Police encounter to secure the votes of Dalits (though Phoolan&#x27;s 22 gang members were killed). Singh was an upper caste man and had ruled the vote bank of upper-caste people in Uttar Pradesh for the Indian National Congress. He resumed his post as Minister of Commerce in 1983.

=== Leader of Rajya Sabha ===
After he resigned from the position of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he was appointed as the leader of Rajya Sabha in the year 1984 and remained so until 1987. Before him the position was assigned to Pranab Mukherjee, who was removed because he then formed his own party, Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress. After Singh&#x27;s tenure this position was given to N. D. Tiwari. He resigned from Rajya Sabha when he left Congress in 1987.

=== Member of Lok Sabha ===
He was elected to Lok Sabha in 1971 from Phulpur. He lost from Allahabad in 1977, but won in 1980 as member of Indira Congress. He resigned from Lok Sabha when he became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in June 1980. After he resigned from Congress and quit as Rajya Sabha member in 1987, he entered Lok Sabha by winning the bye-poll for Allahabad seat vacated by Amitabh Bachchan. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Fatehpur in 1989 and became Prime Minister for 11 months. He was elected from Fatehpur again in 1991, the last time he contested any election.

== Administerial skill ==
He was considered very close to Rajiv Gandhi as well as Indira Gandhi and was loyal to them at a time when the experienced leaders of Congress Party founded a new party, Indian National Congress (Organisation), and empowered the party of Indian National Congress (Requisition). Singh was known as &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; because of his impeccable history and also because of his opposition for the corruption in Bofors deal, which lead the way for him to contest his own party to fight the 1989 Lok Sabha Election and become Prime Minister of India. Singh was responsible for managing the coalition of the Left parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against Rajiv Gandhi to dethrone him in the 1989 elections. He is remembered for the important role that he played in 1989 that changed the course of Indian politics. Singh acted boldly by issuing an arrest warrant against L. K. Advani midway through the latter&#x27;s Rath Yatra.

==Ministries under Central Government==
Singh has been on the list as one of the senior-most and most powerful leaders of the Indian National Congress and has held many important ministry positions such as Defence, External Affairs and Finance.

=== Minister of Finance (1984–1987) ===
He was called to New Delhi following Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s mandate in the 1984 general election. Singh was appointed to the post of Finance Minister in the tenth Cabinet of India, where he oversaw the gradual relaxation of the License Raj (governmental regulation) as Gandhi had in mind. During his term as Finance Minister, he oversaw the reduction of gold smuggling by reducing gold taxes and giving the police a portion of the confiscated gold. He also gave extraordinary powers to the Enforcement Directorate of the Finance Ministry, the wing of the ministry charged with tracking down tax evaders, then headed by Bhure Lal. Singh&#x27;s efforts to reduce government regulation of business and to prosecute tax fraud attracted widespread praise.

Following a number of high-profile raids on suspected evaders  including Dhirubhai Ambani and Amitabh Bachchan – Gandhi was forced to sack him as Finance Minister, possibly because many of the raids were conducted on industrialists who had supported the Congress financially in the past. However, Singh&#x27;s popularity was at such a pitch that only a sideways move seemed to have been possible, to the Defence Ministry (in January 1987). Then he succeeded his position to Rajiv Gandhi.

=== Minister of Defence (1987) ===
In the year 1987, Singh was appointed on the position of Defence Minister of India for the first time but only for a period less than 3 months from 24 January 1987 to 12 April 1987. He was at that time preceded by Rajiv Gandhi and succeeded in his position by Krishna Chandra Pant. At that time due to his non-corrupt image, he was also called &#x27;Mr. Clean&#x27;. He was not able to do any good work for Defence due to holding the position for such a short time. But his biggest work was in the import of Bofors. Once ensconced in South Block, Singh began to investigate the notoriously murky world of defence procurement. After a while, word began to spread that Singh possessed information about the Bofors defence deal (the infamous arms-procurement fraud) that could damage Gandhi&#x27;s reputation. Before he could act on it, he was dismissed from the Cabinet and, in response, resigned his memberships in the Congress Party (Indira) and the Lok Sabha. The deal of Bofors also played a very crucial role in making of his Prime Minister of India.

=== Minister of External Affairs (1989) ===
He was appointed as the 16th Minister of External Affairs of India and remained in the position for another very short period of just 3 days from 2 December 1989 to 5 December 1989. He was succeeded by Inder Kumar Gujral for the position.

==Formation of Janata Dal==

Together with associates Arun Nehru and Arif Mohammad Khan, Singh floated an opposition party named Jan Morcha. He was re-elected to Lok Sabha in a tightly contested by-election from Allahabad, defeating Sunil Shastri. On 11 October 1988, the birthday of the original Janata coalition&#x27;s leader Jayaprakash Narayan, Singh founded the Janata Dal by the merger of Jan Morcha, Janata Party, Lok Dal and Congress (S), in order to bring together all the centrist parties opposed to the Rajiv Gandhi government, and Singh was elected the President of the Janata Dal. An opposition coalition of the Janata Dal with regional parties including the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telugu Desam Party, and Asom Gana Parishad, came into being, called the National Front, with V. P. Singh as convener, NT Rama Rao as president, and P Upendra as a General Secretary.

The National Front fought 1989 General Elections after coming to an electoral understanding with Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left parties (the two main oppositions) that served to unify the anti-Congress vote. The National Front, with its allies, earned a simple majority in the Lok Sabha and decided to form a government. The Bharatiya Janta Party under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the Left parties such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India declined to serve in the government, preferring to support the government from outside.

In a meeting in the Central Hall of Parliament on 1 December, Singh proposed the name of Devi Lal as Prime Minister, in spite of the fact that he himself had been clearly projected by the anti-Congress forces as the &#x27;clean&#x27; alternative to Rajiv Gandhi and their Prime Ministerial candidate. Chaudhary Devi Lal, a Jat leader from Haryana stood up and refused the nomination, and said that he would prefer to be an &#x27;elder uncle&#x27; to the Government and that Singh should be Prime Minister. This last part came as a clear surprise to Chandra Shekhar, the former head of the erstwhile Janata Party, and Singh&#x27;s greatest rival within the Janata Dal. Shekhar, who had clearly expected that an agreement had been forged with Lal as the consensus candidate, withdrew from the meeting and refused to serve in the Cabinet.

Singh was sworn in as India&#x27;s Prime Minister on 2 December 1989.

==Prime Minister (1989–1990)==
Singh held office for slightly less than a year, from 2 December 1989 to 10 November 1990. After state legislative elections in March 1990, Singh&#x27;s governing coalition achieved control of both houses of India&#x27;s parliament. During this time, Janata Dal came to power in five Indian states under Om Prakash Chautala (Banarsi Das Gupta, Hukam Singh), Chimanbhai Patel, Biju Patnaik, Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Mulayam Singh Yadav, and the National Front constituents in two more NT Rama Rao, and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. The Janata Dal also shared power in West Bengal under Jyoti Basu, in Kerala under EK Nayanar and in Rajasthan under Bhairon Singh Shekhawat (supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party government from outside). Singh decided to end the Indian army&#x27;s unsuccessful operation in Sri Lanka which Rajiv Gandhi, his predecessor, had sent to combat the Tamil separatist movement.

In Punjab, Singh replaced the hard-line Siddhartha Shankar Ray as Governor with another former bureaucrat, Nirmal Kumar Mukarji, who moved forward on a timetable for fresh elections. Singh himself made a much-publicised visit to the Golden Temple to ask forgiveness for Operation Blue Star and the combination of events caused the long rebellion in Punjab to die down markedly in a few months.

He also thwarted the efforts of Pakistan under Benazir Bhutto to start a border war with India.

=== Exodus of Kasmiri Hindus ===
V. P. Singh faced his first crisis within few days of taking office, when Kashmiri militants kidnapped the daughter of his Home Minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (then Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir). His government agreed to the demand for releasing militants in exchange; partly to end the storm of criticism that followed, he shortly thereafter appointed Jagmohan Malhotra, a former bureaucrat, as Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Hindus of the Kashmir Valley, were forced to flee the Kashmir valley as a result of being targeted by JKLF and Islamist insurgents during late 1989 and early 1990. Of the approximately 300,000 to 600,000 Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in 1990 only 2,000–3,000 remain there in 2016. 19 January 1990 is widely remembered by Kashmiri Hindus as the tragic &quot;genocide day&quot; of being forced out of Kashmir. Before governor Jagmohan took over and the governor&#x27;s rule was imposed and the army deployed in January 1990, Hindus in the valley, were killed. Of the 2,150 incidents of violence, 2100 attacks were against civilians. The Home Minister at that time Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was blamed for this act and was called it as the support of the Islamic insurgents to establish Islamic state in Jammu and Kashmir (state).

=== 62 Amendment of 1989 and SC-ST Act ===
In the year 1989, the government by Singh implemented the SC-ST Act of 1989 to prevent the atrocities against the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It was enacted when the provisions of the existing laws (such as the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 and Indian Penal Code) were found to be inadequate to check these crimes (defined as &#x27;atrocities&#x27; in the Act). Recognising the continuing gross indignities and offences against Scheduled Castes and Tribes, the Parliament passed the &#x27;Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. The objectives of the Act clearly emphasised the intention of the government to deliver justice to these communities through proactive efforts to enable them to live in society with dignity and self-esteem and without fear or violence or suppression from the dominant castes. The practice of untouchability, in its overt and covert form was made a cognizable and non-compoundable offence, and strict punishment is provided for any such offence. The act was finally passed somehow with controversies.

===Mandal Commission report===
Singh himself wished to move forward nationally on social justice-related issues, which would, in addition, consolidate the caste coalition that supported the Janata Dal in northern India, and accordingly decided to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission which suggested that a fixed quota of all jobs in the public sector be reserved for members of the historically disadvantaged called Other Backward Classes.

This decision led to widespread protests among the upper caste youth in urban areas in northern India. OBC reservation (less creamy layer) was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2008. Culturally unique features of the protests and riots were bandhs (a version of a strike), hartals (a version of a municipal shut-down), dharnas (a version of swarming). Articles also highlighted politicians and victims of rioting during the protests. Although not advisable, late summer travel by airline and vehicle during the protests was possible without delays, between capitals New Delhi and Chandigarh, and Shimla for example. Police prevented extending the range and duration of the strikes, and some strike activity from even occurring. A national state of emergency was largely not declared to mobilize army units against any one demonstration. The strike helped to give large popularity to the Mandal Commission report and fueled the political grouping of the OBC castes, which later helped a lot for the strengthening of regional political parties and stronger parties and other than Congress and BJP. Due to the loss of the votes of the backward caste neither party opposed it and on seeing the protest nor parties declined it.

Even after the passing of the reservations for the Other Backward Class, he was never accepted by them, and his upper-caste voters also didn&#x27;t have to trust him. Afterward, OBC leaders flexed their political power and outnumbered upper and lower castes to gain political power in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The OBC leaders rejected sharing power with lower caste leaders.

===Tug of war with the Reliance group===
In 1990, the government-owned financial institutions like the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the General Insurance Corporation of India stonewalled attempts by the Reliance group to acquire managerial control over Larsen &amp; Toubro. Sensing defeat, the Ambanis resigned from the board of the company. Dhirubhai, who had become Larsen &amp; Toubro&#x27;s chairman in April 1989, had to quit his position to make way for D. N. Ghosh, former chairman of the State Bank of India.
===Ram temple issue and the fall of the coalition===

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party was moving its own agenda forward. In particular, the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation, which served as a rallying cry for several Hindu organisations, took on a new life. The party president, LK Advani, with Pramod Mahajan as aide, toured the northern states on a &quot;rath&quot; – a bus converted to look like a mythical chariot – with the intention of drumming up support. Before he could complete the tour by reaching the disputed site in Ayodhya, he was arrested by Lalu Prasad Yadav&#x27;s orders at Samastipur on the charges of disturbing the peace and fomenting communal tension. Lalu wanted to prevent the communal clashes which took place at different places for this Rath Yatra, and also Bihar faced a similar scenario in 1989 due to the Shilanyas by Rajiv Gandhi Government. Karsevaks reached the site on 30 October 1990, and by the orders of Mulayam Singh Yadav police fired openly upon the Kar sevaks. A deadly riot took place in Ayodhya on 2 November.

This led to the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s suspension of support to the National Front government. VP Singh faced the vote of no confidence in the Lok Sabha saying that he occupied the high moral ground, as he stood for secularism, had saved the Babri Masjid at the cost of power and had upheld the fundamental principles which were challenged during the crises. &quot;What kind of India do you want?&quot; he asked of his opponents in Parliament, before losing the vote 142–346; only a portion of the National Front remaining loyal to him and the Left parties supported him in the vote.

And then, Singh resigned on 7 November 1990.

===Chandra Shekhar government===

Chandra Shekhar immediately seized the moment and left the Janata Dal with several of his own supporters (including Devi Lal, Janeshwar Mishra, HD Deve Gowda, Maneka Gandhi, Ashoke Kumar Sen, Subodh Kant Sahay, Om Prakash Chautala, Hukam Singh, Chimanbhai Patel, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Yashwant Sinha, VC Shukla, and Sanjay Singh) to form the Samajwadi Janata Party/Janata Dal (Socialist). Although Chandra Shekhar had a mere 64 MPs, Rajiv Gandhi the leader of the Opposition, agreed to support him on the floor of the House; so he won a confidence motion and was sworn in as Prime Minister. Eight Janata Dal MPs who voted for this motion were disqualified by the speaker Rabi Ray. His government lasted only a few months before he resigned and called for fresh elections.

==Post-premiership and death==
VP Singh contested the new elections but his party was relegated to the opposition chiefly due to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi (May 1991) during the election campaign, and he later retired from active politics. He spent the next few years touring the country speaking about matters related to issues of social justice and his artistic pursuits, chiefly painting.
In 1992, Singh was the first to propose the name of the future President KR Narayanan as a (eventually successful) candidate for vice president. Later the same year in December, he led his followers to Ayodhya to oppose the Karseva proposed by LK Advani, and was arrested before he could reach the site; the Masjid was demolished by the Karsevaks a few days later. In 1996, the Congress party lost the general elections and Singh was the natural choice of the winning United Front (Singh was one of the forces behind the broad United Front coalition) for the post of Prime Minister. But he declined the offer made to him by communist veteran Jyoti Basu, Bihar strongman Lalu Prasad Yadav and almost all leaders of the Janata family.

In an interview with Shekhar Gupta in July 2005, Singh said that he had resigned from the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet due to differences that arose in the dealing of information regarding commissions taken by Indian agents in the HDW submarine deal, and not due to Bofors. In April 1987, Singh received a secret telegram from J.C.Ajmani, the Indian ambassador in West Germany. The telegram stated that Indian agents had received large commissions in the HDW deal. These commissions amounted to a staggering Rs. 32.55 crore (7% of the agreed price). Singh informed Rajiv Gandhi about this and instituted an inquiry. However, the handling of this case led to differences and Singh finally resigned from the cabinet.

Singh was diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and ceased public appearances. When his cancer went into remission in 2003, he once again became a visible figure, especially in the many groupings that had inherited the space once occupied by his Janata Dal. He relaunched the Jan Morcha in 2006 with actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar as president. After Jan Morcha drew a blank in the 2007 UP elections, Raj Babbar joined the Congress, and Singh&#x27;s elder son Ajeya Singh took over the reins of the party in anticipation of the 2009 General elections. Ajeya Singh then contested as Jan Morcha candidate from Fatehpur, but lost to Rakesh Sachan of the Samajwadi Party. The Jan Morcha was renamed as the National Jan Morcha in June 2009. A month later, the Jan Morcha merged with the Indian National Congress. Singh was placed under arrest in Ghaziabad as he and his supporters were proceeding towards a hauling where prohibitory orders under Section 144 had been imposed to join the farmers agitating against the acquisition of land at Dadri by the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Industries and demanding adequate compensation. Later, Singh and CPI General Secretary AB Bardhan were again arrested on the UP border when they were proceeding to Dadri. However, Singh and Babbar were later able to evade the police, reaching Dadri on 18 August 2006, and ploughing the land in solidarity with the farmers.

Singh died after a very long struggle with multiple myeloma and kidney failure at Apollo Hospital in Delhi on 27 November 2008, aged 77. He was cremated at Allahabad on the banks of the River Ganges on 29 November 2008, his son Ajeya Singh lighting the funeral pyre. He was cremated with full state honour.

== Personal life ==

Singh married Princess Sita Kumari, the daughter of the Raja of Deogarh-Madaria, Rajasthan, on his 24th birthday. It was an arranged marriage and she was 18. Kumari was a Sisodia Rajput descended from Maharana Pratap of Udaipur. The couple had two sons, Ajeya Pratap Singh (born 1957), a chartered accountant in New York City, and Abhay Pratap Singh (born 1958), a doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.

After his death, his elder son Ajeya Singh was sworn as the Raja Bahadur of the Manda estate in 2007 and in 2009, he merged his party Jan Morcha with Indian National Congress.

== Cultural legacy ==

===Painting===

V.P. Singh was also a talented artist. His engagement with the arts began long before his political career and continued when he returned to painting while recuperating from illness. Singh&#x27;s work—primarily sketches, watercolors, and oil paintings—has been exhibited in New Delhi, Mumbai, London, and other cities. In his later years, the themes in his art became more restless and frenzied.

Singh’s artistic career paused during his time in politics but resumed after he left public office. On December 29, 2003, 110 of his paintings were exhibited at Aparna Arts Gallery in Delhi.

His son, Ajeya Singh, showcased his father&#x27;s paintings on May 6, 2015, at Aryan Art Gallery in Delhi. Singh began his artistic journey as an accomplished photographer before progressing to pencil sketches. He later studied under Prof. Sukhvir Sanghal in Allahabad, where he learned wash painting and figurative drawing in the Bengal School style. His works are both impressionist and expressionist in nature, with some surrealist and non-figurative pieces.

===Statue===
A statue of V.P. Singh is situated at Presidency College, Chennai. It was inaugurated by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin in the presence of V.P. Singh&#x27;s wife and Akhilesh Yadav on 27 November 2023.

===Films===
# Juliet Reynolds, an art critic and a close friend of Singh, made a short documentary on him, titled &quot;The Art of the Impossible&quot; (45 minutes long), and covers his political and artistic career.
# Suma Josson made another film on Singh titled &quot;One More Day to Live&quot;.
#Shekhar Gupta had interviewed Singh in 2007, with the episode titled &quot;Walk The Talk with V. P. Singh.&quot;

<text>The Ford Falcon is a full-size car that was manufactured by Ford Australia from 1960 to 2016. From the XA series of 1972 onward, each Falcon and range of derivates have been designed, developed, and built in Australia, following the phasing out of the American-influenced Falcon of 1960 to 1971, which had been re-engineered locally as the XK to XY series for the harsher Australian conditions. The luxury-oriented Ford Fairmont model joined the range from 1965. Luxury long-wheelbase derivative versions called the Ford Fairlane and LTD arrived in 1967 and 1973 respectively with production ending in 2007.

Over 3,000,000 Ford Falcon and its derivatives were made in seven generations to 2016, almost exclusively in Australia and New Zealand, but also South Africa and some RHD Asian markets. Along with its closest rival, the Holden Commodore that was also Australian-made, the Falcon once dominated the fleets of taxis in Australia and New Zealand, as well as police and company fleets.

In its last incarnation as the FG X series, the body style of the Falcon range consisted of sedan and utility body styles. Luxury variants of the current model Falcon, collectively known as the G Series, were marketed as the Ford G6, G6 E, and G6 E Turbo, which replaced the long-standing Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia models. Previously the Falcon range also included a hardtop coupé, panel van and station wagon (respectively up to 1978, 1999 and 2010)., as well as the Futura variant. The Falcon platform had also spawned luxury models such as the Landau coupe and long-wheelbase Fairlane and LTD sedans.

In May 2013, Ford Australia announced the end of local production, which consisted of Falcon and its closely related Territory crossover SUV, by October 2016. This decision was attributable to Ford Motor Company&#x27;s &quot;One Ford&quot; product development plan introduced in 2008 to rationalise its global range. Under this plan, Falcon&#x27;s indirect replacements are the fourth-generation Mondeo from Europe and the sixth-generation Mustang from North America, the latter to retain Ford&#x27;s Australian V8 heritage. The final Ford Falcon, a blue XR6, rolled off the production line on 7 October 2016.

== History ==

During the 1950s, Ford&#x27;s Australian sales were faltering due to the popularity of Holden, which did not have an effective competitor. Ford assembled the British Zephyr and its Consul and Zodiac derivatives. However, while these cars were moderately successful and had a good reputation, Ford could not match Holden&#x27;s price, so sales suffered. One of the reasons for the price difference was the higher cost of imported parts, which were subject to an import tariff. Ford also assembled Canadian-sourced Ford V8 models, but these cars were in a higher price category, putting them out of reach of the average buyer.

Hence, Ford decided to commence local production of a Holden challenger. Initially, they intended to produce the Zephyr, Consul, and Zodiac, using expensive dies they would need to purchase from Ford of Britain. However, during a visit to Ford headquarters in Detroit in 1958, they were shown the new Falcon, which was being prepared for its United States launch. Immediately, the executives were attracted to the new car- it was about the same size as Holden, but it was low, long, wide and modern. The width allowed it to accommodate six people, and a two-speed automatic transmission was available. Besides all this, Ford Australia felt they had more experience building North American cars. Hence, they decided to make Falcon their new Australian car. In 1959, Ford built the Broadmeadows Assembly Plant at Campbellfield, a suburb of Melbourne, for local production of the North American Ford Falcon. The factory was designed in Canada, and had a roof designed for Canadian snow falls, which is needed in Melbourne due to the occurrence of heavy hail falls in the Australian south east and east coast areas. 

== First generation (1960–1966) ==

=== XK ===

The first Falcon sold in Australia was the XK series, introduced in September 1960. It was initially offered only as a four-door sedan, in both Falcon and Falcon Deluxe trim levels. The XK was essentially a right-hand drive version of the North American model, although local country dealers often included modifications such as heavy-duty rear suspension (five leaves) and larger, 6.40 by 13-inch (16 by 33 centimetre), tyres.

The steering was light and the ride surprisingly good, on well-paved roads. The Falcon&#x27;s &quot;king-size&quot; drum brakes actually had less lining area than the Zephyr&#x27;s, but they were stopping a car that was over lighter, and so were adequate. Whereas the North American model used an &quot;economy&quot; 3.10 to 1 rear-axle ratio, the Australian Falcon was built with a 3.56 to 1 ratio, which better complemented the torque characteristics of the engine, yet still allowed a reduction in cruising rpm when compared with the Zephyr.

The station wagon, added to the range in November 1960, lacked the American version&#x27;s extended rear overhang due to concern that the back of the car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.

Billed as being &quot;Australian-with a world of difference&quot;, the Falcon offered the first serious alternative to Holden, and became an instant success. Sales were aided by the contemporary FB-series Holden being perceived as lacklustre and dated by comparison. A 170 in3 engine was introduced late in the model&#x27;s life.

However, before long, XK sales suffered from complaints about the durability on rough outback roads, due chiefly to collapsing front ball joints, and adjusting shims dropping out of the front suspension, both problems inducing some rather severe front camber; the car earned the unflattering nicknames &quot;foul can&quot; or &quot;fault can&quot; during this time.

The XK range was expanded in May 1961 with the addition of utility and panel van body styles, officially designated the Falcon utility and Falcon sedan delivery, respectively.

=== XL ===

Ford Australia introduced some local design changes to the XL in early 1962, such as a heavier suspension system with components from the Fairlane. Also, the appearance was changed with a new Thunderbird roofline. The slogan was &quot;Trim, Taut, Terrific&quot;. Nevertheless, the Falcon was still widely perceived as unsuitable for local conditions and sales stagnated. Ford stuck with the Falcon and sales gradually increased over the following years as improvements to durability and reliability were applied.

New for the XL series were the top-of-the-range Falcon Futura sedan and the Falcon Squire station wagon, the latter featuring simulated woodgrain exterior side and tailgate paneling.
=== XM ===

The XM, released in 1964, was the first Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16 in tie rods instead of the 1/2 in tie rods found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper control arms lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based. A coupé, in a two-door hardtop body style, was offered for the first time in both Falcon Deluxe and Falcon Futura trim levels.
=== XP ===

The XP, released in 1965, saw the Fairmont introduced as an upmarket variant. The XP was the &quot;make or break&quot; Falcon: Ford&#x27;s future in Australia depended on this car succeeding. Ford&#x27;s deputy managing director Bill Bourke conceived a promotion for the new model which was a risk: demonstrate the XP&#x27;s strength by mercilessly driving a fleet of XP Falcons around Ford&#x27;s You-Yangs testing grounds for at over . The gamble paid off with the Falcon winning the &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year Award. A three-speed automatic progressively replaced the two-speed and front disc brakes were introduced as an option (standard on Fairmont and hardtop models).

This model was also the last to include the Squire range of Ford Falcons which featured wood panels on the side of the wagons, similar to the US-based station wagons. The Fairmont made its debut, midway through the model run, as the flagship of the XP Falcon range. It was offered in both sedan and station wagon body styles, replacing the Futura sedan and Squire wagon. Unlike later examples, the XP Fairmonts carried both Falcon and Fairmont badgework.

Additionally in the XP range, several cars were modified by Bill Warner to carry a 260- or 289 in3 V8 and a three-speed automatic or four-speed manual. These cars are discussed as precursors of the GT Falcon which debuted in the next model or as XP Falcon Sprints.
== Second generation (1966–1972) ==
=== XR ===

The next new model Falcon, the XR series, was introduced in September 1966. Styling was based on the third-generation 1966 US Ford Falcon and it was promoted as the &quot;Mustang bred Falcon&quot;. It was the first Australian Falcon to be offered with a V8 engine, the , 289 cubic inch (4.7 litre) Windsor unit. The XR marked the first time a V8 engine could be optioned in all trim levels of an Australian car, V8s having previously been reserved for the more up-market variants. The 144 in3 (2.4 L) six-cylinder engine was deleted for the XR series, leaving the 170 in3 (2.8 L) six as the base Falcon engine. A 200 in3 (3.3 L) six was also available.

The XR series was initially offered in nine different models: Falcon, Falcon 500, and Fairmont sedans, Falcon, Falcon 500, and Fairmont wagons, Falcon and Falcon 500 utilities, and the Falcon Van. The new wagons shared the wheelbase with the XR sedans, unlike the 1966 US Falcon wagons which featured a wheelbase. The Falcon 500 replaced the Falcon Deluxe of the XP series and the two-door hardtop body style available in the XP series was not offered in the XR range. Ford New Zealand, which assembled the Falcon 500 at its Seaview, Lower Hutt, plant near Wellington, introduced a short-lived Falcon 600 model into the XR and subsequent XT ranges, with additional equipment such as a heater standard. The Fairmont and GT models were not locally assembled, but were imported from Australia in limited numbers.

The Falcon XR won the &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year Award in 1966, giving Ford Falcon two consecutive wins.

The marketing focus on the Falcon&#x27;s relationship with the Mustang&#x27;s design appeal led to Ford introducing a Falcon GT variant of the XR in 1967, featuring a version of the 289 in3 (4.7 L) Windsor V8 engine, sourced from the Ford Mustang. The GT marked the beginning of the Australian muscle car. All of the original XR GTs were painted in the colour &quot;GT gold&quot;, except for eight that were &quot;Gallaher Silver&quot; and another five that were &quot;Russet Bronze&quot;, &quot;Sultan Maroon&quot;, &quot;Polar White&quot;, &quot;Avis White&quot; and &quot;Ivy Green&quot;. The non-gold GTs, while having the same specifications, are the rarest of the early Australian muscle cars.

Also specified on the first GT Falcon was a Hurst shifter for the four-speed gearbox, a deep-dish sports steering wheel, sports instrumentation, chrome full-cover wheel trims, and thick &quot;GT stripes&quot; along the lower panels between the front and rear wheels.
=== XT ===

The 1968 XT model featured a mild facelift, with a divided grille, and inset driving lights for the GT. The GT also replaced the thick lower body stripes of the XR with narrow stripes along the waistline from grille to tail light. The tail lights were still round, but instead of the small round indicator of the XR, the XT model had a long indicator across the light. Otherwise, all external body panels and bumpers were the same as the XR.

The XT buyer also could choose a or a six-cylinder engine.

The 289 in3 V8 engine was replaced by a new unit.

The XT series Falcon is not to be confused with the entry-level XT model variant introduced in 2002 with the BA series Falcon.
=== XW ===

The 1969 XW Falcon introduced bolder styling which featured raised ridges down each front guard and a &#x27;buttressed&#x27; c-pillar (although the rear windscreen was not relocated), which made the cars appear larger than the XR/XT models. A new dashboard and trim variations also appeared. Factory-fitted fully integrated air conditioning was made available as an option for the first time.

The GT variant gained a bigger V8, the Canadian-made Windsor engine, producing equipped with dual exhausts and sports air cleaner. The styling of the GT went wilder with the addition of an offset racing-style bonnet scoop, bonnet locks, and blackouts, as well as &#x27;Super Roo&#x27; stripes along the full length of the car (these and the bonnet blackouts were a &#x27;delete option&#x27;). GT wheels were now 12-slot steel with flat centre caps over the lug nuts and stainless steel dress rims. The twin &#x27;driving lights&#x27; introduced on the XT GT were carried over to the XW GT.

In August 1969, the XW also introduced the GT-HO specification. The GT-HO was a homologation specially built for racing. Externally, it was almost indistinguishable from a standard GT, but offered a higher-performance engine and improved suspension— although the &#x27;HO&#x27; stood for &#x27;Handling Option&#x27;, the cars also gained larger Holley carburettors and other performance additions. The Phase I or &#x27;Windsor HO&#x27; was fitted with the 351 in3 Windsor V8, but was replaced a year later with the 351 Cleveland, producing in the Phase II GT-HO. Phase II GT-HO wheels featured a new five-slot design.

The XW also gained a GS (&#x27;Grand Sport&#x27;) option, which could be optioned with the , six-cylinder, or Windsor V8 engines, but not the Windsor V8 on Falcon 500, Futura, and Fairmont. It offered the same dash as the GT with sports instruments, sport wheel trims, and stripes. The GS lasted until the 1978 XC series I model, longer than the GT, which finished with the XB.

=== XY ===

The venerated XY was released in October 1970, with variations to grille and tail lights but otherwise unchanged bodywork from the XW. The six-cylinder motors were bigger— and . A two-barrel (2V) carbureted) version of the 351 Cleveland V8 was an option on all sedans. and this is especially true of the XY GT and XY GTHO Phase III, released in 1970.

The GT&#x27;s styling went wilder again with a &#x27;Shaker&#x27; cold-air induction scoop protruding from a hole in the bonnet, which now sported twin wide GT stripes from grille to windscreen, rather than the bonnet blackouts of the XW. The thick side stripes remained, although altered slightly, as did the twin driving lights and blacked-out panel between the tail lights. Wheels were now the five-slot steel items first seen on the XW Phase II GT-HO. The Phase III GT-HO also sported a plastic front spoiler and a wild bootlid spoiler styled after those fitted to the Mach series Mustangs.

The upgraded Cleveland V8 in the 1971 XY (dizzy in the front) GTHO Phase III produced an estimated , although Fords official figures for this motor were much lower. The 750 cfm Holley carburettor of the XW GT-HO Phase II was replaced by a 780 cfm Holley, along with numerous other performance modifications. The Phase III was Australia&#x27;s fastest four-door production car and possibly the fastest four-door sedan in the world at the time, with a top speed of 141.5 mph (227.7 km/h). Power figures are still debated today, as Ford still claimed as the standard 351 Cleveland V8 in the GT though the GTHO Phase III received many modifications to increase its reliability and race performance. In 1972, Ford made the 15 in Globe &#x27;Bathurst&#x27; alloy wheels available as an upgrade to the GTHO Phase III.

During the life of the XY model, the uniquely Australian uprated 200, 250-1V and 250-2V variants of the seven-main-bearing six cylinder were introduced. Cleveland V8s were imported initially, until the Geelong Foundry began to produce these motors for automatic Falcons in mid-1972. The transmissions included both Ford and Borg-Warner, as did rear axles. The XY is now widely regarded as the best Falcon made in Australia, not just with its Bathurst dominance, but also in its performance, build quality, and refinement, which was superior to competitors at the time. Current values for XYs compared to other Aussie Falcons, and their competitors, attest to this.

Australia&#x27;s first production four-wheel-drive car-based vehicle—a utility—was introduced by Ford as an XY model in November 1972. All were fitted with the 250 in3 six that was mounted on a 30° slant to provide front axle suspension clearance between the front differential and the sump.

== Third generation (1972–1979) ==
=== XA ===

The end of production of the Falcon in the US paved the way for much greater Australian input in the design of Australian-made Falcons, from 1972 onwards, although for several years a distinct resemblance to the US-made Mustang still existed, in part to the styling and design cues by Jack Telnack who designed the XA Falcon. The XA series introduced a new hardtop coupe model, with a distinctive range of paint colours; with purple and wild plum being popular, often ordered with white or black upholstery. The XA Falcon Hardtop bore a strong resemblance to the 1970–71 Ford Torino SportsRoof (both cars shared the same floor sheet metal), and shared its &quot;frameless window&quot; doors with the utility and panel van variants. The drivetrains carried over from the XY, although the 250-2V was soon dropped, and the &#x27;full-house&#x27; GT-HO engines no longer required due to changes in production racing regulations. Ford had planned a &#x27;Phase IV&#x27; GT-HO (and built four), but cancelled it in the wake of the so-called &#x27;Supercar scare&#x27;.The GT variant kept the twin driving lights, but reverted to a bonnet blackout with no stripes at all on the vehicle. The front guards received fake &#x27;vents&#x27; just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe &#x27;Bathurst&#x27; wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT&#x27;s rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other performance parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. 

From the rear, XA hardtops can be distinguished from later models by the tail lights, which have lenses which slope inwards (towards the front of the vehicle).

=== XB ===
In 1973, the XB Falcon (sold with the slogan &quot;The Great Australian Road Car&quot;) was introduced with more aggressive styling, a multifunction control stalk (indicators, high beam, horn), new colours including colour-coded bumpers on the GT variants, and minor trim variations. Engine options carried over from the XA-series. New panel van and utility option packages, &quot;Surferoo&quot; and &quot;Surfsider&quot; vans, and &quot;Overnighter&quot; ute, were introduced.

Power-assisted front disc brakes were now standard across the Falcon range. The GT variant of the XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland V8 engine known as the &#x27;big port&#x27;, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with &#x27;small port&#x27; heads and a 4-barrel 605 CFM downdraught Autolite 4300 carburetor, rated at @ 5400 rpm and @ 3400 rpm of torque. The twin driving lights remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the &quot;power bulge&quot; on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).

This classic car is world-renowned for its starring roles in the movies &quot;Mad Max&quot; and &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (&quot;The Road Warrior&quot;), both starring Mel Gibson. In &quot;Mad Max&quot;, the police use yellow XA and XB sedans, and Max later drives a customised black XB hardtop known as the Pursuit Special, or black-on-black due to its matte black over gloss black paint scheme. In &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (&quot;The Road Warrior&quot;) it was referred to as the &quot;Last of the V8 Interceptors&quot;. It is often referred to as Max&#x27;s Interceptor, but all the MFP cars badged &quot;Interceptor&quot; were four-door sedans, including the one Max drove during the Night Rider chase.

The Ford Landau, a two-door &quot;personal coupé&quot; based on the XB Falcon Hardtop was released in August 1973.

=== XC ===
In July 1976, Ford introduced the XC Falcon, which was the first model to comply with the new pollution regulations specified under Australian Design Rule 27A. This led to locally produced Cleveland V8s and the introduction of the cross-flow (also called the X-flow) six-cylinder. Versions of this engine were produced in North America and, in various guises, used in Australian Falcons through to the XF. Its long stroke and large capacity made for very good &#x27;towing&#x27; torque, while its thick castings and relatively loose tolerances gave it a reputation for reliability in spite of abuse.

The XC also introduced the country&#x27;s first locally produced family sedans with a suspension designed around radial-ply tyres. Known as &quot;Touring Suspension&quot; (or &#x27;Sports Handling Suspension&#x27;), it initially was standard on the Fairmont GXL sedan (optional on other sedans) until it was made standard equipment on all sedans and hardtops in the 1978 &#x27;XC½&#x27; facelift. For better handling on station wagons, owners could order the stiffer heavy duty suspension package as a no-cost option.

Other changes included a totally different dashboard layout to the XA/XB series, new rear doors with a lower sill cut, air extraction vents in the rear of the C-pillars, and very large bumpers front and rear with no additional valance panel under them.

From behind, XC hardtops can be distinguished from earlier models by the tail lights, which have flat lenses with black bezels.The Falcon Sundowner Van, based on the Falcon 500 Van, was introduced in 1977. It included options from the Falcon GS Hardtop, such as comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, slotted sports road wheels, and driving lights, but with bodyside protection mouldings and van side glass deleted. Side and rear decals were included in the package, as was the &quot;sedan ride&quot; 500 kg (10-cwt) suspension package and ER70 H14 radial-ply tyres.

In 1978, inspired by a dominating 1–2 finish for Falcon hardtops at the 1977 Hardie Ferodo 1000, Ford introduced the limited-edition Cobra, which used the last 400 hardtop coupé bodyshells. Based on the Falcon GS Hardtop model, each Cobra was individually numbered and featured highlights such as Globe 15-in alloy road wheels copied from Ferrari intended to aid brake disc cooling, ER70 H15 radial-ply tyres, comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, driving lights, dual exhaust, four-wheel disc brakes, and a distinctive white and blue colour scheme. The 5.8 L engines were installed in cars numbered 002 to 199 and No 351, and the 4.9 L engines were installed in the rest (001, plus 200 to 400 except for no. 351).

The Falcon, while popular, was usually outsold in Australia by GM Holden&#x27;s Kingswood until 1978, when it started to gain ground after Holden decided to replace the Kingswood with a smaller model called the Commodore, based on the European Opel models.

Holden gambled that the predicted increase of oil prices during this era would drive consumers to choose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, but the oil price rise never materialised, whilst Ford dealers aggressively pitched the Cortina 6 against the Commodore alternative until the XD Falcon arrived in 1979.
== Fourth generation (1979–1999) ==
=== XD ===
Ford&#x27;s next model Falcon, the XD (Project Blackwood), introduced in 1979, bore many external styling resemblances to the European Ford Granada, but was slightly larger and less luxurious. Improved body reinforcing allowed many reductions in component weight to be made, improving performance and braking. The Fairmont Ghia replaced the Fairmont GXL.

Initially, as with the first Commodores, quality and fuel consumption concerns dogged the XD. The 1980 introduction of the alloy head improved the fuel economy of the ageing OHV six-cylinder engine, an engine with its roots in the 1950s, while at the same time boosting power in the high-compression 4.1 L version from . However, during this period, a combination of government pressure, the fuel crisis, and more stringent pollution controls began to curtail the development of high-performance cars.

Along with Ford&#x27;s consideration to delete the V8 engine, Ford had also considered replacing the Falcon with a smaller front-wheel drive sedan and hatchback, codenamed &quot;Capricorn&quot;. By 1981, however, thanks to the Falcon&#x27;s sales success, the replacement project was cancelled.

=== XE ===
As the fuel crisis eased, Australians moved away from the downsized Commodore back to the traditional full-size Falcon. In 1982, for the first time in more than a decade, the XE Falcon, with its Watt&#x27;s linkage coil-sprung rear suspension and fuel-saving differential ratios (4.1 L models) eclipsed its Holden rival in terms of sales. Ford Falcon remained number-one seller in Australia until 1988, when Holden returned to the full-size Australian sedan design. A manual transmission was available in three-speed column shift (in six-seater vehicles) or four-speed floor shift, with a five-speed floor shift also available with the base 3.3 L engine. An automatic transmission was available as a three-speed, column or floor shift.

Ford&#x27;s Australian-manufactured &#x27;Cleveland&#x27; V8s were discontinued in 1982. During this period, Ford Australia also built a quantity of four-bolt 351C engines—similar to those used in NASCAR at the time—for race purposes in Australia. With the 351&#x27;s local race career ending in 1985, the remains were shipped and sold in the United States.

The last V8-powered Australian Ford Falcon passenger car (until this powerplant&#x27;s return in 1991) was a silver 4.9-l (302 in3) Ford XE Fairmont Ghia ESP sedan, VIN # JG32AR33633K, in November 1982. Ford Australia continued to make remnant stock of the 5.8 litre (351C) engine available in Bronco and F-series vehicles until August 1985.

In 1983, the 4.1 L EFI six-cylinder engine was introduced to replace the 4.9 L V8, but initially produced and of torque, well down from the and previously produced by the 5.8 L V8.

=== XF ===

The Falcon XF sedan and wagon sold between October 1984 and March 1988 (modified to run on unleaded petrol from January 1986), with the ute and van running through to March 1993. The handling and ride were described as competent, but the non-powered steering was heavy at low speeds with an overly strong caster action after performing a maneuver such as a U-turn. Power steering (and four-wheel disc brakes) were made standard in 1986. It remains Ford&#x27;s best-selling Falcon model to date; over 278,000 XFs were built. It was the first model since the XP not to offer a V8 engine.
=== XG ===

When the XF Falcon passenger car range was replaced by the redesigned EA series, the XF commercials (utility and panel van) continued unchanged due to there being no EA series versions. The XF commercial models continued unchanged stylistically, but over time would gain the EB series engine updates.

The XG, released in March 1993, represented the most significant update to the Falcon commercials in five years. Aside from a new name—the ute was referred to as the &#x27;Falcon Longreach&#x27;—the XG got a new engine, an exterior facelift, and lost the three-speed (or three-on-the-tree) column-shift manual transmission (and the three-speed column-auto ) but now with a five-speed manual on the floor. Ford Australia added the Longreach name for its tough &quot;workhorse&quot; image, as the birthplace of Qantas and the home of the famous Australian Stockman&#x27;s Hall of Fame on the boundaries of the outback. The model was introduced to the media in Longreach.

The XG was essentially an update of the XF. It gained the EB II&#x27;s 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, with either a five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF&#x27;s) EB style door &#x27;rubbing&#x27; strips, and indicator lights on the front quarter panels.

An XR6 model was released in October 1993. Over the standard model, it gained the ED&#x27;s XR6 engine, distinctive quad headlights, indicators in the front bumper (due to the different headlights), sportier suspension, ED XR6 seats, trim, 15 in five-spoke alloy wheels, and exterior badging. 1,050 XR6s were sold between October 1993 and March 1996.

=== XH ===


The XH series Falcon utility and van, released in 1996, were essentially XG models facelifted to resemble the contemporary Falcon EF sedans and wagons. The XH also gained an all-new front suspension and rack and pinion steering from the EA–EL series cars. This meant changes to the frame and bodywork, from the firewall forward. The turret (roof) panel on the utility was now domed and lost its squared-off appearance, increasing interior head room. By this time, the popularity of the panel van had faded and Ford released their final Falcon panel van in 1997 as part of the revised XH II series. It was also with this model that the V8 engine was reintroduced into the Falcon utility commercial vehicle range. After 20 years, the fourth generation Falcon was discontinued in June 1999.
== Fifth generation (1988–1998) ==
=== EA ===
As a result of an A$700 million development the Ford EA Falcon introduced in 1988, bore a passing resemblance to the European Ford Scorpio. Under the skin, however, it remained an entirely Australian design, and is credited as the first Falcon model to employ wind tunnel testing. The EA was also only produced in sedan and station wagon body styles, with the previous-model (XF) utility and panel van continuing in production.

The EA Falcon was available in four trim levels with a choice of three straight-six engine: the base GL powered by a 3.2 litre CFI (although the majority featured a 3.9 L version of the same engine); the luxury Fairmont powered by a 3.9 litre CFI; the sports Falcon S pack and upper luxury Fairmont Ghia both powered by a 3.9 L multi-point (MPI). A five-speed &quot;T50D&quot; fully synchronised manual and Borg-Warner &quot;M51&quot; three-speed automatic transmission were offered, however, the latter was replaced by a four-speed BTR &quot;85SXLE&quot; in the Series II upgrade and further upgraded to BTR &quot;95LE&quot; with the EB series of 1991.

The EA Falcon, released under the codename &quot;EA26&quot; (E for the large size, A for Australia, 26 for the (usually in sequence) global project number), would retain the traditional Falcon hallmarks of width and rear-wheel drive. This proved to be the correct move as sales of the Falcon began to climb after the fuel crisis aftermath, while those of the rival Commodore slipped. It became clear that Australian buying patterns had not truly changed and what the public wanted was a full-size (albeit smaller) family car.

In addition, Ford&#x27;s dominance of the taxi market in Australia meant that a car that could comfortably seat three along the back seat—and even the front, with a bench seat installed—was necessary. It also ensured that Ford could retain, at least until Holden released the new Statesman/Caprice in 1990, the market for official cars for governmental use.

While initially popular, the EA&#x27;s build quality was uncompetitive with uneven panel shutlines, computer problems, poor paint quality and front suspension alignment problems.

Launched in October 1989, the Series II brought with it a four-speed automatic transmission, body-coloured B-pillars, and the 3.2 L engine was dropped. Despite the Series II models having significantly fewer problems than the Series I, Series II prices are also affected by curtailed resale values. The same problem also affects the NA Fairlane and DA series LTD, and even the ute and panel van variants, which persisted with the older XF architecture.

=== EB ===
Visually, the 1991 EB Falcon remained nearly identical to its predecessor with subtle front and rear styling changes to the location of the Ford badge and the rear taillight applique, respectively. This series saw the reintroduction, by Ford Australia, of a V8 engine option (on sedans only) for the first time since 1982. Moreover, this series also saw the reintroduction of a Falcon GT model, with the refined &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; model limited to 265 units. Both this limited edition, and the first XR6 and XR8 sports models (that have continued with all subsequent Falcons and were originally marketed as S-XR6 and S-XR8) first appeared with the EB Series, through the then newly established Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE) joint-venture.

Reportedly costing A$1 million, the radically different Series II model of April 1992 primarily benefitted from a higher capacity 6-cylinder engine (up 35 cubic centimetres or from 3949 cc to 3984 cc), bringing its nominal total swept capacity to 4.0 L. The transmission and electronics were also improved and, externally, styling changes abounded including the base model now having body-coloured bumpers and its matte black plastic exterior door handles in a glossy finish. Other aspects of this upgrade consisted of improvements in safety, electronics and overall refinement. For example: the car now featured an advanced &quot;Smartlock&quot; security locking system standard across all models; anti-lock brakes became optional; a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard (from 1993); foam-filled A-pillars helped deliver better crash protection and Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) reductions.

=== ED ===

The front grille was now elliptical to differentiate it from the EB, and the sports genre (XR6, and XR8) gained an exclusive quad headlamp cluster. Making a comeback in the ED range was the Futura. The safety orientated Futura was marketed towards private buyers, and was equipped with cruise control, anti-lock brakes, and featured body-coloured mirrors. For the first time since the XF series, the luxurious Fairmont Ghia trim level was not available in station wagon form.
The standard 4.0 L six-cylinder produced , the XR6 high-performance option , and the 5.0 litre EFI V8 at 4500 rpm.
=== EF ===

When the facelifted EF was introduced in August 1994, it brought with it a new curvaceous body shape while sharing its doors (albeit, with a new door handle design) and most of its body structure with the earlier EA–ED series cars. Unlike the sedan, the station wagon inherited the rear styling of the ED series. With the new model, came a thoroughly redesigned interior. Cup holders were now prominent features in all models, and Ford paid particular attention to safety. A driver&#x27;s airbag was made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian car, even though the Holden VR Commodore was the first to feature it as an option. From the outside, the reinforced body gave added rollover strength and front collision protection. An original innovation introduced in the EF range was the &quot;Smart Bar&quot;. A bullbar developed to work seamlessly with the vehicle&#x27;s airbag system.

The 4.0 L inline six-cylinder engine was upgraded to aid refinement and increase power to 157 kilowatts (211 hp) this included the removal of the distributor as it was replaced with a coil-pack ignition system which was a first for the Falcon. Also the intake manifold was changed to include a dual length system which involved intake runners of two different lengths and a valve to switch between the two. Changes were also made to the suspension with the aim of providing a more supple ride, but drew criticism for producing nervous handling and an unsettling feeling of roll oversteer (a problem not corrected until the EL facelift).

A passenger airbag was offered as an option in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only the front passenger, but the centre passenger as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 engine, leather upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of neoprene rubber insulation, road and wind noise was cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.

The EF Series also saw the first use of polycarbonate headlight lenses instead of glass, saving weight and gaining shatter resistance.

=== EL ===

The final E-series model, the EL Falcon, was released in October 1996, and was merely a facelift of the EF intended to keep sales strong until the sixth generation AU Falcon was launched. The most obvious change visually, was the return of the grille on the GLi and Futura spec levels. The new oval grille tied in with Ford&#x27;s global lineup of the time. Cosmetic updates extended further with the bonnet, front bumper and headlamps also receiving a revised design. New grilles were now prominent on the luxury variants (Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia), and the quad-headlamps of the XR sport models gained minor changes. New wheel trims were featured on all trim levels, and station wagon variants gained white tinted indicator lenses, replacing the amber tint which had been common since the introduction of the EA.

With the EL there was a revision again with the engine this time the distributor was refitted and the coil-pack ignition removed, though power remained the same at 4900 rpm / at 3000 rpm. The final drive ratio went down from 3.23:1 to 3.08:1 allowing for 1700rpm being achieved at 100 km/h in 4th gear.

To address handling concerns with the EF, improvements were made to the rear suspension and steering which would largely be attributed to Ford Australia&#x27;s association with Tickford Vehicle Engineering. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high speed steering. With the exception of the GLi, the entire range was fitted with standard Bosch 5.3 ABS brakes and an advanced window film known as &quot;Smart Tint&quot; that gave equivalent protection levels of SPF15 sunscreen.

Interior upgrades ranged from reshaped seats and headrests, to new colour schemes, and switches. Station wagons could now be ordered with third-row accommodation and an electric network for mobile phone usage.

== Sixth generation (1998–2010) ==
=== AU ===

The new-generation AU Falcon was released in 1998 with its range comprising the following models: Forté (previously GLi), S, Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6, XR6 VCT and XR8. External model differentiation was achieved via the use of different grilles and bonnets (low bonnet and vertical &quot;waterfall&quot; grille on Forté, horizontal single bar on Futura, integrated quad-lamp bumper bar and grille on the XR sports range; high bonnet and large grille on Fairmont range) and more basic fittings such as different alloy wheel designs, rear light clusters (clear turn signals on Fairmont), body colour-coordination and chrome fittings.

Initially, the company considered a revamped 5th-generation Falcon and even studied the possibility of fully imported replacements such as the American front-wheel-drive Ford Taurus or rear-wheel-drive Ford Crown Victoria, the European rear-wheel-drive Scorpio and, reportedly, even the Japanese rear-wheel drive Mazda 929 (then part of the Ford conglomerate).

Developed under the code name &quot;EA169&quot;, the AU series adopted Ford&#x27;s New Edge worldwide styling, which was meant to differentiate it from the &quot;conformist&quot; styling prevalent in the 1990s. The gamble, which had worked with the Ford Focus, did not particularly endear the AU Falcon to its buyers.

Ford attempted to address the AUs issues with its Series II (April 2000) and Series III (November 2001) updates, which brought styling and interior improvements such as a raised bonnet across the non-XR range (from the Fairmont range), scrapping of the unpopular &quot;waterfall&quot; grill on the base model Forté, revised bigger profile bumper bars, bigger wheels and improved interior trims.

In addition, this series also received mechanical and structural improvements including an upgraded braking system, a laminated firewall engineered to reduce NVH, and incremental power upgrades for the V8 engine. Nevertheless, despite these improvements and ownership incentives (such as free air conditioning and automatic transmission on the biggest volume-seller Forté, plus complimentary scheduled servicing for three years or 60,000 km across the range), Falcon&#x27;s sales never recovered to meet expectations, being outsold by its chief rival, the Holden VT and its successor, the VX Commodores.

This Falcon&#x27;s Australian-production firsts included the 6-cylinder&#x27;s Variable Cam Timing (VCT) and automatic transmissions on the high-performance T-series with an adaptive mode that included steering wheel gear shift buttons.

=== BA ===

Officially debuting in September 2002, the BA Falcon was a major update of the AU, with Ford designers and engineers almost wiping the board clean, and in the process spending just over AU$500 million, a figure much larger than previously anticipated. The BA Falcon won the prestigious &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year Award (COTY) in 2002. Its range comprised the following models: XT (formerly Forté), Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6 and XR8. Major elements of the overhaul included the development of a more effective &quot;Control-Blade&quot; independent rear suspension, a significant revamp of the car&#x27;s inline 6-cylinder engine as well as two new V8 engines and, to top it all off, new transmissions. Design wise, the BA received a completely new look, with designers giving both the front and rear quarters of the car substantial work, resulting in much more contemporary, European-style design. A lot of effort went into improving the craftsmanship and fit and finish of both the exterior and interior. On the outside the windscreen washer nozzles were moved off the hood onto the cowl panel. The headlamps were made subflush to the hood and overall most interfaces were improved. The BA also introduced a thoroughly remodelled interior, whereby the &#x27;oval shaped&#x27; instrument cluster was replaced with a more conservatively styled cluster. It featured a large LCD screen, situated in a &quot;satin finished&quot; centre console (Called the &quot;Interior Command Centre&quot; or ICC in short). On the interior the design team spent many hours improving the feel of the contact points as well as improving fit and finish and craftsmanship. Within a year of its release, Falcon sales had increased substantially and, for a time, eclipsed Holden Commodore sales.

Ford introduced their new Barra straight-six 4.0 litre DOHC VCT engines into the lineup, which included a turbocharged (/) version and base line () naturally aspirated version. The BA also featured a new North American designed 5.4 L &quot;4V Boss and Barra 3V&quot; V8 engines. The &quot;Barra 220&quot; (/) &quot;Boss 260&quot; (/) and &quot;Boss 290&quot; (/) engines were smoother, quieter and more fuel efficient than the Ford Windsor engine used in the AU. In October 2004, Ford released the Mark II update of the BA. Amongst the changes was a six-speed manual transmission, four new exterior colours, and revised wheels trims.

In 2004 Ford introduced the Territory crossover SUV which was based upon the BA&#x27;s engine, floorpan and IRS. This was introduced in response to the long term decline in large sedan sales in Australia, since this sector&#x27;s share of the total market has been steadily shrinking for a decade.

=== BF ===

Visually similar to its forerunner, the BF update from October 2005 was developed with an emphasis geared more towards powertrain enhancements, rather than design. The BF Falcon received various mechanical upgrades, including minimal engine modifications primarily within the VCT system aiming at individualising the cam operation/timing, and improvements towards noise, vibration, and harshness. The naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine gained an increase in power to also contributed due to use of 5–30 recommended oil weight for engine hence bringing improvements in fuel economy and compliance with Euro III emission standards. The turbocharged version of same engine also received further gains in output, with peak power rising to and of torque. Ford, with the BF, also introduced the six-speed &quot;ZF 6HP26&quot; automatic transmission and electronic stability control, both of which were made available on selected trim levels.

Ford updated its Falcon lineup with the Series II update in October 2006. The BF II turbo models had an engine upgrade and came with the same engine as the FPV Typhoon internally, with the only difference being boost pressure, with the XR6 Turbo running 6 PSI boost pressure (FPV, 9PSI). Select trim levels in the BF II range (XT, Futura and Fairmont) saw a modified front-end, which featured more of a sporting image and was more aerodynamic. The entry-level XT could now be specified with the six-speed automatic, with four-speed-automatic continued as the standard transmission. Fuel efficiency figures also improved, with figures of for the base XT and for variants fitted with the ZF six-speed automatic.

Following the release of the FG Falcon model in 2008, which lacked a wagon variant, the BF was revised and re-released in Mark III guise, but only in wagon form, and only the base model XT was available.

The Mark III update included Dynamic Stability Control (available on petrol powered models only), a flip key from the FG series Falcon, Satin Alloy Accents on the front grille surround.

At the end of 2010 the Falcon wagon was permanently discontinued. In its place, Ford offered the smaller and fully imported Ford Mondeo wagon and the Australian-made Territory SUV.

The last petrol-engined BF was built on 30 June, while LPG &quot;E-Gas&quot; models continued until September 2010.

== Seventh generation (2008–2016) ==
=== FG ===

The seventh generation Falcon, known as the &quot;FG&quot;, (and initially known as project Orion) was announced at a press event on 17 February 2008. The FG moniker references the now discontinued Fairmont Ghia (with the Futura model also discontinued), consistent with a more streamlined range consisting of: Falcon XT, XR6 and XR8 and the G-series models Falcon G6 and G6E, replacing the base Fairmont and the top-of-the-range Fairmont Ghia (the latter&#x27;s V8 variant now replaced by the G6E Turbo).

The inline six-cylinder engine received a power upgrade of and to at 6000 rpm/ at 3250 rpm. The turbocharged engine used in the XR6 Turbo and G6E Turbo models produces ( and ). The power output of is similar to previous FPV turbos, but it is a substantially modified design: the new induction system which includes a bigger and more efficient intercooler, higher compression ratio, extra boost and strengthened internals are the key changes. The XT, G6 and G6E also have an E-Gas (LPG) option. The engine continues to use a similar VCT system as its BA/BF predecessors. Fuel consumption has been improved over the outgoing model. The XR6 Turbo received &quot;Motor&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Bang for your Buck&quot; 2008 award.

The FG adds a &quot;Virtual-Pivot&quot; system to the front suspension designed to improve levels of steering, handling and turn-in; and complements Ford&#x27;s Control-Blade IRS system first introduced on the BA Falcon in 2002.

In an unprecedented move, at the 2008 introduction of the FG Falcon, the XR8 was the only V8 model available. The unique 5.4 litre V8 (initially launched in 2003) produced /. In June 2010, new emissions regulations introduced meant that the iconic V8 engine had to be discontinued. Ford phased this out quietly; motoring magazines did not even report on it. However, at the time the V8 was phased out, Ford&#x27;s performance subsidiary, FPV, introduced a Ford America sourced V8, the 5.0 L Coyote (as used in the Mustang). Prodrive specifically developed the engine in Australia to FPV&#x27;s own standards (read below). A new FPV model, the GS, was released to &quot;plug the hole&quot; between the XR6 Turbo and the higher level (and price) FPV V8 models when the XR8 was phased out. The GS is an entry point to FPV, taking many of the sales that would have been destined for the former Ford XR8.

The 5.0 L &#x27;modular V8&#x27; engine is currently the Ford Performance Vehicles&#x27; V8 engine, released in June 2010. Initially two versions were released, one rated at and of torque and the other at and of torque. Both engines carry the &#x27;Boss&#x27; moniker, with the 315 kW version dubbed the &quot;Boss 315&quot;, and the more powerful version dubbed the &quot;Boss 335&quot;.

In 2010, Ford Australia celebrated 50 years of continuous Falcon production, from 1960 to date. A special XR50 model was released to commemorate the occasion. The commemorative model marked the start of the FG update.

The first update to the FG model was released in the second half of 2010. The Mk2 update adds several interior and exterior elements as standard to all vehicles. iPod Integration and Bluetooth are now standard across the range and all models except the XT receive an 8 in colour touch screen. The popular ZF six-speed &quot;6HP26&quot; and &quot;6HP21&quot; (Ecoboost) automatic has also been made standard across the range, spelling the end of the successful four- and five-speed automatics. Other changes included an all new front bumper design, alternative wheel rim design, new floor mats and side step designs. All models receive curtain airbags.

The Mk2 also received numerous updates including a new revised A/C HVAC system, six airbags standard across the range to enhance safety and improved sound deadening to all models to give a more refined, quiet ride.

It was announced in mid-2009 that Ford would start production of a direct-injection, turbocharged four-cylinder &quot;EcoBoost&quot; version of the Falcon. The first ever four cylinder Falcon was released for sale in April 2012, and was fitted with the 2.0 GTDI version of the EcoBoost engine.

A new liquid-injection LPG engine (EcoLPi) was introduced in second half of 2011. It provides superior performance and fuel economy compared to the previous E-gas LPG engine.

The FG Falcon was the first Australian manufactured car to achieve five stars in the independent ANCAP crash safety testing. It achieved a score of 34.6 out of 37. But unlike the FG Mk1, every Mk2 gets the five-star ANCAP safety rating as all cars now get six airbags as standard.

This series marked the end of all Ford Performance Vehicles, after the launch of the FPV GT-F 351 sedans (of which 500 are reserved for Australia and 50 for New Zealand) and Pursuit Ute (total of 120), in June 2014.

=== FG X ===
The FG X series, codenamed 201X, was the last ever production run of Falcon, with production ending on the 7th of October 2016.

In July 2014, Ford Australia released official photographs of Falcon&#x27;s last iteration in XR guise, labelling the reintroduced XR8 as the &quot;best Falcon ever&quot;.

Externally, this Falcon&#x27;s redesigned front end adopts Ford&#x27;s Kinetic 2.0 styling theme featuring the trapezoidal grille which debuted on the Ford Evos concept. The re-introduction of the iconic XR8 model stems from the closure of Ford Performance Vehicles&#x27;s operations, hence the reason why this model features the bulk of the FPV GT driveline, including the local supercharged &quot;Miami&quot; variant of the Coyote V8.

In August 2014, Ford Australia revealed that this last series would be known as the &quot;FG X&quot;, following significant feedback from key enthusiasts. The new series code, like the preceding G6 trim level, pays homage to the Fairmont and Ghia nameplates of past generations whereas the X alludes to Falcon&#x27;s most popular series, from the XR to XF.

== Falcon utility ==
The Australian affection for the ute (short for &quot;utility&quot;) allowed the Falcon to serve as the base model for their line of utes and panel vans, starting in 1961 and gaining rapid recognition by (usually younger) enthusiasts by the mid-1960s. As the base sedan and station wagon models of the Falcon further evolved, so too did the ute and panel van models, although usually up to a year or so after initial release into the market. The only exception was the XF series, which lasted through the initial &quot;EA26&quot; era. While EA26 ute prototypes were actually built, the XF shell continued through to the 1998 release of the AU model, in 1996 gaining the nose treatment of the then current EF series Falcon, with a combination of XF and E-Series Interiors. Low Series XH utes did not have airbags, for example.

The Falcon Ute award-winning modified vehicle (2004-2010) project led by TJ Andrews Funeral Directors, Simon Orton from Leslie Consulting, Tod Lawler, and Ford Australia engineer Graeme Sheahan, created an opportunity to manufacture a world-class hearse (Allonge) for the funeral industry.

The Falcon utility ended production on 29 July 2016, with 467,690 utilities produced between 1961 and 2016.

== Exports ==
Australian Falcon exports were traditionally confined to right-hand-drive countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as New Zealand (where Ford New Zealand sometimes devised local trim variations, such as the XR Falcon 600 and the XA Luxury V8), and Pacific Island nations like Papua New Guinea and Fiji. New Zealand assembly of the Falcon began at Seaview with the XR in 1966 and XA assembly was moved to the new plant in Wiri in 1973. The cars generally followed Australian specifications but the model line was limited and factory options were little more than automatic transmission, though the 1979 XD Fairmont Ghia 302 V8 was the first locally assembled car to offer air conditioning as a build option (NZ$1,050). New Zealand assembly ceased in the early 1990s, after which all Falcons sold locally were fully imported from Australia.

The only significant export market for the Falcon outside of Oceania was South Africa, where the EL was released in 1996, including the GLi, Futura, Fairmont and XR6 in its line-up. This was succeeded by the AU, but was dropped in the early 2000s. (In the early 1970s, the Falcon XY had been assembled in South Africa as the Fairmont, before being fully imported.) Some limousines and hearses (inc. LPG-only powered Utes) were exported to the UK by Coleman Milne, who used to convert European-made Granadas and Scorpios for the same purpose. Earlier, some XA and XB Fairmonts were shipped to the UK as was the contemporary LTD which was modified with Ford Europe tail lights to add the mandatory rear fog lamps and also had to have new screenwash nozzles as the protruding original items did not meet EU safety rules.

Hong Kong also imported a small batch of LPG-powered AU Falcon station wagons for trial as taxis, and although this model initially found favour in luggage capacity with operators when compared to mainstream taxis like the Toyota Comfort, it did not see success there, citing higher operating costs.

Ford had intended on developing the car with left-hand-drive export potential, and received federal and state government grants to assist, but in October 2007, it was announced by Ford Australia president Tom Gorman that the left-hand-drive Falcon project was to be abandoned and the export-incentive grant money would be directed to construction of the Ford Focus small car in Australia. In the end, the Focus project did not proceed as its parent company messed up a lucrative local component sourcing arrangement, so the Asia-Pacific production of that model was instead started at a new plant in Thailand in June 2012. As the FG Falcon utilises much of the previous model&#x27;s architecture, converting it to left-hand drive would have been a costly and time-consuming process.

Ford Australia at one time considered exporting the FG Falcon to China and the Middle East. Sales to the Middle East of previous models were not feasible, as the market was already served by the Ford Crown Victoria, which was later discontinued.

== Replacements and end of production ==
In 1996, Ford Australia imported the boldly-styled third-generation Taurus as a potential replacement of the venerable, but by then dated, Falcon platform. This Taurus was available only as a sedan and in its highest Ghia specification (with a luxury pack option), despite other variants and a wagon being available in its home US market. It was smaller than the Falcon and was powered by a 3.0 litre V6 engine. Due to poor sales, Taurus imports into Australia ended in 1998, the same year the AU Falcon launched.

In 2009, Ford&#x27;s European design head Martin Smith suggested that not even the sixth-generation Taurus that was due in 2010 could be a true replacement for the rear-wheel-drive Falcon, despite this time being of similar size.

On 23 May 2013, Ford Australia announced the end of its local manufacturing operations (involving Falcon and Territory models) by October 2016, with the Falcon nameplate destined to retire after 56 years of continuous production in Australia. A high manufacturing cost base (with costs at the Campbellfield plant some four times higher than in Ford&#x27;s Asian plants and twice as much as in Europe) and unsustainable low sales of its Australian-made products were factors in Ford Motor Company&#x27;s decision to end its Australian manufacturing activities after 90 years. The announcement put an end to years of speculation concerning the Falcon&#x27;s future, which included the possibility of the Falcon switching from its current Australia-only architecture to a global large car platform to be built for all world markets as part of the &quot;One Ford&quot; global product development plan implemented in 2006. The options consisted of either a rear-wheel-drive platform (shared with Mustang) or a transverse front-wheel-drive platform (shared with Explorer and Taurus). Ultimately, it was decided by Ford that the Ford Mustang coupé would be the only rear-wheel drive Ford car built for all global markets and that the Falcon nameplate would be retired.

The fourth-generation Mondeo from Europe and the sixth-generation Mustang from North America both indirectly replaced the Falcon. Beginning from 2015, the new model of the right-hand drive Mustang returned to the Australian market after a 13-year absence, as part of Ford&#x27;s efforts to boost sales of the Mustang brand worldwide and still give Ford Australia a flagship car to replace the Falcon XR and FPV GT V8 range.

== Sales ==

 Falcon van production ended in 1999.&lt;br&gt; Falcon station wagon production ended in 2010.

<text>Haradanahalli Doddegowda Deve Gowda (; born 18 May 1933) is an Indian politician who served as the prime minister of India from 1996 to 1997. He previously served as the chief minister of Karnataka from 1994 to 1996 and as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Lok Sabha. A member of the Janata Dal (Secular), he has been serving as the party&#x27;s president since 1999 and has been an MP in the Rajya Sabha representing Karnataka since 2020.

Born in a family of farmers, Deve Gowda joined the Indian National Congress (INC) in 1953 and remained a member until 1962. He became president of the state unit of the Janata Dal in 1994 and was considered to be a driving force in the party&#x27;s victory in Karnataka. He served as the chief minister of Karnataka from 1994 to 1996. In the 1996 general elections, no party won enough seats to form a government and Deve Gowda was elected to serve as prime minister as head of the United Front coalition. His premiership lasted for less than a year and he left office in April 1997. After his prime ministerial tenure, he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha as a Member of Parliament until his defeat in 2019. Deve Gowda was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2020.

==Early life and career==
H. D. Deve Gowda was born on 18 May 1933 in Haradanahalli, a village in Holenarasipura Taluk, of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore (now in Hassan, Karnataka). His father Dodde Gowda was a paddy farmer and mother, Devamma was a home maker.

Gowda earned a diploma in civil engineering from L. V. Polytechnic, Hassan, in the early 1950s.

Deve Gowda joined the Indian National Congress party in 1953 and remained a member until 1962. During that period, he was President of Anjaneya Cooperative Society of Holenarasipura and later became a member of the Taluk Development Board of Holenarasipura.

==State politics (1962–1996)==
In 1962, Deve Gowda was elected to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly from Holenarasipura constituency as an independent candidate. Later, he was elected from the same constituency to the Assembly for six consecutive terms from 1962 to 1989. He joined the Congress (O) during the Congress split. He served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly from March 1972 to March 1976 and from November 1976 to December 1977. During the Emergency in the 1970s, he was imprisoned in the Bangalore Central Jail.

Later, Deve Gowda served as the two-time president of the state unit of the Janata Party. He served as a minister in the Janata Party Government in Karnataka headed by Ramakrishna Hegde from 1983 to 1988. When V.P. Singh joined Janata Dal, Subramanian Swamy formed Janata Party (Jaya Prakash) faction, and Deve Gowda joined him to become Janata Party (JP)&#x27;s Karnataka President. He was later defeated from Holenarasipur in 1989, and soon later rejoined Janata Dal. He became president of the state unit of the Janata Dal in 1994 and led the party to victory in the 1994 State Assembly elections. He was elected from the Ramanagara, and sworn in as the 14th Chief Minister of Karnataka in December.

As chief minister, Gowda toured Switzerland and attended the Forum of International Economists. His tour to Singapore brought in foreign investment to the State. He resigned from the position to serve as prime minister following his appointment in 1996.

== Prime Minister (1996–1997)==

Following the 1996 general elections, P. V. Narasimha Rao government was defeated with no other party winning enough seats to form a government.

When the United Front (a conglomeration of non-Congress and non-BJP regional parties) decided to form the Government at the Centre with the support of the Congress and CPI(M), Deve Gowda was unexpectedly chosen to head the government after V. P. Singh and Jyoti Basu declined. He was sworn-in as the 11th Prime Minister of India in June 1996 and was elected to the Rajya Sabha in September 1996 during his tenure as prime minister. During his tenure, he served as the Home Minister and as the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the United Front, the policy-making committee consisting of other coalition party leaders. He is credited for providing financial closure and kickstarting development of the Delhi Metro Project. He left office on 21 April 1997 after the Congress revoked its support for Gowda amidst discontent over communication between the coalition and the Congress. It compromised to support a new government under I. K. Gujral, who served as the prime minister from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998.

==Post-premiership (1997–present)==
He was defeated in the 1999 general elections. He was elected president of the Janata Dal (Secular) the same year.

The 2004 Karnataka state elections witnessed the revival of his party&#x27;s fortunes under the leadership of Siddaramaiah with the Janata Dal (Secular) winning 58 seats and becoming a part of the ruling coalition in the state. Later, the party joined with the BJP and formed another government in 2006. Deve Gowda&#x27;s son, H. D. Kumaraswamy, headed the BJP-JD(S) coalition government in the state for 20 months. The alliance was defeated in 2008. B. S. Yediyurappa was elected as the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Deve Gowda verbally abused Yediyurappa. This event was termed as a &quot;new low in Indian politics&quot;. Deve Gowda later apologised for hurling abuse at him.

Deve Gowda expelled Siddaramaiah and CM Ibrahim from the JD(S) in 2005. Later, both Siddaramaiah and CM Ibrahim joined the Indian National Congress, which won the 2013 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election, with Siddaramaiah being elected as the Chief Minister of Karnataka.

Deve Gowda contested the 2019 general elections against G. S. Basavaraj in Tumkur Lok Sabha constituency of Karnataka. G. S. Basavaraj, BJP candidate of Tumkur Constituency won against Deve Gowda by a margin of 13,339 votes. G. S. Basavaraj polled 596,127 votes while Deve Gowda got 582,788 votes. He has been elected to Rajya Sabha.

== Personal life ==
He married Chennamma in 1954. They have six children together: four sons, including politicians H. D. Revanna and H. D. Kumaraswamy, who is the former Chief Minister of Karnataka, and two daughters. He is the father-in-law of politician Anitha Kumaraswamy and grandfather of actor Nikhil Kumaraswamy, politicians Prajwal Revanna and Suraj Revanna.

<doc id="373747" wikidata="Q8037018" url="?curid=373747" title="Worshipful Company of Cooks">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Cooks of London is the smallest of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Company received its first and incorporating Royal Charter from Edward IV on 11 July 1482. Its Royal Charter of 16 February 1663, from Charles II, is the present day governing ordinance for the Company.

The company&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1170, when it was founded from two guilds of cooks in medieval London − the Cooks of Eastcheap and the Cooks of Bread Street. The company&#x27;s history runs from the earliest records of Cooks in the Middle Ages and their control of the craft until the 19th century to the Company&#x27;s current charitable works. Unusually for the male-dominated livery companies, the Cooks had freemaiden members in 1495.

The Cooks Company is no longer an association of tradesmen in its original sense of control, yet its membership today still includes craft tradesmen, and its activities engage with a broad range of organisations associated with cooking. The Company&#x27;s purpose in contemporary times has come to rest in a public search for the common good, to contribute as effectively as it can to the pursuit of a good society − to be socially useful. It does this through four principal objectives that translate its origins, history, traditions, affiliations, and activities into meaningful outcomes for today&#x27;s world:
* To fund a range of charitable activities associated with the welfare and education of the catering trade
* To support the modern day craft of cooking including catering excellence through competition, scholarly and scientific culinary research, and the development of food policy
* To support the City of London
* To pursue a fellowship of association that can mobilise the necessary resource, skill, and wisdom to bring these about

The Cooks&#x27; Company ranks thirty-fifth in the order of precedence of Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Vulnerati Non Victi&quot;, Latin for &quot;Wounded not Conquered&quot;.

<doc id="373750" wikidata="Q248484" url="?curid=373750" title="Inder Kumar Gujral">
<text>Inder Kumar Gujral (4 December 1919 – 30 November 2012) was an Indian diplomat, politician, and anti-colonial independence activist, who served as the prime minister of India from April 1997 to March 1998.

Born in Punjab, he was influenced by nationalistic ideas as a student, and joined the All India Students Federation and the Communist Party of India. He was imprisoned for taking part in the Quit India movement. After independence, he joined the Indian National Congress party in 1964, and became a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha.

He was the Minister of Information and Broadcasting during the emergency. In 1976, he was appointed as the Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union. In 1996, he became the Minister of External Affairs in the Deve Gowda ministry, and developed the Gujral doctrine during this period. He was appointed the prime minister of India in 1997. His tenure lasted for less than a year.

He retired from all political positions in 1998. He died in 2012 at the age of 92, following hospitalization due to a lung infection.

==Early and personal life==

=== Family ===
Inder Kumar was born on 4 December 1919 in a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family to Avtar Narain and Pushpa Gujral in the village of Pari Darveza in the Sohawa Tehsil of the Jhelum District in undivided Punjab in British India, which is in present-day Punjab, Pakistan. He studied at D.A.V. College, Hailey College of Commerce and Forman Christian College, Lahore, all affiliated with the University of the Punjab. He was a member of All India Students Federation. He also participated in the Indian independence movement, and was jailed in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. As a student, he became a member of the Communist Party of India. He also has two sisters, Uma Nanda and Sunita Judge. On 26 May 1945, Inder Kumar Gujral married Sheila Gujral (24 January 1924 – 11 July 2011) and had two sons, Naresh Gujral (born 19 May 1948), who is a Rajya Sabha MP, and Vishal Gujral. IK Gujral&#x27;s younger brother Satish Gujral was a world-renowned painter and sculptor.

=== Education ===
Gujral&#x27;s hobbies included poetry; he spoke Urdu and was, after his death, eulogised as a lover of the language by Maulana Azad National Urdu University, an institution where he held the position of chancellor. His wife Sheila Gujral, an acclaimed poet, died on 11 July 2011 after an illness. The couple had two sons, Naresh, who is a Shiromani Akali Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha, and Vishal. The couple also have two granddaughters and a grandson.

==Early politics==
Gujral became vice-president of the New Delhi Municipal Committee in 1958, and joined the Congress party (INC) in 1964. He was close to Indira Gandhi, and became a member of the Rajya Sabha in April 1964. During the Emergency of June 1975, Gujral was Minister of Information and Broadcasting, where he was in charge of the media during a time of censorship in India and was in charge of Doordarshan. He again was elected to the Rajya Sabha to serve until 1976. He also served as Water Resources Minister. Later, Gujral was appointed Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union by Indira Gandhi and stayed on during the tenures of Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. He was rumoured to have been shunted out of the ministry due to conflicts with the prime minister&#x27;s son, Sanjay Gandhi, over media censorship, and was replaced by Vidya Charan Shukla, who had no qualms following party lines on the matter; he was then moved to the Planning Ministry.

==Janata Dal==
Gujral resigned from the Indian National Congress party in the 1980s. Then he joined the Janata Dal. In the 1989 Indian general election, Gujral was elected from Jalandhar in Punjab. He served as Minister of External Affairs in Prime Minister V. P. Singh&#x27;s eleventh cabinet of India. In 1989, Singh sent him to Srinagar to negotiate with the perpetrators of the 1989 kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed. He also brought about controversy during the Gulf War when he hugged Saddam Hussein as a show-of-good-faith to ensure Indian expatriates would be safe. In the 1991 Indian general election, Gujral contested from Patna in Bihar. However, the election was countermanded following complaints of &#x27;irregularities&#x27;. In 1992, Gujral was elected to the Rajya Sabha with the help of Lalu Prasad Yadav.

Subsequent to the 1996 election, when the United Front government was formed under the premiership of H. D. Deve Gowda, Gujral was again named Minister of External Affairs. During this tenure, he developed the &#x27;Gujral doctrine&#x27; which emphasised better relations with India&#x27;s neighbours and was refined when he became prime minister. He also served as Union Minister or Minister of State of several other portfolios—Communications and Parliamentary Affairs, Information and Broadcasting, Works and Housing and Planning.

The Indian National Congress party had been supporting the United Front government from outside, but citing its wish to have the incumbent prime minister replaced, decided to withdraw support; this led to the government&#x27;s collapse in April 1997. To avoid mid-term elections, a compromise was reached: the INC agreed to support another United Front government under a new leader, provided its concerns—such as not being consulted before taking important decisions and being marginalised—were addressed. The United Front elected Gujral as its new leader, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister on 21 April 1997.

==Prime Minister (April 1997– March 1998)==
Gujral became prime minister as the consensus candidate between others that included Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav; his government was supported by the INC from outside. In the early weeks of his tenure, the Central Bureau of Investigation asked for permission from the Governor of Bihar, A. R. Kidwai, to prosecute the state Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in a corruption case related to the Fodder Scam, a move that Kidwai sanctioned. Even legal scholars said that Yadav could not escape prosecution. Subsequently, the demand for the resignation of Yadav was raised both from within and outside the United Front. United Front and Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet called for action against Yadav and for the resignation of other RJD members; while the same was said by JD members Sharad Yadav, H. D. Deve Gowda and Ram Vilas Paswan who called for the dismissal of accused RJD members Kanti Singh, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Captain Jai Narain Nishad. Though INC chairperson Sitaram Kesri offered minor calls for Yadav&#x27;s resignation, Yadav then offered Gujral support to run from any Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar to get his support. Gujral, however, was silent on the matter, but later controversially transferred the CBI director Joginder Singh, who was investigating the case against Yadav, and replaced him with R. C. Sharma, who said Gujral would directly control the CBI and that the pace of investigating many sensational cases &quot;will definitely slacken now.&quot; However, Yadav was still expelled from the party by JD leader Sharad Yadav, before forming his own Rashtriya Janata Dal in 1997.

Another controversial decision of his government was its recommendation of President&#x27;s rule in Uttar Pradesh in 1997. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Uttar Pradesh government, headed by Kalyan Singh, sought a vote of confidence after violence and unruly scenes took place in the assembly. However, President K.R. Narayanan refused to sign the recommendation and sent it back to the government for reconsideration. The Allahabad High Court also gave a decision against President&#x27;s rule in Uttar Pradesh. He also resisted signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

On 28 August 1997, the Jain Commission report was submitted to the government and was leaked on 16 November. The commission had inquired into the conspiracy aspects of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and reportedly criticised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), amongst others such as the Narasimha Rao government, for tacitly supporting Tamil militants accused in Gandhi&#x27;s assassination. The DMK was part of the ruling coalition at the center and had ministers in the Union Cabinet. The Congress first demanded the tabling of the report on the floor of the parliament, which was refused by Gujral, who feared a battle between the DMK and the Tamil Maanila Congress would lead to the DMK&#x27;s withdrawal from the government. Gujral later formed a Joint Parliamentary Committee to study the report after informing Sitaram Keshri of the decision, to which Keshri acceded. INC parliamentary party leader Sharad Pawar said they would call for the resignation of anyone implicated in the report. Gujral convened the government to inform them of the updates and said it supported the DMK. The DMK&#x27;s Industry Minister Murasoli Maran said: &quot;We are part of the United Front. We will stand and fall together. I am hundred per cent confident of that. If it were so easy to break the United Front, then it will be called the disunited front. No one is going to ditch their colleagues for a few loaves of power. We have no reason to quit at all. The report is full of recycled news. There is nothing startling about it, everybody already knows what the report is saying. A Madras court is expected to give its verdict on a criminal case on the assassination on January 28. Let us wait till then to know who was involved in the dastardly act. Until then, all this is disinformation.&quot; However, the Tamil Maanila Congress called for the DMK, which was in a coalition government in Tamil Nadu, to share all actions it would undertake. The report was tabled on 20 November 1997. On the same day there were angry scenes in parliament, as the INC then called for the DMK&#x27;s removal from the cabinet and refused to partake in any parliamentary debate until that happened. Speaker P.A. Sangma then adjourned the house. The INC finally withdrew support from his government on 28 November after Gujral sent Kesri a letter saying he would not dismiss any DMK leaders. Gujral resigned following the withdrawal, and sent a letter to President K. R. Narayanan that read: &quot;My government has lost its majority and does not want to continue in office on moral grounds&quot;, but did not call for the dissolution of parliament. The president accepted the resignation, but asked for Gujral to stay on in an interim capacity. INC General Secretary Oscar Fernandes then said: &quot;All the secular parties are welcome to support a government which will be attempted by the Congress.&quot; The United Front&#x27;s leader Chandrababu Naidu got the support of all the constituents saying they would neither support the INC nor the Bharatiya Janata Party, as did the TMC, saying they would not allow a &quot;U.P.-like situation to happen in the centre.&quot; In similar measure, BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu said the party would &quot;throttle&quot; INC attempts to form a new government. The president then dissolved parliament on 4 December, triggering a snap election.

Gujral was the third PM to be from the Rajya Sabha, following Indira Gandhi (January 1966 - March 1967) and H. D. Deve Gowda (June 1996 - April 1997). They were followed by Manmohan Singh (May 2004 - May 2014).

As a Prime minister, Gujral had a practice of reserving Friday mornings for meeting the general public.

==Gujral doctrine==
The Gujral doctrine is a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with India&#x27;s immediate neighbours, notably Pakistan, as spelt out by Gujral. The doctrine was later termed as such by journalist Bhabani Sen Gupta in his article, &quot;India in the Twenty First Century&quot; in International Affairs. These principles are, as he set out at Chatham House in September 1996 (which he later reiterated at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies):

He wrote in his autobiography of the doctrine: &quot;The logic behind the Gujral doctrine was that since we had to face two hostile neighbours in the north and the west, we had to be at &#x27;total peace&#x27; with all other immediate neighbours in order to contain Pakistan&#x27;s and China&#x27;s influence in the region.&quot;

Following a series of attacks throughout the 2000s, said by the Indian media and government to have originated from and been planned in Pakistan, culminating with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujral doctrine was criticised by the Indian media. Following the attack, &quot;India Today&quot; said that targeted, covert strikes against Pakistani organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba were a &quot;capability that I.K. Gujral dismantled as prime minister over a decade ago will take over a year to rebuild.&quot; The major setback of the Gujral doctrine is said to be the debilitating impact it had on the R&amp;AW&#x27;s (Research and Analysis Wing) ability to conduct operations in Pakistan. On his orders Pakistan&#x27;s special operations desk of R&amp;AW was shut down leading to major gaps in India&#x27;s intelligence capabilities. Analysts have time and again blamed this as the foremost factor for India&#x27;s &quot;intelligence failure&quot; before the Kargil War commenced. It is said that this was because of Gujral&#x27;s negligence towards such repercussions and his urge to leave an imprint on Indo-Pak relations that he did this. However, it was also praised in the media.

The snap election was held in February–March 1998. Gujral contested again from Jalandhar as Janata Dal candidate with the support of the Shiromani Akali Dal. The Akali Dal, though a part of BJP-led coalition, opted to support Gujral because during his Prime Ministerial tenure, Gujral declared that the central government will share the expenses against the insurgency in Punjab during the 1980s and early 1990s, along with the state government of Punjab.

Gujral was a member of the Club de Madrid after his tenure as the Prime Minister ended.

== Global policy ==
Along with his brother Satish Gujral, he was one of the signatories of the Agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Illness and death==
Gujral was admitted at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon, Haryana (part of the National Capital Region), on 19 November 2012, after being diagnosed with a lung infection. He had had a serious chest infection a few days before being admitted to the hospital following more than a year of dialysis. His health deteriorated in the hospital and was reported to be &quot;very critical&quot;. On 27 November, he fell unconscious and his urine output system stopped working. Gujral died on 30 November 2012, four days before his 93rd birthday. His body lay in state at his official residence, 5 Janpath, until noon the next day. The Government of India declared a seven-day period of state mourning and cancelled official functions until 6 December. He was given a state funeral at 15:00 on 1 December near Samata Sthal. His death was announced to parliament by Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, following which both houses adjourned. On 3 December, condolence references were held for him.

Reactions came from President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chairman Lalu Prasad Yadav. Other immediate reactions came from MPs: Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, Veerappa Moily, Ghulam Nabi Azad. Minister for New and Renewable Energy Farooq Abdullah offered his condolences and said Gujral was &quot;a politician, a diplomat and a humanist who would be remembered for his many accomplishments in the diplomatic and political arena;&quot; while Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Srikant Kumar Jena said Gujral had an &quot;exceptional personality, courage and intellect&quot; and that: &quot;Today we feel extremely saddened on the demise of former Prime Minister Shri Inder Kumar Gujral, who was a man of exceptional courage and intellect.&quot; The Union Cabinet issued a statement that read: &quot;In his death, India has lost a great patriot, a visionary leader and a freedom fighter.&quot; INC chairperson Sonia Gandhi wrote to Gujral&#x27;s son, MP Naresh Gujral: &quot;...the late leader had the ability to win goodwill and friendship across the political spectrum. It is these qualities and the genuine warmth of his personality that made him such a widely admired and respected Prime Minister of India, MP and ambassador.&quot; Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa sent a message to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in which he wrote: &quot;Shri Gujral was ahead of his times in a rapidly globalising world. Sri Lanka will always remember with gratitude, Shri I K Gujral&#x27;s contribution towards strengthening India-Sri Lanka relations and regional cooperation.&quot; Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Parvez Ashraf mentioned Gujral&#x27;s &quot;admirable role&quot; in boosting India-Pakistan relations, while he also said South Asia had lost a noble and distinguished politician. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sent an unnamed senior leader of her Awami League party for the funeral. Salman Khurshid and Lal Krishna Advani were amongst the dignitaries at his funeral.

<text>The Jewry Wall is a substantial ruined wall of 2nd-century Roman masonry, with two large archways, in Leicester, England. It stands alongside St Nicholas&#x27; Circle and St Nicholas&#x27; Church. It formed the west wall of a public building in (Roman Leicester), alongside public baths, the foundations of which were excavated in the 1930s and are also open to view. The wall gives its name to the adjacent Jewry Wall Museum.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of the wall (first recorded ) is debated. It is unlikely to relate to Leicester&#x27;s medieval Jewish community, which was never large and was expelled from the town by Simon de Montfort in 1231. One theory that has achieved widespread currency is that the name bears some relation to the 24 &quot;s&quot; (meaning &quot;sworn men&quot;, and roughly equivalent to aldermen) of early medieval Leicester, the senior members of the Corporation, who were said to have met, as a &quot;jury&quot;, in the town churchyard—possibly that of St Nicholas. However, it seems more likely that the name derives from a broader folk belief attributing mysterious ruins of unknown origin to Jews. Such attributions are found at a number of other sites elsewhere in England and other parts of Europe.

==Description==
The wall is an impressive example of standing Roman masonry. It dates to approximately 125–130 AD. It measures long, high and thick. It is among the largest pieces of surviving civil Roman architecture in Britain, and is comparable to the &quot;Old Work&quot; at Wroxeter. The structure comprises alternate bands of Roman brick and coursed masonry, of local granite, limestone and sandstone. In the centre of the wall are two large arched openings about wide and high, and there are further arched alcoves on the eastern side.

The wall lies immediately to the west of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, which includes in its late Saxon and early medieval fabric much reused Roman brick and masonry.

The remains of the Roman town&#x27;s public baths, immediately west of the wall, were excavated in four seasons from 1936 to 1939 by Kathleen Kenyon. The wall and some of the foundations of the baths are now laid out to public view. They are adjoined by a 1960s building housing the Jewry Wall Museum (and formerly Vaughan College), which stands on the remainder of the baths site (including the site of the three furnaces). The museum contains excellent examples of Roman mosaics, painted wall plaster and other Roman and Iron Age artefacts from sites around Leicester.

The wall was taken into state care in 1920 and is now the responsibility of English Heritage. The wall itself is a Grade I listed building; its wider site, including the adjacent remains of the baths and St Nicholas&#x27; Church, forms a scheduled monument.

==Function and context==
The wall appears to have formed the long western side of a large rectangular basilica-like structure. The precise character and function of this building has been a matter of much debate. 18th- and early 19th-century antiquaries tended to identify it as a Roman or British temple, sometimes said to have been dedicated to the god Janus. The ruin was also occasionally identified as &quot;part of a bath&quot;. For much of the 19th century it was widely believed to have been a town gate, though this was suggested by neither its structure nor its location. This interpretation still appeared as fact in the generally authoritative Victoria County History as late as 1907. The prevailing view in the early 20th century was that the ruin was part of the town basilica.

When she began her excavations in the late 1930s, Kenyon initially thought the overall site was that of the town forum (of which the basilica would have formed a part). Although she modified her views when she uncovered the remains of the baths, she continued to believe that the area had originally been laid out as the forum, with the Jewry Wall the west wall of the basilica, but argued that in a second phase of building, only about 20 years later, the site had been converted to public baths. This interpretation was abandoned when, in a series of excavations undertaken between 1961 and 1972, the true remains of the forum were firmly identified a block further east (Insula XXII). The Jewry Wall was then identified as the wall of the palaestra (gymnasium) of the baths complex, and this continues to be the most commonly accepted view, given in the official scheduled monument descriptions and in the interpretive material on site.

There are still a number of unanswered questions, however, and the issue remains open.

== Jewry Wall Museum ==
The Jewry Wall Museum faces the Jewry Wall ruins, and houses artefacts from Iron Age, Roman, and medieval Leicester. The building is Grade II listed and below Vaughan College, home to Leicester University&#x27;s Institute for Lifelong-Learning. The museum is run by Leicester City Council and is free to enter.

In 2004, as part of a scheme of cost-cutting by Leicester City Council, it was proposed that the Jewry Wall Museum&#x27;s hours be reduced. An interest group was created in response, and the &#x27;Friends of Jewry Wall Museum&#x27; have been actively promoting the museum since. Nevertheless, Leicester City Council reduced the museum&#x27;s hours to save money, and it is closed for several months over the winter. Councillor John Mugglestone rationalised the decision at the time, saying: &quot;At Jewry Wall, we have more curators than visitors&quot;.

The museum was threatened again in 2011, when Leicester City Council announced plans to close the museum (along with two others in the city) to save money. This decision was overturned following a motion by the City Council&#x27;s backbench Labour councillors, led by former Labour Council leader Ross Willmott.

==In popular culture==
The Jewry Wall features as the &quot;Old Bathhouse&quot; in the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;. It is in the town of &quot;&quot;, the form of the name of Leicester that appears in the Domesday Book of 1086.

<doc id="373775" wikidata="Q23834" url="?curid=373775" title="Comb">
<text>A comb is a tool consisting of a shaft that holds a row of teeth for pulling through the hair to clean, untangle, or style it. Combs have been used since prehistoric times, having been discovered in very refined forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in Persia.

Weaving combs made of whalebone dating to the middle and late Iron Age have been found on archaeological digs in Orkney and Somerset.

==Description==
Combs are made of a shaft and teeth that are placed at a perpendicular angle to the shaft. Combs can be made out of a number of materials, most commonly plastic, metal, or wood. In antiquity, horn and whalebone was sometimes used. Combs made from ivory and tortoiseshell were once common but concerns for the animals that produce them have reduced their usage. Wooden combs are largely made of boxwood, cherry wood, or other fine-grained wood. Good quality wooden combs are usually handmade and polished.

Combs come in various shapes and sizes depending on what they are used for. A hairdressing comb may have a thin, tapered handle for parting hair and close teeth. Common hair combs usually have wider teeth halfway and finer teeth for the rest of the comb. Hot combs were used solely for straightening hair during the colonial era in North America.

A hairbrush comes in both manual and electric models. It is larger than a comb, and is also commonly used for shaping, styling, and cleaning hair. A combination comb and hairbrush was patented in the 19th century.

==Uses ==
Combs can be used for many purposes. Historically, their main purpose was securing long hair in place, decorating the hair, matting sections of hair for dreadlocks, or keeping a kippah or skullcap in place. In Spain, a &quot;peineta&quot; is a large decorative comb used to keep a mantilla in place.

In industry and craft, combs are used in separating cotton fibres from seeds and other debris (the cotton gin, a mechanized version of the comb, is one of the machines that ushered in the Industrial Revolution). A comb is used to distribute colors in paper marbling to make the swirling colour patterns in comb-marbled paper.

Combs are also a tool used by police investigators to collect hair and dandruff samples that can be used in ascertaining dead or living persons&#x27; identities, as well as their state of health and toxicological profiles.

===Hygiene===
Sharing combs is a common cause of parasitic infections much like sharing a hat, as one user can leave a comb with eggs or live parasites, facilitating the transmission of lice, fleas, mites, fungi, and other undesirables. Siblings are also more likely to pass on nits to each other if they share a comb.

===Making music===
Stringing a plant&#x27;s leaf or a piece of paper over one side of the comb and humming with cropped lips on the opposite side dramatically increases the high-frequency harmonic content of the hum produced by the human voice box, and the resulting spread sound spectrum can be modulated by changing the resonating frequency of the oral cavity. This was the inspiration for the kazoo, a membranophone.

The comb is also a lamellophone. Comb teeth have harmonic qualities of their own, determined by their shape, length, and material. A comb with teeth of unequal length, capable of producing different notes when picked, eventually evolved into the thumb piano and music box.

== Types ==

=== Chinese combs ===

In China, combs are referred to by the generic term () or () and originated about 6000 years ago during the late Neolithic period. Chinese combs are referred as () when referring to thick-tooth comb and () when referred to thin-tooth comb. A form of produced in Changzhou is the Changzhou comb; the &quot;Palace Comb Factory&quot;, also called &quot;Changzhou combs Factory&quot;, found in the city of Changzhou started to operate since the 5th century and continues to produce handmade wooden combs up to this day. were also introduced in Japan during the Nara period where they were referred by the generic name . 

=== Japanese combs ===
In Japan, combs are referred to as . Indigenous Japanese started to be used by Japanese people about 6000 years ago in the Jōmon era. In the Nara period, Chinese combs from the Tang dynasty were introduced in Japan. Another form of comb in Japan is the Satsuma comb, which started to appear around the 17th century and was produced by the samurai warriors of the Satsuma clan as a side job.

=== Liturgical comb ===

A liturgical comb is a decorated comb with used ceremonially in both Catholic and Orthodox Christianity during the Middle Ages, and in Byzantine Rite up to this day.

===Nit comb===

Specialized combs such as &quot;flea combs&quot; or &quot;nit combs&quot; can be used to remove macroscopic parasites and cause them damage by combing. A comb with teeth fine enough to remove nits is sometimes called a &quot;fine-toothed comb&quot;, as in the metaphoric usage &quot;go over [something] with a fine-toothed comb&quot;, meaning to search closely and in detail. Sometimes in this meaning, &quot;fine-toothed comb&quot; has been reanalysed as &quot;fine toothcomb&quot; and then shortened to &quot;toothcomb&quot;, or changed into forms such as &quot;the finest of toothcombs&quot;.

===Afro pick===
An Afro pick is a type of comb having long, thick teeth which is usually used on kinky or Afro-textured hair. It is longer and thinner than the typical comb, and it is sometimes worn in the hair. The history of the Afro pick dates back at least 5,000 years, as a practical tool that may also have cultural and political meaning.

===Unbreakable plastic comb===
An unbreakable plastic comb is a comb that, despite being made of plastic rather than (more expensive) metal, does not shatter into multiple pieces if dropped on a hard surface such as bathroom tiles, a hardwood floor, or pavement. Such combs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. Today most plastic combs are unbreakable as technology has reached a point of understanding the causation of brittleness in these products.

===Modern artisan combs===

Modern artisan combs crafted from a wide variety of new and recycled materials have become popular over recent years. Used skateboard decks, vinyl records, brass, titanium alloy, acrylic, sterling silver, and exotic wood are a few of the materials being used.

<doc id="373781" wikidata="Q4664047" url="?curid=373781" title="Abbey Park, Leicester">
<text>Abbey Park is a public park in Leicester, England, through which the River Soar flows. It is owned and managed by Leicester City Council and is Leicester’s premier park. It opened in 1882 on the flood plain of the River Soar, and expanded in 1932 to include the area west of the river that had formerly been the medieval St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, still bounded by large medieval walls. The park includes the archaeological sites of the Abbey and the ruins of Cavendish House, along with a wide range of decorative and recreational parkland features.

It is Grade II* listed in Historic England&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens.

==History==
In 1876 Leicester town council bought of marshy ground between the river and canal from the Earl of Dysart in order to develop flood prevention plans. Planning for this first incarnation of the park was underway by 1879, as part of designs by the borough surveyors for the relief of flooding in the area. However the design for the park itself was opened up to a competition. The winning design, with its bandstand, rustic bridges and planted gardens, was the work of William Barron, a celebrated landscape designer. It was Leicester&#x27;s first public park of significant size, and was opened on 29 May 1882 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, an event commemorated by an ornate plaque at the Abbey Park Road entrance. The park was created in an area that had previously been described as &quot;marshy ground in a poor district&quot; at a cost of over £40,000. The works included the widening and deepening of the river over a length of around a mile, with the excavated earth used to create mounds within the park, as well as the construction of stone weirs and locks. Three new bridges were constructed crossing the river. An artificial lake was created and over 33,000 trees planted. Excavations as part of the work discovered remains of animals including elephants and rhinoceros. The resulting park occupied 57 acres of land between the River Soar and the Grand Union Canal. Two lodges designed by architect Mr. J. Tait were built at the Abbey Road entrance to the park.
Although the new park was called Abbey Park, the site of the abbey itself, bounded by substantial medieval masonry and brick walls, was not within the park, but was in agricultural land on the other side of the River Soar. The exact location of the Abbey was unknown, with no standing remains other than the boundary walls and the ruins of the sixteenth century Cavendish House. Archaeological investigations of a limited nature began in the 1920s, and popular enthusiasm was fuelled by the 1922 discoveries in Egypt of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, and a hope that Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s tomb might be similarly discovered. After assorted modest excavations, the 32 acre Abbey Grounds site was donated to the city by the Earl of Dysart at the end of 1925. Several years of preliminary works, and sporadic attempts to pin down the site of the Abbey buildings, were followed by more thorough work undertaken in 1929-30. With the rise in unemployment culminating in the Great Depression the city council attempted to alleviate local poverty by employing a team of workmen to clear pernicious weeds from the overgrown site, and the architect W K Bedingfield was able to utilise this process to also search for, and then uncover the buried foundations of the Abbey buildings. A variety of graves were found, but no magnificent tomb of the sort popularly hoped for. Having exposed and mapped the extent of the Abbey Church and a variety of monastic buildings, the workforce built low walls to mark out the foundations and pier bases. They also carried out extensive repairs to the stonework and brickwork of the medieval boundary walls particularly along the north and western sides of the site, traditionally ascribed to Abbot Penny and Abbot Cloune. The north and western wall is now named Abbot Penny&#x27;s Wall, and is a Grade I listed structure. Paths were laid out across the grounds, tennis courts were built, a large oval was levelled for use as a cricket pitch, and a new stone bridge in a classical style, was built across the River Soar to link the two parts of the park.

Despite the absence of a tomb, the abbey ruins received a memorial slab to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. He died while en route from York to London on 29 November 1530. A statue of him also stands next to the Park&#x27;s cafe. Alongside the site of the 12th century Leicester Abbey, which was marked out with low stone walls, are the substantial ruins of Cavendish House (built in the 17th century by William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire incorporating the Abbey Gatehouse, and by tradition built using stone from the abbey). The house was used by Charles I after the siege of Leicester during the English Civil War in 1645; after he left, his soldiers set fire to it leaving the house gutted. The charred stone window frame is still visible today.

==Facilities and events==

The park now has an area of , and has formal gardens, a sensory garden, a boating lake and model boat lake, a miniature railway operated by Leicester Society of Model Engineers since 1949, a visitor centre, cafe, children&#x27;s play area with paddling pool, pets corner, tennis courts, a bowling green, and a bandstand. The park has regularly won the Green Flag Award, a national award made annually to parks which reach a high standard.

The park was the site of an annual flower show dating back to the 19th century, which included a swimming gala and evolved into the Abbey Park Show in the 1940s, with the addition a range of entertainment and displays. It continued until 1995, when it was abolished due to falling attendances and rising costs, although a return is periodically discussed. It was also the site of the Pageant of Leicester, held in 1932. The Abbey Park Festival was an annual music festival which was held for over twenty years from 1981. An annual bonfire and fireworks event is held in the park around Guy Fawkes Night.

The Abbey has been the site of training excavations by Archaeology students at Leicester University.

Since 2010 Abbey Park has housed the offices and studios of Takeover Radio within one of its Gatehouse Lodges.

<text>A Googlewhack was a contest to find a Google Search query that returns a single result. A Googlewhack must consist of two words found in a dictionary and was only considered legitimate if both of the search terms appear in the result. Published googlewhacks were short-lived since when published to a website, the new number of hits would become at least two: one to the original hit found, and one to the publishing site, unless a screenshot was provided. Googlewhacks generally no longer exist due to changes in Google search indexing.

==History==
The term &quot;googlewhack&quot;, coined by Gary Stock, first appeared on the web at UnBlinking on 8 January 2002. Subsequently, Stock created The Whack Stack, at googlewhack.com, to allow the verification and collection of user-submitted Googlewhacks.

Googlewhacks were the basis of British comedian Dave Gorman&#x27;s comedy tour &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot; and book of the same name. In these Gorman tells the true story of how, while attempting to write a novel for his publisher, he became obsessed with Googlewhacks and travelled across the world finding people who had authored them. Although he never completed his original novel, &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot; went on to be a &quot; Sunday Times&quot; No. 1 best seller in the UK.

Participants at Googlewhack.com discovered the sporadic &quot;cleaner girl&quot; bug in Google&#x27;s search algorithm where &quot;results 1–1 of thousands&quot; were returned for two relatively common words such as Anxiousness Scheduler or Italianate Tablesides.

Googlewhack went offline in November 2009 after Google stopped providing definition links. Gary Stock stated on the game&#x27;s web page soon afterward that he was pursuing solutions for Googlewhack to remain viable.

===Score===
Some people propose the googlewhack &quot;score&quot;, which is the product of the hits of the individual words. Thus a googlewhack score is highest when the individual words produce a large number of hits.

=== Examples ===

* comparative unicyclist
* maladroit wheezer

==Variations==

&quot;New Scientist&quot; has discussed the idea of a &quot;Googlewhackblatt&quot;, which is similar to a Googlewhack except that it involves finding a &quot;single word&quot; that produces only one Google result. Lists of these have become available, but as with Googlewhacks, they result in the Googlewhackblatt status of the word being destroyed—unless it is blocked by robots.txt or the word does not produce any Google results before it is added to the list, thus forming the Googlewhackblatt Paradox. Those words that do not produce any Google search results at all are known as &quot;Antegooglewhackblatts&quot; before they are listed—and subsequently elevated to Googlewhackblatt status if it is not blocked by robots.txt.

Feedback stories are also available on the &quot;New Scientist&quot; website, thus resulting in the destruction of any existing Googlewhackblatts that are ever printed in the magazine. Antegooglewhackblatts that are posted on the Feedback website become known as &quot;Feedbackgooglewhackblatts&quot; as their Googlewhackblatt status is created. In addition, &quot;New Scientist&quot; has more recently discovered another way to obtain a Googlewhackblatt without falling into the Googlewhackblatt Paradox. One can write the Googlewhackblatt on a website, but backward, and then search on elgooG to view the list properly while still keeping the Googlewhackblatt&#x27;s status as a Googlewhackblatt.

In contrast to Googlewhacks, many Googlewhackblatts and Antegooglewhackblatts are nonsense words or uncommon misspellings that are not in dictionaries and probably never will be.

Practical use of specially constructed Googlewhackblatts was proposed by Leslie Lamport (although he did not use the term).

==Research applications==
The probabilities of internet search result values for multi-word queries was studied in 2008 with the help of Googlewhacks. Based on data from 351 Googlewhacks from the &quot;WhackStack&quot; a list of previously documented Googlewhacks, the Heaps&#x27; law formula_1 coefficient for the indexed World Wide Web (about 8 billion pages in 2008) was measured to be formula_2. This result is in line with previous studies which used under 20,000 pages. The googlewhacks were a key in calibrating the model so that it could be extended automatically to analyse the relatedness of word pairs.

<doc id="373793" wikidata="Q247819" url="?curid=373793" title="Volkswagen Polo">
<text>The Volkswagen Polo is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by the German car manufacturer Volkswagen since 1975. It is sold in Europe and other markets worldwide in hatchback, saloon, and estate variants throughout its production run. As of 2018, six separate generations of the Polo have been produced, usually identified by a &quot;Series&quot; or &quot;Mark&quot; number.

Some generations were facelifted midway through production, with the updated versions known unofficially by an addition of the letter F to the mark number, e.g., Mk2F. Some members of the automotive press and some enthusiasts consider the facelifts to be separate models, so have used the unofficial designations Polo Mk1 to Mk7 for previous generations. Each Polo model is also identified by a two- or three-character Volkswagen Group &quot;Typ&quot; number. Official VW Polo history describes Mark I to Mark IV using either Roman numerals or Arabic numerals, with facelifted variants known as &quot;Phase II&quot; models. The body style has been varied through the life of the car, originally as a hatchback, which derived from the Audi 50. A saloon version was marketed as the Volkswagen Derby.

Volkswagen vehicles built on different platforms have carried the Polo nameplate. For example, the Volkswagen Polo Playa hatchback sold in Southern Africa in the late 1990s was a rebadged SEAT Ibiza, which has a different body shell from the Polo Mk3 sold in Europe at the same time. Starting in 1982, Volkswagen sold the Polo in Japan initially through an agreement with Japanese dealership Yanase that specializes in European and North American vehicles. Of all Volkswagens imported into Japan, only the Polo (until 2017) and the Golf (until 1997), complied with Japanese government dimension regulations until the introduction of the VW Up! in 2012.

==Related models==
The first Polo was a rebadged version of the Audi 50 hatchback launched in August 1974. The Audi 50 was discontinued in 1978, as Audi concentrated on larger luxury models. The Mk1 and Mk2 versions of the Polo were then standalone models in the Volkswagen range.

With the expansion of the Volkswagen Group: Audi (in the 1960s), SEAT (in the 1980s), and Škoda (in the 1990s) were acquired, and the platform used for the Polo was shared with other models.

The Polo shared its platform with the SEAT Ibiza Mk2. The Ibiza was actually launched before the Polo Mk3 and shared essentially all its mechanicals, the dashboard, and other interior components, although no body panels were shared between the two cars. The saloon and estate versions of the Polo Mk3 were actually rebadged SEAT Córdoba models and had no body panels in common with the Polo hatchback. The SEAT Inca and Volkswagen Caddy vans were also based on this model. The Volkswagen Lupo and SEAT Arosa were also based on a shortened version of the Polo Mk3 platform.

The Polo Mk4 continued this trend of platform sharing, with the SEAT Ibiza Mk3 and Škoda Fabia Mk1 and Mk2 both being developed on the same platform and featuring several of the same engines.

The 2009 Polo Mk5 is developed on the latest platform, known as the PQ25, the same platform used in the SEAT Ibiza Mk4 that was launched in 2008 and the Audi A1.

==Body styles==

The first Polos were hatchbacks, with the saloon being marketed as the Volkswagen Derby.

With the release of the Polo Mk2, the saloon was renamed the Volkswagen Polo Classic&#x27; and the &quot;conventional&quot;-styled hatchback (with a sloping tailgate) was renamed as a coupé, the Volkswagen Polo Coupé. Unusually, the third (and new) body that was &quot;actually&quot; marketed as the Volkswagen Polo Hatchback was closer in concept to a small estate, albeit with exactly the same wheelbase and floor pan as the coupé instead of the (longer) saloon. This latter version, also known as the squareback (in the original German brochures, &quot;steilheck&quot;, literally &quot;steep tail&quot;), amongst other nicknames, was the most popular in virtually every country where the Polo was sold. Despite the differences in silhouette and target market segment, all body types were two- or three-door only.

From the Polo Mk3 onwards, the range was more straightforwardly conventional, including unambiguous &quot;saloon&quot;, &quot;hatchback&quot;, and &quot;estate&quot; models, with only the hatchback offering both five-door and slightly shorter three-door models (both still with quite vertical tailgates, the coupé variation having been retired), the others being four or five-door only and increasing in length from hatch to saloon to estate.

===Summary===
*Three-door hatchback (Mk1 to Mk5) – the Mk2 and Mk2F were available in two separate three-door hatchback styles, one of which was badged as a coupé.
*Two-door saloon (Mk1, Mk1F, Mk2, Mk2F)
*Four-door saloon (Mk3, Mk3F, Mk4, Mk4F, Mk5, Mk6)
*Five-door hatchback (Mk3, Mk3F, Mk4, Mk4F, Mk5, Mk6)
*Five-door estate (Mk3, Mk3F)
*Five-door crossover SUV-style (two-wheel drive) hatchback (Mk4, Mk4F, Mk5)

==Mechanical layout==
The Polo is a compact car, with a traditional transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive. Mk1 Polos only came with four-cylinder petrol engines, but for the Mk2, a diesel engine was offered for the first time, although only in certain markets, others having to wait until the launch of the Mk3. The current range includes a variety of three- and four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.

Early versions used a four-speed manual transmission, whilst the current car is available with either six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent MacPherson strut front suspension, and a twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes at the front and rear drum brakes, although some recent models have all-round disc brakes.

==First generation (86; 1975) ==
The first-generation Polo, a rebadged version of the Audi 50, was introduced in 1975 and was produced until October 1981. It was also called the Volkswagen Derby. By 1979, 500,000 Polos were produced worldwide. It shared the internal designation &quot;Typ 86&quot; with the Audi 50.

The differences between the Audi and Volkswagen models were minor, with the Polo being cheaper and much more basic. The two cars were initially sold alongside each other, but the Audi 50 never sold as well, and was withdrawn in 1978. The Polo was manufactured at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg.

The manufacturer let it be known that Bertone had been involved in the styling of the Polo and its Audi sibling, although the car was essentially an in-house Audi design, with the Italian design studio&#x27;s contribution restricted to the circular extractor vent cover at the base of the C pillar, and the small &quot;flick-up&quot; at the rear end of the waistline.

In 1977, the Derby saloon was released, which was simply a Polo, identical to the hatchback from the C-pillar forward, with a large boot attached.

The Mark 1 Polo and Derby were facelifted in 1979 (unofficially referred to as the Mark 1F) with plastic bumpers, a different front grille, and a revised dashboard. The round headlights of the Derby were replaced with square ones, bringing it in line with the similar Golf-based Jetta saloon.

==Second generation (86C; 1981) ==
The Polo Mk2 (or &quot;Typ 86C&quot;) was introduced in October 1981, with the major change being the introduction of a third body style with a steep (almost vertical) rear window, in addition to a version resembling the original Mk1 shape with a diagonal rear window. The original body style was simply called the Volkswagen Polo without a suffix in most markets (&quot;steilheck&quot;, &quot;steep tail&quot; in Germany) while the more traditional design was typically marketed as the Polo Coupé - although in fact, both were three-door hatchbacks. In some markets, the &quot;steilheck&quot; design was designated a Wagon. The saloon version received the name Volkswagen Derby, although it later became the Polo Sedan. Production was expanded to Spain in the mid-1980s following Volkswagen&#x27;s takeover of SEAT. By 1983, the one-millionth Polo was produced. The second million were produced by 1986.

The Polo competed in the supermini sector with its new rivals such as the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta, and it was one of the largest superminis in production at this time, meaning that it was close to larger cars, including the Ford Escort in terms of size, space, and price. Within two years of its launch, however, it was faced with competition from a wave of new rivals, particularly the Fiat Uno and Peugeot 205.

The Polo Mk2 was used extensively by Volkswagen to develop future innovations, for example supercharging with a 40-mm G-Lader supercharger in the GT G40 version. A 60-mm G-Lader would later be used on the larger and more technically challenging G60 engine used in the Golf and Corrado.

A fuel-efficient two-cylinder diesel was prototyped in the mid-1980s with a G40 supercharger to overcome its small capacity, although this did not enter production. A high fuel-efficiency model that did make production was the petrol-engined &quot;Formel E&quot; (E for economy), introduced at the launch in 1981 with a 1.1-litre engine and from 1983 with a 1.3-litre engine, overdrive top-gear ratio and an early stop-start ignition system (called &quot;SSA&quot;), which would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and restart the engine on moving the gear lever to the left in neutral.

Similar systems were later used on the Volkswagen Golf Mk3 and various systems from other car manufacturers.

It was a popular import in the UK, competing with the likes of the Peugeot 205, Fiat Uno, and Nissan Micra. While of an outdated design, its reliability and build quality were among the best to be found on a small car of this era. In the years since then, it went on to achieve a higher survival rate than many of its competitors.

However, some engines were only available on certain markets. For example, the British market never received any diesel-engined versions of the Polo, though the diesel engine was already available on many similar cars by the end of the 1980s, namely the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Nova, and Peugeot 205.

===Facelift (1990–1994)===


The Mark II Facelift (referred to as the Mark IIF, also erroneously known as the &quot;Mark 3&quot;) was a far-reaching facelift of the MkII, including a reskin of the bodywork, launched in the autumn of 1990. The new look had square headlights, enlarged and reshaped taillights, bigger bumpers, and a new interior (dashboard and door trim). The three different body styles were maintained. Under the skin, the car received modifications to the chassis, suspension, and brakes, as well as the cosmetic differences. The new Polo retained the previous four-cylinder engines, but now as well as the carburetted 1.0-litre, a fuel-injected model was available with single-point injection, and all engines came with a catalytic converter as standard to combat tightening European emissions regulations. The saloon was only produced in Spain, and production ceased in 1992 due to disappointing sales.

At the time of launch of the Mark IIF Polo, the highest-performance model was the Polo GT. This featured a multipoint fuel-injected version of the 1272-cc engine, and a top speed more than 100 mph. This produced and had a quoted top speed of . Times for 0–60 stood at 11.1 seconds. The defining features of the GT include red piping in the bumpers, black overhead cloth, a tachometer, and a red &quot;GT&quot; badge in the grille. This was succeeded by the launch of the G40 in May 1991, displacing the GT as the most powerful Polo at the time, with a top speed around 120 mph – rivalling the likes of the Ford Fiesta XR2i, Peugeot 205 GTI, and Renault Clio 16v.

Soon after the launch of the Mark IIF, another sporting model was added to the range — a new version of the supercharged G40, now as a full production model in all markets rather than the limited batch of Mark II G40s. As with the previous model, Volkswagen Motorsport modified G40 Cup cars were sold for racing in a one-make series, the Volkswagen Polo G40 Cup. Features that define the G40 from other Polo models at the time (on top of the GT) include a bee-sting aerial, BBS cross-spoke alloy wheels, Le Mans interior trim, and front and rear red &quot;G40&quot; badges.
==Third generation (6N/6KV; 1994)==
The Mark III Polo or &quot;Typ 6N&quot;, (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mark 4&quot; by enthusiasts as it is the Polo&#x27;s fourth guise) appeared in 1994, and was a completely new model (on a new chassis), available as three- and five-door hatchback versions, the latter making VW the last major European manufacturer to finally offer rear side doors in this class. It shared its platform with the SEAT Ibiza Mark 2. This platform actually used the floorpan of the Volkswagen Golf Mk3 (a multitude of mechanical parts and all of the suspension components were interchangeable among the three models). Although the dashboard and a number of mechanical components, including engines, were shared with the Ibiza, outwardly the two cars were different, with no shared body panels.
An all-new 1.0-litre petrol engine was added to the range from launch, while the 1.3-litre petrol engine from the MK2 was briefly carried over. Also new to the range were 1.4- (8-valve or 16-valve) and 1.6-litre petrol engines, as well as a 1.9-litre diesel (with or without a turbocharger).

The saloon and estate versions of the Mark III, which debuted in 1995, were essentially rebadged version of the SEAT Córdoba, which were launched early in 1994. They were referred to internally by Volkswagen as the &quot;Typ 6KV&quot;, and shared body panels with the SEAT model rather than the Polo hatchback models, with some cosmetic alterations such as new rear and front bumpers and headlights. The Volkswagen Caddy 9K van also shares the same platform and front-end styling as the 6KV models.

The later Volkswagen Lupo and SEAT Arosa city cars were based on a shortened version of the Typ 6N platform and shared many components.

===Polo Playa (1996–2003)===

The Volkswagen Polo Playa was a model for the South African market, where the SEAT brand was not available. It was sold instead of the European Polo Mark III from 1996 until 2002 and was effectively a rebadged SEAT Ibiza Mark II. In 2002, the Mark IV Polo was adopted in South Africa, and the separate Polo Playa model was dropped.

==Fourth generation (6Q/9N/9N3; 2001) ==

Unveiled in September 2001, the all-new Mark IV (or &quot;Typ 9N&quot;, sometimes erroneously referred to as the &quot;Mark 4&quot;) model was put on sale in early 2002. It shares its platform with the SEAT Ibiza Mk3, Škoda Fabia Mk1, and Škoda Fabia Mk2. The car is all new compared to the Mark III/F and bears structural resemblance to Golf MK4 (1J). The rear taillights resemble those of the B5.5 Passat. Outwardly, the most recognisable change is the use of quadruple round headlights similar to the Lupo&#x27;s.

Volkswagen Racing rallied a Polo S1600 in the 2003 Junior World Rally Championships, winning the Turkish round. The Super 1600 developed /215 to its front wheels.
This version of the Polo was a mixed success in the United Kingdom. It sold reasonably well (though not as well as some earlier Polos), but several customer-satisfaction surveys by high-profile motoring magazines such as &quot;Top Gear&quot; gave the Polo a very low rating.

&quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s 2005 survey rated the Polo as the third-least satisfying supermini to own, with only the Fiat Punto and Rover 25 receiving worse ratings. It fell behind most of its crucial rivals, namely the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa, Citroën C3, and Peugeot 206.

A saloon version of the Mk4 Polo was produced for markets outside Europe, including most Latin American countries, South Africa and China.

== Fifth generation (6R/6C/61; 2009) ==
Volkswagen launched the fifth generation Polo (internal designation &quot;Typ 6R&quot;) at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009. For the first time in Polo&#x27;s history, the car was declared European Car of the Year, for 2010. The Polo was also declared 2010 World Car of the Year at the New York International Auto Show in April 2010. It also won What Car? Supermini of the Year 2010, as well as being awarded Japan Import Car of the Year for 2010–2011.

It shares its platform with the SEAT Ibiza Mk4 and the Audi A1. Production for the UK market started in August 2009, with first deliveries beginning in October 2009. The Polo Mark V is 44 mm longer, 32 mm wider, and sits 13 mm lower to the road than the previous generation Polo. Boot capacity is increased by 10 L to 280 L of storage space with 952 L with the seats folded down. The car is 7.5% lighter than its predecessor. The Polo has thoracic airbags and has been awarded a five-star Euro NCAP crash impact rating.

=== Saloon versions ===

====Volkswagen Vento/Polo Sedan====

In 2010, a saloon based on the Polo Mk5 platform was developed for launch in India and Russia. This saloon is known as the Vento or Polo Sedan, depending on the country. It has a length of 4,384 mm, increased wheelbase (2,552 mm) and ground clearance (168–170 mm), and had one petrol engine (1.6-litre, four-cylinder, 105 PS; coupled with either five-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox) and one diesel engine (1.6-litre, turbocharged four-cylinder common-rail, 105 PS; only five-speed manual gearbox) options available.

In several markets, it is succeeded by the Virtus, while some markets such as Mexico offered the Virtus alongside the Vento for the purpose of keeping a budget-friendly option. In Russia, the Polo Mk5-based Polo Saloon is succeeded by the Škoda Rapid-based Polo liftback.

==== Volkswagen Ameo ====

The Ameo is another saloon based on the Polo Mk5 which was released in June 2016. It was specifically developed for the Indian market which offers lower excise tax for vehicles shorter than 4 meter in length. The Ameo is more heavily derived from the hatchback body of the Polo, retaining its shorter wheelbase and the rear doors, unlike the larger Vento/Polo Saloon. It was discontinued in 2020 due to low demand.

==Sixth generation (AW/BZ; 2017) ==

The sixth generation Polo was unveiled on 16 June 2017, with production starting at the Pamplona plant on 17 July 2017. Built on the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s MQB A0 platform, it is the first generation Polo not to be available as a 3-door model.

The boot space has increased by around 25% from 280 to 351 litres. As an option, this generation introduces the fully digital instrument cluster called &quot;Active Info Digital Display Cockpit&quot;, the first car in the small car segment to do so. In addition, the Polo VI introduces a series of driver assistance systems such as traffic sign recognition, blind spot assistant and automatic emergency braking. On 21 April 2021, it received a mid-cycle facelift.

== GTI ==
The Volkswagen Polo GTI is a hot hatch version of the Polo.

===Mk2 Polo GT G40 and Mk2F Polo G40===
The Volkswagen Polo GTI can trace its roots back to the original hot Polo, the supercharged 1.3-litre G40. It was sold in the United Kingdom between 1990 and 1994 in the form of the Mk2F Polo but was available during the late 1980s in limited numbers in Europe in the form of the Mk2 Polo GT G40. The car was expensive compared to its rivals of the time, so did not sell in vast numbers. This makes it highly collectible today, and according to &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;a potential future classic.&quot;

===Mk3 Polo GTI===
After production of the G40 ended in 1994, Volkswagen decided to release the first GTI-branded Polo in a limited batch of just 3000. It was released in 1995 and available only in left-hand drive. It featured a 1.6-litre, 16-valve engine. The GTI was not available in the UK at any stage during its limited production, so as of 1994, the UK only had the 1.4-litre, 16-valve as a model with any sporting intent.

====Facelift (6N2)====
Between 1999 and 2002, Volkswagen offered two sporting models — the 16V and GTI. The 16V came with the 1.4-litre, 16-valve (V), engine, and had options such as 15-in Spa alloys and air conditioning. However, the GTI – available only in three- or five-door hatchback body styles in three colours being red, silver, and black, used a 1.6-litre 16-V engine with variable valve timing. External changes included a deeper front splitter with honeycomb mesh grilles, lowered sports suspension (by 10 mm), a subtle rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, fog lights, and 15&quot; BBS RXII split rims for the wheels, bearing 195/45/15 tyres. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, xenon headlights with a headlight washer system, a six-disc CD autochanger with a GAMMA head unit, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel, handbrake and gearstick, chrome inserts, and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Polo GTI Mk3F, however, never got the new six-speed gearbox that was introduced in the smaller Volkswagen Lupo GTI, which shared the same engine.

===Mk4 Polo GT===
With the introduction of the 2002 Polo, the GTI model was discontinued and was given no direct replacement. A GT model, though, was produced, featuring the same 1.9-litre TDI, engine found in the popular Škoda Fabia vRS and SEAT Ibiza FR TDI, as well as a six-speed gearbox. Although this model had a relatively slow 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time over 9 seconds, it did have impressive midrange clout with torque figures of 310 Nm (228 lb-ft).

===Mk4 Polo GTI===
The GTI was not released until late 2005, after yet another Polo revamp was reintroduced. This time it boasted a 1.8-litre, engine, which had been used in models from the Mk4 Volkswagen Golf GTI to the Audi A6. Despite the impressive figures, this new model lacked the standard features of the Polo GTI Mk3, with xenon headlights not even on the options list, and fully digital climate control only being an expensive option. Although faster than the 2000–2002 Polo GTI, the newer model was also seen as being off the pace when compared to its rivals, most of which are now nudging . In Europe, this led to VW quickly beefing up the Polo further to create the Polo GTI Cup Edition, which was tuned to around and featured more aggressive styling, 17&quot; wheels and larger diameter 312mm front disc brakes. The Polo GTI Cup Edition has 177 bhp, 29 bhp more than the standard Polo GTI. The standard Polo GTI model completes 0–100 km/h in 8.2 seconds, but in the Cup, it completes 0–100 km/h in 7.5 seconds.

===Mk5 Polo GTI===
The Mk5 Polo GTI was launched at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The new GTI is powered by VW&#x27;s award-winning 1.4-litre TSI engine (adapted from that used in the current Scirocco), which uses both a supercharger and turbocharger to provide torque throughout the revolution range. The Mk5 Polo is also 7.5% lighter than its predecessor and with a increase in power over the previous generation Polo GTI it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.9 seconds. The Mk5 Polo also includes features not found on previous generation Polos, such as touch-screen satellite navigation and a seven-speed version of VW&#x27;s DSG gearbox as standard.

====Facelift====
The Mk5 Polo GTI facelift was launched in 2015. It featured a new 1.8-litre turbocharged engine, which had been developed by Audi. It produced 189 bhp and was capable of sprinting from 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds (real world test). It was now also available with a manual transmission.

===Mk6 Polo GTI===
The Mk6 Polo GTI was launched in 2017. It features a slightly detuned version of the 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine from the Mk7 Golf GTI. It produced , an increase over the previous 1.8-litre engine, and was capable of getting to in under 6.7 seconds. Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dq250 DSG. Along with the engine, the GTI version came standard with lowered suspension, GTI badges, GTI bumpers, 17-in wheels, sill extensions, bigger brakes, red brake calipers, twin exhausts, tartan seats, sport steering, red stitching, and a roof spoiler. It is equipped with a standard ‘sport’ chassis and optional ‘Sport Select’ chassis. 

==== Facelift ====
== Performance versions and motorsport ==
Volkswagen helped consolidate the pre-eminence of the so-called hot hatch genre of high-performance hatchbacks with their Golf GTI in 1975 and has produced a number of performance versions of the Polo. The first of these was the Polo &quot;GT&quot; version of the Polo Mk1F.

The Polo Mk2 and Mk2F were available as supercharged G40 models. The GT G40 with its 1.3-litre engine could reach in 8.1 seconds from standstill and had a maximum speed of . It was used by Volkswagen to set a number of world endurance speed records, such as the 1.3-litre class records for speed over 24 hours and speed over a distance of .

The fastest version of the Polo Mk3 on the United Kingdom market was the 1.6-litre, 16-V, model. A Polo GTI model was also produced, but only in a limited edition in Germany, and this was the first time the GTI label had been used for a Polo. A GTI version of the Polo Mk3F, with a 1.6-litre petrol engine was also produced.

In 2004, Volkswagen Individual, a specialist division of Volkswagen, produced a limited number of (Polo Mk4) Club Sports with a 1.8-litre, turbocharged engine producing . Available only in Germany, this was based on the one-make racing series Polo Cup Racer hatchback. The Club Sport came with a roll cage inside the vehicle and Recaro racing seats as standard.

A GTI version of the Polo Mk4F was launched in 2006. These feature styling similar to that of the contemporary Golf GTI and a turbocharged 20-V, , 1.8-litre petrol engine. It has a 0–100 km/h time of 8.2 seconds and a top speed of .

Volkswagen Individual have also engineered an even faster Polo called the Polo GTI Cup Edition. Available with the same 1.8-litre, turbocharged engine, albeit with , its claimed 0–100 km/h is 7.5 seconds, and it has a claimed top speed of .

Volkswagen Racing in South Africa rallied a four-wheel drive Polo Mk4F that shared some components with its sister World Rally Championship Škoda Fabia; the S2000 has a 2.0-litre, engine. Mk4 Polos have been entered into the Junior World Rally Championship. The Polo also competed in the Russian Touring Car Championship.

A number of one-make race series were made of the Polo, starting with the G40 Cup for Polo Mk2 and Mk2F G40 versions. The current Polo Cup championship for cars is a support race at rounds of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.

Sébastien Ogier won the FIA World Rally Championship for Drivers in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 driving a Volkswagen Polo R WRC.

==Sales==

The sales of Volkswagen Polo set a benchmark for Volkswagen, which sold more than 12 million cars globally so far; in February 2010 Volkswagen produced the 11,111,111th Polo worldwide at the celebration event of its first production anniversary in Pune, India. In 2010, its first full year on sale in the United Kingdom, more than 45,000 units were sold. It was the UK&#x27;s sixth-best selling new car.

11 years later, in 2021, the Polo has maintained consistent sales figures with it being the fifth best-selling car in the UK in 2021 having had 30,634 new registrations throughout the year.

In South Africa, the previous model Polo is produced and branded as the Polo Vivo, and is consistently the top-selling passenger car.

<doc id="373805" wikidata="Q1185824" url="?curid=373805" title="Democracy Now!">
<text>Democracy Now! is an hour-long TV, radio, and Internet news program based in Manhattan and hosted by journalists Amy Goodman (who also acts as the show&#x27;s executive producer), Juan González, and Nermeen Shaikh. The show, which airs live each weekday at 8 a.m. Eastern Time, is broadcast on the Internet and via more than 1,400 radio and television stations worldwide.

The program combines news reporting, interviews, investigative journalism and political commentary from a progressive perspective. It documents social movements, struggles for justice, activism challenging corporate power and operates as a watchdog outfit regarding the effects of American foreign policy. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; views as its aim to give activists and the citizenry a platform to debate people from &quot;the establishment&quot;. The show is described as progressive by fans as well as critics, but Goodman rejects that label, calling the program a global newscast that has &quot;people speaking for themselves&quot;. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; describes its staff as &quot;includ[ing] some of this country&#x27;s leading progressive journalists.&quot;

Democracy Now Productions, the independent media nonprofit organization that produces &quot;Democracy Now!,&quot; is funded entirely through contributions from listeners, viewers, and foundations such as the Park Foundation, Ford Foundation, Lannan Foundation, and the J.M. Kaplan Fund. It has over $36 million in assets and about a $10 million annual budget. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; does not accept advertisers, corporate underwriting or government funding. The show has become popular on the internet, and from the late 2010s onward, has been involved in pioneering extensive media cooperation in the public sphere across the US.

== Background ==

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, also called &quot;Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report&quot;, &quot;Democracy Now Independent Global News&quot;, or &quot;Democracy News&quot;, was founded on February 19, 1996, at WBAI in New York City by journalists Amy Goodman, Juan González, Larry Bensky, Salim Muwakkil, and Julie Drizin. It originally aired on five Pacifica Radio stations. Goodman is the program&#x27;s principal host, with Juan González and Nermeen Shaikh as frequent co-hosts. Jeremy Scahill, an investigative reporter and co-founding editor for &quot;The Intercept&quot; and Drop Site News, has been a frequent contributor since 1997.

The show covered the Seattle protests (1999) targeting the World Trade Organization.

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; partnered with Free Speech TV (FSTV) and Deep Dish Television to cover the 2000 Democratic National Convention. The event marked a turning point for &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, as in addition to its presence on radio, it became a television show. From then onward, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has had their content promoted and broadcast on FSTV.

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; began broadcasting on television every weekday shortly after September 11, 2001, and is the only public medium in the U.S. that airs simultaneously on satellite and cable television, radio, and the internet.

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has been critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. After data disclosures by the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks regarding the TPP in 2010, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has given a significant media platform and extensively covered them since, and like some other news networks cooperated with its leader Julian Assange. Coverage of WikiLeaks by &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; was sympathetic.

In 2011, reporter Sharif Abdel Kouddous covered the Egyptian revolution for &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;.

On February 19, 2016, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; marked 20 years on the air with an hour-long retrospective look back at &quot;two decades of independent, unembedded news&quot;, with highlights chosen from over 5,000 episodes. Amy Goodman also published a book entitled &quot;Democracy Now!: 20 Years Covering the Movements Changing America&quot;, and launched a 100-city tour across the United States to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, with scheduled broadcasts of the show recorded during her travels.

=== Studios ===

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; began as a radio program broadcast from the studios of WBAI, a local Pacifica Radio station in New York City. In early September 2001, amid a months-long debate over the mission and management of Pacifica, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; was forced out of the WBAI studios. Goodman took the program to the Downtown Community Television Center located in a converted firehouse building in New York City&#x27;s Chinatown, where the program began to be televised. Only a few days later on September 11, 2001 &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; was the closest national broadcast to Ground Zero. On that day Goodman and colleagues continued reporting beyond their scheduled hour-long time slot in what became an eight-hour marathon broadcast. Following 9/11, in addition to radio and television, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; expanded their multimedia reach to include cable, satellite radio, Internet, and podcasts.

In November 2009, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; left their broadcast studio in the converted DCTV firehouse, where they had broadcast for eight years, and moved to a repurposed graphic arts building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. In 2010, the new 8,500-square-foot &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; studio became the first radio or television studio in the nation to receive LEED Platinum certification, the highest rating awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council.

=== Syndication ===
&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; is the flagship program of the Pacifica Radio network. It also airs on several NPR member stations. The television simulcast airs on public-access television and several PBS stations; by satellite on Free Speech TV and Link TV, and free-to-air on C Band. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; is also available on the Internet as downloadable and streaming audio and video. In total, nearly 1,400 television and radio stations broadcast &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; worldwide.

== Awards and reception ==
&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and its staff have received several journalism awards, including the Gracie Award from American Women in Radio &amp; Television; the George Polk Award for its 1998 radio documentary &quot;Drilling and Killing: Chevron and Nigeria&#x27;s Oil Dictatorship&quot;, on the Chevron Corporation and the deaths of two Nigerian villagers protesting an oil spill; and Goodman with Allan Nairn won Robert F. Kennedy Memorial&#x27;s First Prize in International Radio for their 1993 report, &quot;Massacre: The Story of East Timor&quot;, which involved first-hand coverage of genocide during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.

On October 1, 2008, Goodman was named as a recipient of the 2008 Right Livelihood Award, in connection with her years of work establishing &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and in 2009, she, like her frequent guest Glenn Greenwald, was awarded the first annual Izzy Award (named after journalist I. F. &quot;Izzy&quot; Stone) for &quot;special achievement in independent media&quot;. Her co-host Juan González was inducted into the New York chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; Hall of Fame on November 19, 2015.

== 2008 Republican National Convention arrests ==
Three journalists with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;—including principal host Amy Goodman, and news producers Nicole Salazar and Sharif Abdel Kouddous—were detained by police during their reporting on the 2008 Republican National Convention protests in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Salazar was filming as officers in full riot gear charged her area. As she yelled &quot;Press!&quot; she was knocked down and told to put her face in the ground while another officer dragged her backward by her leg across the pavement. The video footage of the incident was immediately posted on the Internet, leading to a large public outcry against her arrest. When a second producer, Kouddous, approached, he too was arrested, and charged with a felony. According to a press release by &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, Goodman herself was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers had established a line of &quot;crowd control&quot;, and ordered Goodman to move back. Goodman claims she was arrested after being pulled through the police line by an officer, and subsequently (as well as Kouddous) had her press credentials for the convention physically stripped from her by a Secret Service agent. All were held on charges of &quot;probable cause for riot&quot;. A statement was later released by the city announcing that all &quot;misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists&quot; would be dropped. The felony charges against Salazar and Kouddous were also dropped.

Goodman, Salazar, and Kouddous subsequently filed a lawsuit against the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis as well as other defendants. According to Baher Asmy of the Center for Constitutional Rights, &quot;[a]ll three plaintiffs that are journalists with &quot;Democracy Now&quot; reached a final settlement with the city of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the United States Secret Service, that will resolve the claims that they had against them from unlawful and quite violent arrests.&quot; The settlement includes $100,000 in compensation and a promise of police training.

== 2016 North Dakota access pipeline protests ==

In September 2016, an arrest warrant for criminal trespass was issued for Amy Goodman after covering for &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; the Dakota Access Pipeline protests during which guards unleashed dogs and pepper spray on protesters in Morton County, North Dakota. An arrest warrant was reportedly also issued for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka.

Goodman elected to turn herself in. Three days before the court date, the charges were increased to engaging in a riot, which carried a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $1,500 fine. On October 17, 2016, the judge quickly dismissed the charges, but Morton County prosecutors insisted the case is still open and that they may pursue further charges in the future. Goodman asserted the importance of freedom of the press and said that &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; would continue covering the developing situation in North Dakota.

==Notable guests, interviews, and on-air debates==

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has featured appearances from Green Party candidate Jill Stein during the 2016 United States presidential election.

== Listenership ==

According to a 2016–17 Quantcast survey, &quot;democracynow.org reaches over 395K U.S. monthly people&quot;.
