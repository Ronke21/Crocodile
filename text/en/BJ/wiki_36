<text>; ) is a market town and community in Carmarthenshire and the preserved county of Dyfed, Wales. It is located on the Loughor estuary and is also the largest town in the county of Carmarthenshire. 

The town is north-west of Swansea and south-east of Carmarthen. At the 2021 census the community had a population of 25,366, and the built up area had a population of 42,155. The local authority was Llanelli Borough Council when the county of Dyfed existed, but it has been under Carmarthenshire County Council since 1996.

==Name==
===Spelling===
The anglicised spelling “Llanelly” was used until 1966, when it was changed to Llanelli after a local public campaign. It remains in the name of a local historic building, Llanelly House, and this is sometimes confused with the village and parish of Llanelly, in south-east Wales near Abergavenny.

Llanelly in Victoria, Australia was named after this town of Llanelli, using the spelling current at that time.

==History==

The beginnings of Llanelli can be found on the lands of present-day Parc Howard. An Iron Age hill fort once stood which was called &quot;Bryn-Caerau&quot; (hill of the forts). Evidence suggests there were five hill forts from Old Road to the Dimpath. During the Roman conquest of Wales it is unknown whether the area of Llanelli was part of the Silures tribe or the Demetae tribe. There is evidence of a Roman camp near St Elli shopping centre but it is unknown when it was built, and it was completely abandoned shortly after construction either due to the Romans thinking the area was completely worthless or due to a raid by either rebellious local Britons or an Irish raid. During the post-Roman period, the area of Llanelli may have been heavily populated with Pagans as there&#x27;s evidence of a pagan worship temple under the Saint Elli church, it may have had frequent raids from Brycheiniog and Dyfed in order to Christianise the area to which it would eventually fall into Dyfed. During the early medieval period, it is said a saint named Elli, or Ellyw, who in legend is the son or daughter of King Brychan established a church on the banks of the Afon Lliedi. The original church would have been a wooden or partly stone, thatched structure. According to early Welsh transcripts, the church of Carnwyllion, i.e. the mother church of the cwmwd, was at Llanelli. The current St Elli&#x27;s Church dates from the 14th century although extensive restorations were completed in 1911.

According to the Red Book of Hergest during the Norman invasion of Wales Rhys Ieuanc and his uncle Maelgwn ap Rhys took the allegiance of all the Welsh of the Kingdom of Dyfed apart from one region. Cemais would not pay allegiance and thus Rhys Ieuanc and his uncle, Maelgwn ap Rhys, attacked and pillaged the area moving on to attack the castles at Narberth and Maenclochog. At this time Rhys Ieuanc moved against Cedweli and Carnwyllion with his forces besieging and burning Carnwyllion Castle in 1215.

Llanelli was industrialised in the early 19th century as the global centre for tinplate production. Lying near the Western fringe of the South Wales Coal Field, Llanelli played an important role in industry, with coal exported through three small docks along with the copper and tin produced within the town itself. Although Llanelli is not located within the South Wales valleys, coal from the Gwendraeth and the Loughor Valleys was transported to Llanelli for export. The Stepney Family and other prominent families (including the Raby family, Howard family and Cowell family), played an important role in the development of the town. Aside from industry, Llanelli is also renowned for its pottery, which has a unique cockerel hand-painted on each item. A collection of this pottery can bee seen at the Llanelli Museum in Parc Howard.

Llanelli people are sometimes nicknamed &quot;Turks&quot;. There are several theories on this nickname: Llanelli allowed the docking of a Turkish ship when Swansea dockers were on strike in the 1920s, Llanelli tinplate workers wrapped their heads like turbans to deal with sweat, or it is a reference to the 4th Battalion of the Welch Regiment fighting against the Ottoman Empire in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.

The built up area, as defined by the Office for National Statistics, extends beyond the Llanelli community to include parts of the neighbouring Llanelli Rural community.

In 2024 it was announced that the town would be seeking city status.

==Culture and language==
===National Eisteddfod===
Llanelli hosted the National Eisteddfod six times between 1895 and 2014.

===Welsh language===
In the mid-20th century, Llanelli was the world&#x27;s largest town in which more than half the inhabitants spoke a Celtic language. It is ranked as the seventh largest urban area in Wales. According to the 2011 UK Census returns, 23.7 per cent of Llanelli town residents habitually spoke Welsh. However, the area around Llanelli is a Welsh stronghold, in which 56 per cent do so in communities such as Llwynhendy and Burry Port.

During the 1950s, Trefor and Eileen Beasley campaigned to get Llanelli Rural Council to distribute tax papers in Welsh by refusing to pay taxes until their demand was met. The council reacted by sending in the bailiffs and selling their furniture to recover the money owed. The Beasleys&#x27; neighbours bought the furniture and returned it to them. The council finally reversed its policy in the 1960s, giving Welsh equal status with English.

==Economy==
In 1991 Llanelli was a distinct travel to work area, but a 2001-based revision has merged it into a wider one of Swansea Bay.

===Manufacture===
Several firms, including Tata Steel Europe tinplate at Trostre and Dyfed Steels, are based in the Llanelli area and service the automotive industry. The Technium Performance Engineering Centre was developed at Llanelli Gate as a business incubator for businesses in the automotive, motor sport and aerospace sectors.

The traditional industries of Llanelli have gradually declined in recent decades. Local government has responded by seeking to attract tourism with developments such as the Machynys Golf Course, retail parks at Trostre and Pemberton, and the Millennium Coastal Park. The core shopping area has now moved largely from the town centre to the Trostre/Pemberton area.

===Brewing===
The longstanding Felinfoel Brewery continues in Felinfoel, just outside the town.

Rev. James Buckley was an ordained Methodist minister, born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1770, who after moving to Llanelli towards the end of the 18th century became involved in establishing a small brewery. After the death of the owner, Buckley gained possession of the brewery and changed its name to Buckley&#x27;s. In 1998, the brewery was bought by Brains Brewery, which transferred production to its facility in Cardiff. However, Brains continues to produce &quot;The Reverend James&quot;, a bitter named in Buckley&#x27;s memory. Since then the Llanelli brewery has been partly demolished.

===Leisure and tourism===
In the past decade, the longstanding emphasis on heavy industry has shifted towards the tertiary sector employment in leisure and tourism. Ongoing developments include the new Llanelli Scarlets rugby stadium, the Old Castle Works leisure village (see below) and a National Hunt racecourse at Ffos Las near Trimsaran. Machynys Ponds, a Site of Special Scientific Interest notable for its dragonfly population, lies a mile to the south.

==Religion==
===Church in Wales===

The parish church of St Elli has a medieval tower. The body of the church was rebuilt by G. F. Bodley in 1905–1906. It is a Grade II* listed building. Several other churches in the town are also listed buildings, but made redundant by the Church in Wales and now in private ownership. They include All Saints&#x27; and St Alban&#x27;s.

===Nonconformism===
From the early 19th to late 20th centuries, Llanelli was a major centre of Welsh nonconformism. At the end of the Second World War there were 22 chapels in the town. The history of the chapels has been chronicled in a book by the former BBC journalist Huw Edwards. Edwards noted that many of the chapels had closed and others were in sharp decline, he suggested that if the decline continued, only two or three were likely to survive as functioning chapels in the 2020s.

The most well known of Llanelli&#x27;s chapels is probably Capel Als, where David Rees was a minister for many years in the 19th century. Llanelli had seven other Independent (Congregationalist) chapels, namely Tabernacle, Lloyd Street, Siloah now closed, Soar now closed, Ebenezer, Dock Chapel, and Park Church (the only chapel where services were conducted in English). The Tabernacle Chapel built in 1872–1873 by John Humphreys of Morriston overlooks the Town Hall. There is a prominent four-pillared Corinthian arcade at the entrance. The building was Grade II* listed in December 1992. It is used as a venue by the Llanelli Choral Society. Other listed chapels include Bethel Baptist Chapel in Copperworks Road, Park Congregational Chapel, Zion Baptist Chapel at Island Place, and Hall Street Methodist Church.

Situated on Waunlanyrafon, across the road from the police station, is the Roman Catholic Church, Our Lady Queen of Peace Church.

Llanelli has an Islamic centre on Station Road and Baptist churches spread throughout the town and surrounding areas.

==Sport==

===Rugby union===
The town&#x27;s rugby union teams – the Scarlets, who compete in the Pro14, and Llanelli RFC in the Welsh Premiership – play at &quot;Parc y Scarlets&quot;, which opened in November 2008 in Pemberton. Previously they had played at Stradey Park, home to Llanelli RFC for over 130 years and one venue used for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, hosting the match between Argentina and Samoa on 10 October 1999.

The Welsh folk song &quot;Sosban Fach&quot; (Little Saucepan) is mostly associated with Llanelli RFC.

Many rugby clubs have notable scalps collected from touring international sides but Llanelli has in its rugby history one of the greatest scalps ever. On 31 October 1972, in one of the most famous results in rugby union history, Llanelli beat the New Zealand national team 9–3 in front of around 20,000 spectators. Llanelli centre Roy Bergiers scored the only try of the game, charging down a clearance by All Black scrum-half Lin Colling after a penalty from Phil Bennett rebounded back into play off the crossbar.

There is a strong junior rugby core, including club sides such as Felinfoel, New Dock Stars, Llangennech and the Llanelli Wanderers. In 2005, Coedcae School won the Inter-Schools Cup of Wales with an 8–5 victory over Brynteg Comprehensive.

===Rugby league===
Llanelli&#x27;s West Wales Raiders play in RFL League 1, the third tier of rugby league in England and Wales. The club is based at Stebonheath Park.

===Association football===
Stebonheath Park is the home of football club Llanelli A.F.C., which plays in the Cymru South. The town has many active local teams and tournaments such as the 2018 Challenge Cup, where West End United beat Trostre Sports AFC.

===Bowls===
Llanelli hosts the annual Llanelli Open Bowls Tournaments, the oldest and most prestigious of which, the Roberts-Rolfe Open Singles event, has been run since 1926 and has a first prize of £600. The contests are held from July to September in Parc Howard.

===Golf===
The Llanelli area has two golf courses: the Machynys Peninsula Golf &amp; Country Club which hosted the Wales Ladies Championship of Europe from 2005 until 2008, and Glyn Abbey Golf Club, which was named Welsh Golf Club of the Year 2009.

===Snooker===
Llanelli is the birthplace and home of Terry Griffiths OBE (1947–2024), snooker world champion in 1979 and runner-up in 1988. Later a coach and snooker commentator, he ran the Terry Griffiths Matchroom in the town centre.

==Media==
Llanelli is home to Tinopolis, one of Britain&#x27;s largest independent media producers. It has subsidiaries that produce over 2,500 hours of broadcast television, including English language programmes such as &quot;Question Time&quot; for the BBC and Welsh-language television programs such as &quot;Wedi 7&quot; for S4C.

Coverage of local affairs appears in two papers, the &quot;Llanelli Star&quot; founded in 1909 and Llanelli Herald launched in 2015. Online coverage is found on &quot;Llanelli Online&quot;. The main county-wide radio station is Radio Carmarthenshire.

It was built for Thomas Stepney, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthenshire, in 1714. John Wesley, the early leader of the Methodist movement, stayed there several times. It also featured in the first series of the BBC television show, &quot;Restoration&quot;.
*Parc Howard Museum is set in the grounds of Parc Howard. The museum houses a collection of Llanelly Pottery (so spelt), an art collection and material on the history of the town.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Llanelli, at community (town) and county level: Llanelli Town Council (Cyngor Tref Llanelli) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council is based at the Old Vicarage on Town Hall Square. Carmarthenshire County Council also has offices in the town, at Ty Elwyn on Town Hall Square, and a customer service centre at 36 Stepney Street.

Some of the built up area extends into the neighbouring community of Llanelli Rural, which has a separate community council. The community of Llanelli is bordered by those of Llanelli Rural, Llanrhidian Higher and Llanrhidian Lower, the last two being across the Loughor Estuary in the City and County of Swansea.

The town forms part of the Llanelli parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Nia Griffith MP of the Labour Party. The Llanelli Senedd constituency is represented by Labour&#x27;s Lee Waters MS.

===Administrative history===
Llanelli was an ancient parish, which covered the town and surrounding rural areas. The parish was subdivided into five hamlets: Berwick, Glyn, Hêngoed, Westfa and a Llanelli hamlet, also known as the borough hamlet, covering the town itself. The borough hamlet was administered as a borough by the 17th century, run by a corporation led by a portreeve. A government survey of boroughs in 1835 found that the borough corporation had no official charter and very few powers. The borough was therefore left unreformed when the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed most ancient boroughs across the country into municipal boroughs.

In order to provide more modern forms of local government, the borough hamlet was made a local board district in 1850, run by an elected local board. The board was given the property of the old borough corporation, which then ceased to function. Local board districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so the part of Llanelli parish outside the urban district was made a separate parish called Llanelli Rural.
Llanelli Town Hall was completed in 1896 to serve as the urban district council&#x27;s headquarters. Llanelly Urban District was upgraded to a municipal borough in 1913. The official spelling of the borough&#x27;s name was Llanelly until 1966 when it was changed to Llanelli.

The municipal borough of Llanelli was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Llanelli was created covering the area of the former borough, with its community council taking the name Llanelli Town Council. District-level functions passed to the new Llanelli Borough Council, which covered surrounding rural areas and nearby towns as well as Llanelli itself. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. The borough of Llanelli and county of Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council.

Llanelli Waterside, a joint venture between Carmarthenshire County Council and the Welsh Assembly Government, aims to transform the waterfront into a business, leisure and residential community. There are two seafront housing developments under construction. Pentre Nicklaus Village, located on the Machynys Peninsula has been criticised for being above the price range for local people. Pentre Doc Y Gogledd (North Dock Village) in the historic North Dock area is nearing completion by the firm of David McLean.

<text>Ficus rubiginosa, the rusty fig or Port Jackson fig (&quot;damun&quot; in the Dharug language), is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia in the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;. Beginning as a seedling that grows on other plants (hemiepiphyte) or rocks (lithophyte), &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; matures into a tree high and nearly as wide with a yellow-brown buttressed trunk. The leaves are oval and glossy green and measure from long and wide.

The fruits are small, round, and yellow, and can ripen and turn red at any time of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit is in the form of a syconium, an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species &quot;Pleistodontes imperialis&quot;, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots, and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot; was described by French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines in 1804, from a type specimen whose locality is documented simply as &quot;New Holland&quot;. In searching for the type specimen, Australian botanist Dale Dixon found one from the herbarium of Desfontaines at Florence Herbarium and one from the herbarium of Étienne Pierre Ventenat at Geneva. As Ventenat had used Desfontaines&#x27; name, Dixon selected the Florence specimen to be the type in 2001. The specific epithet &quot;rubiginosa&quot; related to the rusty coloration of the undersides of the leaves. Indeed, &quot;rusty fig&quot; is an alternate common name; others include &quot;Illawarra fig&quot; and &quot;Port Jackson fig&quot;. It was known as &quot;damun&quot; (pron. &quot;tam-mun&quot;) to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.

In 1806, German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow gave it the botanical name &quot;Ficus australis&quot; in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, but this is a &quot;nomen illegitimum&quot; as the species already had a validly published name. That link https://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?taxon_id=38740 is now this: https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/511809. Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini broke up the genus &quot;Ficus&quot; in 1844, placing the species in the genus &quot;Urostigma&quot; as &quot;U. rubiginosum&quot;. In 1862, Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel described &quot;Urostigma leichhardtii&quot; from material collected from Cape Cleveland, Queensland, noting it had affinities to &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot;. In 1867, he placed &quot;Urostigma&quot; as a subgenus in the reunited &quot;Ficus&quot;, which resulted in the taxon becoming &quot;Ficus leichhardtii&quot;. Miquel also described &quot;Ficus leichhardtii&quot; variety &quot;angustata&quot; from Whitsunday Island, later classified as &quot;F. shirleyana&quot; by Czech botanist Karel Domin. Queensland state botanist Frederick Manson Bailey described &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; variety &quot;pubescens&quot; in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it &quot;Ficus baileyana&quot;. All these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from (and hence reclassified as) &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; by Dixon in 2001.

In a study published in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase region, in the first molecular analysis of the section &quot;Malvanthera&quot;. They found &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; to be most closely related to the rainforest species &quot;F. watkinsiana&quot; and two rock-growing (lithophytic) species of arid northern Australia (&quot;F. atricha&quot; and &quot;F. brachypoda&quot;). They classified these species in a new series &quot;Rubiginosae&quot; in the subsection &quot;Platypodeae&quot;. Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).

Joseph Maiden described variety &quot;lucida&quot; in 1902, and Bailey described variety &quot;glabrescens&quot; in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on the basis of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey&#x27;s description more closely matched Dixon&#x27;s findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey&#x27;s name and reclassified it as &quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot; forma &quot;glabrescens&quot; in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the nominate form.

==Description==
A spreading, densely-shading tree when mature, &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; may reach or more in height, although it rarely exceeds in the Sydney region.

The trunk is buttressed and can reach in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte, or high lithophyte.

Alternately arranged on the stems, the ovate (egg-shaped), (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from long and wide, on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°.

As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (compound flower) known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the fig&#x27;s inner surface into a hollow cavity. &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.

It closely resembles its relative, the Moreton Bay fig (&quot;F. macrophylla&quot;). Having similar ranges in the wild, they are often confused. 

The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; are the easiest distinguishing features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (&quot;F. obliqua&quot;), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12 mm long and 4–11 mm in diameter, compared with 7–17 mm long and 8–17 mm diameter for &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot;″s range spans the entire eastern coastline of Australia, from the top of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to the vicinity of Bega on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland and the far western plains in New South Wales. &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; f. &quot;rubiginosa&quot; and &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; f. &quot;glabrescens&quot; are found over most of the range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic, and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.

&quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is found in rainforest, rainforest margins, gullies, riverbank habitat, vine thickets, and rocky hillsides. It is found on limestone outcrops in Kanangra-Boyd National Park. Fig seedlings often grow from cracks in stone where seeds have been lodged, in locations such as cliffs and rock faces in natural environments, or in brickwork on buildings and elsewhere in the urban environment. The soils it grows on are often well-drained and low in nutrients. They are derived from sandstone, quartzite, and basalt. In the Sydney region, &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; grows from sea level to 1000 m (3500 ft) altitude, in areas with an average yearly rainfall of . &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is largely sympatric with &quot;F. obliqua&quot;, though its range extends further west into dryer regions than the latter species.

Outside its native range, &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; has naturalised to some degree in urban Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, as well as New Zealand, Hawaii and California, and Mediterranean Europe. &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; has been planted widely in Malta since the early 1990s but has not been observed to fruit.

==Ecology==
The fruit is consumed by many bird species including the rose-crowned fruit dove (&quot;Ptilinopus regina&quot;), wompoo fruit dove (&quot;P. magnificus&quot;), wonga pigeon (&quot;Leucosarcia melanoleuca&quot;), topknot pigeon (&quot;Lopholaimus antarcticus&quot;), Pacific koel (&quot;Eudynamys orientalis&quot;), Australasian swamphen (&quot;Porphyrio melanotus&quot;), Australian king parrot (&quot;Alisterus scapularis&quot;), Australasian figbird (&quot;Sphecotheres vieilloti&quot;), green catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus crassirostris&quot;), regent bowerbird (&quot;Sericulus chrysocephalus&quot;), satin bowerbird (&quot;Ptilonorhynchus violaceus&quot;) and pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), as well as the mammalian grey-headed flying fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;), and spectacled flying fox (&quot;Pteropus conspicillatus&quot;). It is one of several plant species used as food by the endangered Coxen&#x27;s fig parrot. Many fruits drop onto the ground around the tree, though others are dispersed by animals that eat them.

The thrips species &quot;Gynaikothrips australis&quot; feeds on the underside of new leaves of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot;, as well as &quot;F. obliqua&quot; and &quot;F. macrophylla&quot;. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue, and a gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and live for around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night, wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. Psyllids have almost defoliated trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney in spring.

&quot;P. imperialis&quot; crossed the waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and seedlings of the previously infertile trees of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded as far south as Napier. &quot;P. imperialis&quot; has been transported to Hawaii, California, and Israel, where it has been observed to pollinate its host.

They can live to 100 years or more and have been known to resprout after bushfire, bearing fruit within three years.

===Other life in the syconia===
As with many other &quot;Ficus&quot; species, the community of wasps inside the figs of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera &quot;Sycoscapter&quot; and &quot;Philotrypesis&quot;—are common while others are rare. Investigation of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer to the wall of the syconium. The wasps of the genera &quot;Sycoscapter&quot; and &quot;Philotrypesis&quot; are parasitic and are around the same size as the pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male &quot;Sycoscapter&quot; and &quot;Philotrypesis&quot; wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the fig later. An example of this is &quot;Pseudidarnes minerva&quot;, a metallic green wasp species.

Nematodes of the genus &quot;Schistonchus&quot; are found in the syconia (and the pollinator wasps) of many species of fig, with &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; hosting two species. They appear to be less species-specific than wasps. &quot;S. altermacrophylla&quot; is generally associated with &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; though it has been recorded on several other fig species.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot; was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1789, where it is grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching high in 30 years. Planting trees apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.

In a brief description, William Guilfoyle recorded a variegated fig from New South Wales &quot;12–15 ft high&quot; in 1911 as &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; variety &quot;variegata&quot;. A variegated form is in cultivation on Australia&#x27;s east coast, and in the United States. It is a chimera lacking in chlorophyll in the second layer of the leaf meristem. The leaves have an irregular central green patch along the midvein with irregular yellow and green elsewhere. Leaves that grow in winter generally have larger green patches than those that do in summer. The chimera is unstable, and branches of all-green growth appear sporadically.

Despite the relatively large size of the leaves, it is popular for bonsai work as it is highly forgiving to work with and hard to kill; the leaves reduce readily by leaf-pruning in early summer. Described as the best tree for a beginner to work with, it is one of the most frequently used native species in Australia. Its bark remains smooth, and does not attain a rugged, aged appearance. Known as &quot;Little Ruby&quot;, a narrow-leaved form with its origins somewhere north of Sydney is also seen in cultivation.

&quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; is also suited for use as a houseplant in low, medium or brightly lit spaces, although a variegated form requires brighter light. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It is easily propagated by cuttings or aerial layering.

The light-coloured wood is soft and brittle. Lightweight, it has some value in the making of such items as toys and small boxes.

<text>All Over the Guy is a 2001 American gay-themed romantic comedy film directed by Julie Davis and written by Dan Bucatinsky, based on Bucatinsky&#x27;s 1997 stage play, &quot;I Know You Are, But What Am I?&quot;

==Plot==
The film is told mostly in flashback; with Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) recounting his side to Esther (Doris Roberts), an HIV clinic worker as he waits for test results and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) telling his side to a man he meets at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Tom is the son of emotionally distant alcoholic WASP parents who never quite accepted his sexual orientation and as a result is a heavy drinker himself and has a penchant for random hookups with different men. Eli&#x27;s parents are both Jewish psychiatrists who raised him to be emotionally open but ended up making him neurotic.

Tom and Eli are set up on a by their best friends, Jackie (Sasha Alexander) and Brett (Adam Goldberg), who think they would be a perfect match. They both looking for &#x27;The One&#x27;, but don&#x27;t recognize it when they find it. On the date, a boring evening is broken up only by an amusing diatribe by Tom against the movie &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;. A few days later they run into each other at a flea market and hit it off, winding up back at Eli&#x27;s place where Tom spends the night. The next morning Tom says that it was a mistake.

Jackie and Brett decide to try again to set them up, and the two men start to develop a relationship. Tom&#x27;s fear of becoming emotionally close coupled with Eli&#x27;s own insecurities makes it difficult for them to maintain, but Jackie and Brett get engaged which forces Tom and Eli together. They disguise their unease behind petty arguments over meaningless details of grammar and pronunciation but are finally able to push past the pettiness and make love. Eli tells Tom he loves him and Tom, terrified, lashes out at him the next day and drives him away.

The flashbacks end here on the day of Brett and Jackie&#x27;s wedding. Esther tries to teach Eli to be more understanding of Tom&#x27;s emotional needs. The AA member tries to sexually assault Tom and when he tells Jackie, she upbraids him for throwing Eli away for daring to fall for him. At the reception, Eli and Tom come to realize that they have to overcome their families&#x27; dysfunction and their own fears.

==Release==
&quot;All Over the Guy&quot; premiered in 2001, with a small band called Kara&#x27;s Flowers on hand to perform at the after party. That band later changed its name to Maroon 5.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 43% out of 47 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9/10.

Kevin Maynard from Mr. Showbiz wrote “While both leads are appealing enough, it’s the stuff on the sidelines that keeps All Over the Guy entertaining.” Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote “A romantic comedy of wit and substance that actor-writer Dan Bucatinsky and director Julie Davis have moved gracefully from stage to screen with a change of title and sexual orientation.”

Albert Nowicki of Queer.pl praised the movie, called it &quot;a classic of LGBT cinema,&quot; and noted: &quot;This is a film about the struggles of dating, challenging each other, about dealing with problems and escaping from them. &quot;All Over the Guy&quot; doesn&#x27;t feature faultless heroes, nor does it have perfectly articulated, calculated speeches that sound artificially and kitschy — like &#x27;I&#x27;m just a girl...&#x27; from &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. Instead, we are presented with rationally outlined characters openly discussing their weaknesses. Natural performances from the actors make it easy to identify with them.&quot;

<text>Phillip Terry (born Frederick Henry Kormann; March 7, 1909 – February 23, 1993) was an American actor.

==Early years==
Terry &quot;had elementary education in various schools in the oil country around Texas and Oklahoma.&quot; He attended Iona High School in New York and Sacred Heart College in San Francisco.

==Career==
After studying at the Royal Academy, he toured British provinces for four years performing in stock theater. He went to Hollywood and took a job with CBS Radio, where he performed in a number of plays on the air, specializing in Shakespearean roles. In 1937, a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer talent scout heard him in one of these broadcasts and arranged an interview. Terry made a screen test and was awarded a contract with the studio. One of his first film appearances was in a bit part in the movie &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1937) starring Joan Crawford.

Two years later he signed with Paramount, where he starred in &quot;The Parson of Panamint&quot;, &quot;The Monster and the Girl&quot; in 1941. He then did supporting roles in &quot;Wake Island&quot; (1942) and &quot;Bataan&quot; (1943), the work on the latter occurring when he was on &quot;loan-out&quot; to MGM. During World War II Terry was classified &quot;4F&quot; unfit for military service due to defective vision. When he left Paramount, he signed with RKO and was in &quot;Music in Manhattan&quot;, &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, &quot;Pan-Americana&quot;, &quot;Born to Kill&quot; and the lead in &quot;Seven Keys to Baldpate&quot; (1947). Terry appeared in more than eighty movies over the span of his career. Many of the early roles were small and often uncredited. But in the 1940s, he received bigger and more numerous roles in some quality movies, such as &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945) starring Ray Milland, and &quot;To Each His Own&quot; (1946) starring Olivia de Havilland, who won an Oscar as Best Actress for her performance in the film.

==Marriages==
On July 21, 1942, at the Hidden Valley Ranch in Ventura County, California, he married film star Joan Crawford. They were divorced in 1946. Irving Wallace, Amy Wallace, David Wallechinsky, and Sylvia Wallace wrote in their book, &quot;The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People&quot;:Despite her status as a single parent, in 1939 she [Crawford] began adoption proceedings for a baby girl, whom she named Joan Crawford, Jr. Months later Joan changed the child&#x27;s name to Christina...During [her marriage to Phillip Terry] she adopted a second child — a boy — and named him Phillip Terry, Jr. Following her 1946 divorce from Terry, she renamed the boy Christopher Crawford.

==Later years==
Terry never completely abandoned acting. During the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, he took on occasional movie roles. Some of his better B movies from this period include &quot;The Leech Woman&quot; (1960), with Grant Williams, and &quot;The Navy vs. the Night Monsters&quot; (1966), with Mamie Van Doren. Sometimes he would accept television roles and was in episodes of &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot;. He also made five guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, including the role of murder victim Robert Doniger in the 1960 episode, &quot;The Case of the Gallant Grafter&quot;, and he played Lawrence Kent in the 1961 episode, &quot;The Case of the Resolute Reformer&quot;.

<doc id="362341" wikidata="Q1366948" url="?curid=362341" title="Silver Slugger Award">
<text>The Silver Slugger Award has been awarded annually since 1980 to the best offensive player at each position in both the American League and the National League, as determined by the coaches and managers of Major League Baseball.

These voters consider several offensive statistics, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, as well as their &quot;general impressions of a player&#x27;s overall offensive value&quot;. They are not permitted to vote for players on their team.

The award is a bat-shaped trophy, three feet (91 cm) tall, engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver. It is given by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats.

Ten Silver Slugger Awards are given each year per league individually. One each goes to a catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, and shortstop. Three outfielders receive the award, irrespective of their specific position; for instance, three left fielders could win the award in a given year. One award goes to a designated hitter (a player who bats in place of the pitcher) and one to a utility player (a player who can play multiple fielding positions). Additionally, since 2023, a Silver Slugger is also awarded to “the best offensive team” in each league.

Pitchers in the National League received a Silver Slugger Award each year until 2019 and in 2021. In the COVID-shortened season, MLB allowed National League teams to use a designated hitter, so an NL DH received a Silver Slugger Award for the first time. In 2022, MLB permanently allowed both leagues to use the DH. That year also saw the introduction of the Utility Player Award.

Home run record-holder Barry Bonds won 12 Silver Slugger Awards, the most of any player, and won the award in five consecutive seasons twice: from 1990 to 1994, and again from 2000 to 2004. Mike Piazza and Alex Rodriguez are tied for second, with ten each. Piazza is also the winningest catcher, having won all ten playing at the position. Rodriguez won seven Silver Sluggers as a shortstop for the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers, and three with the Yankees as a third baseman. Wade Boggs leads third basemen with eight awards; Barry Larkin leads shortstops with nine. Other leaders include Jose Altuve, who is tied with Ryne Sandberg (seven wins as a second baseman), Mike Hampton (five wins as a pitcher), and Paul Goldschmidt (five wins as a first baseman). David Ortiz has won seven awards as a designated hitter, the most at that position. In 2018, J. D. Martinez collected two Silver Slugger Awards: one as a designated hitter and the other as an outfielder, becoming the only player to win twice in one year. In 2021, Max Fried became the final pitcher to win a Silver Slugger Award.

<doc id="362342" wikidata="Q2920613" url="?curid=362342" title="Shared parenting">
<text>Shared parenting, shared residence, joint residence, shared custody, joint physical custody, equal parenting time (EPT) is a child custody arrangement after divorce or separation, in which both parents share the responsibility of raising their child(ren), with equal or close to equal parenting time. A regime of shared parenting is based on the idea that children have the right to and benefit from a close relationship with both their parents, and that no child should be separated from a parent.

The term &quot;Shared Parenting&quot; is applied in cases of divorce, separation or when parents do not live together; in contrast, a shared earning/shared parenting marriage is a marriage where the partners choose to share the work of child-raising, earning money, house chores and recreation time in nearly equal fashion across all four domains. &quot;Shared parenting&quot; is different from split custody, where some children live primarily with their mother while one or more of their siblings live primarily with their father.

&quot;Bird&#x27;s nest custody&quot; is an unusual but increasingly common form of shared parenting where the child always lives in the same home, while the two parents take turns living with the child in that home. Its long term use can be expensive as it requires three residences, and it is most commonly used as a temporary shared parenting arrangement until one parent has found a suitable home elsewhere.

==Frequency==
The popularity of shared parenting, or equal parenting time (EPT), has increased greatly in the past ten years. In Spain in 2022, for instance, &#x27;Due to legal reforms, equal parenting time (EPT) laws in Spain now apply to approximately 40% of all divorces.&#x27; The frequency of shared parenting versus sole custody varies across countries, being most common in Scandinavia.

In a comparative survey of 34 western countries conducted from 2005 to 2006, the proportion of children aged 11 to 15 living in a shared parenting arrangement versus sole custody was highest in Sweden (17%), followed by Iceland (11%), Belgium (11%), Denmark (10%), Italy (9%) and Norway (9%). Ukraine, Poland, Croatia, Turkey, the Netherlands and Romania all had 2% or less. Among the English speaking countries, Canada and the United Kingdom had 7% while the United States and Ireland had 5%.

Shared parenting is increasing in popularity and it is particularly common in Scandinavia. Circa 2016-2017, the percentage in Sweden had increased to 28%; with 26% for children age 0–5 years, 34% among the 6-12 year old age group, and 23% among the oldest children ages 13–18.

==Scientific research==
Epidemiological studies on the effect of shared parenting on children has been conducted using both cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs. Their conclusions are that children with a shared parenting arrangement have better physical, mental, social and academic outcomes compared to children in a primary parenting arrangement. These finding holds for all age groups, whether the parents have an amicable or high-conflict relationship, and after adjusting for socio-economic variables.

With its early adoption of shared parenting and excellent health data, the largest studies on shared parenting have been conducted in Sweden. In a large cross-sectional study comparing over 50,000 children, ages 12 and 15, living in either a shared or sole custody arrangement, Dr. Malin Bergström found that children with shared parenting had better outcomes for physical health, psychological well-being, moods and emotions, self-perception, autonomy, parental relations, material outcomes, peer relations, school satisfaction and social acceptance. Using data from the same cross-sectional survey, Bergström did a follow-up study focusing on psychosomatic problems of concentration, sleeping, headaches, stomach aches, tenseness, lack of appetite, sadness and dizziness. They found that both boys and girls did better living in a shared parenting versus sole custody arrangement. Both studies adjusted for selected socio-economic variables.

A review of 60 quantitative research studies found that in 34 of the studies, children in a shared parenting arrangement had better outcomes on all measured variables for well-being, most notably for their family relationships, physical health, adolescent behavior and mental health. In 14 studies, they had better or equal outcomes on all measures, in 6 studies that had equal outcomes on all measures, and in 6 studies that had worse outcomes on one measure and equal or better outcomes on the remaining measures. The results were similar for the subset of studies that adjusted for socio-economic variables and the level of conflict between parents. The variable with the smallest difference was academic achievement, for which only 3 out 10 studies showed an advantage for shared parenting. Studies indicate that children fare better in joint custody arrangements, or where they have good access to both parents, as compared to sole custody arrangements.

== Parental benefits ==
While the primary arguments for shared parenting is based on the child&#x27;s best interest of having close contact with both parents in their daily life, there are also important advantages to the parents. Most parents enjoy spending time with their children, and with shared parenting, both parents have that joy in their life. Both parents also get child-free time to work or play without having to hire a baby sitter, which a sole custodial parent must do. Moreover, both parents get the same opportunity for career development and advancement. In fact, some argue that shared parenting is one critical component in the efforts to reduce the gender pay gap.

== Benefits for children ==
Not only can shared parenting benefit parents, but it can also benefit children. In a study conducted by Cambridge University, it was found that children of parents with higher levels of shared parenting responsibilities experienced fewer emotional and conduct issues. In addition, shared parenting can help children develop better problem solving and communication skills, while also providing greater stability through consistent schedules and routines.

==Criticism==
Early criticism of shared parenting was based upon the assumptions (i) that children need one single primary attachment figure to bond with, (ii) that child development suffer from frequent moves back and forth between two households, and (iii) that one should not disrupt the status quo. Scientific research finds support for and against these assumptions. It is important that child-specific factors like parental temperament, environmental factors, and genetic factors are considered before attempting to determine how a specific parenting style will affect a child&#x27;s Attachment Theory.

A second wave of criticism argued that shared parenting increases parental conflict and that shared parenting is only suitable for parents who get along well as co-parents. Once more, research has found support for and against this criticism. The science suggests the appropriateness of any parenting style must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Parents with mental illness, personality disorder, history of abuse, or history of substance abuse may make shared parenting a poor choice. Couples at high risk for interpersonal violence also do not make good shared parenting candidates.

A third wave of criticism acknowledges that shared parenting could be an appropriate custodial arrangement but argued that there should be no presumptions in family law, with each custody decision made based upon a judge&#x27;s assessment of the best interest of a child. Critics also suggest that shared parenting requires more logistical coordination.

== Legislation ==

Some legislatures have established a legal rebuttable presumption for &quot;shared parenting&quot; which favors shared parenting in most custody cases while allowing the court to order alternative arrangements based upon evidence that shared parenting would not be in the best interest of the children, such as in cases of parental child abuse or neglect. Bills promoting shared parenting have been introduced in Canada and the United States.

===Italy===
In 2006, Italy passed a law that made joint custody the default arrangement for separating couples. A study of the effect of the law suggested that the joint custody presumption increased the duration and complexity of custody litigation, but that it did not find evidence that parents were making concessions on the division of assets to &quot;buy back&quot; custody from the other parent.

===United States===
In 2018, Kentucky became the first jurisdiction to establish a legal presumption for shared parenting, after the house voted 81-2 and the senate voted 38–0 in favor, and after the bill was signed by governor Matt Bevin. Similar laws were passed by both chambers in Minnesota and Florida, but vetoed by the governors.

Some family lawyers and state bar associations have argued against a presumption of joint parenting. For example, concerns have been expressed that a presumption for joint custody might get in the way of negotiated custody outcomes that are better suited to the children, and joint custody might be inappropriately imposed upon couples who suffer unnecessary financial burdens or conflict as a result.

== Advocacy ==
The advocacy for shared parenting is a world-wide movement. It is unified in its belief that shared parenting is in the best interest of children, and that it is a children&#x27;s right issue. The gender perspective, however, varies greatly across nations. In Scandinavian countries, such as Iceland, it is commonly viewed as a gender equity issue with strong support from women&#x27;s organizations. As a contrast, in North America, several organizations see it as a father&#x27;s rights issue, and some women&#x27;s organizations work against shared parenting, while other women are among the strongest advocates. As yet another contrast, in countries like Turkey and Iran, it is often seen as a women&#x27;s right issue, as sole custody is commonly awarded to the father.

There are a number of organizations that advocate for shared parenting as being in the best interest of children:

<text>The sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis) is a species of large crane of North America and extreme northeastern Siberia. The common name of this bird refers to their habitat such as the Platte River, on the edge of Nebraska&#x27;s Sandhills on the American Great Plains. Sandhill cranes are known to frequent the edges of bodies of water. The central Platte River valley in Nebraska is the most important stopover area for the nominotypical subspecies, the lesser sandhill crane (&quot;A. c. canadensis&quot;), with up to 450,000 of these birds migrating through annually.

==Taxonomy==
In 1750, English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the sandhill crane in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Brown and Ash-colour&#x27;d Crane&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of Canada by James Isham. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the sandhill crane with herons and cranes in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea canadensis&quot;, and cited Edwards&#x27; work.

The sandhill crane was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Grus&quot;, but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the sandhill crane, were placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Antigone&quot; that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.

The specific epithet &quot;canadensis&quot; is the modern Latin word for &quot;from Canada&quot;.

Five subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – northeast Siberia through Alaska and north Canada to Baffin Island
* &quot;A. c. tabida&quot; (Peters, JL, 1925) – south Canada and west, central United States
* &quot;A. c. pratensis&quot; (Meyer, FAA, 1794) – Georgia and Florida
* &quot;A. c. pulla&quot; (Aldrich, 1972) – Mississippi
* &quot;A. c. nesiotes&quot; (Bangs &amp; Zappey, 1905) – Cuba and Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Pines)

==Description==
Adults are gray overall; during breeding, their plumage is usually much worn and stained, particularly in the migratory populations, and looks nearly ochre. The average weight of the larger males is , while the average weight of females is , with a range of across the subspecies. Sandhill cranes have red foreheads, white cheeks, and long, dark, pointed bills. In flight, their long, dark legs trail behind, and their long necks keep straight. 

Immature birds have reddish-brown upperparts and gray underparts. The juveniles do not have the characteristic red foreheads, making it possible to distinguish the children from the parents, even when they are the same height.

The sexes look alike. Sizes vary among the different subspecies; the average height of these birds is around . Their wing chords are typically , tails are , the exposed culmens are long, and the tarsi measure . Wingspan is 78.7 in (200 cm).

These cranes frequently give a loud, trumpeting call that suggests a rolled &quot;r&quot; in the throat, and they can be heard from a long distance. Mated pairs of cranes engage in &quot;unison calling&quot;. The cranes stand close together, calling in a synchronized and complex duet. The female makes two calls for every one from the male.

Sandhill cranes&#x27; large wingspans, typically , make them very skilled soaring birds, similar in style to hawks and eagles. Using thermals to obtain lift, they can stay aloft for many hours, requiring only occasional flapping of their wings, thus expending little energy. Migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds, and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) they ride.

Sandhill cranes fly south for the winter. In their wintering areas, they form flocks over 10,000. One place this happens is at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. An annual Sandhill Crane Festival is held there in November.

===Fossil record===
Sandhill cranes have one of the longest fossil histories of any extant bird. A 10-million-year-old crane fossil from Nebraska is said to be of this species, but this may be from a prehistoric relative or ancestor of sandhill cranes, and not belong in the genus &quot;Grus&quot;. The oldest unequivocal sandhill crane fossil is 2.5 million years old, older by half than the earliest remains of most living species of birds, primarily found from after the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary some 1.8 million years ago. As these ancient sandhill cranes varied as much in size as present-day birds, those Pliocene fossils are sometimes described as new species. &quot;Grus haydeni&quot; may have been a prehistoric relative, or it may comprise material of a sandhill crane and its ancestor.

===Subspecies and evolution===
Sandhill cranes vary considerably in size (much of which is clinal) and in migratory habits. A female of &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot; averages , in length, and has a wingspan of . A male of &quot;A. c. tabida&quot; averages , in length, and has a wingspan of . The southern subspecies (along with &quot;A. c. rowani&quot;) are intermediate, roughly according to Bergmann&#x27;s rule.

Three subspecies are resident: &quot;A. c. pulla&quot; of the Gulf Coast of the U.S., &quot;A. c. pratensis&quot; of Florida and Georgia, and &quot;A. c. nesiotes&quot; of Cuba. The northern populations exist as fragmented remains in the contiguous U.S. and a large and contiguous population from Canada to Beringia. These migrate to the Southwestern United States and Mexico. These cranes are rare vagrants to China, South Korea, and Japan and very rare vagrants to Western Europe.

Six subspecies have been recognized in recent times:
*Lesser sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot;
*Cuban sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. nesiotes&quot; – ESA: endangered
*Florida sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. pratensis&quot;
*Mississippi sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. pulla&quot; – ESA: endangered
*Canadian sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. rowani&quot;
*Greater sandhill crane, &quot;A. c. tabida&quot;

The Florida sandhill crane was listed as EC or easily confused to facilitate an attempted reintroduction of the whooping crane (&quot;Grus americana&quot;) into Florida. The attempt failed, but the listing remained. The current list of endangered subspecies includes only two birds, &quot;A. c. nesiotes&quot; and &quot;A. c. rowani&quot;, with &quot;A. c. pratensis&quot; no longer listed. Sandhill cranes occur in pastures, open prairies and freshwater wetlands in peninsular Florida from the Everglades to the Okefenokee Swamp.

Some authorities no longer recognize Canadian sandhill crane as a distinct subspecies, as insignificant genetic differentiation and minimal morphological differentiation exist between it and greater sandhill crane. The others can be somewhat more reliably distinguished in hand by measurements and plumage details, apart from the size differences already mentioned. Unequivocal identification often requires location information, which is often impossible in migrating birds.

Analysis of control region mtDNA haplotype data shows two major lineages. The Arctic and the subarctic migratory population includes the lesser sandhill cranes. The other lineages can be divided into a migratory and some indistinct clusters which can be matched to the resident subspecies. The lesser and greater sandhill cranes are quite distinct, their divergence dating to roughly 2.3–1.2 million years ago , some time during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. Glaciation seemingly fragmented off a founder population of lesser sandhill cranes, because during each major ice age, its present breeding range was frozen year-round. Still, sandhill cranes are amply documented from fossil and subfossil remains right to the modern era. Conceivably, they might be considered distinct species already, a monotypic &quot;G. canadensis&quot; and the greater sandhill crane, &quot;G. pratensis&quot;, which would include the other populations.

The scant differences between southern Canadian and western U.S. populations appear to result from genetic drift, due to the recent reduction in population and range fragmentation. Until the early 20th century, the southern migratory birds occupied a much larger and continuous range. Thus, the subspecies &quot;A. c. rowani&quot; may well be abandoned.

The two southern U.S. resident populations are somewhat more distinct. The Cuban population has been comparatively little studied, but appears to have been established on the island for a long time. They and the migratory greater sandhill cranes proper may form a group of lineages that diverged much later from a range in the southern U.S. and maybe northern Mexico, where they were resident. The southern migratory population would then represent a later re-expansion, which (re-)evolved their migratory habits independent from the northernmost birds, the geographically separated populations expanding rapidly when more habitat was available as the last ice age ended.

==Behavior==
Sandhill cranes are fairly social birds that usually live in pairs or family groups through the year. During migration and winter, unrelated cranes come together to form &quot;survival groups&quot; that forage and roost together. Such groups often congregate at migration and winter sites, sometimes in the thousands.

===Diet===
Sandhill cranes are mainly herbivorous, but eat various types of food, depending on availability. They often feed with their bills down to the ground as they root around for seeds and other foods, in shallow wetlands with vegetation or various upland habitats. Cranes readily eat cultivated foods such as corn, wheat, cottonseed, and sorghum. Waste corn is useful to cranes preparing for migration, providing them with nutrients for the long journey. Among northern races of sandhill cranes, their diet is most varied, especially among breeding birds. They variously feed on berries, small mammals, insects, snails, reptiles, and amphibians.

===Breeding===
Sandhill cranes raise one brood per year. In nonmigratory populations, laying begins between December and August. In migratory populations, laying usually begins in April or May. Both members of a breeding pair build the nest using plant material from the surrounding area. Nest sites are usually marshes, bogs, or swales, though occasionally on dry land. Females lay one to three (usually two) oval, dull brown eggs with reddish markings. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 30 days. The chicks are precocial; they hatch covered in down, with their eyes open, and able to leave the nest within a day. The parents brood the chicks for up to three weeks after hatching, feeding them intensively for the first few weeks, then gradually less frequently until they reach independence at 9 to 10 months old.

The chicks remain with their parents until one to two months before the parents lay the next clutch of eggs the following year, remaining with them for 10–12 months. After leaving their parents, the chicks form nomadic flocks with other juveniles and nonbreeders. They remain in these flocks until they form breeding pairs between two and seven years old.

===Predators===
As a conspicuous ground-dwelling species, sandhill cranes are at risk from a few predators. Corvids, such as ravens and crows, gulls, jaegers, raptors and mammals such as foxes, coyotes and racoons feed on young cranes and eggs. In Oregon and California, the most serious predators of chicks are reportedly coyotes, ravens, raccoons, American mink, and great horned owls, roughly in descending order. Cranes of all ages can be hunted by both North American species of eagles, bobcats, and possibly American alligators. Additionally, there is a report that even a much smaller peregrine falcon has successfully killed a adult sandhill crane in a stoop. In New Mexico, humans hunt them with a permit granted in a lottery draw during late fall. There are a total of 17 states that allow hunting of Sandhill Cranes.

Sandhill cranes defend themselves and their young from aerial predators by jumping and kicking. Actively brooding adults are more likely to react aggressively to potential predators to defend their chicks than wintering birds, which most often normally try to evade attacks on foot or in flight. For land predators such as dogs, foxes, and coyotes, they move forward, often hissing, with their wings open and bills pointed. If the predator persists, the crane stabs with its bill and kicks. They can even kill predators by piercing through the skull with their sharp beak, and even coyotes can be killed.

==Status and conservation==
===Mainland North America===
In the 1930s, sandhill cranes were generally extirpated east of the Mississippi River, but their populations have recovered, with an estimated 98,000 in the region in 2018, a substantial increase over the previous year. Although sandhill cranes are not considered threatened as a species, the three southernmost subspecies are quite rare. Resident populations, not migratory birds, cannot choose secure breeding habitat. Many subpopulations were destroyed by hunting or habitat change. The greater sandhill crane proper initially suffered most; by 1940, probably fewer than 1,000 birds remained. Populations have since increased greatly again. At nearly 100,000, they are still fewer than the lesser sandhill crane, which, at about 400,000 individuals continent-wide, is the most plentiful extant crane.

Some migratory populations of sandhill cranes face population threats due to interspecies competition with snow geese. Since the 1990s, snow geese have eaten waste corn on which the cranes also rely prior to migration. Sandhill crane populations are also threatened by hunting. Hunting cranes is legal throughout the states of the Central Flyway, from the Dakotas and Wyoming south to Oklahoma and Texas. Nebraska is the sole state along the Central Flyway where hunting cranes is illegal. Despite losses from hunting, interspecies competition and other pressures such as habitat loss, the species has expanded its range. Since the early 2000s, the sandhill crane has expanded both its winter (nonbreeding) and breeding ranges northward, including into upstate New York. In the 21st century, parts of the Midwestern United States have seen an extensive rebound of the species.

The transplantation of wild birds and introduction of captive-reared birds into suitable low-population areas have been called viable management techniques.

The Mississippi sandhill crane has lost the most range; it used to live along most of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, and its range was once nearly parapatric with that of its eastern neighbor. As of 2013, about 25 breeding pairs exist in an intensively managed population. The Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge—established in 1975 when fewer than 35 of the birds existed—has the biggest release program for cranes on Earth, and 90% of the cranes there were raised in captivity. The second viable egg from a two-egg nest was occasionally removed from the nests, starting in 1965, to become part of a captive flock. This breeding flock is divided between the Audubon Institute&#x27;s Species Survival Center and White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. These cranes have produced offspring for annual releases into the refuge.

A Mississippi sandhill crane was the first bird to hatch from an egg fertilized by sperm that was thawed from a cryogenic state. This occurred at the Audubon Institute, as part of this subspecies&#x27; endangered species recovery plan.

In January 2019, 25 to 30 thousand cranes (both greater and lesser subspecies) were found wintering at the Whitewater Draw State Wildlife Area near McNeal in southeast Arizona.

Sandhill cranes have been tried as foster parents for whooping cranes in reintroduction schemes. This failed when the whooping cranes imprinted on their foster parents, later did not recognize other whooping cranes as their conspecifics, and unsuccessfully tried to pair with sandhill cranes, instead.

===Cuba===
The Cuban sandhill crane (subspecies &quot;A. c. nesiotes&quot;) is not as rare as once believed and while it remains threatened its population is increasing. Based on very limited information, up until the 1990s it was typically believed to consist of about 300 birds. Detailed surveys conducted from 1994 to 2002 resulted in an estimate of about 525 individuals, while surveys from 2004 to 2015 estimated that the population now was above 550. Subsequent reviews have placed the Cuban sandhill crane population at around 700 birds in 2017. They inhabit dry or seasonally flooded grasslands and savannas, as well as nearby wetlands, and the remaining populations are divided into ten localities (it formerly occurred in two additional localities) in six provinces. Based on the surveys from 1994 to 2002, six of the ten known localities each are home to less than 25 Cuban sandhill cranes; the last four each are home to more than 70. The two largest, one in the Zapata Swamp ( 120 cranes) and another on Isla de la Juventud ( 170 cranes), are increasing, whereas most other subpopulations appear to be stable, but some likely are too small for long-term survival and possibly are decreasing. Subsequent surveys indicate that at least the four largest subpopulation now are larger than they were in the 1994–2002 surveys.

Primary threats to Cuban sandhill cranes are habitat loss due to tree planting, spreading shrubs, expanding agriculture and fires, predation by non-native mammals (dogs, mongooses and feral pigs), and poaching. Population fragmentation is also a problem, as all remaining localities are separated by distances that are greater than the largest distances non-migratory sandhill cranes are known to move.

===Vagrancy===

Sandhill cranes occasionally reach Europe as vagrants. The first British record was on Fair Isle in April 1981, and the second was in Shetland in 1991. Small groups have also been seen in parts of eastern China and Taiwan. In 2022, reports emerged of regular sightings of sandhill cranes in New Brunswick, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The mythical Mothman, a humanoid creature reportedly seen in the Point Pleasant, West Virginia area from November 1966 to December 1967 is thought to have originated from sightings of out-of-migration sandhill cranes.

==In popular culture==
In 2023 the &quot;Mississippi sandhill crane&quot; was featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<text>Terahertz radiation – also known as submillimeter radiation, terahertz waves, tremendously high frequency (THF), T-rays, T-waves, T-light, T-lux or THz – consists of electromagnetic waves within the International Telecommunication Union-designated band of frequencies from 0.1 to 10 terahertz (THz), (from 0.3 to 3 terahertz (THz) in older texts, which is now called &quot;decimillimetric waves&quot;), although the upper boundary is somewhat arbitrary and has been considered by some sources to be 30 THz.

One terahertz is 1012 Hz or 1,000 GHz. Wavelengths of radiation in the decimillimeter band correspondingly range 1 mm to 0.1 mm = 100 μm and those in the terahertz band 3 mm = 3000 μm to 30 μm. Because terahertz radiation begins at a wavelength of around 1 millimeter and proceeds into shorter wavelengths, it is sometimes known as the &quot;submillimeter band&quot;, and its radiation as &quot;submillimeter waves&quot;, especially in astronomy. This band of electromagnetic radiation lies within the transition region between microwave and far infrared, and can be regarded as either.

Compared to lower radio frequencies, terahertz radiation is strongly absorbed by the gases of the atmosphere, and in air most of the energy is attenuated within a few meters, so it is not practical for long distance terrestrial radio communication. It can penetrate thin layers of materials but is blocked by thicker objects. THz beams transmitted through materials can be used for material characterization, layer inspection, relief measurement, and as a lower-energy alternative to X-rays for producing high resolution images of the interior of solid objects.

Terahertz radiation occupies a middle ground where the ranges of microwaves and infrared light waves overlap, known as the &quot;terahertz gap&quot;; it is called a &quot;gap&quot; because the technology for its generation and manipulation is still in its infancy. The generation and modulation of electromagnetic waves in this frequency range ceases to be possible by the conventional electronic devices used to generate radio waves and microwaves, requiring the development of new devices and techniques.

==Description==
Terahertz radiation falls in between infrared radiation and microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, and it shares some properties with each of these. Terahertz radiation travels in a line of sight and is non-ionizing. Like microwaves, terahertz radiation can penetrate a wide variety of non-conducting materials; clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics. The penetration depth is typically less than that of microwave radiation. Like infrared, terahertz radiation has limited penetration through fog and clouds and cannot penetrate liquid water or metal. Terahertz radiation can penetrate some distance through body tissue like x-rays, but unlike them is non-ionizing, so it is of interest as a replacement for medical X-rays. Due to its longer wavelength, images made using terahertz waves have lower resolution than X-rays and need to be enhanced (see figure at right).

The earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a strong absorber of terahertz radiation, so the range of terahertz radiation in air is limited to tens of meters, making it unsuitable for long-distance communications. However, at distances of ~10 meters the band may still allow many useful applications in imaging and construction of high bandwidth wireless networking systems, especially indoor systems. In addition, producing and detecting coherent terahertz radiation remains technically challenging, though inexpensive commercial sources now exist in the 0.3–1.0 THz range (the lower part of the spectrum), including gyrotrons, backward wave oscillators, and resonant-tunneling diodes. Due to the small energy of THz photons, current THz devices require low temperature during operation to suppress environmental noise. Tremendous efforts thus have been put into THz research to improve the operation temperature, using different strategies such as optomechanical meta-devices.

==Sources==

===Natural===
Terahertz radiation is emitted as part of the black-body radiation from anything with a temperature greater than about 2 kelvin. While this thermal emission is very weak, observations at these frequencies are important for characterizing cold 10–20 K cosmic dust in interstellar clouds in the Milky Way galaxy, and in distant starburst galaxies.

Telescopes operating in this band include the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and the Submillimeter Array at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii, the BLAST balloon borne telescope, the Herschel Space Observatory, the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope at the Mount Graham International Observatory in Arizona, and at the recently built Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Due to Earth&#x27;s atmospheric absorption spectrum, the opacity of the atmosphere to submillimeter radiation restricts these observatories to very high altitude sites, or to space.

===Artificial===
, viable sources of terahertz radiation are the gyrotron, the backward wave oscillator (&quot;BWO&quot;), the molecule gas far-infrared laser, Schottky-diode multipliers, varactor (varicap) multipliers, quantum-cascade laser, the free-electron laser, synchrotron light sources, photomixing sources, single-cycle or pulsed sources used in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy such as photoconductive, surface field, photo-Dember and optical rectification emitters, and electronic oscillators based on resonant tunneling diodes have been shown to operate up to 1.98 THz.

There have also been solid-state sources of millimeter and submillimeter waves for many years. AB Millimeter in Paris, for instance, produces a system that covers the entire range from 8 GHz to 1,000 GHz with solid state sources and detectors. Nowadays, most time-domain work is done via ultrafast lasers.

In mid-2007, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Argonne National Laboratory, along with collaborators in Turkey and Japan, announced the creation of a compact device that could lead to portable, battery-operated terahertz radiation sources. The device uses high-temperature superconducting crystals, grown at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. These crystals comprise stacks of Josephson junctions, which exhibit a property known as the Josephson effect: when external voltage is applied, alternating current flows across the junctions at a frequency proportional to the voltage. This alternating current induces an electromagnetic field. A small voltage (around two millivolts per junction) can induce frequencies in the terahertz range.

In 2008, engineers at Harvard University achieved room temperature emission of several hundred nanowatts of coherent terahertz radiation using a semiconductor source. THz radiation was generated by nonlinear mixing of two modes in a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser. Previous sources had required cryogenic cooling, which greatly limited their use in everyday applications.

In 2009, it was discovered that the act of unpeeling adhesive tape generates non-polarized terahertz radiation, with a narrow peak at 2 THz and a broader peak at 18 THz. The mechanism of its creation is tribocharging of the adhesive tape and subsequent discharge; this was hypothesized to involve bremsstrahlung with absorption or energy density focusing during dielectric breakdown of a gas.

In 2013, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology&#x27;s Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia developed a method to create a graphene antenna: an antenna that would be shaped into graphene strips from 10 to 100 nanometers wide and one micrometer long. Such an antenna could be used to emit radio waves in the terahertz frequency range.

==Terahertz gap==
In engineering, the terahertz gap is a frequency band in the THz region for which practical technologies for generating and detecting the radiation do not exist. It is defined as 0.1 to 10 THz (wavelengths of 3 mm to 30 μm) although the upper boundary is somewhat arbitrary and is considered by some sources as 30 THz (a wavelength of 10 μm). Currently, at frequencies within this range, useful power generation and receiver technologies are inefficient and unfeasible.

Mass production of devices in this range and operation at room temperature (at which energy &quot;kT&quot; is equal to the energy of a photon with a frequency of 6.2 THz) are mostly impractical. This leaves a gap between mature microwave technologies in the highest frequencies of the radio spectrum and the well-developed optical engineering of infrared detectors in their lowest frequencies. This radiation is mostly used in small-scale, specialized applications such as submillimetre astronomy. Research that attempts to resolve this issue has been conducted since the late 20th century.

In 2024, an experiment has been published by German researchers where a TDLAS experiment at 4.75 THz has been performed in &quot;infrared quality&quot; with an uncooled pyroelectric receiver while the THz source has been a cw DFB-QC-Laser operated at 43.3 K and laser currents between 480 mA and 600 mA.

===Closure of the terahertz gap===
Most vacuum electronic devices that are used for microwave generation can be modified to operate at terahertz frequencies, including the magnetron, gyrotron, synchrotron, and free-electron laser. Similarly, microwave detectors such as the tunnel diode have been re-engineered to detect at terahertz and infrared frequencies as well. However, many of these devices are in prototype form, are not compact, or exist at university or government research labs, without the benefit of cost savings due to mass production. 

==Research==

===Molecular biology===

Terahertz radiation has comparable frequencies to the motion of biomolecular systems in the course of their function (a frequency 1THz is equivalent to a timescale of 1 picosecond, therefore in particular the range of hundreds of GHz up to low numbers of THz is comparable to biomolecular relaxation timescales of a few ps to a few ns). Modulation of biological and also neurological function is therefore possible using radiation in the range hundreds of GHz up to a few THz at relatively low energies (without significant heating or ionisation) achieving either beneficial or harmful effects.

===Medical imaging===
Unlike X-rays, terahertz radiation is not ionizing radiation and its low photon energies in general do not damage living tissues and DNA. Some frequencies of terahertz radiation can penetrate several millimeters of tissue with low water content (e.g., fatty tissue) and reflect back. Terahertz radiation can also detect differences in water content and density of a tissue. Such methods could allow effective detection of epithelial cancer with an imaging system that is safe, non-invasive, and painless. In response to the demand for COVID-19 screening terahertz spectroscopy and imaging has been proposed as a rapid screening tool.

The first images generated using terahertz radiation date from the 1960s; however, in 1995 images generated using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy generated a great deal of interest.

Some frequencies of terahertz radiation can be used for 3D imaging of teeth and may be more accurate than conventional X-ray imaging in dentistry. 

===Security===
Terahertz radiation can penetrate fabrics and plastics, so it can be used in surveillance, such as security screening, to uncover concealed weapons on a person, remotely. This is of particular interest because many materials of interest have unique spectral &quot;fingerprints&quot; in the terahertz range. This offers the possibility to combine spectral identification with imaging. In 2002, the European Space Agency (ESA) Star Tiger team, based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Oxfordshire, UK), produced the first passive terahertz image of a hand. By 2004, ThruVision Ltd, a spin-out from the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, had demonstrated the world&#x27;s first compact THz camera for security screening applications. The prototype system successfully imaged guns and explosives concealed under clothing. Passive detection of terahertz signatures avoid the bodily privacy concerns of other detection by being targeted to a very specific range of materials and objects.

In January 2013, the NYPD announced plans to experiment with the new technology to detect concealed weapons, prompting Miami blogger and privacy activist Jonathan Corbett to file a lawsuit against the department in Manhattan federal court that same month, challenging such use: &quot;For thousands of years, humans have used clothing to protect their modesty and have quite reasonably held the expectation of privacy for anything inside of their clothing, since no human is able to see through them.&quot; He sought a court order to prohibit using the technology without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. By early 2017, the department said it had no intention of ever using the sensors given to them by the federal government.

===Scientific use and imaging===
In addition to its current use in submillimetre astronomy, terahertz radiation spectroscopy could provide new sources of information for chemistry and biochemistry.

Recently developed methods of THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz TDS) and THz tomography have been shown to be able to image samples that are opaque in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum. The utility of THz-TDS is limited when the sample is very thin, or has a low absorbance, since it is very difficult to distinguish changes in the THz pulse caused by the sample from those caused by long-term fluctuations in the driving laser source or experiment. However, THz-TDS produces radiation that is both coherent and spectrally broad, so such images can contain far more information than a conventional image formed with a single-frequency source.

Submillimeter waves are used in physics to study materials in high magnetic fields, since at high fields (over about 11 tesla), the electron spin Larmor frequencies are in the submillimeter band. Many high-magnetic field laboratories perform these high-frequency EPR experiments, such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Florida.

Terahertz radiation could let art historians see murals hidden beneath coats of plaster or paint in centuries-old buildings, without harming the artwork.

In additional, THz imaging has been done with lens antennas to capture radio image of the object.

===Particle accelerators===
New types of particle accelerators that could achieve multi Giga-electron volts per metre (GeV/m) accelerating gradients are of utmost importance to reduce the size and cost of future generations of high energy colliders as well as provide a widespread availability of compact accelerator technology to smaller laboratories around the world. Gradients in the order of 100 MeV/m have been achieved by conventional techniques and are limited by RF-induced plasma breakdown. Beam driven dielectric wakefield accelerators (DWAs) typically operate in the Terahertz frequency range, which pushes the plasma breakdown threshold for surface electric fields into the multi-GV/m range. DWA technique allows to accommodate a significant amount of charge per bunch, and gives an access to conventional fabrication techniques for the accelerating structures. To date 0.3 GeV/m accelerating and 1.3 GeV/m decelerating gradients have been achieved using a dielectric lined waveguide with sub-millimetre transverse aperture.

An accelerating gradient larger than 1 GeV/m, can potentially be produced by the Cherenkov Smith-Purcell radiative mechanism in a dielectric capillary with a variable inner radius. When an electron bunch propagates through the capillary, its self-field interacts with the dielectric material and produces wakefields that propagate inside the material at the Cherenkov angle. The wakefields are slowed down below the speed of light, as the relative dielectric permittivity of the material is larger than 1. The radiation is then reflected from the capillary&#x27;s metallic boundary and diffracted back into the vacuum region, producing high accelerating fields on the capillary axis with a distinct frequency signature. In presence of a periodic boundary the Smith-Purcell radiation imposes frequency dispersion.

A preliminary study with corrugated capillaries has shown some modification to the spectral content and amplitude of the generated wakefields, but the possibility of using Smith-Purcell effect in DWA is still under consideration.

===Communication===
The high atmospheric absorption of terahertz waves limits the range of communication using existing transmitters and antennas to tens of meters. However, the huge unallocated bandwidth available in the band (ten times the bandwidth of the millimeter wave band, 100 times that of the SHF microwave band) makes it very attractive for future data transmission and networking use. There are tremendous difficulties to extending the range of THz communication through the atmosphere, but the world telecommunications industry is funding much research into overcoming those limitations. One promising application area is the 6G cellphone and wireless standard, which will supersede the current 5G standard around 2030. 

For a given antenna aperture, the gain of directive antennas scales with the square of frequency, while for low power transmitters the power efficiency is independent of bandwidth. So the &quot;consumption factor&quot; theory of communication links indicates that, contrary to conventional engineering wisdom, for a fixed aperture it is more efficient in bits per second per watt to use higher frequencies in the millimeter wave and terahertz range. Small directive antennas a few centimeters in diameter can produce very narrow &#x27;pencil&#x27; beams of THz radiation, and phased arrays of multiple antennas could concentrate virtually all the power output on the receiving antenna, allowing communication at longer distances. 

In May 2012, a team of researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology published in &quot;Electronics Letters&quot; that it had set a new record for wireless data transmission by using T-rays and proposed they be used as bandwidth for data transmission in the future. The team&#x27;s proof of concept device used a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) negative resistance oscillator to produce waves in the terahertz band. With this RTD, the researchers sent a signal at 542 GHz, resulting in a data transfer rate of 3 Gigabits per second. It doubled the record for data transmission rate set the previous November. The study suggested that Wi-Fi using the system would be limited to approximately , but could allow data transmission at up to 100 Gbit/s. In 2011, Japanese electronic parts maker Rohm and a research team at Osaka University produced a chip capable of transmitting 1.5 Gbit/s using terahertz radiation.

Potential uses exist in high-altitude telecommunications, above altitudes where water vapor causes signal absorption: aircraft to satellite, or satellite to satellite.

====Amateur radio====

A number of administrations permit amateur radio experimentation within the 275–3,000 GHz range or at even higher frequencies on a national basis, under license conditions that are usually based on RR5.565 of the ITU Radio Regulations. Amateur radio operators utilizing submillimeter frequencies often attempt to set two-way communication distance records. In the United States, WA1ZMS and W4WWQ set a record of on 403 GHz using CW (Morse code) on 21 December 2004. In Australia, at 30 THz a distance of was achieved by stations VK3CV and VK3LN on 8 November 2020.
===Manufacturing===
Many possible uses of terahertz sensing and imaging are proposed in manufacturing, quality control, and process monitoring. These in general exploit the traits of plastics and cardboard being transparent to terahertz radiation, making it possible to inspect packaged goods. The first imaging system based on optoelectronic terahertz time-domain spectroscopy were developed in 1995 by researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and was used for producing a transmission image of a packaged electronic chip. This system used pulsed laser beams with duration in range of picoseconds. Since then commonly used commercial/ research terahertz imaging systems have used pulsed lasers to generate terahertz images. The image can be developed based on either the attenuation or phase delay of the transmitted terahertz pulse.

Since the beam is scattered more at the edges and also different materials have different absorption coefficients, the images based on attenuation indicates edges and different materials inside of objects. This approach is similar to X-ray transmission imaging, where images are developed based on attenuation of the transmitted beam.

In the second approach, terahertz images are developed based on the time delay of the received pulse. In this approach, thicker parts of the objects are well recognized as the thicker parts cause more time delay of the pulse. Energy of the laser spots are distributed by a Gaussian function. The geometry and behavior of Gaussian beam in the Fraunhofer region imply that the electromagnetic beams diverge more as the frequencies of the beams decrease and thus the resolution decreases. This implies that terahertz imaging systems have higher resolution than scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) but lower resolution than X-ray imaging systems. Although terahertz can be used for inspection of packaged objects, it suffers from low resolution for fine inspections. X-ray image and terahertz images of an electronic chip are brought in the figure on the right. Obviously the resolution of X-ray is higher than terahertz image, but X-ray is ionizing and can be impose harmful effects on certain objects such as semiconductors and live tissues.

To overcome low resolution of the terahertz systems near-field terahertz imaging systems are under development. In nearfield imaging the detector needs to be located very close to the surface of the plane and thus imaging of the thick packaged objects may not be feasible. In another attempt to increase the resolution, laser beams with frequencies higher than terahertz are used to excite the p-n junctions in semiconductor objects, the excited junctions generate terahertz radiation as a result as long as their contacts are unbroken and in this way damaged devices can be detected. In this approach, since the absorption increases exponentially with the frequency, again inspection of the thick packaged semiconductors may not be doable. Consequently, a tradeoff between the achievable resolution and the thickness of the penetration of the beam in the packaging material should be considered.

===THz gap research===
Ongoing investigation has resulted in improved emitters (sources) and detectors, and research in this area has intensified. However, drawbacks remain that include the substantial size of emitters, incompatible frequency ranges, and undesirable operating temperatures, as well as component, device, and detector requirements that are somewhere between solid state electronics and photonic technologies.

Free-electron lasers can generate a wide range of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation from microwaves, through terahertz radiation to X-ray. However, they are bulky, expensive and not suitable for applications that require critical timing (such as wireless communications). Other sources of terahertz radiation which are actively being researched include solid state oscillators (through frequency multiplication), backward wave oscillators (BWOs), quantum cascade lasers, and gyrotrons.

==Safety==
The terahertz region is between the radio frequency region and the laser optical region. Both the IEEE C95.1–2005 RF safety standard and the ANSI Z136.1–2007 Laser safety standard have limits into the terahertz region, but both safety limits are based on extrapolation. It is expected that effects on biological tissues are thermal in nature and, therefore, predictable by conventional thermal models . Research is underway to collect data to populate this region of the spectrum and validate safety limits. 

A theoretical study published in 2010 and conducted by Alexandrov et al at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico created mathematical models predicting how terahertz radiation would interact with double-stranded DNA, showing that, even though involved forces seem to be tiny, nonlinear resonances (although much less likely to form than less-powerful common resonances) could allow terahertz waves to &quot;unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication&quot;. Experimental verification of this simulation was not done. Swanson&#x27;s 2010 theoretical treatment of the Alexandrov study concludes that the DNA bubbles do not occur under reasonable physical assumptions or if the effects of temperature are taken into account. A bibliographical study published in 2003 reported that T-ray intensity drops to less than 1% in the first 500 μm of skin but stressed that &quot;there is currently very little information about the optical properties of human tissue at terahertz frequencies&quot;.

<text>Craft beer is beer manufactured by craft breweries, which typically produce smaller amounts of beer than larger &quot;macro&quot; breweries and are often independently owned. Such breweries are generally perceived and marketed as emphasising enthusiasm, new flavours, and varied brewing techniques.

The microbrewery movement began in both the United States and United Kingdom in the 1970s, although traditional artisanal brewing existed in Europe for centuries and subsequently spread to other countries. As the movement grew, and some breweries expanded their production and distribution, the more encompassing concept of craft brewing emerged. A brewpub is a pub that brews its own beer for sale on the premises.

== Producer definitions ==
=== Microbrewery ===

Although the term &quot;microbrewery&quot; was originally used in relation to the size of breweries, it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility, adaptability, experimentation and customer service. The term and trend spread from the UK to the US in the 1980s, and was eventually used as a designation for breweries that produce fewer than annually. In 1995, there were 205 microbreweries nationwide. In 2000, that number more than doubled to 420 microbreweries.

=== Nanobrewery ===

The website The Food Section defines a &quot;nanobrewery&quot; as, &quot;a scaled-down microbrewery, often run by a solo entrepreneur, that produces beer in small batches.&quot; Nanobrewers often work out of garages or small industrial spaces. Small batches are then sold to local bars or directly to customers. The U.S. Department of the Treasury defines nanobreweries as &quot;very small brewery operations&quot; that produce beer for sale. These small operations still must meet state and federal licensing requirements. In 2013, there were more than 200 &quot;nanos&quot; in the United States. With lower startup costs than a craft brewery, nanobreweries have become popular among home brewers looking to expand and practice their beer brewing skills.

=== Craft brewery ===
&quot;Craft brewing&quot; is a more encompassing term for developments in the industry succeeding the microbrewing movement of the late 20th century. The definition is not entirely consistent but typically applies to relatively small, independently owned commercial breweries that employ traditional brewing methods and emphasize flavor and quality. The term is usually reserved for breweries established since the 1970s but may be used for older breweries with a similar focus. A United States trade group, the Brewers Association, interested in brand transparency, offers a definition of craft breweries as &quot;small, independent and traditional&quot;. The craft brewing process takes time and can be considered an art by the brewmasters. In the United Kingdom, the Assured Independent British Craft Brewer initiative is run by the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA), who ensure that any breweries using the Independent Craft Brewer logo are relatively small, independent and brewing quality beer.

=== Farm brewery ===
The term &quot;farm brewery&quot; or &quot;farmhouse brewery&quot; has been around for centuries. Several beer styles are considered &quot;farmhouse,&quot; originally stemming from farmers brewing low ABV beer as an incentive for field workers. Farm breweries were not large scale; they had smaller, more unique, methods of brewing and fermenting in comparison to the larger breweries of the time. This had different effects on the overall product, creating unconventional beer flavors.

The term &quot;farm brewery&quot; has more recently found its way into several local and state laws in order to give farm breweries certain, often agriculturally related, privileges not normally found under standard brewery laws. These privileges usually come at a price: some portion of the ingredients (such as grains, hops, or fruit) used in the beer must be grown on the given licensed farm brewery.

=== Brewpub ===
Brewpub is an abbreviated term combining the ideas of a brewery and a pub or public-house. A brewpub can be a pub or restaurant that brews beer on the premises. In the United States a brewpub is defined as selling 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and operating significant food services. A taproom brewery is a professional brewery that sells 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and does not operate significant food services. The beer is brewed primarily for sale in the taproom, and is often dispensed directly from the brewery&#x27;s storage tanks.

The term first gained prominence in California in the early 1980s. The concept was popularized by Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Brewery in Hayward, which opened on September 9, 1983, as one of the first modern brewpubs in the United States. This followed the passage of Assembly Bill 3610 in 1982, authored by Assemblyman Tom Bates, which allowed brewers to sell directly to consumers if food was served. Signed into law on January 1, 1983, the legislation paved the way for brewpubs in California. Although Buffalo Bill&#x27;s founder Bill Owens attempted to trademark the term &quot;brewpub,&quot; it had already entered common usage. The legalization and rise of brewpubs helped spark California’s craft beer movement.

In the European Union, brewpubs in some countries are favoured by a system of progressive beer duty, which originated in Bavaria. In the United Kingdom brewpubs brewing up to 5,000 hectolitres a year (about 880,000 pints) pay just half of ordinary beer duty rates.

== Developments in the 21st century ==

=== Marketing strategy ===
Craft beer has adopted a marketing strategy that differs from those of the large, mass-market breweries, offering products that compete on the basis of quality and diversity instead of low price and advertising. Their influence has been much greater than their market share, which amounts to only 2% in the UK, indicated by the introduction by large commercial breweries of new brands for the craft beer market. However, when the strategy failed, the corporate breweries invested in microbreweries or, in many cases, acquired them outright.

=== Canned beer ===

The American Can Company developed the first beer can in 1933 after years of researching how to create a can that would hold a pressurized carbonated beverage. They also created a special coating on the inside of a can to prevent a metallic taste from affecting the beer. The first can of beer was sold on January 24, 1935, when the American Can Company partnered with New Jersey–based Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company, delivering two thousand cans of Krueger&#x27;s Finest Beer and Krueger&#x27;s Cream Ale to people in Richmond, Virginia. By the end of the year, 37 breweries were canning their beer.

In the United Kingdom, the Felinfoel Brewery sold the first canned beer in Europe in January 1936.

In 1962, a brewing company in Pittsburg introduced the first self-opening can, which later became a pull ring tab, eliminating the need for a separate opening device.

The use of cans by craft brewers doubled between 2012 and 2014, with over 500 companies in the United States using cans to package their beverages. Previously associated with the major brewing corporations, cans are now favored by craft brewers for numerous reasons: cans are impervious to oxygen, beer-degrading light does not affect canned beer, canned beer is more portable since less room is required for storage or transportation, canned beer cools more quickly, and cans have a greater surface area for wraparound designs and decorations.

The perception that bottles lead to a taste that is superior to canned beer has been called &quot;just kind of dated,&quot; as most aluminum cans are lined with a polymer coating that protects the beer from the problematic metal. However, since drinking directly from a can may still result in a metallic taste, most craft brewers recommend pouring beer into a glass prior to consumption. In June 2014, the BA estimated 3% of craft beer in the United States is sold in cans, 60% is sold in bottles, and kegs represent the remainder of the market.

Between 2015 and 2020, the proportion of craft beer packaged in cans in the UK increased nearly tenfold to 4.9 percent.

=== Barrel-aged beer ===
Goose Island first produced its Bourbon County Stout in 1992, but it was not regularly available until 2005. Other breweries began following Goose Island&#x27;s lead, typically aging rich imperial stouts such as Founders KBS and The Bruery&#x27;s Black Tuesday. In 2018, &quot;Food and Drink&quot; wrote: &quot;A process that was once niche has become not just mainstream, but ubiquitous.&quot; Barrel-aged sour beers are a newer trend, inspired by the Belgian tradition of lambics and Flanders red ale.

=== Non-alcoholic craft beers ===
The market for non-alcoholic beer and wine in North America is predicted to quadruple from a base of about $20 million in 2018. Brooklyn Brewery are among the early craft breweries prepared to release a non-alcoholic craft beer, with their &quot;Special Effects.&quot; Examples in Europe include Mikkeller&#x27;s &quot;Drink&#x27;in The Sun&quot; and Nirvana&#x27;s gluten-free &quot;Kosmic Stout&quot;.

== Craft beer in Asia ==

=== Cambodia ===
Cambodia&#x27;s first microbrewery, Kingdom Breweries, opened in 2009 and brews dark, pilsener, and lager beers.

=== China ===
China, the world&#x27;s largest beer consumer as of July 2013, is home to a growing craft beer market, with brands such as Slowboat Brewery, Jing-A Brewery, and Boxing Cat Brewery. By July 2013, the number of brewpubs in Shanghai, China had doubled since 2010. General beer consumption reached in early 2013 and an increasing interest in craft beers developed accordingly. The Great Leap Brewing Company is one example of numerous microbreweries that have been recently established, with a localization strategy leading to the use of traditional Chinese ingredients and spices in the Beijing brand&#x27;s beer production process. China&#x27;s largest brewpub is located in Suzhou and is managed by the Taiwanese brewing company Le Ble D&#x27;or (金色三麥), while craft beer consumers are both ex-pats and native Chinese.

=== India ===
India&#x27;s first microbrewery, Doolally, was opened in Pune in 2009. In 2019, Bangalore had over 60 microbreweries.

=== Japan ===
An early boom in small regional microbreweries followed Japan&#x27;s 1994 revision of tax laws allowing the establishment of smaller breweries producing per year. Before this change, breweries could not get a license without producing at least per year. Beer produced by microbreweries in the early 1990s was commonly referred to as Ji Bīru (地ビール), or &quot;local beer.&quot; In the late 2000s, more established microbreweries in Japan chose to emphasize the term Craft Beer (クラフトビア) to mark a break with the short-lived Ji Bīru boom and to emphasize the traditional brewing skills and reverence for ingredients that characterize their products.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, over-strict laws made it almost impossible for any craft beer to be brewed. On the remote East Coast, however, &quot;Arugam Bay Surfer&#x27;s Beer&quot; managed to maintain a small, but popular brewpub. Established in 1977, the Siam View Hotel escaped regulations due to the long civil war and its remoteness. For two years running, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;Best of British&quot; awarded the Siam View Hotel the &quot;Best Pub in Sri Lanka&quot; medal.

=== Taiwan ===

In Taiwan, where a single beer company dominates the market, the craft beer market has grown with brewers such as Redpoint Brewing Company gaining increasing market exposure through local bars and restaurants. This market trend has been accompanied by craft beer festivals where expat and Taiwanese brewers showcase their beer.

=== Thailand ===
Following the introduction of American microbrews in 2012, the popularity of craft beer bars in Thailand—primarily Bangkok—increased fairly rapidly and in January 2014, the fourth global location of Danish microbrewery Mikkeller was launched in Bangkok. The brand partnered with an already established beer distribution company and seeks to capitalize on the higher earning capacity of Thai people in the second decade of the 21st century, as well as tourists. At the opening, one of the owners explained: &quot;... and we thought it was about time to elevate the level of craft beer available in Thailand and, hopefully, expand throughout Southeast Asia.&quot; A total of 30 beers are served at the venue, including two microbrews exclusive to Thailand.

=== Vietnam ===

Vietnam is the largest producer of craft beer in Southeast Asia, with microbreweries producing 31,000 hectolitres in 2018.

With a beer culture that emerged during French colonisation and further influenced by Vietnamese students returning from overseas studies, , there were 31 microbreweries in Vietnam. Established microbreweries include Heart of Darkness Craft Brewery, BiaCraft, Platinum Beers, Fuzzy Logic and Pasteur Street Brewing Company, Rooster Beers.

== Craft beer in Europe ==

=== Czech Republic ===

There has been a boom of craft beer breweries. Despite strong tradition of drinking Czech beer there is a growing craft beer scene in the Czech Republic focused on non-traditional beer styles. Notable breweries include Matuška, Clock and Zichovec. What makes Czech craft beer unique is the common use of decoction instead of just infusion even for top fermented beers.

=== Denmark ===

In Denmark microbreweries have occurred throughout the country in increasing numbers. Small microbreweries often relate to restaurants and pubs, but local microbrewed craft beers are also sold in stores.

=== Estonia ===
Estonia has a tradition of home-brewed farm beers which are often flavoured with juniper. Craft beer came late to Estonia, but that began to change in 2012 when Mikkeller brewed a custom beer for the Estonian market, called Baltic Frontier. Then one local brewer in particular, Põhjala, led the way for other Estonian microbrewers such as Lehe, Koeru and Õllenaut. By 2017 there were nearly 30 microbreweries on the Estonian market, in a country with a population of only 1.2 million. Since 2015 Põhjala Brewery has organised an annual craft beer festival called &quot;Tallinn Craft Beer Weekend&quot;.

=== Finland ===

The legislation in Finland allows craft breweries to sell their products directly to consumers.

=== France ===
France may be more commonly associated with wine, but its craft beer scene is also popular, ranging from classic farmhouse ales to experimental styles infused with local ingredients like lavender or foie gras.

Today, there are hundreds of craft breweries across France. Many draw inspiration from traditional European styles like Belgian saisons and German pilsners, while others experiment with unique ingredients like chestnuts or wildflowers.

=== Germany ===
Some microbreweries, such as those in Germany, have been brewing traditionally for hundreds of years. In Germany, there were 901 small breweries in 2010. The Federal Statistical Office defines a small brewery as a brewery with a production of less than 5,000 hectoliters (132,086 US gallons) beer p.a. Small breweries pay a reduced beer tax.

The total market share of the small breweries is less than 1%. 638 of them have a production even less than 1,000 hl (26,417.2 US gal.) p.a. and can be considered as microbreweries in a narrow sense. The figures apply to commercial breweries only and do not include hobby brewing.

About one third of the small breweries have a tradition going back up to 500 years, most of them in Franconia. About two thirds were founded in the last 25 years. The vast majority of small breweries operate in combination with a brewpub.

Whereas in other countries, microbreweries and brewpubs have risen in reaction to the mass production and marketing of beer, in Germany, the traditional brewpub or Brauhaus remains a major source of beer. This is mainly true for the South of Germany, especially the state of Bavaria. Upper Franconia, a district in the Region Franconia in the north of Bavaria, has the highest density of breweries in the world. Upper Franconia has about one million inhabitants and about 200 breweries. Many of them are microbreweries or brewpubs.

=== Ireland ===
Ireland has a long history of brewing and in the past two decades, there has been a resurgence in craft breweries. Although the Irish market remains dominated by three multinational brewing concerns (Diageo, Heineken and C&amp;C), there have been four so-called waves of growth in the Irish craft beer market. The number of microbreweries in Ireland had risen from 15 in 2012 to over 72 by 2017. Macro breweries have pursued a policy of forcing craft taps out of pubs, through the use of incentives such as free or discounted kegs offered to publicans to replace craft brewery taps with their own.

=== Italy ===

In recent years, many microbreweries have opened in Italy, due to increasing beer popularity among young people. According to Coldiretti, microbreweries have grown in ten years by 1900%. There are more than 900 microbreweries active in Italy.

=== Norway ===
After Oslo Microbrewery was established in 1989, the number of microbreweries in Norway has expanded rapidly and sharply in the recent decades. Interest and expertise among Norwegians about craft brewed beer has risen sharply in a short time, and the old brewery traditions of this country are revived and the traditional brewing yeast kveik rediscovered. However, most craft beers are brewed by imported recipes. Local microbreweries are scattered across Norway, from Lindesnes in the very south, and to the northernmost microbrewery in the world, Svalbard Bryggeri at Svalbard.

=== Russia ===
Craft brewing gained popularity in Russia in the mid-2010s. Local craft brews typically sell for between 200 and 300 roubles ($3–4) a pint. At least two dozen craft bars have opened in Moscow since the summer of 2014, serving Russian and foreign microbrews. As of 2021 there are about 250 independent craft breweries in Russia, but the share of craft beer in sales was only 1.5%.

=== Spain ===
In Spain in 2011, the newspaper &quot;El País&quot; reported a &quot;revolution is occurring in craft beer&quot; (&quot;cervezas artesanales&quot;) and more recently that by 2013 the trend had extended to the autonomous communities of Catalonia, Valencia, Basque Country, Navarre and Madrid.

=== Sweden ===

In Sweden, microbreweries have existed since around 1995. Today, the market is flourishing with many of the nation&#x27;s regions and cities having their own breweries, such as Gotlands Bryggeri, Jämtlands Bryggeri, Helsingborgs Bryggeri and Wermlands Brygghus. Stefan Persson, the CEO of Swedish clothing chain H&amp;M, has his own microbrewery on his estate in England.

=== United Kingdom ===
The term &quot;microbrewery&quot; originated in the UK in the late 1970s to describe the new generation of small breweries that focused on producing traditional cask ale independently of major brewers or pub chains. In 1972, Martin Sykes established Selby Brewery as the first new independent brewing company in 50 years. &quot;I foresaw the revival in real ale, and got in early&quot;, he said. Another early example was the Litchborough Brewery founded by Bill Urquhart in 1974. Alongside commercial brewing, training courses and apprenticeships were offered by Litchborough, with many of the UK movement&#x27;s early pioneers passing through its courses prior to setting up their own breweries.

Before the development of large commercial breweries in the UK, beer would have been brewed on the premises from which it was sold. Alewives would put out a sign—a hop pole or ale-wand—to show when their beer was ready. The medieval authorities were more interested in ensuring adequate quality and strength of the beer than discouraging drinking. Gradually men became involved in brewing and organized themselves into guilds such as the Brewers Guild in London of 1342 and the Edinburgh Society of Brewers in 1598; as brewing became more organized and reliable many inns and taverns ceased brewing for themselves and bought beer from these early commercial breweries.

However, there were some brewpubs which continued to brew their own beer, such as the Blue Anchor in Helston, Cornwall, which was established in 1400 and is regarded as the oldest brewpub in the UK. In the UK during the 20th century, most of the traditional pubs which brewed their own beer in the brewhouse round the back of the pub, were bought out by larger breweries and ceased brewing on the premises. By the mid-1970s, only four remained: All Nations (Madeley, Shropshire), The Old Swan (Netherton, West Midlands), the Three Tuns (Bishop&#x27;s Castle, Shropshire) and the Blue Anchor pub (Helston, Cornwall).

The trend toward larger brewing companies started to change during the 1970s, when the popularity of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)&#x27;s campaign for traditional brewing methods, and the success of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;World Guide to Beer&quot; encouraged brewers in the UK, such as Peter Austin, to form their own small breweries or brewpubs. In 1979, a chain of UK brewpubs, known as the &quot;Firkin&quot; pubs, started, running to over one hundred at the chain&#x27;s peak; however, the chain was sold and eventually its pubs ceased brewing their own beer.

Some British brewpubs specialize in ale, while others brew continental lagers and wheat beers. The Ministry of Ales, Burnley; The Masons Arms in Headington, Oxford; The Brunswick Inn, Derby (in 2010, half of the beers sold by the establishment were brewed on-site); The Watermill pub, Ings Cumbria; and the Old Cannon Brewery, Bury St Edmunds are some examples of small independent brewpubs in the UK.

The city of Bristol was identified by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in May 2014 as an area where the microbrewery industry had flourished. Ten brewpubs, such as Zerodegrees, The Tobacco Factory, Copper Jacks Crafthouse and The Urban Standard, were identified as thriving Bristol craft beer establishments.

The East End of London has also been a place for speciality craft beers and unique independent pubs and breweries. Again &quot;The Guardian&quot; has a list of Craft Beer pubs in East London with local East End tour companies also showing the distinct food and craft beer pubs to London visitors with Craft Beer Tours.

In the UK there are no firm criteria for what defines a &quot;craft beer&quot;. In 2019 CAMRA allowed craft keg beers to be sold at its Great British Beer Festival for the first time. Festival organiser Catherine Tonry said: &quot;People coming to the festival love beer in all forms and types of dispense.&quot;

=== Jordan ===

Jordan has several companies producing beer, the oldest being the Jordan Brewery Company, which built the first Amstel beer factory outside the Netherlands in 1958 in Zarqa, and which also produces Petra, the oldest local brew of Jordan. Jordan&#x27;s first microbrewery, Carakale Brewery, was established in 2010 in Fuheis.

=== Turkey ===

In Turkey, craft beers became popular in present-day; Gara Guzu, Feliz Kulpa, Antiochs, Pablo and Graf are some Turkish craft beer brands.

== Craft beer in North America ==

=== Canada ===
By the early 1980s, 97% of Canadian beer was produced by Labatt and Molson. The first microbrewery was the short-lived Horseshoe Bay Brewery, which was opened in 1981 by Frank Appleton and John Mitchell next to the Troller Pub in North Vancouver. It closed after a year, but Mitchell and Appleton, along with Paul Hadfield, opened the Spinnaker Brewpub in Victoria in 1984. A number of other microbreweries subsequently opened between 1984 and 1987, including Granville Island (Vancouver), Big Rock (Calgary), Brick (Waterloo, Ontario), Upper Canada (Toronto), and Wellington County (Guelph, Ontario).

Over the next twenty years there was steady if not spectacular growth, and by 2006 there were 88 small breweries across Canada, most of them in British Columbia, Québec and Ontario. In the second decade of the century, breweries began to appear in every province at an exponential rate, and by 2018, there were over 700 breweries across Canada producing more than 20 million hectolitres. Several provinces have associations representing craft brewers, including the Ontario Craft Brewers (OCB), and the BC Craft Brewers Guild.

Since it is a provincial, not a federal, responsibility to regulate the sale of alcohol, the exact definition of small brewery, microbrewery, macrobrewery and nanobrewery, which is defined by the number of hectolitres produced, varies from province to province.

Several of the more successful microbreweries have been bought by MolsonCoors, AB InBev, and Sapporo, including Granville Island (Vancouver), Mill Street (Toronto), and Creemore Springs (Creemore, Ontario); although the new owners often claim that these operations are still craft breweries, their membership in the relevant provincial craft brewers&#x27; association is immediately terminated due to rules requiring independent ownership.

=== Mexico ===

In the 1990s craft beer began being produced and consumed in central Mexico, with the trend spreading throughout the country. The main producers are in Baja California, Jalisco and Mexico City. Most beer produced is exported to the United States, and the development of the craft beer industry was not aided by the presence of two large beer consortia in the country. In 2009, craft beer accounted for only 0.05% of total production. The National Association of Craft Beer Producers &quot;(Asociación Nacional de Creadores de Cerveza Artesanal)&quot; was established to support and promote the industry in Mexico.

=== United States ===

In the US, the craft beer movement was revived in 1965—subsequent to an earlier American era—when Fritz Maytag acquired the Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco, thereby saving it from closure. American craft beer drinkers tend to have higher average incomes and demographically skew white, male, and generation X; however trends show an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse, female, and millennial demographic profile.

In a June 2014 interview, the owner of an Oregon-based microbrewery explained: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to do more than just make great beer. It&#x27;s really about innovation, creativity—stepping outside the box of traditional beer marketing&quot;, while an employee explained that &quot;heart and soul&quot; is the essence of the operation.

The turnaround of the Anchor Brewing Company in 1965, after it was acquired by Maytag, is considered a turning point for American beer, due to the revival of craft beer in the US, where microbrewing boomed after then-president Jimmy Carter de-regulated the beer market in 1979. During the same period, others turned to homebrewing and eventually a few of these brewers started to produce on a slightly larger scale. For inspiration, they turned to the centuries-old tradition of artisan beer and cask ale production that was continuing in the UK, Germany and Belgium.

The New Albion Brewing Company was founded in 1976 and served as a blueprint for American brewers to build small-scale commercial breweries. The popularity of these products was such that the trend quickly spread and a large number of small breweries were founded, often attached to a bar (known as a &quot;brewpub&quot;) where the product could be sold directly. As microbreweries proliferated, some became more than microbreweries, necessitating the creation of the broader category of craft beer.

American microbreweries typically distribute through a wholesaler in a traditional three-tier system, others act as their own distributor (wholesaler) and sell to retailers or directly to the consumer through a tap room, attached restaurant, or off-premises sales. Because alcohol control is left up to the states, there are many state-to-state differences in the laws. Following the federal US government shutdown on October 1, 2013, craft beer producers were forced into an activity lull due to the closure of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), an arm of the Treasury Department. The TTB is responsible for granting approval for new breweries, recipes, and labels. Interest spread to the US, and in 1982, Grant&#x27;s Brewery Pub in Yakima, Washington was opened, reviving the US &quot;brewery taverns&quot; of well-known early Americans as William Penn, Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. Growth was initially slow—the fifth US brewpub (BridgePort Brewing Company in Portland, Oregon) opened in 1984, and Dock Street Brewing Company was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1985 by Rosemarie Certo and Jeffrey Ware, and continues to operate today with multiple locations in Philadelphia, then Triple Rock in 1986, but the growth since then has been considerable: the Brewers Association reports that in 2012 there were 2,075 regional craft breweries, microbreweries and brewpubs in the US

Craft brewing is most established in the US, where changes to US law laid the foundations for the expansion of craft brewing. The 1978 Carter homebrewing law allowed for small amounts of beer and wine, and, in 1979, Carter signed a bill to deregulate the brewing industry, making it easier to start new breweries, although states could still enact local restrictions. As a result of deregulation, homebrewing became a popular hobby in the 1980s and 1990s, and, in the mid-1990s, homebrewers launched business ventures based on home-based hobby brewing.

In 1979, 89 breweries existed in the US—the Brewers Association reports that in March 2013 a total of 2,416 US breweries were in operation, with 2,360 considered craft breweries (98 percent—1,124 brewpubs, 1,139 microbreweries, and 97 regional craft breweries). By 2015, the number of US craft breweries had grown to over 4,000. Additionally, craft brewers sold more than of beer, which represented approximately 7.8% of the US market by volume. In 2007 the largest American craft brewery was the Boston Beer Company, makers of Samuel Adams. The West Coast has the most craft breweries and the Deep South has the fewest.

The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as &quot;small, independent and traditional&quot;: &quot;small&quot; is defined as an &quot;annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less&quot;; &quot;independent&quot; is defined as at least 75% owned or controlled by a craft brewer; and &quot;traditional&quot; is defined as brewing in which at least 50% of the beer&#x27;s volume consists of &quot;traditional or innovative&quot; ingredients. This definition includes older microbreweries, which traditionally produce small quantities of beer, as well as other breweries of various sizes and specialties.

The Brewers Association defines four markets within American craft brewing: microbreweries, with an annual production less than ; brewpubs, which sell 25% or more of their beer on site; regional craft breweries, which make between and , of which at least 50% is all malt or contains adjuncts that are used only to enhance flavor; and contract brewing companies, which hire other breweries to make their beer.

In March 2014, the Brewer&#x27;s Association (B.A.) updated the definition of craft beer to remove any references to the use of adjuncts in the brewing process. The change allows long-established breweries, such as Yuengling, to be defined as craft beer. The B.A. statement read:
The idea that brewers who had been in business for generations didn&#x27;t qualify as &quot;traditional&quot; simply did not cohere for many members. Brewers have long brewed with what has been available to them. (Since the Brewers Association doesn&#x27;t define craft beer—that idea remains up to the beer drinker—the definition doesn&#x27;t differentiate on what type of beer craft brewers brew, as long as the majority of what they make is beer.) The revised definition also provides room for the innovative capabilities of craft brewers to develop new beer styles and be creative within existing beer styles. The revised definition removes the subjective assessment by Brewers Association staff of whether adjuncts &quot;enhance&quot; or &quot;lighten&quot; flavor in a particular beer.

The B.A. decision also included an updated mission statement and market share goals for the industry. Association members committed to strive for a goal of 20 percent market share by 2020 and Gary Fish, owner of Deschutes Brewery and 2014 chair of the BA Board, explained:

The 20-by-20 objective is an aspirational goal for our craft community, with an inspiring symmetry. I&#x27;m convinced this goal is within our reach if we, as an industry, continue to focus on our strengths and passions—making and delivering high-quality, innovative, full-flavored beer to craft beer enthusiasts. ... Additionally, by noting a commitment to quality and clarifying the place of homebrewers and brewing enthusiasts, we further acknowledge the critical role each plays in the health and growth of the craft brewing industry.

The Brewers Association reported the production of craft beer has doubled between 2011 and 2016, with the number of breweries growing from 2,000 in 2011 to 5,200 in 2016. The craft breweries are also seeing an increase in beer tourism, seasonal brews, and a marketing effort to get more women involved in beer production.

== Craft beer in South America ==

=== Colombia ===
In recent years, Colombia has seen a significant boom in the production and consumption of craft beer, with cities such as Medellín standing out as epicenters of this trend. The growth of small breweries has been driven by consumers&#x27; desire to experience more authentic and higher quality flavors, moving away from traditional industrial options. Medellín, in particular, has seen an increase in craft beer culture, with specialized bars and festivals dedicated to promoting the various local and national brands. This trend has transformed the city into a must-visit destination for craft beer lovers.

One of the breweries that has gained recognition in this movement is Cervecería FESTA, founded in Medellín with a focus on the production of premium craft beer. Inspired by Colombian culture and folklore, FESTA distinguishes itself by offering an authentic and unique experience, brewing beers that seek to reflect the essence of the country. Despite being a relatively new brewery, FESTA has managed to capture the attention of fans thanks to its commitment to quality and innovation, positioning itself as a benchmark within the city&#x27;s growing beer scene.

<doc id="362359" wikidata="Q123225" url="?curid=362359" title="Albrecht von Haller">
<text>Albrecht von Haller (also known as Albertus de Haller; 16 October 170812 December 1777) was a Swiss anatomist, physiologist, naturalist, encyclopedist, bibliographer and poet. A pupil of Herman Boerhaave and Jacob Winslow, he is sometimes referred to as &quot;the father of modern physiology.&quot;

==Early life==
Haller was born into an old Swiss family at Bern. Prevented by long-continued ill-health from taking part in boyish sports, he had more opportunity for the development of his precocious mind. At the age of four, it is said, he used to read and expound the Bible to his father&#x27;s servants; before he was ten he had sketched a Biblical Aramaic grammar, prepared a Greek and a Hebrew vocabulary, compiled a collection of two thousand biographies of famous men and women on the model of the great works of Bayle and Moréri, and written in Latin verse a satire on his tutor, who had warned him against a too great excursiveness. When still hardly fifteen he was already the author of numerous metrical translations from Ovid, Horace and Virgil, as well as of original lyrics, dramas, and an epic of four thousand lines on the origin of the Swiss confederations, writings which he is said on one occasion to have rescued from a fire at the risk of his life, only, however, to burn them a little later (1729) with his own hand.

==Medicine==

Haller&#x27;s attention had been directed to the profession of medicine while he was residing in the house of a physician at Biel after his father&#x27;s death in 1721. While still a sickly and excessively shy youth, he went in his sixteenth year to the University of Tübingen (December 1723), where he studied under Elias Rudolph Camerarius Jr. and Johann Duvernoy. Satisfied with his progress, he in 1725 exchanged Tübingen for Leiden, where Boerhaave was in the zenith of his fame, and where Albinus had already begun to lecture in anatomy. At that university he graduated in May 1727, undertaking successfully in his thesis to prove that the so-called salivary duct, claimed as a recent discovery by Georg Daniel Coschwitz (1679–1729), was nothing more than a blood-vessel.

===&quot;Sensibility&quot; and &quot;irritability&quot;===
In 1752, at the University of Göttingen, Haller published his thesis (&quot;De partibus corporis humani sensibilibus et irritabilibus&quot;) discussing the distinction between &quot;sensibility&quot; and &quot;irritability&quot; in organs, suggesting that nerves were &quot;sensible&quot; because of a person&#x27;s ability to perceive contact while muscles were &quot;irritable&quot; because the fiber could measurably shorten on its own, regardless of a person&#x27;s perception, when excited by a foreign body.

===&quot;Nerve impulses&quot; vs. &quot;muscular contractions&quot;===
Later in 1757, he conducted a famous series of experiments to distinguish between nerve impulses and muscular contractions.

==Other disciplines==

Haller then visited London, making the acquaintance of Sir Hans Sloane, William Cheselden, John Pringle, James Douglas and other scientific men; next, after a short stay in Oxford, he visited Paris, where he studied under Henri François Le Dran and Jacob Winslow; and in 1728 he proceeded to Basel, where he devoted himself to the study of higher mathematics under John Bernoulli. It was during his stay there also that his interest in botany was awakened; and, in the course of a tour (July/August, 1728), through Savoy, Baden and several of the cantons of Switzerland, he began a collection of plants which was afterwards the basis of his great work on the flora of Switzerland. From a literary point of view the main result of this, the first of his many journeys through the Alps, was his poem entitled &quot;Die Alpen&quot;, which was finished in March 1729, and appeared in the first edition (1732) of his &quot;Gedichte&quot;. This poem of 490 hexameters is historically important as one of the earliest signs of the awakening appreciation of the mountains, though it is chiefly designed to contrast the simple and idyllic life of the inhabitants of the Alps with the corrupt and decadent existence of the dwellers in the plains.

In 1729 he returned to Bern and began to practice as a physician; his best energies, however, were devoted to the botanical and anatomical researches which rapidly gave him a European reputation, and procured for him from George II in 1736 a call to the chair of medicine, anatomy, botany and surgery in the newly founded University of Göttingen. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1743, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1747, and was ennobled in 1749.

The quantity of work achieved by Haller in the seventeen years during which he occupied his Göttingen professorship was immense. Apart from the ordinary work of his classes, which entailed the task of newly organizing a botanical garden (now the Old Botanical Garden of Göttingen University), an anatomical theatre and museum, an obstetrical school, and similar institutions, he carried on without interruption original investigations in botany and physiology, the results of which are preserved in the numerous works associated with his name. He also continued to persevere in his youthful habit of poetical composition, while at the same time he conducted a monthly journal (the &quot;Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen&quot;), to which he is said to have contributed twelve thousand articles relating to almost every branch of human knowledge. He also warmly interested himself in most of the religious questions, both ephemeral and permanent, of his day; and the erection of the Reformed church in Göttingen was mainly due to his unwearied energy. Like his mentor Boerhaave, Haller was a Christian and a collection of his religious thoughts can be read in a compilation of letters to his daughter.

Notwithstanding all this variety of absorbing interests, Haller never felt at home in Göttingen; his untravelled heart kept on turning towards his native Bern, where he had been elected a member of the great council in 1745, and in 1753 he resolved to resign his chair and return to Switzerland.

==Botany==
Haller made important contributions to botanical taxonomy that are less visible today because he resisted binomial nomenclature, Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s innovative shorthand for species names that was introduced in 1753 and marks the starting point for botanical nomenclature as accepted today.
Haller was among the first botanists to realize the importance of herbaria to study variation in plants, and he therefore purposely included material from different localities, habitats and developmental phases. Haller also grew many plants from the Alps himself.

The plant genus &quot;Halleria&quot;, an attractive shrub from Southern Africa, was named in his honour by Carl Linnaeus.

==Later life==
The twenty-one years of his life which followed were largely occupied in the discharge of his duties in the minor political post of a &quot;Rathausmann&quot; which he had obtained by lot, and in the preparation of his &quot;Bibliotheca medica&quot;, the botanical, surgical and anatomical parts of which he lived to complete; but he also found time to write the three philosophical romances &quot;Usong&quot; (1771), &quot;Alfred&quot; (1773) and &quot;Fabius and Cato&quot; (1774), in which his views as to the respective merits of despotism, of limited monarchy and of aristocratic republican government are fully set forth.

In about 1773, his poor health forced him to withdraw from public business. He supported his failing strength by means of opium, on the use of which he communicated a paper to the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Göttingen Royal Society in 1776; the excessive use of the drug is believed, however, to have hastened his death.

Haller, who had been three times married, left eight children. The eldest, Gottlieb Emanuel, attained to some distinction as a botanist and as a writer on Swiss historical bibliography (1785–1788, 7 vols). Another son, Albrecht was also a botanist.

== Importance for homoeopathy ==
 Albrecht von Haller is quoted in the footnote to paragraph 108 in the &quot;Organon of Medicine&quot;, the principal work by the founder of homoeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann. In this paragraph, Hahnemann describes how the curative powers of individual medicines can only be ascertained through accurate observation of their specific effects on &quot;healthy&quot; persons:

&quot;Not one single physician, as far as I know, during the previous two thousand five hundred years, thought of this so natural, so absolutely necessary and only genuine mode of testing medicines for their pure and peculiar effects in deranging the health of man, in order to learn what morbid state each medicine is capable of curing, except the great and immortal Albrecht von Haller. He alone, besides myself, saw the necessity of this (vide the Preface to the Pharmacopoeia Helvet., Basil, 1771, fol., p. 12); Nempe primum in corpore sano medela tentanda est, sine peregrina ulla miscela; odoreque et sapore ejus exploratis, exigua illiu dosis ingerenda et ad ommes, quae inde contingunt, affectiones, quis pulsus, qui calor, quae respiratia, quaenam excretiones, attendum. Inde ad ductum phaenomenorum, in sano obviorum, transeas ad experimenta in corpore aegroro,&quot; etc. But no one, not a single physician, attended to or followed up this invaluable hint.&quot;

The quotation from Haller&#x27;s Preface may be translated from the Latin as follows: &quot;Of course, firstly the remedy must be proved on a healthy body, without being mixed with anything foreign; and when its odour and flavour have been ascertained, a tiny dose of it should be given and attention paid to all the changes of state that take place, what the pulse is, what heat there is, what sort of breathing and what exertions there are. Then in relation to the form of the phenomena in a healthy person from those exposed to it, you should move on to trials on a sick body...&quot;

==Reception==
In his &quot;Science of Logic&quot;, Hegel mentions Haller&#x27;s description of eternity, called by Kant &quot;terrifying&quot; in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (A613/B641). According to Hegel, Haller realizes that a conception of eternity as infinite progress is &quot;futile and empty&quot;. In a way, Hegel uses Haller&#x27;s description of eternity as a foreshadowing of his own conception of the true infinite. Hegel claims that Haller is aware that: &quot;only by giving up this empty, infinite progression can the genuine infinite itself become present to him.&quot;

<text>George Washington Johnson (c. October 1846 – January 23, 1914) was an American singer and pioneer sound recording artist. Johnson was the first African American recording star of the phonograph. His most popular songs were &quot;The Whistling Coon&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Song&quot;.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Virginia, either in Fluvanna County or near Wheatland in Loudoun County. His father was a slave, and he was likely freed in 1853. From an early age, Johnson was raised near Wheatland as the companion and servant of a prosperous white farmer&#x27;s son. During his time with this family, he developed his musical ability and even learned to read and write, which was illegal for a black child in Virginia before the American Civil War. Johnson later worked as a laborer, and in his late twenties he moved to New York City. By the late 1870s he was making his living as a street entertainer in New York, specializing in whistling.

==Musical career==

Some time between January and May 1890, Johnson was recruited by two different regional phonograph distributors who were looking for recording artists for their coin-operated machines. Charles Marshall of the New York Phonograph Company and Victor Emerson of the New Jersey Phonograph Company both heard Johnson performing in Manhattan, probably at the ferry terminals on the Hudson River. Both of them invited Johnson to record his loud raggy whistling on wax phonograph cylinders for a fee of twenty cents per two-minute performance. Although Johnson could whistle all the tunes of the day, one of his first recordings for both companies was a popular vaudeville novelty song called &quot;The Whistling Coon&quot;. Johnson sang as well as whistled, and also was able to give a boisterous laugh in musical pitch. From this he developed the second performance that made him famous, &quot;The Laughing Song&quot;. Although he recorded other material, including whistling the song &quot;Listen to the Mockingbird&quot; and some short minstrel show performances done with other performers, it was these two songs that Johnson would perform and record over and over for years.

In the earliest days of the recording industry, every record was a &quot;master&quot;. A singer with a strong voice could make three or four usable recordings at once, with as many machines running simultaneously with their recording horns pointed towards the singer&#x27;s mouth. Johnson would sometimes sing the same song over and over again in the recording studio fifty or more times a day.

By 1895, Johnson&#x27;s two tunes &quot;The Whistling Coon&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Song&quot; were the best-selling recordings in the United States. &quot;The Laughing Song&quot; was number one for ten weeks from April to June 1891, while &quot;The Whistling Coon&quot; was number one for five weeks in July and August 1891. Johnson was the first African American to appear on the pop chart, and his song on the chart was the first to have been written by an African American. The total sales of his wax cylinders between 1890 and 1895 have been estimated at 25,000 to 50,000, each one recorded individually by Johnson. Remarkably, the New Jersey record company marketed Johnson as a black man, during an era when much of American life was strongly segregated by race. &quot;The Whistling Coon&quot; was characterized by a light-hearted tune and lyrics which would be unacceptable today, in which a black man is compared to a baboon.

Johnson continued recording for the New York and New Jersey companies, and in 1891 also started recording for their parent company, the North American Phonograph Company. At least one of his 1891 recording sessions was held at Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey. Johnson also made appearances in Vaudeville. His repertory on stage was pretty much limited to his two famous songs, but this was sufficient to get him bookings on bills.

In 1894, Johnson began recording with Len Spencer, a Vaudeville star of the era, and the two would remain friends until the end of Johnson&#x27;s life. In 1895, Johnson made his first recordings on the new disc technology for Berliner Gramophone. In addition to Berliner, Johnson recorded for Edison Records, Columbia, the Victor Talking Machine Company, the Chicago Talking Machine Company, Bettini and numerous other small cylinder and disc companies through the 1890s and up to 1909 or 1910.

In 1897, Johnson recorded two new songs, &quot;The Laughing Coon&quot; and &quot;The Whistling Girl&quot;. They remained in the Edison and Columbia catalogs for years, although neither was as popular as his two original tunes.

==Later life==
By 1905, Johnson&#x27;s popularity had declined. New recording technology enabled the pressing of thousands of duplicate records from a single master, and Johnson was no longer needed to record each copy individually. His friend Len Spencer, now a successful artist and booking agent, hired Johnson as an office doorman. Johnson worked for Spencer and lived in his office building for several years, then moved back to Harlem. Johnson died from pneumonia and myocarditis in 1914 at the age of 67. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Maple Grove Cemetery in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York.

== Personal life and rumors ==
False rumors have circulated that Johnson died either in a racially motivated lynching, or alternatively that he was hanged after he committed murder. While neither story is true, Johnson did have an &#x27;eventful&#x27; personal life. There is no evidence that he ever legally married or had any children, but Johnson did have at least two &#x27;common-law wives&#x27;, both of whom died while living with him. The first, an unnamed &quot;German woman&quot;, was found dead in their apartment on West 39th Street in late 1894 or early 1895. No charges were filed. The second, Roskin Stuart, was found beaten and unconscious in their apartment on West 41st Street on October 12, 1899. Stuart was taken to the hospital and died a few hours later. Johnson was tried for first-degree murder and found not guilty.

==Honors==
In 2013 the Maple Grove Historical Preservation Society began a campaign to honor Johnson, and received a grant from the MusiCares Foundation to erect a plaque on his grave site. On April 12, 2014, a century after his death, the singer was finally recognized in a ceremony including displays, presentations and a performance by actor Larry Marshall who impersonated Johnson.

Also in 2013, his c. 1896 recording of &quot;The Laughing Song&quot; was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry.

<doc id="362371" wikidata="Q457477" url="?curid=362371" title="Whooping crane">
<text>The whooping crane (Grus americana) is an endangered crane species, native to North America, named for its &quot;whooping&quot; calls. Along with the sandhill crane (&quot;Antigone canadensis&quot;), it is one of only two crane species native to North America, and it is also the tallest North American bird species. The whooping crane&#x27;s lifespan is estimated to be 22–24 years in the wild. After being pushed to the brink of extinction, due to unregulated hunting and loss of habitat, and just 21 wild (and two captive) cranes remaining by 1941, conservation efforts would lead to a partial recovery. The total number of cranes in the surviving migratory population, plus three reintroduced flocks and in-captivity, only slightly exceeds 800 birds .

==Taxonomy==
The whooping crane was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons and cranes in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea america&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on those by two English naturalists. In 1729–1732 Mark Catesby had described and illustrated the whooping crane in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;, and in 1750 George Edwards had described and illustrated the crane using a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of northeast Canada by James Isham, an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America but this has been restricted to the Hudson Bay. The whooping crane is now one of eight species placed in the genus &quot;Grus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is considered to be monotypic as no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
An adult whooping crane is white with a red crown and a long, dark, pointed bill. However, immature whooping cranes are cinnamon brown. While in flight, their long necks are kept straight and their long dark legs trail behind. Adult whooping cranes&#x27; black wing tips are visible during flight.

On average, the whooping crane is the fifth-largest extant species of crane in the world. Whooping cranes are the tallest bird native to North America and are anywhere from the third to the fifth heaviest species on the continent, depending on which figures are used. The species can reportedly stand anywhere from in height. Wingspan, at least typically, is from . Widely reported averages put males at a mean mass of , while females weigh on average (Erickson, 1976). However, one small sample of unsexed whooping cranes weighed on average. Typical weights of adults seem to be between . The body length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, averages about . The standard linear measurements of the whooping cranes are a wing chord length of , an exposed culmen length of and a tarsus of . The only other very large, long-legged white birds in North America are: the great egret, which is over a foot (30 cm) shorter and one-seventh the weight of this crane; the great white heron, which is a morph of the great blue heron in Florida; and the wood stork. All three other birds are at least 30% smaller than the whooping crane. Herons and storks are also quite different in structure from the crane. Larger individuals (especially males of the larger races) of sandhill crane can overlap in size with adult whooping cranes but are obviously distinct at once for their gray rather than white color.

Their calls are loud and can carry several kilometers. They express &quot;guard calls&quot;, apparently to warn their partner about any potential danger. A crane pair jointly calls rhythmically (&quot;unison call&quot;) after waking in the early morning, after courtship, and when defending their territory. The first unison call ever recorded in the wild was taken in the whooping cranes&#x27; wintering area of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge during December 1999.

==Distribution and habitat==

At one time, the range for the whooping crane extended throughout midwestern North America as well as southward to Mexico. By the mid-20th century, the muskeg of the taiga in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta and Northwest Territories, Canada, and the surrounding area had become the last remnant of the former nesting habitat of the Whooping Crane Summer Range. However, with the recent Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership Reintroduction Project, whooping cranes nested naturally for the first time in 100 years in the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, United States, and these have subsequently expanded their summer range in Wisconsin and surrounding states, while reintroduced experimental non-migratory populations have nested in Florida and Louisiana.

Whooping cranes nest on the ground, usually on a raised area in a marsh. The female lays 1 or 2 eggs, usually in late-April to mid-May. The blotchy, olive-coloured eggs average 2½ inches in breadth and 4 inches in length (60 by 100 mm), and weigh about . The incubation period is 29–31 days. Both parents brood the young, although the female is more likely to directly tend to the young. Usually no more than one young bird survives in a season. The parents often feed the young for 6–8 months after birth and the terminus of the offspring-parent relationship occurs after about 1 year.

Breeding populations winter along the Gulf coast of Texas, United States, near Rockport on the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and along Sunset Lake in Portland, Matagorda Island, Isla San Jose, and portions of the Lamar Peninsula and Welder Point, which is on the east side of San Antonio Bay.

The Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma is a major migratory stopover for the crane population, hosting over 75% of the species annually.

As many as nine whooping cranes were observed at various times on Granger Lake in Central Texas in the 2011/2012 winter season. Drought conditions in 2011 exposed much of the lake bed, creating ample feeding grounds for these cranes just as they were taking their autumn migration through Texas.

==Predators==

Their many potential nest and brood predators include the American black bear, wolverine, gray wolf, cougar, red fox, Canada lynx, bald eagle, and common raven. Golden eagles have killed some young whooping cranes and fledglings. Due to their large size, adult birds in the wild have few predators. However, American alligators have taken a few whooping cranes in Florida, and the bobcat has killed many captive-raised whooping cranes in Florida and Texas. In Florida, bobcats have caused the great majority of natural mortalities among whooping cranes, including several ambushed adults and the first chick documented to be born in the wild in 60 years. Adult cranes can usually deter or avoid attacks by medium-sized predators such as coyotes when aware of a predator&#x27;s presence, but the captive-raised cranes haven&#x27;t learned to roost in deep water, which makes them vulnerable to ambush. As they are less experienced, juvenile cranes may be notably more vulnerable to ambushes by bobcats. Patuxent Wildlife Research Center scientists believe that this is due to an overpopulation of bobcats caused by the absence or decrease in larger predators (the endangered Florida panther and the extirpated red wolf) that formerly preyed on bobcats. At least 12 bobcats have been trapped and relocated in an attempt to save the cranes.

==Diet==

These birds forage while walking in shallow water or in fields, sometimes probing with their bills. They are omnivorous but tend to be more inclined to animal material than most other cranes. Only the red-crowned crane may have a more carnivorous diet among living cranes. In their Texas wintering grounds, this species feeds on various crustaceans, mollusks, grasshoppers, fish (such as eel), small reptiles (such as snakes), mice, voles, aquatic plants, acorns and fruits (such as wolfberry [&quot;Lycium carolinianum&quot;]). Potential foods of breeding birds in summer include frogs, snakes, small rodents, small birds, fish (such as minnows), aquatic insects, crayfish, clams, snails, aquatic tubers, and berries. Six studies from 1946 to 2005 have reported that blue crabs (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;) are a significant food source for whooping cranes wintering at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, constituting up to 90 percent of their energy intake in two winters; 1992–93 and 1993–94.

Waste grain, including wheat, barley, and corn, is an important food for migrating whooping cranes, but they do not swallow gizzard stones; they digest grain less efficiently than sandhill cranes.

==Individual recognition, territorial and partnership fidelity==

In earlier years, whooping crane chicks were caught and banded in the breeding areas of Wood Buffalo National Park. Although this delivered valuable insight into individual life history and behaviour, it has been discontinued due to risks to the cranes and the people involved.

By recording guard and unison calls followed by frequency analysis of the recording, a &quot;voiceprint&quot; of the individual crane (and of pairs) can be generated and compared over time. This technique was developed by B. Wessling and applied in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and also partially in the breeding grounds in Canada over five years. It delivered interesting results, i.e. that besides a certain fraction of stable pairs with strong affinity to their territories, there is a big fraction of cranes who change partners and territories. Only one of the exciting results was to identify the &quot;Lobstick&quot; male when he still had his band; he later lost his band and was recognized by frequency analysis of his voice and then was confirmed to be over 26 years old and still productive.

==Conservation efforts==
Whooping cranes are believed to have been naturally rare, and major population declines caused by habitat destruction and overhunting led them to them become critically endangered. Even with hunting bans, illegal hunting has continued in spite of potential substantial financial penalties and possible prison time. The population went from an estimated 10,000+ birds before the settling of Europeans on the continent to 1,300-1,400 birds by 1870. By 1938 there were just 15 adults in a single migratory flock, plus about thirteen additional birds living in a non-migratory population in Louisiana, but the latter were scattered by a 1940 hurricane that killed half of them, while the survivors never again reproduced in the wild.

In the early 1960s, Robert Porter Allen, an ornithologist with the National Audubon Society, appeared as a guest challenger on the network television show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;, which gave the Conservation movement some opportunity to update the public on their efforts to save the whooping crane from extinction. His initial efforts focused on public education, particularly among farmers and hunters. Beginning in 1961, the Whooping Crane Conservation Association (WCCA), was established to improve the status of the whooping cranes. This non-profit organization functioned largely by influencing federal, state and provincial political decisions and educating the general public about the critical status of the bird. The whooping crane was declared endangered in 1967.

Allen had begun an effort at captive breeding with a female crane named &#x27;Josephine&#x27;, the sole survivor of the Louisiana population, injured and taken into captivity in 1940, and two successive injured birds from the migratory population, &#x27;Pete&#x27; and &#x27;Crip&#x27;, at the Audubon Zoo and the Aransas refuge. Josephine and Crip produced the first whooping crane born in captivity in 1950, but this chick only lived four days, and though decades of further efforts produced more than 50 eggs before Josephine&#x27;s death in 1965, only four chicks survived to adulthood and none of them bred. At the same time, the wild population was not thriving. In spite of the efforts of conservationists, hunting bans and educational programs, the aging wild population would gain only 10 birds in the first 25 years of monitoring, with entire years passing without a single new juvenile joining those that returned to the Texas wintering grounds. This led to a renewed tension between those who favored efforts to preserve the wild population and others seeing a captive breeding program as the only hope for whooping crane survival, even though it must depend on individuals withdrawn from the extremely-vulnerable wild population.

Identification of the location of the summer breeding grounds of the whooping cranes at Wood Buffalo National Park in 1954 allowed more detailed study of their reproductive habits in the wild, and led to the observation that while many breeding pairs laid two eggs, rearing efforts seemed to favor a single chick, and both chicks would almost never survive to fledge. It was concluded that the removal of a single egg from a two-egg clutch should still leave a single hatchling most likely to survive, while providing an individual for captive breeding. Such removals in alternating years showed no decline in the reproductive success of the wild cranes. The withdrawn eggs were transferred to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, where approaches for hatching and rearing crane chicks in captivity had already been optimized using the more-numerous sandhill cranes. Initial challenges getting the resultant birds to reproduce, even using artificial insemination approaches, would give impetus to the first, unsuccessful attempt at reintroduction, by swapping whooping crane eggs into the nests of the more numerous sandhill cranes as a way to establish a backup population.

In 1976, with the wild population numbering only 60 birds and having increased at an average of only one bird per year over the past decades, ornithologist George W. Archibald, co-founder of the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin, began working with &#x27;Tex&#x27;, a female whooping crane hatched at the San Antonio Zoo in 1967 to Crip and his new mate, the wild-captured &#x27;Rosie&#x27;, to get her to lay a fertile egg through artificial insemination. Archibald pioneered several techniques to rear cranes in captivity, including the use of crane costumes by human handlers. Archibald spent three years with Tex, acting as a male crane – walking, calling, dancing – to shift her into reproductive condition. As Archibald recounted the tale on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1982, he stunned the audience and host Johnny Carson with the sad end of the story – the death of Tex shortly after the hatching of her one and only chick, named &#x27;Gee Whiz&#x27;. Gee Whiz was successfully raised and mated with female whooping cranes. The techniques pioneered at Patuxent, the International Crane Foundation and a program at the Calgary Zoo would give rise to a robust multi-institutional captive breeding program that would supply the cranes used in several additional captive breeding and reintroduction programs. A single male crane, &#x27;Canus&#x27;, rescued in 1964 as an injured wild chick and taken to Patuxent in 1966, would by the time of his 2003 death be the sire, grandsire or great-grandsire of 186 captive-bred whooping cranes. In 2017, the decision was made for the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center to end its 51-year effort to breed and train whooping cranes for release, due to changing priorities and in the face of budget cuts by the Trump administration. Their flock of 75 birds was moved in 2018 to join captive breeding programs at zoos or private foundations, including the Calgary Zoo, the International Crane Foundation, the Audubon Species Survival Center in Louisiana, and other sites in Florida, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas. This relocation is expected to negatively impact the reproductive success of the captive cranes, at least in the short term, and concerns were raised over its impact on the reintroduction efforts for which the Patuxent program had been providing birds.

Meanwhile, the wild crane population began a steady increase, such that in 2007 the Canadian Wildlife Service counted 266 birds at Wood Buffalo National Park, with 73 mating pairs that produced 80 chicks, 39 of which completed the fall migration, while a United States Fish and Wildlife Service count in early 2017 estimated that 505 whooping cranes, including 49 juveniles, had arrived at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge that season. As of 2020, there were an estimated 677 birds living in the wild, in the remnant original migratory population as well as three reintroduced populations, while 177 birds were at the time held in captivity at 17 institutions in Canada and the United States, putting the total population at over 800.

The wild cranes winter in marshy areas along the Gulf Coast in and surrounding the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. An environmental group, The Aransas Project, has sued the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), maintaining that the agency violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to ensure adequate water supplies for the birds&#x27; range. The group attributes the deaths of nearly two dozen whooping cranes in the winter of 2008 and 2009 to inadequate flows from the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers. In March 2013 during continuing drought conditions, a federal court ordered TCEQ to develop a habitat protection plan for the crane and to cease issuing permits for waters from the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers. A judge amended the ruling to allow TCEQ to continue issuing permits necessary to protect the public&#x27;s health and safety. An appeals court eventually granted a stay in the order during the appeals process. The Guadalupe-Blanco and San Antonio river authorities joined TCEQ in the lawsuit, warning that restricting the use of their waters would have serious effects on the cities of New Braunfels and San Marcos as well as major industrial users along the coast. To address the potential of future crowding that may result from the increasing migratory population, in 2012 and following years, purchases of small plots of land and acquisition of conservation easements covering larger areas has led to the protection of tens of thousands of additional acres of potential coastal habitat near the Aransas reserve. A large purchase of over 17,000 acres in 2014 was paid for with $35 million made available from the settlement over the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill and an additional $15 million raised by a Texas parks non-profit.

Concerns have been raised over the effects of climate change on the migratory cycle of the surviving wild population. The cranes arrive on their nesting grounds in April and May to breed and begin their nesting. When young whooping cranes are ready to leave the nest, they depart in September and follow the migratory trail through Texas.

===Reintroduction===
Several attempts have been made to establish other breeding populations outside of captivity.
* The first project, carried out by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife Service and initiated in 1975, involved cross-fostering second eggs from the wild population in the nests of sandhill cranes to establish a second self-sustaining flock using a flyway from Idaho across Utah to New Mexico. The 289 transplanted eggs resulted in 85 chicks that learned to migrate, but the whooping cranes failed to mate with other whooping cranes due to imprinting on their sandhill foster parents. The project was discontinued in 1989, and no members of this population survived. The initiation of this effort and the problem of imprinting are explored in the 1976 documentary &quot;A Great White Bird&quot;.
* A second effort involved the establishment of a non-migratory population near Kissimmee, Florida, by a cooperative effort led by the U.S. and Canadian Whooping Crane Recovery Team in 1993. A total of 289 captive-bred birds provided by the International Crane Foundation were released in the wild between 1993 and 2004. Though in 2003 the population had produced the first chick conceived in the wild to reintroduced cranes, a decision was made in 2005 to release no further birds into the population until problems with high mortality and poor reproductive success were resolved. Studies of the population were discontinued in 2012. The population numbered about 50 adults and 4 chicks in October 2006 but subsequently dwindled to just 14 cranes in March 2018. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a plan to relocate the surviving Kissimmee crane population to join the newer Louisiana reintroduced non-migratory flock, and due to the lack of available mates, two Florida birds were moved to Louisiana in February 2019, including the mother of the first wild-born chick. As of 2020, there were just 9 birds remaining in the Florida population, with another relocated to Louisiana in 2021.

* A third attempt has involved reintroducing the whooping crane to a new flyway established east of the Mississippi river, with its southern end just west of the Atlantic flyway. This project used isolation rearing of young whooping cranes and trained them to follow ultralight aircraft, a method of re-establishing migration routes pioneered by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff working with Canada geese. The ultralight flights were managed by a non-profit organization, Operation Migration, working with the larger Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP), which oversees all aspects of the reintroduced Eastern Migratory Population. Subsequent to hatching, the Operation Migration cranes were taught to follow the ultralight, fledged over their future breeding territory in Wisconsin, and led by the aircraft on their first migration from Wisconsin to Florida. Having learned the migratory route, they then returned north on their own the following spring. With the growth of this reintroduced population, WCEP also began releasing captive-reared juvenile cranes directly into the flock to learn migratory behavior from their peers, in a process referred to as Direct Autumn Release (DAR).

:This reintroduction began in fall 2001 and added birds to the population in subsequent years. Two whooping crane chicks were hatched in the wild from one nest in 2006, to parents that had been part of the first ultralight-led release in 2002, and one of these survived to successfully migrate with her parents to Florida. In early February, 2007, 17 yearlings in a group of 18 were killed by the 2007 Central Florida tornadoes, with the sole survivor dying in late April an unknown cause, possibly related to the storm trauma. Two of the four DAR chicks from 2006 were also lost due to predation. In spite of this, as of May, 2011, there were 105 surviving whooping cranes in the Eastern Migratory Population (EMP), including 17 that had formed pairs, several of which are nesting and are incubating eggs.

:In December 2011, the Operation Migration escort of nine cranes was interrupted by the Federal Aviation Administration due to a regulation prohibiting paid pilots of ultralight aircraft. After a month with the cranes kept in a pen, the FAA finally granted a one-time exemption to allow completion of the migration. In January 2016, citing the near-total failure of the hand-raised and guided birds to reproduce in the wild, the Fish and Wildlife Service made a decision to discontinue the ultralight program in favor of alternatives with reduced human interaction. In June 2018, the size of this population was estimated at 102 birds. This number had dropped to 86 birds in 2020.

* Due to the vulnerability and low reproductive success of the Florida non-migratory population, a new effort was made to establish a non-migratory population in Louisiana&#x27;s White Lake Wetlands Conservation Area, the home of the historical non-migratory population of whooping cranes. This is a cooperative effort of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Louisiana Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at LSU, and the International Crane Foundation. In March 2011, 10 cranes were released, but all but three had been lost by the time a second group of 16 were released in December. Subsequent annual cohorts followed, ranging in size from 10 to 27 birds. In 2019, the population began receiving birds relocated from the failed Florida reintroduction effort with the arrival of a 21-year old reintroduced female and her wild-born 4-year-old daughter, followed by the transfer of a juvenile female in 2021.

:The flock has established a range centered on southwestern Louisiana but also including central and northeastern Louisiana and east Texas, with an occasional stray found more broadly. None of the first released group survived to full maturity, but in the Spring of 2014 the second cohort of birds began to form pairs and nest, producing the population&#x27;s first eggs, although since the parents were still juveniles these eggs were infertile. The next year saw fertile eggs but none survived to hatching. However, in April 2016 a pair of reintroduced cranes hatched two chicks, one of which survived to fledge, represented the first in the wild in Louisiana since 1939. Starting in 2017, a novel strategy was introduced: eggs in the process of hatching, taken from captive birds, were swapped into Louisiana nests in place of infertile eggs, allowing the chicks to be raised by substitute crane parents in the wild. In 2018, a combination of naturally-laid and substituted eggs added five wild-raised juveniles to the population, which all survived to fledge. As of August 2018, 125 birds had been released, with at least 65 surviving, while in 2020 following further releases, relocations from Florida, and several wild fledgings, there were 76 birds in this population.

A major hurdle with some of these reintroduced populations has been deaths to illegal hunting. Over a period of two years, five of the approximately 100 whooping cranes in the Eastern Migratory Population were illegally shot and killed. One of the dead cranes was the female known as &quot;First Mom&quot;. In 2006, she and her mate were the first eastern captive raised and released pair to successfully raise a chick to adulthood in the wild. This was a particular blow to that population because whooping cranes do not yet have an established successful breeding situation in the East. On March 30, 2011, Wade Bennett, 18, of Cayuga, Indiana and an unnamed juvenile pleaded guilty to killing First Mom. After killing the crane, the juvenile had posed holding up her body. Bennett and the juvenile were sentenced to a $1 fine, probation, and court fees of about $500, a penalty which was denounced by various conservation organizations as being too light. The prosecuting attorney has estimated that the cost of raising and introducing to the wild one whooping crane could be as much as $100,000. Overall, the International Crane Foundation estimates that the nearly 20% of deaths among the reintroduced cranes in the Eastern Migratory Population are due to shootings.

Illegal shootings have accounted for an even larger proportion of mortality among the birds introduced into the Louisiana population, with about 10% of the first 147 released cranes being shot and killed. Two juveniles were apprehended for a 2011 incident, a Louisiana man was sentenced to 45 days imprisonment and a $2500 fine after pleading guilty to a killing in November 2014, and a Texas man was fined $25,000 for a January 2016 shooting and barred from possessing firearms during a 5-year probation period, on subsequent violation of which he was given an 11-month custodial sentence. On the other hand, a Louisiana man cited for a July 2018 shooting received probation, community service and hunting and fishing restrictions but no fine or firearms restriction. Two Louisiana juveniles were cited in 2018 for a May 2016 incident.

<text>Gymnosophists (, &quot;gymnosophistaí&quot;, i.e. &quot;naked philosophers&quot; or &quot;naked wise men&quot; (from Greek γυμνός &quot;gymnós&quot; &quot;naked&quot; and σοφία &quot;sophía&quot; &quot;wisdom&quot;)) is the name given by the Greeks to certain ancient Indian philosophers who pursued asceticism to the point of regarding food and clothing as detrimental to purity of thought. They were noted to have been vegetarian by several Greek authors. There were also gymnosophists in Upper Egypt who were called Ethiopian Gymnosophists by Apollonius of Tyana.

In Greek literature, they are mentioned in association with the Persian magi, the Chaldaeans of the Assyrians or the Babylonians, the druids of the Celts, and the priests of Egypt. Some sources claim that famous figures such as Lycurgus, Pythagoras, and Democritus may have met them. They are mentioned by authors such as Philo, Lucian, Clement of Alexandria, Philostratus, and Heliodorus of Emesa. These reports are thought to have served as models to Cynics as well as Christian ascetics. Many authors have discussed the purported questions by Alexander the Great and answers by the Gymnosophists.

==Ancient accounts==
The term gymnosophist was used by Plutarch (c. 46–120 CE) in the 1st century CE, when describing an encounter by Alexander the Great with ten gymnosophists near the banks of the Indus river in what is now Pakistan.

Diogenes Laërtius (fl. 3rd century AD) refers to them, and reports that Pyrrho of Ellis was influenced by the gymnosophists while in India with Alexander the Great, and on his return to Ellis, imitated their habits of life and caused him to found the Hellenistic philosophy of Pyrrhonism.

Strabo (64 or 63 BC – c. AD 24) says that gymnosophists were religious people among the Indians (XVI,I), and otherwise divides Indian philosophers into Brahmanas and Śramaṇas (XV,I,59–60), following the accounts of Megasthenes. He further divides the Sramanas into &quot;Hylobioi&quot; (forest hermits, c.f. Aranyaka) and &quot;Physicians&quot;.

Philo Judaeus (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), also called mentions the gymnosophists twice in the course of listing foreign ascetics and philosophers who are, in his estimation, &quot;prudent, and just, and virtuous&quot; and therefore truly free:

In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria distinguishes the gymnosophists, the philosophers of the Indians, from the Sramanas, &quot;the philosophers of the Bactrians&quot;:

Porphyry in the &quot;Peri Apoches&quot; gives a description of the Indian philosophers’ diet structured around the distinction between two kinds of gymnosophists: the &quot;Brahmins&quot; and the &quot;Samaneans&quot;. The Brahmins are described as &quot;theosophoi&quot; by descent. They are vegetarians and eat only fruit, yogurt and rice. They are independent from the king and devote all their time to the worship. &quot;Samaneans&quot; probably refers to Buddhist monks from Bactria. They become philosophers by choice and may descend from any Indian caste. When they become Samaneans, they renounce all their possessions and shave the superfluous hair on their body. They live in communities and spend their time in debates about the divine.

==Classification==

===Indian===
The philosophical, religious, and tribal identities of the gymnosophists that the Greeks encountered in the 3rd century BC at the town of Taxila in Ancient India were not preserved in the ancient Greek literature, leading to much modern speculation. The following have been proposed as non-mutually exclusive possibilities.

====Brahmin====
Some sects of Brahmins belonging to Hinduism remained naked, lived in forests, practiced austerities, shaved their heads, ate only fruit and milk and meditated.

====Ājīvika====
The Ājīvika went without clothes. Their antinomian ethics match those Pyrrho brought back to Greece from his meetings with the gymnosophists.

====Brachmanes====
The Brachmanes or Bragmanes, who are identified with the Brahmanas of Vedic religion, remained unclothed. Porphyry mentions that they lived on milk and fruits, similar to Vedic Brahmins.

====Digambara====
Jain Digambara went naked and preached non-violence and were identified as gymnosophists.

====Naga sadhu====
The Naga sadhus (&quot;naked saints&quot;) have been identified with the gymnosophists by some modern writers: they are historically known to carry arms, and learn martial arts which are promoted in their akharas. They move totally naked except for the arms they carry. The Naga sadhus are often called Indian gymnosophists. They are mostly worshipers of Shiva and carry Trishula, swords and even other weapons. They were known for taking up arms to defend their faith.

====Shramanas====
The ancient Shramanas, who included both the Digambara sect of Jain monks and Buddhist priests, have been identified as gymnosophists by researchers.

===Ethiopian===
The school of naked philosophers in upper Egypt was visited by the Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15 – c. 100 AD) who called them Ethiopian Gymnosophists. Apollonius had met the gymnosophists of India before his arrival in Egypt, and repeatedly compared the Ethiopian Gymnosophists with them. He regarded them to be derived from the Indians. They lived without any cottages nor houses, but had a shelter for the visitors. They did not wear any clothes and thus compared themselves to the Olympian athletes. They shared their vegetarian meal with him.

<text>The DZ Bank building (formerly DG Bank building) is an office, conference, and residential building located at Pariser Platz 3 in Berlin. It was designed by architect Frank Gehry and engineered by Hans Schober of Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2000.

The building is mixed-use. Facing the Brandenburg Gate are offices, the headquarters of Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank. On the other side, facing Behrenstraße, are 39 residential apartments. Between the two is a large atrium, designed to be used as a conference or performance space. This is covered with a sophisticated glass-grid roof, curved in a complex form typical of Gehry&#x27;s designs.

<doc id="362378" wikidata="Q8423098" url="?curid=362378" title="Individual Visit Scheme">
<text>The Individual Visit Scheme () begun on 28 July 2003 allowing travelers from Mainland China to visit Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis; prior to the Scheme, Mainland residents could only visit on business visas or on group tours.

The outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong from March to June 2003 resulted in a sharp drop in Mainland and foreign visitors to an unprecedented low, adversely affecting the tourist industry.

The main reason for launching the Individual Visit Scheme was to boost the economy of Hong Kong and Macau. In the initial stage of the scheme, residents of Beijing, Shanghai, and 8 Guangdong provincial cities (Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Zhongshan and Zhuhai) could apply for visas to visit the two &#x27;Special Administrative Regions&#x27; individually.

The scheme was extended to all 21 cities of Guangdong province in July 2004, and to 9 other cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces in July 2004.

The visas, issued by the Public Security Bureau of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, were valid for 7 days and could be renewed upon return from Hong Kong to the Mainland.

The scheme brought an immediate surge in the number of Mainland visitors. In the short period between 28 July and 4 November 2003, more than 600,000 individuals on the Mainland applied for visas and 450,000 visas were issued. The number of visitors under the scheme reached two million by May 2004.

== Development ==
The Individual Visit Scheme allows select tourists from designated cities and provinces in mainland China to visit Hong Kong and Macau by using individual visas (as opposed the needing to travel as part of a government-approved tour group).

Initially, the Individual Visit Scheme was only open to residents of Beijing, Shanghai, and eight cities in Guangdong province. China&#x27;s central government expanded the program once it was shown to be successful. As of 2023, the Individual Visa Scheme is open to residents of 49 Chinese cities.

==1 October Golden Week==
1 October Golden Week is the period from 1 to 7 October, coinciding with the National Day of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 October. Therefore, more Mainlanders are able to visit Hong Kong during the holiday. In 2003, this holiday drew 287,000 Mainland visitors to Hong Kong, including 80,000 to 90,000 individual travellers. During, the hotel occupancy rate reached 75% to 80%. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation organised promotional programs at Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay and Maritime Square in Tsing Yi during the National Day holiday.

In addition, the HKSAR Government has adopted a number of measures to deal with the huge influx of individual visitors. At the Lo Wu border crossing, there was an increase in the number of Hong Kong immigration officers on duty, and the time for checking in was reduced. Also, the number of MTR trains departing from Lo Wu was increased to reduce congestion. In addition, visitors from Shanghai and Beijing were encouraged to travel by plane to prevent congestion in Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau.

According to the statistics released by the Immigration Department, about 800,000 to 900,000 Mainland visitors travel to Hong Kong monthly. The ratio of visitors under the scheme rose from 5% to 16.8% between August and October 2003, and to more than 30% in May 2004.

The increase in the number of Mainland tourists has benefits the economy of Hong Kong, demonstrating the economy is on an upward track. Average occupancy rate across all categories of hotels and tourist guest houses in September 2003 was 82%, the same as that in September 2002. This performance was spread across different types of hotels, with the top-tariff hotels achieving 81% occupancy and those of medium tariff recording 83%. The average achieved room rate was HK$684, the highest figure since April 2003, although this is still 2.8% below the comparable rate for September 2002. And in 2006,among the spending of all the visitors in Hong Kong, mainland visitors has taken up to $400 billion, which is one-third of the income.

The government has set up an Economy Relaunch Campaign, which includes raffles, the Lantau Festival, and Individual Visits to provide extra resources to revive the economy. These enhance the appeal of the Individual Visit Scheme.

&quot;As the scheme is attracting a large number of Mainlanders to Hong Kong, it created a &#x27;positive by-product&#x27; to attract overseas travelers to visit Hong Kong,&quot; said Miss Kinnie Wong, the assistant commissioner of the Tourism Commission. She added that tourists from overseas markets such as the United States and Australia may feel safe visiting Hong Kong again in the coming winter or during the Chinese New Year.

It has been suggested that more and more Mainlanders coming to Hong Kong will lead to the authorised saving of Ain Hong Kong. This change enables Mainland travellers access to money more easily when they need it. As a result, it will be more convenient for them to shop and trade in Hong Kong. Besides, the simplicity of the visa application process makes it beneficial. Since people are usually not willing to perform complicated procedures to apply for visas before visiting another place, the Individual Visit Scheme helps encourage visitors to Hong Kong. These two effects are considered long term.

She also pointed out that women joining the Individual Visit Scheme come to Hong Kong because they want to purchase brand-name products. An individual traveller, Mrs. Chiu, said that the brand-name products in Hong Kong are of more variety and are much cheaper when compared with other foreign countries.

As a short-term effect, there will be a rise in the employment rate and investment. Owners of shops or companies can foresee this vital trend and will employ more people to meet the needs of the influx of Mainland travellers.

==Social impact==
The establishment of the Individual Visa Scheme resulted in a surge of tourism to Macau.

The Hong Kong Government repeatedly pointed out that the crime rate of Mainland visitors under the scheme was very low. From August 2003 to May 2004, the number of individual visitors who were arrested for committing crimes such as theft or fraud was only 183, compared with more than 2 million visitors under the scheme.

Mr. Chan Wing-Kai, the head of the Consumer Complaints &amp; Advice Council, said, &quot;The percentage of complaints made by individual visitors is 9.3%, which is relatively low.&quot; The number of complaints made by individual visitors up to October was around 50. Many cases were due to misunderstandings, such as differences between consumer cultures.

<doc id="362379" wikidata="Q811630" url="?curid=362379" title="Caber toss">
<text>The caber toss () is a traditional Scottish athletic event in which competitors toss a large tapered pole called a &quot;caber&quot; (). It is normally practised at the Scottish Highland Games. In Scotland, the caber is usually made from a larch tree, and it can be between tall and weigh . The term &quot;caber&quot; derives from the Gaelic word &quot;cabar&quot;, which refers to a wooden beam.

The person tossing the caber is called a &quot;tosser&quot; or a &quot;thrower&quot;.

Although the sport is primarily associated with Scotland, a similar exercise, &quot;casting the bar&quot;, was popular in England in the 16th century, and similar sports exist around the world, such as stångstörtning in Sweden.

The record for most caber tosses in three minutes is currently held by Scottish teenager Andrew Murphie. He managed to perform 26 successful caber tosses on 23 June 2024 in Grantown on Spey, Scotland smashing the previous record of 16, which was set in Canada. Each caber was more than 5m (16ft) long and weighed more than 40kg (88lbs), and they had to be flipped over end to end.

The Braemar Caber is the worlds most famous Caber being 19ft 6 inches long and 132lbs in weight and has been won the most times by Alistair Gunn of Halkirk who has won it 8 times, the 8th time in 2007.
==Objective and technique==
The primary objective is to toss the caber so that it turns end over end, falling away from the tosser. Ideally it should fall directly away from the tosser in the &quot;12 o&#x27;clock&quot; position. The distance thrown is unimportant.

The tosser balances the caber upright, tapered end downwards, against his or her shoulder and neck, the caber being supported by stewards or fellow-competitors while being placed into position. The tosser then crouches, sliding their interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base, and lifts it in their cupped hands. 
The tosser must balance the caber upright; this is not easy with the heavier end at the top, and less-experienced tossers may be unable to stop the caber falling to one side after lifting it. The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum, and flips the tapered end upwards so that the large end hits the ground first, and, if well tossed, the caber falls directly away from the tosser.

Weight and strength are essential for success, but technique is also important for balancing the caber when lifting it, and flipping up the held (tapered) end to promote a clean toss.

==Scoring==

The straightest end-over-end toss scores highest. If the caber lands on its end but falls back towards the thrower, the score is lower than for any end-over-end throw but is based upon the maximum vertical angle that the caber achieved (side-judging may involve a second judge).

End-over-end tosses are scored according to the hours on a clock, with a 12:00 score being highest (falling directly away from the thrower), down to a 9 or 3 for cabers that reach a vertical, before falling to the side.

<text>Emil Leon Post (; February 11, 1897 – April 21, 1954) was an American mathematician and logician. He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as computability theory.

==Life==
Post was born in Augustów, Suwałki Governorate, Congress Poland, Russian Empire (now Poland) into a Polish-Jewish family that immigrated to New York City in May 1904. His parents were Arnold and Pearl Post.

Post had been interested in astronomy, but at the age of twelve lost his left arm in a car accident. This loss was a significant obstacle to being a professional astronomer, leading to his decision to pursue mathematics rather than astronomy.

Post attended the Townsend Harris High School and continued on to graduate from City College of New York in 1917 with a B.S. in mathematics.

After completing his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1920 at Columbia University, supervised by Cassius Jackson Keyser, he did a post-doctorate at Princeton University in the 1920–1921 academic year. Post then became a high school mathematics teacher in New York City.

Post married Gertrude Singer in 1929, with whom he had a daughter, Phyllis Post Goodman (1932–1995). Post spent at most three hours a day on research on the advice of his doctor in order to avoid manic attacks, which he had been experiencing since his year at Princeton.

In 1936, he was appointed to the mathematics department at the City College of New York. He died in April 1954 of a heart attack following electroshock treatment for depression, less than two months before the death of Alan Turing. He was 57.

==Early work==
In his doctoral thesis, later shortened and published as &quot;Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions&quot; (1921), Post proved, among other things, that the propositional calculus of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; was complete: all tautologies are theorems, given the &quot;Principia&quot; axioms and the rules of substitution and modus ponens. Post also devised truth tables independently of C. S. Peirce and Ludwig Wittgenstein and put them to good mathematical use. Jean van Heijenoort&#x27;s well-known source book on mathematical logic (1966) reprinted Post&#x27;s classic 1921 article setting out these results.

While at Princeton, Post came very close to discovering the incompleteness of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, which Kurt Gödel proved in 1931. Post initially failed to publish his ideas as he believed he needed a &#x27;complete analysis&#x27; for them to be accepted. As Post said in a postcard to Gödel in 1938:

:I would have discovered Gödel&#x27;s theorem in 1921—if I had been Gödel.

==Recursion theory==
In 1936, Post developed, independently of Alan Turing, a mathematical model of computation that was essentially equivalent to the Turing machine model. Intending this as the first of a series of models of equivalent power but increasing complexity, he titled his paper Formulation 1. This model is sometimes called &quot;Post&#x27;s machine&quot; or a Post–Turing machine, but is not to be confused with Post&#x27;s tag machines or other special kinds of Post canonical system, a computational model using string rewriting and developed by Post in the 1920s but first published in 1943. Post&#x27;s rewrite technique is now ubiquitous in programming language specification and design, and so with Church&#x27;s lambda calculus is a salient influence of classical modern logic on practical computing. Post devised a method of &#x27;auxiliary symbols&#x27; by which he could canonically represent any Post-generative language, and indeed any computable function or set at all.

Correspondence systems were introduced by Post in 1946 to give simple examples of undecidability. He showed that the Post correspondence problem (PCP) of satisfying their constraints is, in general, undecidable. The undecidability of the correspondence problem turned out to be exactly what was needed to obtain undecidability results in the theory of formal languages.

In an influential address to the American Mathematical Society in 1944, he raised the question of the existence of an uncomputable recursively enumerable set whose Turing degree is less than that of the halting problem. This question, which became known as Post&#x27;s problem, stimulated much research. It was solved in the affirmative in the 1950s by the introduction of the powerful priority method in computability theory.

==Polyadic groups==
Post made a fundamental and still influential contribution to the theory of polyadic, or &quot;n&quot;-ary, groups in a long paper published in 1940. His major theorem showed that a polyadic group is the iterated product of elements of a normal subgroup of a group, such that the quotient group is cyclic of order &quot;n&quot; − 1. He also demonstrated that a polyadic group operation on a set can be expressed in terms of a group operation on the same set. The paper contains many other important results.

<text>Witold Hurewicz (June 29, 1904 – September 6, 1956) was a Polish mathematician who worked in topology.

==Early life and education==
Witold Hurewicz was born in Łódź, at the time one of the main Polish industrial hubs with economy focused on the textile industry. His father Mieczysław Hurewicz was an industrialist born in Wilno, which until 1939 was mainly populated by Poles and Jews. His mother Katarzyna Finkelsztain hailed from Biała Cerkiew, a town that belonged to the Kingdom of Poland until the Second Partition of Poland (1793) when it was taken by Russia.

Hurewicz attended school in a German-controlled Poland but with World War I beginning before he had begun secondary school, major changes occurred in Poland. In August 1915 the Russian forces that had held Poland for many years withdrew. Germany and Austria-Hungary took control of most of the country and the University of Warsaw was refounded and it began operating as a Polish university. Rapidly, a strong school of mathematics grew up in the University of Warsaw, with topology one of the main topics. Although Hurewicz knew intimately the topology that was being studied in Poland he chose to go to Vienna to continue his studies.

He studied under Hans Hahn and Karl Menger in Vienna, receiving a PhD in 1926. Hurewicz was awarded a Rockefeller scholarship, which allowed him to spend the year 1927–28 in Amsterdam. He was assistant to L. E. J. Brouwer in Amsterdam from 1928 to 1936. He was given study leave for a year, which he decided to spend in the United States. He visited the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and then decided to remain in the United States and not return to his position in Amsterdam.

==Career==

Hurewicz worked first at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill but during World War II he contributed to the war effort with research on applied mathematics. In particular, the work he did on servomechanisms at that time was classified because of its military importance. From 1945 until his death he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Hurewicz&#x27;s early work was on set theory and topology. The &quot;Dictionary of Scientific Biography&quot; states:
&quot;...a remarkable result of this first period [1930] is his topological embedding of separable metric spaces into compact spaces of the same (finite) dimension.*&quot;

In the field of general topology his contributions are centred on dimension theory. He wrote an important text with Henry Wallman, &quot;Dimension Theory&quot;, published in 1941. A reviewer writes that the book &quot;...is truly a classic. It presents the theory of dimension for separable metric spaces with what seems to be an impossible mixture of depth, clarity, precision, succinctness, and comprehensiveness.&quot;

Hurewicz is best remembered for three remarkable contributions to mathematics: his discovery of the higher homotopy groups in 1935–36, his discovery of the long exact homotopy sequence for fibrations in 1941, and the Hurewicz theorem connecting homotopy and homology groups. His work led to homological algebra. It was during Hurewicz&#x27;s time as Brouwer&#x27;s assistant in Amsterdam that he did the work on the higher homotopy groups; &quot;...the idea was not new, but until Hurewicz nobody had pursued it as it should have been. Investigators did not expect much new information from groups, which were obviously commutative...&quot;

In the late 1940s, he was the doctoral advisor of Yael Dowker.

Hurewicz had a second textbook published, but this was not until 1958 after his death. &quot;Lectures on ordinary differential equations&quot; is an introduction to ordinary differential equations that again reflects the clarity of his thinking and the quality of his writing.

He died after participating in the International Symposium on Algebraic Topology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. He tripped and fell off the top of a Mayan step pyramid during an outing in Uxmal, Mexico. In the &quot;Dictionary of Scientific Biography&quot; it is suggested that he was &quot;...a paragon of absentmindedness, a failing that probably led to his death.&quot;

<doc id="362386" wikidata="Q1060990" url="?curid=362386" title="Problem-based learning">
<text>Problem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on problem solving with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes. This includes knowledge acquisition, enhanced group collaboration and communication.

The PBL process was developed for medical education and has since been broadened in applications for other programs of learning. The process allows for learners to develop skills used for their future practice. It enhances critical appraisal, literature retrieval and encourages ongoing learning within a team environment.

The PBL tutorial process often involves working in small groups of learners. Each student takes on a role within the group that may be formal or informal and the role often alternates. It is focused on the student&#x27;s reflection and reasoning to construct their own learning.

The Maastricht seven-jump process involves clarifying terms, defining problem(s), brainstorming, structuring and hypothesis, learning objectives, independent study and synthesising. In short, it is identifying what they already know, what they need to know, and how and where to access new information that may lead to the resolution of the problem.

The role of the tutor is to facilitate learning by supporting, guiding, and monitoring the learning process. The tutor aims to build students&#x27; confidence when addressing problems, while also expanding their understanding. This process is based on constructivism. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based.

The constructs for teaching PBL are very different from traditional classroom or lecture teaching and often require more preparation time and resources to support small group learning.

==Meaning==
Wood (2003) defines problem-based learning as a process that uses identified issues within a scenario to increase knowledge and understanding. The principles of this process are listed below:
# Learner-driven self-identified goals and outcomes
# Students do independent, self-directed study before returning to larger group
# Learning is done in small groups of 8–10 people, with a tutor to facilitate discussion
# Trigger materials such as paper-based clinical scenarios, lab data, photographs, articles or videos or patients (real or simulated) can be used
# The Maastricht 7-jump process helps to guide the PBL tutorial process
# Based on principles of adult learning theory
# All members of the group have a role to play
# Allows for knowledge acquisition through combined work and intellect
# Enhances teamwork and communication, problem-solving and encourages independent responsibility for shared learning - all essential skills for future practice
# Anyone can do it as long it is right depending on the given causes and scenario
The Maastricht 7-jump involves seven steps, which are:

# discuss the case and make sure everyone understands the problem
# identify the questions that need to be answered to shed light on the case
# brainstorm what the group already knows and identify potential solutions
# analyse and structure the results of the brainstorming session
# formulate learning objectives for the knowledge that is still lacking
# do independent study, individually or in smaller groups: read articles or books, follow practicals or attend lectures to gain the required knowledge
# discuss the findings

==History==
The PBL process was pioneered by Barrows and Tamblyn at the medical school program at McMaster University in Hamilton in the 1960s. Traditional medical education disenchanted students, who perceived the vast amount of material presented in the first three years of medical school as having little relevance to the practice of medicine and clinically based medicine. The PBL curriculum was developed in order to stimulate learning by allowing students to see the relevance and application to future roles. It maintains a higher level of motivation towards learning, and shows the importance of responsible, professional attitudes with teamwork values. The motivation for learning drives interest because it allows for selection of problems that have real-world application.

Problem-based learning has subsequently been adopted by other medical school programs adapted for undergraduate instruction, as well as K-12. The use of PBL has expanded from its initial introduction into medical school programs to include education in the areas of other health sciences, math, law, education, economics, business, social studies, and engineering. PBL includes problems that can be solved in many different ways depending on the initial identification of the problem and may have more than one solution.

In 1974, Aalborg University was funded in Denmark and all the programs (engineering, natural and social sciences) were based on PBL. The UNESCO Chair in Problem-Based Learning in Engineering Education is at Aalborg University. Currently its roughly 20,000 students still follow PBL principles.

==Advantages==

There are advantages of PBL. It is student-focused, which allows for active learning and better understanding and retention of knowledge. It also helps to develop life skills that are applicable to many domains. It can be used to enhance content knowledge while simultaneously fostering the development of communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, and self-directed learning skills.
PBL may position students to optimally function using real-world experiences. By harnessing collective group intellect, differing perspectives may offer different perceptions and solutions to a problem. Following are the advantages and limitations of problem-based learning.

=== Enhance student-centred learning ===

In problem-based learning the students are actively involved and they like this method. It fosters active learning, and also retention and development of lifelong learning skills. It encourages self-directed learning by confronting students with problems and stimulates the development of deep learning.

=== Upholds lifelong learning ===

Problem-based learning gives emphasis to lifelong learning by developing in students the potential to determine their own goals, locate appropriate resources for learning and assume responsibility for what they need to know. It also greatly helps them better long term knowledge retention.

=== Prominence on comprehension not facts ===

Problem-based learning focuses on engaging students in finding solutions to real life situations and pertinent contextualized problems. In this method discussion forums collaborative research take the place of lecturing.

=== In-depth learning and constructivist approach ===

PBL fosters learning by involving students with the interaction of learning materials. They relate the concept they study with everyday activities and enhance their knowledge and understanding. Students also activate their prior knowledge and build on existing conceptual knowledge frameworks.

=== Augments self-learning ===

Students themselves resolve the problems that are given to them, they take more interest and responsibility for their learning. They themselves will look for resources like research articles, journals, web materials, text books etc. for their purpose. Thus it equips them with more proficiency in seeking resources in comparison to the students of traditional learning methods.

=== Better understanding and adeptness ===

By giving more significance to the meaning, applicability and relevance to the learning materials it leads to better understanding of the subjects learnt. When students are given more challenging and significant problems are given it makes them more proficient. The real life contexts and problems makes their learning more profound, lasting and also enhance the transferability of skills and knowledge from the classroom to work. Since there is more scope for application of knowledge and skills the transferability is increased. It will be also very helpful to them not only to visualise what it will be like applying that knowledge and expertise on their field of work or profession.

=== Reinforces interpersonal skills and teamwork ===

Project based learning is more of teamwork and collaborative learning. The teams or groups resolve relevant problems in collaboration and hence it fosters student interaction, teamwork and reinforces interpersonal skills. like peer evaluation, working with group dynamic etc. It also fosters in them the leadership qualities, learn to make decision by consensus and give constructive feed back to the team members etc.

=== Self-motivated attitude ===

Researchers say that students like problem-based learning classes rather than the traditional classes. The increase in the percentage of attendance of students and their attitude towards this approach itself makes it very clear that they are self-motivated. In fact it is more fascinating, stimulating and one of the good learning methods because it is more flexible and interesting to students. They enjoy this environment of learning for it is less threatening and they can learn independently. All these aspects make students more self-motivated and they pursue learning even after they leave the school or college.

=== Enriches the teacher-student relationship ===

Since the students are self-motivated, good teamwork, self-directed learning etc. the teachers who have worked in both traditional and project based learning formats prefer project based learning. They also feel that problem-based learning is more nurturing, significant curriculum and beneficial to the cognitive growth of the student.

=== Higher level of learning ===

The PBL students score higher than the students in traditional courses because of their learning competencies, problem solving, self-assessment techniques, data gathering, behavioral science etc. It is because they are better at activating prior knowledge, and they learn in a context resembling their future context and elaborate more on the information presented which helps in better understanding and retention of knowledge. In medical education, PBL cases can incorporate dialogue between patients and physicians, demonstrate the narrative character of the medical encounter, and examine the political economic contributors to disease production. PBL can serve as a platform for a discursive practices approach to culture that emphasizes the emergent, participant-constructed qualities of social phenomena while also acknowledging large-scale social forces.

==Disadvantages==
According to Wood (2003), the major disadvantage to this process involves the utilization of resources and tutor facilitation. It requires more staff to take an active role in facilitation and group-led discussion and some educators find PBL facilitation difficult and frustrating. It is resource-intensive because it requires more physical space and more accessible computer resources to accommodate simultaneous smaller group-learning. Students also report uncertainty with information overload and are unable to determine how much study is required and the relevance of information available. Students may not have access to teachers who serve as the inspirational role models that traditional curriculum offers.

=== Time-consuming ===

Although students generally like and gain greater ability to solve real-life problems in problem-based learning courses, instructors of the methodology must often invest more time to assess student learning and prepare course materials, as compared to LBL instructors. Part of this frustration also stems from the amount of time dedicated to presenting new research and individual student findings regarding each specific topic, as well as the disorganised nature of brain-storming

=== Traditional assumptions of the students ===

The problem of the problem-based learning is the traditional assumptions of the students. Most of the students might have spent their previous years of education assuming their teacher as the main disseminator of knowledge. Because of this understanding towards the subject matter students may lack the ability to simply wonder about something in the initial years of problem-based learning.

=== Role of the instructor ===

The instructors have to change their traditional teaching methodologies in order to incorporate problem-based learning. Their task is to question students&#x27; knowledge, beliefs, give only hints to correct their mistakes and guide the students in their research. All these features of problem-based learning may be foreign to some instructors; hence they find it difficult to alter their past habits.

=== Pupil&#x27;s evaluation ===

The instructors have to adapt new assessment methods to evaluate the pupils&#x27; achievement. They have to incorporate written examinations with modified essay questions, practical examinations, peer and self assessments etc. Problem-based has also been considered slightly more favourable to female participants, whilst having equivocal impacts on their male counterparts when compared to lecture based learning.

===Cognitive load===
Sweller and others published a series of studies over the past twenty years that is relevant to problem-based learning, concerning cognitive load and what they describe as the guidance-fading effect. Sweller et al. conducted several classroom-based studies with students studying algebra problems. These studies have shown that active problem solving early in the learning process is a less effective instructional strategy than studying worked examples (Sweller and Cooper, 1985; Cooper and Sweller, 1987). Certainly active problem solving is useful as learners become more competent, and better able to deal with their working memory limitations. But early in the learning process, learners may find it difficult to process a large amount of information in a short time. Thus the rigors of active problem solving may become an issue for novices. Once learners gain expertise the scaffolding inherent in problem-based learning helps learners avoid these issues. These studies were conducted largely based on individual problem solving of well-defined problems.

Sweller (1988) proposed cognitive load theory to explain how novices react to problem solving during the early stages of learning. Sweller, et al. suggests a worked example early, and then a gradual introduction of problems to be solved. They propose other forms of learning early in the learning process (worked example, goal free problems, etc.); to later be replaced by completions problems, with the eventual goal of solving problems on their own. This problem-based learning becomes very useful later in the learning process.

Many forms of scaffolding have been implemented in problem-based learning to reduce the cognitive load of learners. These are most useful to enable decreasing (&quot;fading&quot;) the amount of guidance during problem solving. A gradual fading of guidance helps learners to slowly transit from studying examples to solving problems. In this case backwards fading was found to be quite effective and assisting in decreasing the cognitive load on learners.

Evaluation of the effects of PBL learning in comparison to traditional instructional learning have proved to be a challenge. Various factors can influence the implementation of PBL: extent of PBL incorporation into curriculum, group dynamics, nature of problems used, facilitator influence on group, and the motivation of the learners. There are also various outcomes of PBL that can be measured including knowledge acquisition and clinical competence. Additional studies are needed to investigate all the variables and technological scaffolds, that may impact the efficacy of PBL.

===Demands of implementing===

Implementing PBL in schools and Universities is a demanding process that requires resources, a lot of planning and organization.
Azer discusses the 12 steps for implementing the &quot;pure PBL&quot;
# Prepare faculty for change
# Establish a new curriculum committee and working group
# Designing the new PBL curriculum and defining educational outcomes
# Seeking Advice from Experts in PBL
# Planning, Organizing and Managing
# Training PBL facilitators and defining the objectives of a facilitator
# Introducing Students to the PBL Program
# Using 3-learning to support the delivery of the PBL program
# Changing the assessment to suit the PBL curriculum
# Encouraging feedback from students and teaching staff
# Managing learning resources and facilities that support self-directed learning
# Continuing evaluation and making changes (pg. 809–812)

=== Cultural difference: Asia ===
Some of the reported difficulties in implementing PBL in these schools include poor participation and difficulty in getting students involved in discussions, due possibly to their Asian reticence. One school reported that students felt that they were compelled to speak as they were being assessed. Some students reported not having enough confidence to seek information independently without guidance from their teachers. The students also found it very time-consuming to seek information themselves, as they still had to cope with the requirements of the traditional curriculum of attending lectures. Some students had difficulty with the language if the PBL discussions were conducted in English, as it was not their working language.

==Constructivism==
Problem-based learning addresses the need to promote lifelong learning through the process of inquiry and constructivist learning. PBL is considered a constructivist approach to instruction because it emphasizes collaborative and self-directed learning while being supported by tutor facilitation. Yew and Schmidt, Schmidt, and Hung elaborate on the cognitive constructivist process of PBL:
# Learners are presented with a problem and through discussion within their group, activate their prior knowledge.
# Within their group, they develop possible theories or hypotheses to explain the problem. Together they identify learning issues to be researched. They construct a shared primary model to explain the problem at hand. Facilitators provide scaffolding, which is a framework on which students can construct knowledge relating to the problem.
# After the initial teamwork, students work independently in self-directed study to research the identified issues.
# The students re-group to discuss their findings and refine their initial explanations based on what they learned.

 PBL follows a constructivist perspective in learning as the role of the instructor is to guide and challenge the learning process rather than strictly providing knowledge. From this perspective, feedback and reflection on the learning process and group dynamics are essential components of PBL. Students are considered to be active agents who engage in social knowledge construction. PBL assists in processes of creating meaning and building personal interpretations of the world based on experiences and interactions. PBL assists to guide the student from theory to practice during their journey through solving the problem.

==Supporting evidence==
Several studies support the success of the constructivist problem-based and inquiry learning methods. One example is a study on a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application, which found that students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.

One large study tracked middle school students&#x27; performance on high-stakes standardized tests to evaluate the effectiveness of inquiry-based science. The study found a 14 percent improvement for the first cohort of students and a 13 percent improvement for the second cohort of students. The study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.

A systematic review of the effects of problem-based learning in medical school on the performance of doctors after graduation showed clear positive effects on physician competence. This effect was especially strong for social and cognitive competencies such as coping with uncertainty and communication skills.

Another study from Slovenia looked at whether students who learn with PBL are better at solving problems and if their attitudes towards mathematics were improved compared to their peers in a more traditional curriculum. The study found that students who were exposed to PBL were better at solving more difficult problems; however, there was no significant difference in student attitude towards mathematics.

==Examples in curricula==

===Malaysia and Singapore===
In Malaysia, an attempt was made to introduce a problem-based learning model in secondary mathematics, with the aim of educating citizens to prepare them for decision-making in sustainable and responsible development. This model called Problem-Based Learning the Four Core Areas (PBL4C) first sprouted in SEAMEO RECSAM in 2008, and as a result of training courses conducted, a paper was presented at the EARCOME5 conference in 2010, followed by two papers during the 15th UNESCO-APEID conference in 2011.

In Singapore, the most notable example of adopting PBL pedagogy in curriculum is Republic Polytechnic, the first polytechnic in Singapore to fully adopt PBL across all diploma courses.

===Medical schools===
Several medical schools have incorporated problem-based learning into their curricula following the lead of McMaster University Medical School, using real patient cases to teach students how to think like a clinician. More than eighty percent of medical schools in the United States now have some form of problem-based learning in their programs. Research of 10 years of data from the University of Missouri School of Medicine indicates that PBL has a positive effect on the students&#x27; competency as physicians after graduation.

In 1998, Western University of Health Sciences opened its College of Veterinary Medicine, with curriculum based completely on PBL.

In 2002, UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP), an accredited five year Master of Science/Medical Doctorate Program housed at University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, began offering a 100% case based curriculum to their students in their pre-clerkship years. The curriculum integrates the basic and preclinical sciences while fostering an understanding of the biological, social, and moral contexts of human health and disease. The students spend their last two clerkship years at University of California, San Francisco.

===Ecological economics===
The transdisciplinary field of ecological economics has embraced problem-based learning as a core pedagogy. A workbook developed by Joshua Farley, Jon Erickson, and Herman Daly organizes the problem-solving process into (1) building the problem base, (2) analyzing the problem, (3) synthesizing the findings, and (4) communicating the results. Building the problem base includes choosing, defining, and structuring an ecological economic problem. Analysis is breaking down of a problem into understandable components. Synthesis is the re-integration of the parts in a way that helps better understand the whole. Communication is the translation of results into a form relevant to stakeholders, broadly defined as the extended peer community. (a concept developed in Post-normal science).

==Other outcomes==
One of the aims of PBL is the development of self-directed learning (SDL) skills. In Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers&#x27; discussion, SDL is defined as &quot;a process in which individuals take the initiative...in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes&quot;. By being invited into the learning process, students are also invited to take responsibility for their learning, which leads to an increase in self-directed learning skills.
In Severiens and Schmidt&#x27;s study of 305 first year college students, they found that PBL and its focus on SDL led to motivation for students to maintain study pace, led to social and academic integration, encouraged development of cognitive skills, and fostered more study progress than students in a conventional learning setting. PBL encourages learners to take a place in the academic world through inquiring and discovery that is central to problem-based learning.

PBL is also argued as a learning method that can promote the development of critical thinking skills. In PBL learning, students learn how to analyze a problem, identify relevant facts and generate hypotheses, identify necessary information/knowledge for solving the problem and make reasonable judgments about solving the problem.

Employers have appreciated the positive attributes of communication, teamwork, respect and collaboration that PBL experienced students have developed. These skills provide for better future skills preparation in the ever-changing information explosion. PBL curriculum includes building these attributes through knowledge building, written and interpersonal interactions and through the experience of the problem solving process.

== Computer-supported collaborative learning ==
Computer-supported PBL can be an electronic version (ePBL) of the traditional face-to-face paper-based PBL or an online group activity with participants located distant apart. ePBL provides the opportunity to embed audios and videos, related to the skills (e.g. clinical findings) within the case scenarios improving learning environment and thus enhance students&#x27; engagement in the learning process.
Comparing face-to-face setting with strict online PBL, the group activities play the key role in the success of the social interaction in PBL. Online PBL is also seen as more cost-effective. Collaborative PBL has been shown to improve critical thinking scores as compared with individual PBL, and increased students&#x27; achievement levels and retention scores.

For the instructors, instructional design principles for the instructors regarding the design and development of online PBL must include collaborative characteristics. For example, the scheduling must be conducive to collaborative activities. Additionally, instructors should ensure that the problems should be relevant to real-life experiences, and the nature of solutions and problem contexts. Furthermore, a sound technological infrastructure is paramount.

=== History of online PBL ===
The establishment and application of PBL in teaching and training started as early as in the 1960s. As instructional technology developed over time coupled with the emergence of the internet in the mid-1990s, online education became popular gaining huge attention from organizations and institutions. However, the use of PBL in complete online education does not seem as established based on the relatively scarce references available in the literature. In 2001, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) was one of the first few faculties that utilized a learning management system (LMS) to facilitate collaboration and group problem-solving. The result showed the significant impact of online PBL on the learning outcomes of students in many aspects including enhancing their communication skills, problem-solving skills and ability to work as a team. The most successful feature of the LMS in terms of user rate was the discussion boards where asynchronous communications took place. Technology has advanced for another decade since then and it should help us take online PBL to a greater height as many more activities such as synchronous online meetings have been made readily available today on numerous platforms. The key focus here is to examine how technology can further facilitate the effective use of PBL online by zooming into the learner needs in each phase of PBL.

===Tools===
==== Collaborative tools ====
The first, and possibly most crucial phase in PBL, is to identify the problem. Before learners can begin to solve a problem, all members must understand and agree on the details of the problem. This consensus forms through collaboration and discussion. With online learning on the rise, it is important that learners can engage in collaborative brainstorming and research through the use of technology. Technology allows for groups to collaborate synchronously or asynchronously from anywhere in the world; schedules and geography no longer prevent collaboration in PBL. Today, there is a plethora of tools available to promote group collaboration online, each with unique strengths and limitations. Learning management systems and cloud-based solutions are the two most popular and accessible technological solution for online collaboration. Learning management systems, such as Canvas, Edmodo, Moodle, Schoology, and itslearning, provide schools and classrooms collaborative tools to support synchronous and asynchronous communication and learning.

The learning management systems (LMS) allow for supervision and support by the course administrator or professor. One limitation of these systems is their availability; most LMS are restricted by course enrollment. Students must be enrolled in a particular course or subscribe to a specific class to gain access to the tools and content stored in the system. Cloud-based solutions on the other hand, such as Google Apps, OneNote, and the Office 365 suit offer collaborative tools outside the traditional education setting. Educators of all kinds (K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, vocational training, HR training teams, etc.) can access these cloud-based solutions and collaborate with anyone around the world by simply sharing a link. These tools range in availability from free with an email account to subscription costs based on the suit purchased. In addition to potential financial limitations, these cloud-based systems are always as secure or private as an LMS that requires course enrollment. Both LMS and cloud-based solutions present learners with opportunities to collaborate in a variety of ways while brainstorming the meaning of the problem and developing a plan for research and future collaboration.

==== Research tools ====
Once the problem has been identified, learners move into the second step of PBL: the information gathering phase. In this phase, learners research the problem by gathering background information and researching potential solutions. This information is shared with the learning team and used to generate potential solutions, each with supporting evidence. The most popular online tool for gathering information today is Google, but there are many other search-engines available online. Free search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing, offer access to seemingly countless links to information. While these research tools provide ample sources of potential information, the quantity can be overwhelming. It also becomes difficult to identify quality sources without adding filters and higher-level search strategies when using these broad search-engines. Libraries are a more selective option and often offer online-databases, but typically require an account or subscription for online access to articles and books. Wolframalpha.com is a smart search-engine with both free and subscription level access options. Wolfram claims to be more than a platform for searching the web, rather, &quot;getting knowledge and answers... by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms, and methods.&quot;

==== Presentation tools ====
The third most important phase of PBL is resolving the problem, the critical task is presenting and defending your solution to the given problem. Students need to be able to state the problem clearly, describe the process of problem-solving considering different options to overcome difficulties, support the solution using relevant information and data analysis. Being able to communicate and present the solution clearly is the key to the success of this phase as it directly affects the learning outcomes. With the help of technology, presentation has been made much easier and more effective as it can incorporate visual aids of charts, pictures, videos, animations, simulations etc. Ideas and connections between ideas can be clearly demonstrated using different tools. Microsoft PowerPoint 2016, Apple Keynote, Prezi, and Google Slides are among the top-rated presentation applications of 2017.

These popular presentation tools have their distinctive features and advantages over one another and can be summarized into three broad types. The first type has almost everything a presenter needs, ranging from tables, charts, picture tools, animations, video tools, add in functions and so forth. Such tools can replace many authoring tools as more complicated functions such as creating simulations, drag and drop etc. are all made possible. Hence, the presentation can be made highly interactive, engaging and compatible with most devices. The best examples are Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote. However, one drawback is that such tools often come at a subscription charge and need to be installed locally on devices. Both PowerPoint and Keynote point more towards the standard form of slide by slide presentations. Prezi represents the second major type of tools with a storytelling style and less traditional or structured form of presentation that allows one to zoom in and out of any part of the screen. These tools are generally web-based and have collaborative functions of value-add for the PBL process. Nevertheless, this type of tools also charge subscription fees based on privilege levels. The third broad type of tools would be the web-based ones free of charge with less fanciful effects, allowing access to presentations collaboratively online anytime. Google Slides is such an option which is easy to use. Though it has less functions, it offers the convenience of being available anytime anywhere on any online device. This type can be effective when students have limited time to prepare for their presentations as it removes many technical difficulties such as arranging for face-to-face meetings, installing the presentation tool or the time needed to learn to create the presentation. Students can spend more time on meaningful discussions about their problem and solution instead of the presentation itself.

== P5BL approach ==

P5BL stands for People, Problem, Process, Product and Project Based Learning.

The P5BL approach was a learning strategy introduced in Stanford School of Engineering in their P5BL laboratory in 1993 as an initiative to offer their graduate students from the engineering, architecture and construction disciplines to implement their skills in a &quot;cross-disciplinary, collaborative and geographically distributed teamwork experience&quot;. In this approach, which was pioneered by Stanford Professor Fruchter, an environment across six universities from Europe, the United States and Japan along with a toolkit to capture and share project knowledge was developed. The students (people) from the three disciplines were assigned a team project that works on solving a problem and delivering an end-product to a client.

The main stress of this approach is to have an inter-disciplinary integrated development of deliverables, in order to improve the overall competency and skills of the students. P5BL mentoring is a structured activity that involves situated learning and constructivist learning strategies to foster the culture of practice that would extend beyond the university campus to real life. P5BL is all about encouraging teaching and learning teamwork in the information age, by facilitating team interaction with professors, industry mentors and owners who provide necessary guidance and support for the learning activity.

Key advantages of this method are that it familiarizes students with real world problems and improves their confidence in solving these. It also improves their networking skills, thereby establishing rapport with key persons of the industry. They also learn, in an educational setting, the value of teamwork. The method also creates in them an appreciation of interdisciplinary approach.

The approach however needs due consideration of the mentoring provided to the students. Appropriate scaffolding should be done by the mentors to ensure that students are successful in attaining their project goals to solve the problem. Communication between the team should also be open and constructive in nature for achieving the necessary milestones.

<doc id="362399" wikidata="Q727355" url="?curid=362399" title="Kittie">
<text>Kittie is a Canadian heavy metal band from London, Ontario, formed in 1996 by lead guitarist Fallon Bowman and the Lander sisters, drummer Mercedes and lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Morgan. Tanya Candler completed the band&#x27;s early line-up on bass. The Lander sisters have remained the band&#x27;s sole constant members. Collectively, their material released via independent record labels has sold over two million copies worldwide.

Kittie was chosen as the band name because the name &quot;seemed contradictory&quot;. After signing to Ng Records, Kittie released their debut album &quot;Spit&quot; (1999), which saw a wider release under Artemis Records the following year. The album, which primarily exhibited a nu metal sound, sold at least 600,000 copies in the United States and was certified gold by the RIAA. Kittie&#x27;s subsequent output, including &quot;Oracle&quot; (2001) and &quot;Until the End&quot; (2004), saw the band transition towards a heavier, more aggressive albeit melodic sound featuring characteristics of alternative metal, groove metal and death metal. Neither album was able to replicate the success of &quot;Spit&quot;, and Kittie parted ways with Artemis Records in 2005.

After leaving Artemis, Kittie created their own label, X of Infamy, and released their fourth album &quot;Funeral for Yesterday&quot; in 2007. In 2009, the band signed to eOne Music, with who they released &quot;In the Black&quot; (2009) and &quot;I&#x27;ve Failed You&quot; (2011), both with bassist Ivana &quot;Ivy&quot; Jenkins. After the release of &quot;I&#x27;ve Failed You&quot;, Kittie went on an indefinite hiatus and the band&#x27;s members pursued various other projects. In 2018, a documentary, &quot;&quot;, chronicling the history of the band was released in co-ordination with its 20th anniversary, followed by a one-off reunion concert. In 2022, Kittie reunited to perform at the Blue Ridge Rock and the When We Were Young festivals. Their first album in 13 years, &quot;Fire&quot;, was released on June 21, 2024, through Sumerian Records.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1996–2004)===
Kittie was formed in September 1996 when drummer Mercedes Lander and guitarist Fallon Bowman met in a gymnastics class. Morgan Lander, sister to Mercedes, became the lead vocalist and guitarist after weeks of Fallon and Mercedes jamming. Tanya Candler completed the line-up by joining as the bassist. Kittie recorded their first demos and began playing concerts in 1998. The band performed at Call the Office and the Embassy and signed up for Canadian Music Week in 1999. Kittie approached Jason Wyner, who was second-in-command at NG Records. After Jason saw the band perform live, NG Records signed Kittie in 1999. Kittie initially released their debut album &quot;Spit&quot; on NG Records on November 13, 1999; however, shortly after, NG Records was purchased by Artemis Records, and production was halted. Around the same time, Candler left the band and was replaced on bass by Talena Atfield. Artemis subsequently reissued &quot;Spit&quot;, with different artwork and photographs, on January 11, 2000. It is the band&#x27;s most successful album, being certified gold by the RIAA. &quot;Spit&quot; has sold at least 600,000 copies in the United States and at least 40,000 copies in Canada. They supported the album by touring with Slipknot.

Their debut album and supporting tour earned Kittie coverage in &quot;Metal Edge&quot;, whose readers voted Morgan Lander for &quot;Female Performer of the Year&quot; and &quot;Spit in Your Eye&quot; for &quot;Home Video of the Year&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s 2000 Readers&#x27; Choice Awards. The band was also voted &quot;New Band of the Year&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Going to be the Next Big Thing&quot;, and &quot;Most Underrated Band&quot;, earning them a total of five &quot;Metal Edge&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards that year. On July 11, 2000, Kittie made a home-video called &quot;Spit in Your Eye&quot; which featured interviews of the band and the band playing shows with the band Slipknot. The success of &quot;Spit&quot; led &quot;Billboard&quot; to call Kittie &quot;the most successful female band in modern metal&quot; in December 2001.

Kittie began jamming on new material in February 2001, and finished writing their second album, &quot;Oracle&quot;, by June. Sounding more aggressive than &quot;Spit&quot;, the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said &quot;We haven&#x27;t written in 4 or 5 years.&quot; She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, &quot;Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile.&quot; However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that &quot;as the backdrop behind the vocals.&quot; Weeks before the album was due to be recorded, Bowman left Kittie due to creative differences with Morgan and her own struggles dealing with the band&#x27;s pressures for success. They have since reconciled their differences. As a result of her departure, Morgan recorded all of the album&#x27;s guitar tracks herself. In August 2001, Artemis Records announced that Kittie would continue as a three-piece (Bowman was not named in the statement) and that the band&#x27;s guitar tech, Jeff Phillips, would fill in as a touring guitarist. Released in November 2001, the album went on to ship almost 220,000 copies in the United States by 2004.

On March 18, 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo two days later. In April 2003, Kittie and Garth Richardson sued Artemis over unpaid royalties of $900,000 and eleven breaches of contract by the label; the dispute was settled out of court in March 2004. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album &quot;Until the End&quot;.

===Departure from Artemis and &quot;Funeral for Yesterday&quot; (2005–2007)===
On March 23, 2005, Morgan Lander reported that both Lisa Marx and Jennifer Arroyo had left the band. Jennifer Arroyo&#x27;s split was amicable while Lisa Marx&#x27;s came as a surprise. Morgan cited financial difficulties, which they attributed to Artemis Records&#x27; poor promotion of their releases, as the reasons for both members&#x27; departures. Lander also revealed that Artemis and the band were in negotiations over whether the band&#x27;s contract would be renewed, expressing her desire to leave the label. Arroyo confirmed that the split was amicable, and also cited her desire to work outside of Kittie full-time was an additional factor. She would go on to join Billy Graziadei of Biohazard in the band Suicide City.

On March 31, 2005, Kittie announced they had parted ways with Artemis Records due to &quot;a proposed amendment to the recording budget for the pending fourth Kittie album.&quot;

In 2005, Kittie added two new members: Tara McLeod on guitar and Trish Doan on bass. In 2005, Morgan and Mercedes Lander&#x27;s clothing line, Poisoned Black clothing, started. Morgan and Mercedes also appeared briefly in the documentaries &quot;&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal - Louder than Life&quot;. On February 7, 2006, Kittie released their &quot;Never Again&quot; EP through Rock Ridge Music. Also in 2006, vocalist Morgan Lander provided vocals on the song &quot;It Turns to Rust&quot;, from the album &quot;In the Arms of Devastation&quot;, by the Canadian death metal band Kataklysm.

Kittie created their own record label, Kiss of Infamy Records, and used it to release their fourth studio album. The label name was later changed to &quot;X of Infamy&quot; after a cease-and-desist letter from attorneys representing Kiss Catalog Ltd. (the owner of the intellectual property rights pertaining to the musical group Kiss) alleging that the Kiss of Infamy trademark was &quot;confusingly similar&quot; to their client&#x27;s trademark. Kittie&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Funeral for Yesterday&quot; was released on February 20, 2007, through their record label. Along with the release of &quot;Funeral for Yesterday&quot;, Morgan Lander announced that Kittie would release a 45-minute-DVD with the CD. In February 2007, Kittie toured as part of the &quot;Funeral for Yesterday Tour&quot; alongside Walls of Jericho, 36 Crazyfists, Dead To Fall, and In This Moment. Doan left Kittie following the tour due to her struggles with anorexia athletica-nervosa, which she developed during the recording of &quot;Funeral for Yesterday&quot;. From July 6 to September 16, 2007, Kittie embarked on another headlining tour of the United States, the Sweet Revenge Tour, with It Dies Today, Silent Civilian, Bring Me the Horizon and Blessed by a Broken Heart. Jeff Phillips filled in on bass for the duration of tour. Soon after, Ivy Vujic officially became the new bass player.

===&quot;In the Black&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Failed You&quot; (2008–2011)===
On August 2, 2008, David Lander, father of band members Morgan and Mercedes and the band&#x27;s manager, died of a heart attack.

On June 26, 2009, it was announced that Kittie signed to the E1 Music record label. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;In the Black&quot;, was released on September 15, 2009. Videos were shot for two singles, &quot;Cut Throat&quot; and &quot;Sorrow I Know&quot;. &quot;Cut Throat&quot; premiered on MTV 2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on September 5, 2009, and on the Canadian show &quot;Much Loud&quot; on September 20, 2009. &quot;Cut Throat&quot; also appeared on the &quot;Saw VI&quot; Soundtrack released on October 20, 2009, and also in &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules&quot;, released on March 25, 2011. On September 16, 2009, an announcement was made that German label Massacre Records would distribute &quot;In the Black&quot; in Europe.

In January 2010, Kittie returned to Europe to promote &quot;In the Black&quot;. Supporting bands on the tour included It Dies Today and Malefice. This tour included dates in Scotland, England, France, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In a January 27, 2010 interview, Morgan Lander revealed that the band was in talks to film a video for the track &quot;Die My Darling&quot;. In March 2010, Kittie embarked on another North American tour with God Forbid, Periphery and Gwen Stacy as support. From May through June 2010, Kittie took part in the &quot;Happy Daze&quot; tour headlined by Insane Clown Posse and featuring Coolio, Kottonmouth Kings and Necro.

Kittie participated in the 2010 &quot;Thrash and Burn&quot; tour through July and August which also featured Asking Alexandria, Born of Osiris, Evergreen Terrace, Stick to Your Guns, Chelsea Grin, Through the Eyes of the Dead, Impending Doom, Periphery and Greeley Estates. This was followed by a one-month stint as one of the two opening acts on Devildriver&#x27;s 2010 North American tour.

Kittie&#x27;s sixth studio album, titled &quot;I&#x27;ve Failed You&quot;, was released on August 30, 2011. Two videos were released for the songs &quot;We Are the Lamb&quot; and &quot;Empires (Part 2)&quot;. In 2011, Mercedes Lander joined the all-female band the Alcohollys featuring former Kittie bassist Tanya Candler.

===Documentary, death of Trish Doan, hiatus (2012–2020)===
On February 13, 2012, Kittie announced that Ivy Vujic was resigning from the band and that Trish Doan would be returning. On September 7, 2013, Kittie performed at the Spread the Metal Festival at The Opera House in Toronto. The band would enter a period of inactivity following the performance, citing rising costs associated with touring and writing new music. Morgan later noted declining turnouts at the band&#x27;s shows as a factor, with her and Mercedes both feeling that Kittie had &quot;overstayed [their] welcome&quot; by the time &quot;I&#x27;ve Failed You&quot; was released. In 2017, Mercedes described Kittie as being on an indefinite hiatus. In spite of their prolonged inactivity, the band did not want to announce that they had broken up. In 2024, McLeod said: &quot;To admit that we were done would have been a really big heartbreak for all of us. None of us wanted to admit that even though we did overstay our welcome. We knew it was inevitable but maybe didn&#x27;t want to admit it. All of us really gripped onto [Kittie] as a musical identity.&quot;

In early 2014, Kittie posted information about a secret project that was in the works to their Facebook page. On March 8, Kittie posted photos on their Facebook and Instagram of past and present members all together in the same room with a camera. On March 28, 2014, Kittie launched an Indiegogo campaign celebrating the impending 20th anniversary of the band, with a DVD documentary featuring past and present members and a tell all book. Their goal of $20,000 was reached in eight hours. The campaign closed on April 28, 2014, with a total amount of $40,525 raised, 203% of the initial goal. Kittie slated Rob McCallum to direct the documentary and Mark Eglinton to help pen the biography.

In April 2015, it was announced that Kittie would tour the United States in June 2015, as part of Ill Niño&#x27;s the Civil Unrest Tour. However, a month before it could begin, the band dropped out of the tour &quot;due to unforeseen issues with immigration in the USA&quot;. In October 2015, Kittie released a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, featured on the Cleopatra Records tribute album &quot;A Salute To The Thin White Duke - The Songs Of David Bowie&quot;. Morgan, Mercedes and McLeod recorded the cover in a single day in December 2014 at Beach Road Studios with producer Siegfried Meier.

In October 2016, it was announced that drummer/vocalist Mercedes Lander had started a new sludge/doom metal band called the White Swan that released the single &quot;Illuminate&quot;. The debut EP, &quot;Anubis&quot;, was released on November 1, 2016.

On February 11, 2017, bassist Trish Doan died at the age of 31. Doan had moved to Australia in 2013 and had frequently used her social media accounts to speak of her frustrations with depression.

On August 30, 2017, the band announced that they would performing a three-set single concert on October 27, 2017, in their hometown of London, Ontario in the London Music Hall, featuring three different line-up variations made up of both current and former members. The concert marked the launch of their 20-year anniversary documentary, and featured the return of Candler, Bowman, Phillips, Arroyo and Vujic to perform songs from their respective eras. The concert was released on DVD format on March 26, 2019.

On March 30, 2018, the documentary &quot;Kittie: Origins/Evolutions&quot;, which was filmed prior to the reunion concert, was released on Blu-ray and DVD for the very first time. Like they did with the reunion concert, Atfield and Marx declined to participate; according to Morgan Lander, Atfield was supportive of the documentary, appearing in the initial crowdfunding pitch video, but &quot;didn&#x27;t think it was the right move for her&quot; to appear. Packaged with the movie was a CD featuring a collection of live performances by the band.

In 2019, Morgan Lander expressed uncertainty about the future of the band, the primary reason being that she didn&#x27;t feel right moving the band forward without Trish Doan. Several months later, it was announced that Lander had joined the melodic death metal band, Karkaos, as their new lead singer.

In October 2020, Mercedes Lander stated that it was unlikely that Kittie would reunite to perform again without a significant financial offer and the ability to include all of the band&#x27;s former members. Like her sister, she also stated that she found it difficult to go forward with the band without Doan.

===Return to performing, &quot;Fire&quot; (2021–present)===
In late 2021, coinciding with a resurgence in nu metal&#x27;s popularity, Kittie was contacted by bookers to play several shows, prompting the band to officially end their hiatus in January 2022 with Jenkins rejoining the band on bass. On September 8, 2022, Kittie performed their first show since 2017 at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival at the Virginia International Raceway in Alton, Virginia. In October 2022, Kittie performed on all three days of the When We Were Young festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. After seeing the band perform at the When We Were Young festival, Kittie were signed to Sumerian Records by label head Ash Avildsen and began working on new material in January 2023.

On May 13, 2023, Kittie performed their first new song in 12 years, &quot;Vultures&quot;, at the Sick New World Festival in Las Vegas. On November 19, 2023, the band confirmed that they were recording a new album with producer Nick Rasculinecz at Sienna Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. On February 13, 2024, Kittie premiered their first new song in 13 years, &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;, on Sirius XM&#x27;s Liquid Metal channel. The following day, the band formally released the song as a single with a music video and announced that they had signed to Sumerian Records. Upon release, &quot;Consequence&quot;, &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; listed the song as one of the best of the week. After the release of &quot;Vultures&quot;, the band announced that its seventh album, &quot;Fire&quot;, would be released on June 21, 2024.

==Musical style and influences==
Kittie has been put under multiple genres of music. They have been categorized as , alternative metal, , , extreme metal, groove metal, thrash metal, gothic metal, punk, and hard rock. Kittie has often used death metal and black metal vocals in their songs and often had clean singing in those songs as well. On the &quot;Spit&quot; album, Kittie used screaming, clean singing and rapping. Kittie have been compared to bands such as Pantera, Slayer, and Mudvayne.

Kittie&#x27;s formative influences were based within the Seattle grunge scene; Morgan Lander has stated that when Kittie made &quot;Spit&quot;, the band were listening to bands such as Silverchair, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana. Later on, when Morgan joined the band, Kittie transitioned from a grunge band into a nu metal band, taking inspiration from recent releases of the time by Korn, Deftones and Sepultura. When asked about their influences in an interview with &quot;Metal Maidens&quot; in 1999, the members of Kittie cited Nile, Today Is the Day, Placebo, Far, Weezer, Orgy, Fear Factory, Hole, Tura Satana, Human Waste Project, Babes in Toyland, Misfits, Blondie, and Nasum as influences. With the release of &quot;Oracle&quot;, Kittie abandoned the nu metal style found on &quot;Spit&quot; in favour of a more extreme metal sound. In interviews, Morgan has cited Marilyn Manson, Korn, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Carcass, At the Gates, Acid Bath, and Testament as influences on the band.

== Recognition ==
&quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; called Kittie &quot;probably the best known all-female band of the [nu metal] era&quot;, and various publications have described the band as influential to women in rock and metal. The band have been cited as an inspiration by Lzzy Hale, Serena Cherry (Svalbard and Noctule) and Poppy, whilst Demi Lovato and Caroline Polachek are fans of the band. Princess Nokia has called Kittie her favourite metal band of all time, and included the band in the music video for &quot;Dragons&quot;, from her debut album &quot;Metallic Butterfly&quot; (2014). In 2016, &quot;OC Weekly&quot; listed Kittie as the eight-best Canadian metal band.

<doc id="362400" wikidata="Q2530089" url="?curid=362400" title="Separable polynomial">
<text>In mathematics, a polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) over a given field &quot;K&quot; is separable if its roots are distinct in an algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;, that is, the number of distinct roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial.

This concept is closely related to square-free polynomial. If &quot;K&quot; is a perfect field then the two concepts coincide. In general, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is separable if and only if it is square-free over any field that contains &quot;K&quot;,
which holds if and only if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is coprime to its formal derivative &quot;D&quot; &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

==Older definition==
In an older definition, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) was considered separable if each of its irreducible factors in &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] is separable in the modern definition. In this definition, separability depended on the field &quot;K&quot;; for example, any polynomial over a perfect field would have been considered separable. This definition, although it can be convenient for Galois theory, is no longer in use.

==Separable field extensions==
Separable polynomials are used to define separable extensions: A field extension is a separable extension if and only if for every in which is algebraic over , the minimal polynomial of over is a separable polynomial.

Inseparable extensions (that is, extensions which are not separable) may occur only in positive characteristic. 

The criterion above leads to the quick conclusion that if &quot;P&quot; is irreducible and not separable, then &quot;D&quot; &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = 0.
Thus we must have
:&quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;p&quot;) 
for some polynomial &quot;Q&quot; over &quot;K&quot;, where the prime number &quot;p&quot; is the characteristic.

With this clue we can construct an example:
:&quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;T&quot; 
with &quot;K&quot; the field of rational functions in the indeterminate &quot;T&quot; over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements. Here one can prove directly that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is irreducible and not separable. This is actually a typical example of why &quot;inseparability&quot; matters; in geometric terms &quot;P&quot; represents the mapping on the projective line over the finite field, taking co-ordinates to their &quot;p&quot;th power. Such mappings are fundamental to the algebraic geometry of finite fields. Put another way, there are coverings in that setting that cannot be &#x27;seen&#x27; by Galois theory. (See Radical morphism for a higher-level discussion.)

If &quot;L&quot; is the field extension 
:&quot;K&quot;(&quot;T&quot;&amp;hairsp;1/&quot;p&quot;), 
in other words the splitting field of &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is an example of a purely inseparable field extension. It is of degree &quot;p&quot;, but has no automorphism fixing &quot;K&quot;, other than the identity, because &quot;T&quot;&amp;hairsp;1/&quot;p&quot; is the unique root of &quot;P&quot;. This shows directly that Galois theory must here break down. A field such that there are no such extensions is called &quot;perfect&quot;. That finite fields are perfect follows &quot;a posteriori&quot; from their known structure.

One can show that the tensor product of fields of &quot;L&quot; with itself over &quot;K&quot; for this example has nilpotent elements that are non-zero. This is another manifestation of inseparability: that is, the tensor product operation on fields need not produce a ring that is a product of fields (so, not a commutative semisimple ring).

If &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is separable, and its roots form a group (a subgroup of the field &quot;K&quot;), then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is an additive polynomial.

==Applications in Galois theory==
Separable polynomials occur frequently in Galois theory.

For example, let &quot;P&quot; be an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients and &quot;p&quot; be a prime number which does not divide the leading coefficient of &quot;P&quot;. Let &quot;Q&quot; be the polynomial over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements, which is obtained by reducing modulo &quot;p&quot; the coefficients of &quot;P&quot;. Then, if &quot;Q&quot; is separable (which is the case for every &quot;p&quot; but a finite number) then the degrees of the irreducible factors of &quot;Q&quot; are the lengths of the cycles of some permutation of the Galois group of &quot;P&quot;. 

Another example: &quot;P&quot; being as above, a resolvent &quot;R&quot; for a group &quot;G&quot; is a polynomial whose coefficients are polynomials in the coefficients of &quot;P&quot;, which provides some information on the Galois group of &quot;P&quot;. More precisely, if &quot;R&quot; is separable and has a rational root then the Galois group of &quot;P&quot; is contained in &quot;G&quot;. For example, if &quot;D&quot; is the discriminant of &quot;P&quot; then formula_1 is a resolvent for the alternating group. This resolvent is always separable (assuming the characteristic is not 2) if &quot;P&quot; is irreducible, but most resolvents are not always separable.

<doc id="362407" wikidata="Q293194" url="?curid=362407" title="Óscar Berger">
<text>Óscar José Rafael Berger Perdomo (; born 11 August 1946) is a Guatemalan businessman and politician who served as the 46th president of Guatemala from 2004 to 2008. He previously served as mayor of Guatemala City from 1991 to 1999.

==Early years and family==
Berger was born to an upper-class family with large sugar and coffee holdings. His paternal grandparents were Belgian immigrants. He graduated in law from the private Jesuit Rafael Landívar University. 

In 1967, he married Wendy Widmann, also from a land-owning Guatemalan family. He had a son and a grandchild named Juan Pablo Berger.

==Political career==
In 1985, Berger joined Álvaro Arzú&#x27;s successful campaign to become mayor of Guatemala City. From January 1991 to June 1999, he was mayor himself. After leaving office, he ran in the 1999 presidential election as the candidate of the National Advancement Party but lost to Alfonso Portillo.

A representative of the industrial and land oligarchy that financed his electoral campaign, Berger was elected with 54.13% of the vote in the presidential election of December 2003, ahead of his rival from the center-left, Alvaro Colom. Only 46% of those registered on the electoral rolls took part in the vote.

Berger&#x27;s party worked for national reconciliation following the civil war that gripped the country until 1996.

== Mayor of Guatemala City (1991-1999) ==
As university classmates, Berger established a friendship with Álvaro Arzú, with whom they founded the then PAN civic committee, which would later become a political party. With the support of Arzú, Berger won a seat at the Municipal Council of Guatemala City, taking office on 15 January 1986. He would later join different municipal commissions that focused on Sports, Public Health, Agriculture, Livestock, and Food, and also became director of the Municipal Social and Sports Club, one of the most popular soccer clubs in Guatemala. 

On 11 May 1989, Berger and Arzú registered the National Advance Party (PAN). The newly formed center-right party would participate and win in the 1990 Guatemalan city mayoral election. Berger would be sworn in as mayor on 15 January 1991 and become re-elected in the 1995 mayoral election.

PAN would also succeed in the 1995 general election, gaining the majority of seats in Congress and qualifying Álvaro Arzú to the second round of the presidential election. Arzú would go on to defeat FRG candidate Alfonso Portillo.

== Presidential candidacy ==

=== 1999 candidacy ===
During Arzú&#x27;s presidential term, Berger expressed his interest in running for the presidency. On 27 June 1999, PAN would formalize his candidacy for the 1999 general election. Accordingly, Berger would step down from his mayoral duties and devote his time to the campaign.

Berger would run a campaign focusing on combatting poverty, increasing the country&#x27;s wage limit, and being tough on organized crime. However, the populist rhetoric delivered by second-time presidential hopeful Alfonso Portillo would have a greater reach with the Guatemalan populace. Berger would go on to lose the second round of the presidential election; many speculated his loss as a punishment for the arrogance of President Arzú and the questionable ways state corporations were privatized during his mandate.

The electoral loss would cause conflict within the PAN party, which would later have a faction of the party leave to form the Unionist Party. During this time, Berger would break his relationship with Arzú, blaming his lousy governance for his defeat against Portillo&#x27;s FRG party.

=== 2003 candidacy ===
In the spring of 2002, Berger returned to the political arena with a newly formed conservative political coalition called the Great National Alliance (GANA), encompassing the Patriot Party, the Reform Movement (MR), and the National Solidarity Party (PSN). His association with GANA would cause him to be expelled from PAN. Nevertheless, after seeing a significant lead in the country&#x27;s polls, Berger would accept GANA&#x27;s presidential nomination.

The beginning of the 2003 presidential race was marked by the unusual registration of Efraín Ríos Montt as a presidential candidate - despite the constitution prohibiting it - and the extortions and assassinations of prominent political leaders. However, Montt would not have the significant votes to go to the second round, making the election a race between Álvaro Colom, leader of the National Unity of Hope (UNE), and Berger. Running on a campaign of political, economic, and social reform and the explicit support of the country&#x27;s oligarchs, Berger would win the election with 54% of the vote. His coalition would also win 47 seats in Congress.

== Presidency (2004–2008) ==
The inauguration of Óscar Berger as the 46th president took place on 14 January 2004. In his inaugural speech, Berger promised to continue strengthening government institutions, defend the rule of law, and fight against the impunity of corrupt and violent actors. At the beginning of his presidency, persecution began against former officials of the Portillo administration, which raised a high expectation that the government would dismantle the corrupt structure of the State. However, investigations against the officials halted, which led to Berger&#x27;s approval ratings plummeting.

===Domestic policy===

Berger authorized the construction of several highways in Guatemala and the remodeling of the Aurora International Airport. He undertook a reform of the army, recognized the responsibility of the state for war crimes, and appointed Rigoberta Menchu, a figure of the pacifist and indigenous movement, as special ambassador to the presidency. Most of the members of his government, however, were from the oligarchy. 

Serious events would also occur that exposed the degree of corruption of several of Berger&#x27;s officials, such as the PARLACEN Case, the Case of the seizure of the Pavón prison, the bankruptcy of the Coffee and Commerce banks, and the million-dollar robbery at the Aurora Airport. Additionally, Berger would pursue a repressive policy towards the peasant movement. It is in this context that the massacre of Nueva Linda took place in August 2004, in which the police killed nine peasants. A CICIG report published in 2010 accused the government of Óscar Berger of carrying out &quot;social cleansing&quot; operations and ordering extrajudicial executions. Philip Alston, a rapporteur to the United Nations, had already, in 2007, denounced social cleansing operations involving the Guatemalan government.
==== CICIG ====

On 12 December 2006, the United Nations and the Government of Guatemala signed an agreement that would institute the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which, after the approval of the Constitutional Court in May 2007, was subsequently ratified by Congress on 1 August 2007. Thus, the CICIG emerged as an independent international body whose purpose was to support the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, the National Civil Police, and other State institutions in the investigation of the crimes committed by members of the illegal security forces and clandestine security devices, and in general in the actions that tend to the dismantling of these groups.
==== Hurricane Stan ====

In October 2005, Guatemala suffered one of the worst natural disasters in its history. The passage through Central America of Hurricane Stan, whose consequences would be even more virulent than those produced years ago by Mitch, sowed chaos in the country, causing hundreds of fatalities and missing persons, as well as an incalculable number of victims.

Such was the degree of destruction generated that Berger declared the &quot;state of public calamity.&quot; Berger would also remark in regards to the damage done by Stan: &quot;It&#x27;s not so bad, poor people are used to living like this.&quot;
===Foreign policy===
In March 2006, Berger would ratify the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

In June 2006, the Berger administration, and the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, signed the Central America-4 Free Mobility Agreement, which authorized the free movement of their citizens across borders between the four signatory states without any restrictions or checks.

== Post-presidency ==
Berger&#x27;s presidency ended on 14 January 2008, upon the inauguration of his successor, Álvaro Colom. The Colom administration would accuse Berger of leaving a floating debt of more than 4 billion quetzals.

<doc id="362410" wikidata="Q1507165" url="?curid=362410" title="Fathers' rights movement">
<text>The fathers&#x27; rights movement is a social movement whose members are primarily interested in issues related to family law, including child custody and child support, that affect fathers and their children. Many of its members are fathers who desire to share the parenting of their children equally with their children&#x27;s mothers—either after divorce or marital separation. The movement includes men as well as women, often the second wives of divorced fathers or other family members of men who have had some engagement with family law. Most Fathers&#x27; rights advocates argue for formal gender equality.

==Demographics==
The fathers&#x27; rights movement exists almost exclusively in industrialized countries, where divorce has become more common. It emerged in the West from the 1960s onwards as part of the men&#x27;s movement with organizations such as Families Need Fathers, which originated in the 1970s. In the late twentieth century, the growth of the internet permitted wider discussion, publicity and activism about issues of interest to fathers&#x27; rights activists. Factors thought to contribute to the development of the fathers&#x27; rights movement include shifting household demographics brought about by rising divorce and falling marriage rates, changes in the understanding and expectations of fatherhood, motherhood and childhood as well as shifts in how legal systems impact families.

Fathers&#x27; rights groups in the West are primarily composed of white, middle or working class, heterosexual men. Members tend to be politically conservative but do not share a single set of political or social views and are highly diverse in their goals and methods. Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement advocate for strong relationships with their children and focus on a narrowly defined set of issues based on the concerns of divorced or divorcing men. Women, often new partners including second wives or other family members of men who have had some engagement with family law and mothers without custody, are also members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement, and fathers&#x27; rights activists emphasize this. Two studies of fathers&#x27; rights groups in North America found that fifteen percent of their members were women.

The fathers&#x27; rights movement organizations Families Need Fathers and the Lone Fathers Association have campaigned for fathers&#x27; rights over many decades. Longer lasting organizations appear to result from the longterm dedication and commitment of key individuals. Other fathers&#x27; rights groups have tended to form and dissolve quickly. Internal disagreements over ideology and tactics are common, and members tend not to remain with the groups after they have been helped.

==Political and social views==

The fathers&#x27; rights movement has both liberal and conservative branches, with different viewpoints about how men and women compare. Although both groups agree on the victimization and discrimination against men, they disagree on why men and women differ (nature versus nurture) and traditional gender roles. The liberal version believes the differences between the genders are due to culture and supports equality between men and women; in contrast, the conservative branch believes in traditional patriarchal/complementary families and that the differences between genders are due to biology. Ross Parke and Armin Brott view the fathers&#x27; rights movement as one of three strands within the men&#x27;s movement that deal almost exclusively with fatherhood, the other two being the good fathers&#x27; movement and groups forming the Christian Men&#x27;s movement – the Promise Keepers being the largest.

Warren Farrell, a veteran of the women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s and fathers&#x27; movement since the 1970s, describes the fathers&#x27; rights movement as part of a larger &quot;gender transition movement&quot; and thinks that, similar to women in the 1960s, fathers are transitioning from gender-based to more flexible family roles. Farrell also believes the movement helps children by increasing the number who are raised equally by both parents, which in turn increases the children&#x27;s social, academic, psychological, and physical benefits—in his opinion it becomes a children&#x27;s rights issue with fathers acting as advocates.

Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement assert that fathers are discriminated against as a result of gender bias in family law; that custody decisions have been a denial of equal rights; and that the influence of money has corrupted family law. The movement&#x27;s primary focus has been to campaign (including lobbying and research) for formal equal rights for fathers, and sometimes for children, and to campaign for changes to family law related to child custody, support and maintenance, domestic violence and the family court system itself. Fathers&#x27; rights groups also provide emotional and practical support for members during separation and divorce. The fathers&#x27; rights movement is considered to be a part of the broader manosphere, a set of Internet forums promoting masculinity along with opposition to feminism.

Some fathers&#x27; rights groups have become frustrated with the slow pace of traditional campaigning for law reform; groups such as the originally UK-based &quot;Fathers 4 Justice&quot; have become increasingly vocal and visible, undertaking public demonstrations that have attracted public attention and influenced the politics of family justice. Following protests, some fathers&#x27; rights activists have been convicted of offenses such as harassment and assault. Fathers&#x27; rights groups have condemned threats and violent acts, with Matt O&#x27;Connor of Fathers 4 Justice asserting that his organization was committed to &quot;peaceful, non-violent direct action&quot; and that members caught engaging in intimidation would be expelled. An example of this was in January 2006, when O&#x27;Connor temporarily disbanded the group after it was revealed that a fringe subsection of members were plotting to kidnap Leo Blair, the young son of Tony Blair, the former UK Prime Minister. According to the police, the plot never progressed beyond the &quot;chattering stage&quot;. Four months later the group was refounded.

Legal scholar Richard Collier writes that fathers&#x27; rights activists often base their arguments for reform on &quot;anecdotal evidence and assertion&quot; rather than &quot;evidence-backed research&quot;, and argues that implementing their proposed changes to the law &quot;may have potentially deleterious consequences&quot; for mothers and children. Collier, along with researchers Martha Fineman and Michael Flood, have said the movement perpetuates negative stereotypes of women as hostile, deceptive, vindictive, and irresponsible as well as the stereotype that women are out to take advantage of men financially. Collier links such negative views of women with ideas of a crisis of masculinity within the broader men&#x27;s movement, often in tandem with &quot;virulent&quot; anti-feminism.

==Main issues==
===Family court system===
Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody. Critics of the movement argue that fathers&#x27; groups ignore actual trends in family law that seek to affirm the symbolic importance of fathers within a heteronormative family structure.

Stephen Baskerville, president of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children and fathers&#x27; rights advocate, defines court-determined custody as not a right to parent one&#x27;s children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting. He states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially when children are involved. He also states that divorce provides advantages for women such as automatic custody of the children and financial benefits in the form of child support payments. Members of the FR movement also state that family courts are slow to help fathers enforce their parental rights, and are expensive and time-consuming.

Baskerville has also stated that family courts are secretive, censoring and punitive towards fathers who criticize them. He also claims that employees and activists within the courts support and benefit from the separation of children from their parents and that family law today represents civil rights abuses and intrusive perversion of government power.

Others contest these conclusions, stating that family courts are biased in favor of fathers and that the lower percentage of separated fathers as custodial parents is a result of choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. Other writers state that fathers&#x27; rights activists incorrectly maintain that the courts are biased against fathers while in reality the vast majority of cases are settled by private agreement and fathers voluntarily relinquish primary custody of their children, which explains the lower percentage of custodial fathers; and that the &quot;bias&quot; of courts is in favour of the primary caregiver, not mothers per se. Collier writes that fathers&#x27; rights activists &quot;misread the gendered nature of law&#x27;s regulation of shared parenting historically&quot;. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father&#x27;s rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored the fact that in the vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they are willing to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.

===Custody and parenting===

According to the BBC, &quot;Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men&#x27;s rights activism&quot;. Journal Of Divorce and Remarriage a section written by Linda Nielsen, &quot;One of the most complex and compelling issues confronting policymakers, parents, and the family court system is what type of parenting plan is most beneficial for children after divorce&quot;. Stating that &quot;children need two parents&quot; and that &quot;children have a fundamental human right to an opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father&quot;, members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that shared parenting is in fact in the best interests of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally shared parenting with three conditions (the child has about equal time with mom and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact two-parent family, followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if shared parenting cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, if their father is their primary custodial parent rather than their mother.

Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement and their critics disagree about the correlation of negative developmental outcomes for children to sole custody situations. Social scientist V. C. McLoyd states that father absence covaries with other relevant family characteristics such as the lack of an income from a male adult, the absence of a second adult, and the lack of support from a second extended family system and conclude that it is the negative effects of poverty, and not the absence of a father, that result in negative developmental outcomes. On the other hand, Professor Craig Hart states that although the consequences of poverty and having a single parent are interrelated, each is a risk factor with independent effects on children, and Silverstein and Auerbach state that the negative outcomes for children in sole custody situations correlate more strongly to &quot;fatherlessness&quot; than to any other variable including poverty.

Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement criticize the best interests of the child standard currently used in many countries for making custody decisions, which they describe as highly subjective and based on the personal prejudices of family court judges and court-appointed child custody evaluators, and that courts are abusive when more than half custody is taken away from a willing, competent parent. Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement including Ned Holstein state that a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting is supported by a majority of citizens. Baskerville writes that proposals to enact shared parenting laws are opposed by divorce lawyers, and he says that &quot;radical feminist&quot; groups oppose shared parenting because of the possibility of domestic violence and child abuse.

Mo Yee Lee, after conducting a study of mothers and children, concluded that there are some advantages to joint custody arrangements; and overall, the degree of conflict between parents impacted the children more than the custody arrangement.
 Some feminist groups have stated that if shared parenting were ordered, fathers would not provide their share of the daily care for the children. The National Organization For Women also questions the motives of those promoting shared parenting, noting that it would result in substantial decreases in or termination of child support payments.

Stephen Baskerville states that shared parenting has been demonstrated to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, and that it is the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support is at the same time an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.

Stephen Baskerville describes no-fault or unilateral divorce based on no fault as a power grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers have a constitutional right to shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children. Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child&#x27;s protection against unfit or violent parents.

Pro-feminist sociologist Michael Flood states that supporters of shared parenting use it only as a symbolic issue related to &quot;rights&quot;, &quot;equality&quot;, and &quot;fairness&quot; and that the father&#x27;s rights movement is not actually interested in the shared care of their children or the children&#x27;s wishes, adding that fathers&#x27; rights groups have advocated policies and strategies that are harmful to mothers and children and also harmful to the fathers themselves. In contrast, social scientist Sanford Braver states that the bad divorced dad image is a myth that has led to harmful and dangerous social policies.

Some fathers&#x27; rights activists object to the term &quot;visitation&quot;, which they see as denigrating to their level of authority as parents, and instead prefer the use of &quot;parenting time&quot;.

===Child support===

From the source Northwestern University Law Review. Authors Tait, Anderson explained that &quot;child support is a ubiquitous kind of debt, common to all income and wealth levels, with data showing that approximately 30% of the U.S. adult population has either been subjected to pay child support or has received it.&quot; Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement campaign for the reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children&#x27;s standard of living after separation, and on the assumption that the children live with one parent and never with the other. Activists state that the current guidelines are arbitrary, provide mothers with financial incentives to divorce, and leave fathers with little discretionary income to enjoy with the children during their parenting time. In the US, fathers&#x27; rights activists propose guidelines based on a Cost Shares model, in which child support would be based on the average income of the parents and the estimated child costs incurred by both parents. Laura W. Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.

Solangel Maldonado states that the law should value a broader definition of fathering for poor fathers by reducing the focus on collecting child support and encouraging the informal contributions (such as groceries, clothes, toys, time with the children) of these fathers by counting these contributions as child support.

Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement state that child support should be terminated under certain conditions, such as if the custodial parent limits access to the children by moving away against the wishes of the other parent, gives fraudulent testimony, or if paternity fraud is discovered, adding that two men should not have to pay child support for the same child.

Stephen Baskerville states that it is often difficult for fathers in financial hardship or who take on a larger caregiving role with their children to have their child support payments lowered. He also states that unemployment is the primary cause of child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.

Stephen Baskerville states that the purpose of child support should be publicly determined, and enforcement programs must be designed to serve that purpose, observing the due process of law.

Some legal scholars and feminist writers have said that the fathers&#x27; rights movement puts the interests of fathers above the interests of children, for example by suggesting that it is acceptable for fathers to withdraw child support if they are not given access to their children, or by lobbying for changes in family law that would allegedly heighten children&#x27;s exposure to abusive fathers, and would allegedly further endanger mothers who are victims of domestic violence.

Supporters of the fathers&#x27; rights movement assert that some women make false claims of domestic violence, sexual or child abuse in order to gain an upper hand in divorce, custody disputes and/or prevent fathers from seeing their children, and they state that lawyers advise women to make such claims. They state that false claims of domestic violence and child abuse are encouraged by the inflammatory &quot;win or lose&quot; nature of child custody hearings, that men are presumed to be guilty rather than innocent by police and by the courts, Lawyers and advocates for abused women assert that family court proceedings are commonly accompanied with allegations of domestic violence because of the prevalence of domestic violence in society rather than as a result of false allegations of domestic violence. They also assert that domestic violence often begins or increases around the time of divorce or separation. Sociologist Michael Flood argues that fathers&#x27; rights groups have had a damaging impact on the field of domestic violence programming and policy by attempting to discredit female victims of violence, to wind back the legal protections available to victims and the sanctions imposed on perpetrators, and to undermine services for the victims of men&#x27;s violence. Stephen Baskerville asserts that when child abuse occurs the perpetrator is not likely to be the father, and that child abuse most often occurs after the father has been separated from his children. Baskerville proposes that domestic violence and child abuse must be adjudicated as criminal assault, observing due process protections, and that government funding for programs addressing these issues must be made contingent on such protections.

===Parenting time interference===
Glenn Sacks states that some mothers interfere with the father&#x27;s parenting time and that such interference should be stopped. Sacks and Jeffery M. Leving state that parenting time interference can result from the custodial parent&#x27;s relocation beyond a practical distance from the noncustodial parent and they campaign for a rebuttable presumption prohibiting such relocations.

Fathers&#x27; rights activists have also advocated for the inclusion of parental alienation syndrome, a proposed syndrome developed by Richard A. Gardner that alleges unjustified disruption of the relationship between a parent and a child is caused by the other parent. Neither PAS nor PAD are accepted by any legal or mental health organization. Despite lobbying, parental alienation syndrome was not included in the draft of the DSM manual that was released in 2010, though parental alienation disorder does appear as a &quot;Condition Proposed by Outside Sources&quot; to be reviewed by a working group.

===No-fault divorce===
Stephen Baskerville states that laws establishing no-fault divorce did not stop at removing the requirement that grounds be cited for a divorce, so as to allow for divorce by &quot;mutual consent&quot;; it also allows either spouse to end the marriage without any agreement or fault by the other. Phyllis Schlafly states that no-fault divorce should be referred to as unilateral divorce.

Stephen Baskerville states that laws establishing no-fault divorce can be seen as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract. He states that it is not possible to form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other. He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against what he describes as the confiscation of their children.

Baskerville states that fault has entered through the back door in the form of child custody hearings, and that the forcibly divorced spouse (&quot;defendant&quot;) is presumed guilty. Similarly, other members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement believe that men fail to get appropriate recognition of their innocence as a result of no-fault divorce. 

Stephen Baskerville proposes &quot;reasonable limits&quot; on no-fault divorce when children are involved. Some members of the FRM support the end of the no-fault principle in child custody and divorce decisions. Some members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement state that the availability of divorce should also be limited.

===Government involvement===
Stephen Baskerville states that governments throughout the United States and other democracies are engaged, by accident or design, in a campaign against fathers and fatherhood, which in his view, lies at the root of a larger problem that threatens marriage, destroys families, devastates the lives of many children, and undermines parents, democracy and accountability. Baskerville also states that it is the removal of the father from the family through divorce that initiates problems for which the government is perceived as the solution rather than the problem, and that these problems are then used to justify the continued existence and expansion of the government. Members of the fathers&#x27; rights movement state that modern divorce involves government officials invading parents&#x27; private lives, evicting people from their homes, seizing their property, and taking away their children.

===Parental and reproductive rights===
Fathers&#x27; rights advocates have worked for the right of unwed, otherwise fit, fathers to get custody if the mother tries to have their child adopted by a third party or if child welfare authorities place the child in foster care. Fathers&#x27; rights activists seek a gender-neutral approach in which unwed men and women would have equal rights in adoption issues, an approach that critics state does not sufficiently acknowledge the different biological roles in procreation and pregnancy, and the disparity in society&#x27;s social and economic structures. In the US, some states have passed laws to protect the rights of unwed fathers to custody. Courts have increasingly supported these rights, though judges often require evidence that the father has shown interest in, and given financial and emotional support to, the mother during pregnancy.

Some fathers&#x27; rights advocates have sought the right to prevent women from having an abortion without the father&#x27;s consent, based on the idea that it is discriminatory for men not to have the ability to participate in a decision to terminate a pregnancy. This option is not supported by any laws in the United States. Fathers&#x27; rights advocates Jeffrey M. Leving and Glenn Sacks have stated that &quot;choice for men is a flawed solution.&quot; Advocates have also expressed the desire to have a &quot;financial abortion&quot; in which the option exists to sever all responsibility for child support for an unwanted child. Commenting on this, legal scholar Kim Buchanan states, &quot;The only way men&#x27;s lack of a pregnancy opt-out can be framed as a gender injustice is to accept that men have a right to visit the consequences of unprotected sex (or contraceptive failure) exclusively on their female partners.&quot; Some feminists, however, such as former president of the feminist organization National Organization for Women, attorney Karen DeCrow, have supported the &quot;financial abortion&quot; concept, stating &quot;if a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring pregnancy to term, and the biological father does not, and cannot, share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support... autonomous women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their choice.

===Parental leave===

Pressure from father&#x27;s rights groups, among others, have in several countries resulted in gender-neutral program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including the need to protect the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize gender-neutral child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children&#x27;s care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with their infants.

==Criticism==
Advocates of substantive equality argue against formal equality frequently referenced by Fathers&#x27; right advocates.
The gestation investment is seen by some as one justification for substantive equality between Fathers&#x27; rights and Mothers&#x27; rights.

<doc id="362417" wikidata="Q3480741" url="?curid=362417" title="Mal de debarquement">
<text>Mal de debarquement&quot; syndrome(orsyndrome du &quot;mal de débarquement, MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase &quot;mal de débarquement&quot; is French and translates to &quot;illness of disembarkment&quot;.

MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose and throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e., while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of &quot;land sickness&quot; that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. Since 2020, the syndrome has received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition, and more scientific research has commenced in determining what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. This is also due to the fact that MdDs is now officially recognized (2020).

== Symptoms ==

Common symptoms most frequently reported include a persistent sensation of motion usually described as rocking, swaying, or bobbing, disequilibrium with difficulty maintaining balance; it is never accompanied by a spinning vertigo. Chronically fatigued, sufferers can become fatigued quickly with minimal exertion and some might experience neck and back pain. Other symptoms include the feeling of pressure in the brain, mostly around the frontal lobe area, headaches or migraine headaches, ear pain, ear fullness and possibly tinnitus.

Fluctuations in weather also affect sufferers, in particularly hot weather and barometric pressure changes. Many have photo-sensitivity and find it more difficult to walk in the dark as well as other sensitivities to strong smells including chemical smells. Cognitive impairment (&quot;brain fog&quot;) includes an inability to recall words, short-term memory loss, an inability to multi-task, misspelling and mispronunciation of words, difficulty in concentrating. Many MdDS sufferers report they are unable to use a computer for any length of time due to the visual overstimulation, and some are even unable to watch television.

Symptoms can be increased by stress, lack of sleep, crowds, flickering lights, loud sounds, fast or sudden movements, enclosed areas and visual intolerance of busy patterns and scrolling movement.

Research reveals MdDS is not migraine-related and many sufferers have never had migraine symptoms prior to the onset of the disorder. However, for some MdDS sufferers there may have been a correlation between migraine and some pathophysiological overlap or even some other precipitating illness.

The condition may be masked by a return to motion such as in a car, train, plane, or boat; however, once the motion ceases, the symptoms rebound or return, often at much higher levels than when the journey first commenced.

The symptoms of MdDS may be extremely debilitating and fluctuate high and low on a daily basis; it greatly affects the daily life and working capacity of sufferers with many having to relinquish work; it also limits most other daily and social activities. Sufferers can have low quality of life in both the physical and emotional realms, comparable to people who have multiple sclerosis with many symptoms being of a similar nature. High levels of disequilibrium can contribute to suffers not being able to drive a car for a long time or walk far and this can create varying levels of anxiety in some or possibly depression due to the significant level of disability.

== Diagnosis ==

MdDS is diagnosed several ways, one being by the symptoms: in particular, the &quot;constant rocking, swaying feeling&quot; and the abatement of this feeling when in motion again and as a matter of exclusion. There are no definitive tests that confirm MdDS, only tests that rule out other conditions. Tests include hearing and balance, and MdDS is generally diagnosed by either a neurologist or an ear, nose, and throat specialist.

Due to the complex nature of the illness, it can be challenging to be properly diagnosed by a specialist. In the past most that suffer from the condition averaged 2–5 medical visits before being diagnosed. Due to the complexity of MdDs most patients self-diagnose, with access to internet information, and confirm their diagnosis with an MdDS specialist. The lack of knowledge of the condition and limited resources leaves patients with limited options. Those options include benzodiazepines, physical vestibular rehabilitation, and migraine medications. Additionally, patients have seen improvement with non-invasive brain stimulation methods, though the long-term implications of this treatment is still to be seen.

== Treatment ==

There is no known cure for MdDS, as with most balance and gait disorders, some form of displacement exercise is thought helpful (for example walking, jogging, or bicycling but not on a treadmill or stationary bicycle). This has not been well-studied in MdDS. Medications that suppress the nerves and brain circuits involved in balance (for example, the benzodiazepine clonazepam) have been noted to help and can lower symptoms; however, it is not a cure. It is not known whether a medication that suppresses symptoms prolongs symptom duration or not. Vestibular therapy has not proved to be effective in treating MdDS.

Additional research was undertaken by Dr Yoon-Hee Cha into the neurological nature of this syndrome through imaging studies but later withdrawn due to faulty study hypothesis.

== Epidemiology ==

The condition is thought to be under-reported in the medical literature. A study of 27 cases conducted by Timothy C. Hain in 1999 noted all but one patient to be female. The average age in this series was 49 years. This apparent gender disparity, however, may be due in part to the fact that the questionnaire which formed the basis of the study was circulated in a publication with a predominantly female reader base.

Subsequent studies have produced conflicting results with regard to the gender distribution of MdDS. The trends in Hain&#x27;s report have recently been supported by the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation, in a study of over 100 individuals diagnosed with MdDS. The female:male ratio was approximately 9:1; the average age of onset was 43–45 years. However, another recent study found that 44% of subjects who had experienced MdDS for 2 years or more were male, suggesting a more even distribution.

It has been shown to occur in excursions of as little as 30 minutes though it has been unclear how long it takes for symptoms to occur. The most commonly reported inciting event was a prolonged ocean cruise (~45%); however, shorter boating excursions (~22%), aircraft travel (~15%), and automobile travel (~8%) have all been described.

Mal de Débarquement syndrome has been noted as far back to the times of Erasmus Darwin in 1796, and Irwin J. A. (1881) &quot;The pathology of seasickness&quot;.

Cases of MdDS have been reported in children as young as eight and in both genders. Men may have a more difficult time obtaining a diagnosis due to the disparity of women reported. When sailors and soldiers returned from World War II, the syndrome was reported at a higher rate in males

== Research ==

===Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation===

Despite MdDS causing significant disability, therapy for persistent MdDS remains virtually nonexistent. A pilot study has commenced utilizing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) this being a method of neuromodulation in which a local magnetic field is applied over the scalp to induce an electric current in the cortical structures underlying the coil. Low-frequency rTMS (e1 Hz) induces local inhibition, whereas high frequency rTMS (Q5 Hz) induces local excitation. The TMS studies have proved to help in lowering the symptoms of MdDS if the treatment is ongoing; however, it is not a cure.

===Vestibulo-ocular reflex research===

At least one clinical trial on readaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex undertaken by Dr. Mingjia Dai from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City produced results for a significant percentage of patients who participated in the program. Dai developed an intervention that provided improvement in symptoms for 70% of the patients in the clinical trial phase. The protocol involved a physical manipulation of the patient intended to readapt the vestibulo-ocular reflex. While the program was no longer in the research phase, Dai continued to accept patients. According to Dai, success was measured as a 50% reduction of symptoms. Since death of Dr. Dai, vestibulo-ocular research are now directed by Dr. Sergei B. Yakushin. During the last nine years Dr. Yakushin published several number of research linked to MdDs such as:
* 

In 2022, Yakushin and colleagues conducted a study that suggested opto-kinetic stimulation as a potential treatment for individuals diagnosed with MdDS who experience gravitational pulling sensations. Participants of this study were exposed to therapeutic interventions, such as vestibular rehabilitation therapy, to stimulate the vestibular-ocular reflex and reform their perception of gravity and motion. The results indicated that opto-kinetic stimulation was effective in alleviating the pulling sensation experienced by MdDS. Over 70% of MdDS patients who participated in this study reported an immediate relief of symptoms following the treatment. Three years following the treatment, 58% of the participants reported that the treatment continued to alleviate the gravitational pulling sensations. These results display the benefits of opto-kinetic stimulation treatments for reducing symptoms of MdDS.

===Hormonal Research===
Viviana Mucci postulated that MdDs is a hormonal disorder that only occurs in females. This needs further scrutiny due to issues of using only small sample sizes, using only self-reported survey data that they further tweaked within the paper (see table 5&#x27;s removal of data &quot;Not Sure&quot; that did not fit their hypothesis), and Mucci&#x27;s belief that there are no men with this disorder. This is why they only surveyed females about menses, ovulation, menopause, and birth control pill usage. 
They formulated a theoretical mathematic model attempting to explain a theoretical vestibulo–cerebellar loop. The loop between the &quot;right and left vestibular nuclei, and the Purkinje cells of the right and left flocculonodular cerebellar corte&quot; combined with female menses is the origin of the symptoms according to Mucci.

=== Case Studies ===
A case study conducted by Amuk and colleagues focused on a 30-year-old male patient with MdDS to highlight potential psychiatric comorbidities. The subject of this case study reported the difficulties faced when seeking a diagnosis despite chronic symptoms. Physicians suggested the symptoms were initially caused by psychological distress and prescribed anti-anxiety medications. This patient&#x27;s experience highlights the overlooked nature of this disorder and the likelihood of misdiagnoses. Moreover, the patient from this case study expressed how the mismanagement of their diagnosis negatively impacted their psychological well-being, highlighting the importance proper diagnosis and symptom management.

In 2023, Ramesh and fellow researchers utilized a case study format to bring attention to the lack of research pertaining to pediatric patients with MdDS. It was mentioned the lack of research is expected since MdDS is known to affect middle-aged individuals for the most part. Despite this, Ramesh and colleagues recruited three patients with MdDS between the ages of 7 and 16 for this case study in an attempt to gain insight of treatment among pediatric patients. These patients were treated with medications such as Clonazepam, Escitalopram, and Venlafaxine. Treatment additionally included therapeutic intervention like opto-kinetic stimulation and vestibular ocular reflex exercises. It was described that all three of the patients reported experiencing migraines, which is a common symptom reported by adults patients with MdDS. Moreover, it was expressed that two of the pediatric patients were diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and the third patient reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety. This emphasizes the presence of psychiatric comorbidities associated with MdDS. Researchers also emphasized how this displays the importance of proper and timely diagnosis to prevent impacting the likelihood of mental distress. This study insinuates a need for further research is encouraged in order to improve general understanding of this condition and improve diagnostic challenges.

<text>Oscar Berger (May 12, 1901 – May 15, 1997) was a well-known caricaturist and cartoonist. His work appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines, and he authored and illustrated seven books. Some of the notable people who have sat for him to be drawn include: Winston Churchill, Pope Pius XII, Robert Frost, Charles de Gaulle, Marcel Marceau, Pablo Casals, Gina Lollobrigida, Christopher Morley, Bernard Shaw, Charlie Chaplin, Maria Tallchief, Ralph Richardson, Andrei Gromyko, Carlos P. Romulo, Valeska Gert, John Foster Dulles, and eight U.S. presidents.

==Biography and career==
Oscar Berger was born on May 12, 1901 in Prešov, Austria-Hungary. He started drawing at the age of three, and at the age of seven, he published his first book entitled &quot;My Life&quot;, on a miniature printing press. While growing up, he traveled with his parents to Budapest, Vienna and Paris. After graduating from high school in Levoča, he left for Prague where he continued his self-education in art; drawing the landscape and architecture of the city, and sometimes informal sketches of people passing by. One of these attracted the attention of the editors of a Berlin newspaper, resulting in an invitation to become its chief staff artist, and his work started to appear regularly in European newspapers. He was present at the Munich trials of 1923 where his drawings pilloried Hitler and the other defendants on trial; his drawings once causing so much laughter among the foreign journalists, that the whole group was cleared out of the court room. In 1928, he made his first trip to the United States, where a collection of his drawings were exhibited at the Advertising Club in New York City. It was during this visit that New York Governor Al Smith introduced him to Franklin Roosevelt. Berger recalls that when he asked him to sit for a drawing, Roosevelt quipped: &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ll be glad to, but don&#x27;t you think it a waste of your time?&quot; When he became president five years later, Berger sketched him again.

When Hitler rose to power in 1932, Berger was faced with a difficult decision, since many of his drawings of Hitler ridiculed him. He decided that leaving Germany would be his best option before any repercussions could occur. He then returned to Prague, and also lived in Budapest, Vienna, Paris, London, depending on where his work took him. In 1940, he was living in London during The Blitz, and he had the opportunity to sketch Winston Churchill as he was talking with cabinet members in a corridor of the House of Commons. Berger later recalled: &quot;The raid was heavy; hundreds of bombers came over in waves. As the ancient buildings shook under the impact of bursting bombs, I saw Churchill&#x27;s heavy jowl set with determination. I trembled as I sketched. Churchill never winced, but seemed to gather new strength as he spoke&quot;. Berger remained in England throughout the war years working for &quot;The Evening News&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. After the war ended, he came to San Francisco in 1945 to cover the League of Nations conference for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He drew multiple world leaders in attendance at the conference, including Andrei Gromyko and Carlos P. Romulo. By 1945, he had moved to New York City, and in 1955, he officially became a U.S. citizen. In 1985, he observed how publications were always writing about Gromyko&#x27;s &quot;dour&quot; smile, Berger said when he first met him in San
Francisco at the conference, &quot;he had a full smile ... maybe his life, his adventures in 40 years of political storms, have changed that&quot;.

==Subjects==
Berger was known for taking a minimalist approach when drawing his subjects, just bringing a sketch block and a few pencils. Numerous world leaders and important figures sat for him, including: Winston Churchill, Pope Pius XII, George II of Greece, Victor Emmanuel III, Edvard Beneš, Clement Attlee, Charles de Gaulle, Haile Selassie, Paul von Hindenburg, Andrei Gromyko, Carlos P. Romulo, John Foster Dulles, Luci Johnson, Queen Elizabeth II, Vyacheslav Molotov and Queen Wilhelmina.

The U.S. presidents who sat for him are: Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. In a conversation with &quot;American Art Magazine&quot;, Berger was asked to give his thoughts on the presidents he had drawn, and his remarks pertained to a common characteristic amongst them, their innate sense of humor: &quot;FDR&#x27;s was instant and bubbling; Coolidge took some time to warm up; Truman&#x27;s was dry and to the point; Eisenhower&#x27;s was precise and measured; Hoover&#x27;s was hidden but evident; and Kennedy&#x27;s natural, immediate, sharp, but good-natured&quot;.

Berger also had 10 U.S. Supreme Court justices sit for him, which he donated to the Smithsonian Institution National Portrait Gallery. Those he sketched include: Felix Frankfurter, Abe Fortas, Potter Stewart, Earl Warren, Thurgood Marshall, John Marshall Harlan, Byron White, William J. Brennan Jr., William O. Douglas and Hugo Black.

Berger sketched many notable individuals from the fields of literature, poetry, acting and sports, including: Christopher Morley, Ralph Richardson, Robert Frost, Marcel Marceau, Gina Lollobrigida, Bernard Shaw, Charlie Chaplin, Maria Tallchief, Valeska Gert, Pablo Casals, Joe DiMaggio, Tallulah Bankhead, T. S. Eliot, Arturo Toscanini, Anna Pavlova, Helen Hayes, Marlene Dietrich, Jimmy Durante, Jane Russell, Clark Gable, Bette Davis, Vivien Leigh, Danny Kaye, Judy Garland and Bob Hope.

==Selected works==

His work appeared in &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, &quot;Look Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, among numerous other publications. He also produced posters and advertising for Shell, London Transport and the Post Office. A partial list of caricatures he contributed to &quot;The New York Times&quot; include: &quot;Recipes for Notables (Add a Grain of Salt)&quot;, &quot;Hitler and Chaplin at 54&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Sketch Book&quot;, and &quot;A Short History of Arturo Toscanini&quot;.

In 1933, he authored and illustrated his first book titled &quot;Tip and Tap&quot; (The Two Scotsmen}, published by Rudolf Mosse Buchverlag. Other books he authored and illustrated include: &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Foibles&quot;, &quot;À la Carte: The Gourmet&#x27;s Phantasmagoria in Fifty Cartoons&quot;, &quot;Famous Faces: Caricaturist&#x27;s Scrapbook&quot;, &quot;My Victims: How to Caricature&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, and &quot;The Presidents, From George Washington to the Present&quot;.

==Personal life==
Berger married Aran (Anne) Varga, from Kispest, Hungary. They resided in Central Park South in Manhattan.

<text>Fallon Bowman (born 16 November 1983) is a Canadian guitarist and singer best known for her involvement with the metal band Kittie. Since departing Kittie in 2001, Bowman has worked with Pigface and as a solo artist under the name Amphibious Assault, as well as under her own name.

==Musical career==

At age 14, Bowman co-founded Kittie with classmate Mercedes Lander and Mercedes&#x27; sister, Morgan Lander. She played guitar and performed background vocals for the band as heard on their &quot;Spit&quot; album and the &quot;Paperdoll&quot; EP. She left Kittie in August 2001.

In 2003, Bowman came across the term amphibious assault in a Tom Clancy novel and thought it would be a great name for an industrial band. She then recorded several tracks with Pigface for the band&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Easy Listening&quot;. Her enjoyment of the recording experience led her to begin writing music again. She purchased a sequencer and began exploring the industrial music genre. Bowman filled her basement with drum machines and synthesizers and wrote the songs that made up Amphibious Assault&#x27;s debut album, &quot;District Six&quot;, released on the Social Unrest label. Bowman&#x27;s former Kittie bandmate, bassist Talena Atfield, and guitarist Pete Henderson also contributed to the project.

Amphibious Assault&#x27;s second album was completed and originally scheduled for a June, and later, an August 2005 release. The release was postponed on both occasions, largely due to Bowman&#x27;s school schedule which also caused her to miss her scheduled live appearances with Pigface. On 10 January 2007, Bowman announced via the Amphibious Assault website, that the second album, &quot;On Better Days and Sin-Eating&quot;, was available for purchase. The album was limited to 500 physical copies but was also made available via digital download.

In 2011, Bowman founded The Grace Dynasty, a five-piece band that included Rhim of The Birthday Massacre on drums. The band played a series of live shows before announcing their debut album. After recording was completed, the decision was made to drop the band name and release the album under Bowman&#x27;s name. The album, &quot;Human Conditional&quot;, was released on 25 January 2011.

In November 2016, Bowman participated in Pigface&#x27;s two-night 25th anniversary event in Chicago. In November 2019, Bowman joined Pigface for a concert at Toronto&#x27;s Lee&#x27;s Palace.

In January 2021, Bowman announced the return of Amphibious Assault, as well as a new album, titled &quot;Simulacrima&quot;. The album was released digitally on 12 February 2021, with physical copies made available a few months later.

In January 2022, Amphibious Assault released the single &quot;Death Ship&quot;.

== Other work ==
In 2010, Bowman was the subject of a prank for an episode of the Animal Planet series &quot;Freak Encounters&quot;. The episode reveals that she has a degree in archaeology. Bowman has also appeared in commercials and films.

<text>Claire Trevor (née Wemlinger; March 8, 1910April 8, 2000) was an American actress. She appeared in 65 feature films from 1933 to 1982, winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), and received nominations for her roles in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954) and &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937). Trevor received top billing, ahead of John Wayne, for &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939).

==Early life==
Trevor was born on March 8, 1910, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York City, the only child of Noel Wemlinger, a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor (of French birth but German ancestry), and his wife, Benjamina (&quot;Betty&quot;), who was of Irish birth. She was raised in New York City, and from 1923 on, in Larchmont, New York. For many years, her year of birth was misreported as 1909, which is why her age at the time of her death was initially given as 91, not 90.

==Career==

According to her biography on the website of Claire Trevor School of the Arts, &quot;Trevor&#x27;s acting career spanned more than seven decades and included successes in stage, radio, television, and film...[She] often played the hard-boiled blonde, and every conceivable type of &#x27;bad girl&#x27; role.&quot;

After completing high school, Trevor began her career with six months of art classes at Columbia University and six months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She made her stage debut in the summer of 1929 with a repertory company in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She subsequently returned to New York, where she appeared in a number of Brooklyn-filmed Vitaphone short films and performed in summer stock theatre. In 1932, she starred on Broadway as the female lead in &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot;.

Trevor made her film debut in &quot;Jimmy and Sally&quot; (1933), a film originally written for the popular screen duo of James Dunn and Sally Eilers. When Eilers declined the role, Trevor was cast in her place. From 1933 to 1938, Trevor starred in 29 films, often having either the lead role or the role of heroine. In 1937, she was the second lead actress (after top-billed Sylvia Sidney) in &quot;Dead End&quot;, with Humphrey Bogart, which led to her nomination for Best Supporting Actress. From 1937 to 1940, she appeared with Edward G. Robinson in the popular radio series &quot;Big Town&quot;, while continuing to make movies. In the early 1940s, she also was a regular on &quot;The Old Gold Don Ameche Show&quot; on the NBC Red Radio Network, starring with Ameche in presentations of plays by Mark Hellinger. In 1939, she was well established as a solid leading lady. One of her more memorable performances during this period includes the Western &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939).

Two of Trevor&#x27;s most memorable roles were opposite Dick Powell in &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944) and with Lawrence Tierney in &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947). In &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), Trevor played Gaye Dawn, a washed-up, alcoholic nightclub singer and gangster&#x27;s moll. For that role, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her third and final Oscar nomination was for her performance in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954). In 1957, she won an Emmy for her role in the &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; episode entitled &quot;Dodsworth&quot;. Trevor moved into supporting roles in the 1950s, with her appearances becoming very rare after the mid-1960s. She played Charlotte, the mother of Kay (Sally Field) in &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot; (1982). Her final television role was for the 1987 television film, &quot;Norman Rockwell&#x27;s Breaking Home Ties&quot;. Trevor made a guest appearance at the 70th Academy Awards in 1998.

==Personal life and death==
Trevor married Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, in 1938; they divorced four years later. She married Navy Lieutenant Cylos William Dunsmore in 1943. Their son Charles was her only child. The couple divorced in 1947. The next year, Trevor married Milton Bren, a film producer with two sons from a previous marriage, and moved to Newport Beach, California.

In 1978, Trevor&#x27;s son, Charles, died in the crash of PSA Flight 182, and this was followed by the death of her husband Milton from a brain tumor in 1979. Devastated by these losses, she returned to Manhattan for some years, living in a Fifth Avenue apartment and taking a few acting roles amid a busy social life. She eventually returned to California, where she remained for the rest of her life, becoming a generous supporter of the arts.

Trevor supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

On April 8, 2000, Trevor died at a hospital in Newport Beach, California, at age 90. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Legacy==
The Claire Trevor School of the Arts at the University of California, Irvine, was named in Trevor&#x27;s honor. Her Oscar and Emmy statuettes are on display in the Arts Plaza, next to the Claire Trevor Theatre.

<text>Sonneberg is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the south of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the west clockwise) the districts Hildburghausen, Saalfeld-Rudolstadt, and the Bavarian districts Kronach and Coburg.

==History==
The district was created in 1868 when districts were introduced in Saxe-Meiningen. In 1952, parts of the district were split off into a newly created district Neuhaus am Rennweg. In 1994, Neuhaus am Rennweg was dissolved and the district Sonneberg regained its original size. In 2019 the municipalities Lichte and Piesau from the district Saalfeld-Rudolstadt came as villages into the town Neuhaus am Rennweg in the district Sonneberg.
==Geography==
The district is located on the southern slopes of the mountains of the Thuringian Forest. The land descends from the more than 800m tall hills (the highest elevation is the 869m high Großer Farmdenkopf) down to the lower plains &quot;Sonneberger Unterland&quot; and &quot;Schalkauer Platte&quot;. The &quot;Dreistromstein&quot; near Siegmundsburg near Neuhaus am Rennweg marks the intersection of three watersheds that drain into the rivers Rhine, Weser, and Elbe.

==Politics==
Jürgen Köpper of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has served as interim district administrator since Hans-Peter Schmitz resigned in March 2023, citing health concerns. An early election to replace him took place on 11 June 2023, with a runoff held on 25 June. In the runoff, Jürgen Köpper was defeated by Robert Sesselmann of the Alternative for Germany (AfD). This marked the first time any AfD candidate had been elected district administrator, and the first executive position to be held by the party.

==Coat of arms==

Until 1952, a coat of arms introduced in the 1920s was used, which shows the coat of arms of the House of Henneberg instead of the Lords of Sonneberg in the top right field as another important part of Sonneberg&#x27;s history.

<text>DishnetDSL was a broadband internet service provider in India. VSNL, a part of the Tata group acquired DishnetDSL in 2004 and it is now a part of Tata Indicom Broadband.

==History==
DishnetDSL was started by Chinnakannan Sivasankaran as part of Sterling Group in 1998. Initially DSL was a part of much bigger plan which is &quot;Education To Home&quot; or ETH. Dr. Vijay P. Bhatkar is the chairman for ETH and under his leadership Dishnet DSL started operations in Pune. It was the first ISP to offer DSL services in India. However, due to the model it adapted (overhead cables similar to broadcasting cable) it couldn&#x27;t gain a larger customer base. This model was adapted as BSNL rejected Dishnet request to use Telecom exchanges to house DSLAM.

During 2000–2003, Dishnet aggressively connected five star hotels with DSL in every room which was considered a luxury. It worked with prestigious hotels like Leela Kempinski in Mumbai and Goa, Sun &amp; Sand, Ritz Carlton in Mumbai, Le Meridien in Pune &amp; some others in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Cochin.

In 2004 it was sold to VSNL which was acquired by TATA Telecom and the assets are merged with TATA.

<text>Admiral Sir James Stirling (28 January 179122 April 1865) was a British naval officer and colonial administrator. His enthusiasm and persistence persuaded the British Government to establish the Swan River Colony and he became the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia. In 1854, when Commander-in-Chief, East Indies and China Station, Stirling on his own initiative signed Britain&#x27;s first Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty. Throughout his career Stirling showed considerable diplomatic skill and was selected for a number of sensitive missions. Paradoxically, this was not reflected in his personal dealings with officialdom and his hopes for preferment received many rebuffs. Stirling also personally led the attack in Western Australia on a group of approximately seventy Bindjareb men, women and children now known as the Pinjarra massacre.

Stirling entered the Royal Navy at age 12 and as a midshipman saw action in the Napoleonic Wars. Rapid promotion followed and when he was 21 he received his first command, the 28-gun sloop , and, in the War of 1812 between the US and the UK, seized two prizes. &quot;Brazen&quot; carried the news of the end of that war to Fort Bowyer and took part in carrying to England the British troops that had captured the fort. On return to the West Indies, Stirling made two surveys of the Venezuelan coast and reported on the strengths, attitudes and dispositions of the Spanish government and various revolutionary factions, later playing a role in the British negotiations with these groups.

In his second command, , he carried supplies and coinage to Australia, but with a covert mission to assess other nations&#x27; interest in the region and explore opportunities for British settlements. He is chiefly remembered for his exploration of the Swan River, followed by his eventual success in lobbying the British Government to establish a settlement there. On 30 December 1828, he was made Lieutenant-Governor of the colony-to-be. He formally founded the city of Perth and the port of Fremantle and oversaw the development of the surrounding area and on 4 March 1831 he was confirmed as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the new territory, Western Australia, in which post he remained until in 1838 he resumed his naval career.

In October 1834 Stirling personally led a group of twenty-five police, soldiers and settlers in a punitive expedition against approximately seventy Bindjareb men, women and children camped on the Murray River partly in retaliation for several murders and thefts. This bloody attack involving rifles and bayonets against spears is known as the Pinjarra Massacreand sometimes the Battle of Pinjarra. An uncertain number of Aboriginal men, women and children were killed during this encounter; Stirling reported 15 males killed, John Septimus Roe 15–20, and an unidentified eyewitness 25–30 including 1 woman and several children with probably more floating down with the stream. One of Stirling&#x27;s party was injured and one was injured and died about two weeks later, although it is uncertain if from existing injuries, injuries suffered during the massacre, poor medical treatment after the massacre, or a combination thereof. An uncertain number of Bindjareb were injured, and an uncertain number died of their injuries.

From 1840 to 1844, in command of the 80-gun , he patrolled the Mediterranean with instructions to &quot;show the flag&quot; and keep an eye on the French. In 1847, he was given command of the 120-gun first rate ship of the line and his first commission was to conduct Her Majesty, the Dowager Queen Adelaide on trips to Lisbon and Madeira and then back to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. After that, &quot;Howe&quot; was assigned to the eastern Mediterranean, where she reinforced the squadron led by Vice Admiral Parker using gunboat diplomacy to secure an uneasy peace in the region.

Stirling&#x27;s fifth and final command was as Commander in Chief, China and the East Indies Station, and his flag, as Rear Admiral of the White, was hoisted on on 11 May 1854. Shortly afterwards news arrived that war had been declared on Russia. Stirling was anxious to prevent Russian ships from sheltering in Japanese ports and menacing allied shipping and, after lengthy negotiations through the Nagasaki Magistrate, concluded a Treaty of Friendship with the Japanese. The treaty was endorsed by the British Government, but Stirling was criticised in the popular press for not finding and engaging with the Russian fleet.

==Family background==
Stirling was the fifth of eight sons, ninth of the sixteen children, of Andrew Stirling, Esq. of Drumpellier near Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, and his father&#x27;s second cousin, Anne Stirling.

The Glaswegian Stirling family was made enormously wealthy by the slave trade in Britain, and Stirling&#x27;s father in law James Mangles was a wealthy Atlantic Ocean slaver. The Stirling family were also well-known and celebrated in the naval annals of the 18th century. His maternal grandfather was Admiral Sir Walter Stirling and his uncle was Admiral Sir Charles Stirling. With such a family background, it was natural for James to enter the Royal Navy. His education at Westminster School was interleaved with periods of training on board British warships, and on 14 January 1804, at the age of 12, he entered the navy as a First-Class Volunteer, embarking on the storeship HMS &quot;Camel&quot; for the West Indies. Thus he began a distinguished career.

==Early career==

===Period as a midshipman===

Stirling trained for midshipman on board and also served for a period on under the flag of Admiral Sir John Duckworth, Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica Squadron. He passed his midshipman tests on 20 January 1805 and shortly afterwards was posted to , but on 27 June, at the request of his uncle, Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling, he joined his uncle&#x27;s flagship, the 98-gun .

The following month, at age 14, he was to see his first naval action. &quot;Glory&quot; was in the fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Robert Calder, which in July that year engaged against the combined French and Spanish fleets off Cape Finisterre during the Napoleonic Wars. &quot;Glory&quot; sustained a damaged foremast spar and sails &quot;much torn&quot;. After the battle, the Squadron returned to England with two captured Spanish ships as prizes.

In July 1806 his uncle was given a new ship, , and orders to convoy General Samuel Auchmuty and his troops to the Río de la Plata and take over command of the squadron there from Admiral Sir Home Popham on the flagship . James accompanied his uncle and saw the fall of Montevideo to General Auchmuty&#x27;s forces and the capture of twenty-five warships and more than 10,000 tons of merchant shipping. In August 1807 the Stirlings crossed the South Atlantic for a stay of five months at the Cape of Good Hope and at the end of February 1808 &quot;Diadem&quot; returned to England via a short period in Rio de Janeiro.

On arrival in England in April, Midshipman Stirling was posted to under Captain Henry Blackwood. At this time he was preparing for his examinations to become a lieutenant, and Blackwood arranged for him to have short stints as Acting Lieutenant on other vessels in the Channel Fleet. He started his examinations at Somerset House on 1 August 1809 and on 12 August rejoined &quot;Warspite&quot; as a full Lieutenant.

===West Indies===
On 1 April 1810 Stirling was transferred from &quot;Warspite&quot; to under Captain R.D. Dunn and moved with Dunn when the Captain was transferred to in November. A year later, on 20 November 1811, he received a significant elevation to flag lieutenant on , the flagship of his uncle, now vice-admiral and commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station. On 3 March 1812, he was appointed acting commander of the sloop and three months later, at age 21, he was promoted to the rank of commander. Soon after that he was given command of the 28-gun sloop , built in 1808, in which he was to serve for six years.

In the War of 1812 between the United States of America and Britain, the role assigned to the ships of the Jamaica Station was to attack the US coast and ports on the Gulf of Mexico and to destroy their ships and stores. On 11 July 1812 &quot;Brazen&quot; weighed anchor on Stirling&#x27;s first mission, which was to be against New Orleans and the Mississippi delta. However, &quot;Brazen&quot; was severely damaged by a hurricane and had to abandon the mission and enter the Spanish port of Pensacola to carry out repairs. Despite this, Stirling was able to make a valuable survey of Mobile Bay and the Spanish-held Florida coastline and capture an American ship, which he took back to Jamaica as a prize on 20 November.

He had no immediate opportunity to revisit the Gulf of Mexico, as &quot;Brazen&quot; was ordered to return to England for a maintenance survey. After docking in Sheerness for four months, the ship escorted a convoy carrying settlers and stores to Hudson Bay. On his return to the Strait of Dover at the end of December 1813, Stirling received confidential orders for an important mission, to carry the Duke of Brunswick to Holland. After that, during most of 1814, &quot;Brazen&quot; patrolled the Irish Sea and the Hebrides in search of French or American ships until, at the end of the year, Stirling received orders to return to the West Indies, to the Windward Islands Station at Barbados, where Admiral Duckworth was now Commander-in-Chief.

There were now two stations in the West Indies, at Barbados and Jamaica, and for a while &quot;Brazen&quot; shuttled between the two, carrying communications between the two admirals. On one such trip Stirling was introduced to Simón Bolívar, who was in Jamaica following a defeat on the South American mainland. Soon after that he was given a mission to carry the news of the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, to the British troops under the command of General John Lambert, near New Orleans, and to assist in their return to England. His reconnaissance of Mobile Bay and the coast of Florida three years earlier now stood him in good stead. The troops, who had captured Fort Bowyer, were recovered and some of them, under the command of Captain Harry Smith, were taken to England on &quot;Brazen&quot; after surviving a severe gale in the Gulf of Florida. Smith was impressed with Stirling&#x27;s seamanship and became a long-standing friend.

The Treaty of Paris, signed by France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia on 20 Nov 1815, ended the Napoleonic Wars and a large fleet was no longer needed. The Admiralty set about decommissioning ships and retiring officers. However, Stirling and &quot;Brazen&quot; received a stay of execution, as they were needed again in the West Indies. Spain was losing its grip on the north of South America and rival factions were struggling for power. So close to the West Indies, Britain had an interest in the establishment of secure government on the mainland, but needed to be careful to avoid offending Spain, now an ally. &quot;Brazen&quot; arrived at Barbados in June 1816 and on 20 July Stirling and the Barbados Harbourmaster were sent to survey the coast of Venezuela and gain intelligence regarding the attitudes of the population and the disposition of the various revolutionary factions.

After making his report Stirling went back to patrolling the Caribbean with orders to prevent piracy and the contraband trade. Late in September he seized the . This action turned out to be unwise. &quot;Hércules&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Hercule&quot; on which Stirling had served in 1804, was nicknamed &quot;Black Frigate&quot; and had at one time been the flagship of the Argentine Navy. When taken by Stirling, she was a privateer with 22 guns carrying a valuable cargo plundered from Spanish American cities and ships. She was under the command of William Brown, who had been an admiral in the Argentine Navy and was in command of the revolutionary fleet fighting the Spaniards. Her capture compromised the cautious line taken by the British between the Spanish and the revolutionaries. The Governor of Barbados ordered her release, but, when she had left Barbados, Stirling recaptured her and took her to Antigua as a prize. After long drawn-out proceedings, the High Court of the Admiralty ruled in Brown&#x27;s favour, but he lost the frigate and her cargo. Stirling continued to receive demands for payment of damages for many years.

At the end of 1816 Stirling was commissioned to make a further detailed inspection of the conditions in Venezuela. From Güiria in the Paria Peninsula he sailed west to Caracas and the port of La Guaira and returned eastward by an inland route, in order to study the conditions in the interior of the country. In February 1817 he submitted a detailed report to the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral John Harvey. In it he blamed Spanish neglect for the devastation and decay he found in the interior. He described the insurgent &quot;Patriots&quot; as determined and disciplined, but the Loyalists were indisciplined and lazy. Following this, Stirling was given a number of covert missions in connection with Venezuela. The exact orders he received are not known, as the period from January to June 1817 has been removed from &quot;Brazen&#x27;s&quot; log in Admiralty files. In May, the Executive Committee of the Patriots prepared a draft &quot;Constitution for the Republic of Venezuela&quot; which was given to Stirling for transmission to the West Indies Stations and thence to England. However this draft was subsequently rejected by Bolívar. Another source reports that a secret agreement, between the British and the Republicans, was signed later on board &quot;Brazen&quot;, in which the British would assist Bolívar in exchange for preferential trading rights when the Republic came into being.

In the second half of 1817 Stirling returned once again to patrolling the Caribbean with orders to seize any vessels suspected of piracy, orders which he carried out with alacrity because of the prize money. By June 1818 &quot;Brazen&quot; was in need of repair and he returned with her to England, where the ship was taken out of commission and Stirling received the dread news that he was to be placed on half pay. However, Admiral Harvey had sent the Lords of the Admiralty a letter strongly commending &quot;the zeal and alacrity of this intelligent and excellent officer&quot;, which may have influenced their decision to promote him to Post Captain on 7 December 1818.

===Surrey===

Although at the end of 1817 he was not to know it, Stirling was to be without a command for eight years.
Between 1818 and 1822 his father, Andrew, was a tenant at Henley Park in Surrey,
and Stirling made use of his enforced leave to visit his parents and other members of his scattered family. He also made several visits to the Continent of Europe. On one such visit to France he met and befriended Captain James Mangles, RN, who was also on half pay. Mangles was returning from a tour of North Africa and Asia Minor and was among the first Europeans to have visited Petra. His uncle had an estate at Woodbridge Park, about ten miles from the Stirlings at Henley Park and had extensive interests in the East Indies, had been High Sheriff for Surrey in 1808 and was a director of the British East India Company.

Captain Mangles invited Stirling to visit Woodbridge, where he met for the first time the, then, 13-year-old Ellen Mangles, his future wife. The two families got on well together and the parents were delighted two years later when, according to the etiquette of that era, Stirling formally asked the uncle&#x27;s permission to propose marriage to his daughter. The permission was granted on the condition that Stirling should not make the proposal until Ellen completed her schooling.
The couple were married at Stoke Church, Guildford on 3 September 1823, on Ellen&#x27;s 16th birthday,
and went on a nine-month honeymoon and grand tour. On their return, Ellen gave birth to their first child, Andrew, at Woodbridge on 24 October 1824.

During the next eighteen months Stirling put forward several ideas to the Admiralty, including a means of assessing compass declinations at sea and a proposal for improving stowage in warships. He was keen to keep his name in front of those in the Admiralty who could post him to active service. He had returned from the grand tour short of funds, his father had died in 1823, the family businesses were not prospering and he himself had to make payments to the court in connection with the &quot;Hércules&quot; case. The competition for preferment from other officers on half pay was intense, so he was fortunate that on 23 January 1826 he was recommissioned and given command of the newly built .

==Australia==
In 1826 the western side of Australia was still called New Holland, however the Dutch appeared to have no interest in its development. For the British, a port on the west or north coast might be a useful stage for trade with their settlements in the Cape of Good Hope, India and Singapore. However, the French were known to have an intense interest and French ships were exploring the Australian coasts. The British needed to assess further the potential of the region and find out the extent of the French interest without creating a diplomatic incident. For this task, Stirling, with his record of exploration, diplomacy and covert missions, was a natural choice. New South Wales was running short of currency and the settlement on Melville Island was short of food and scurvy was rife. A supply mission to these would be excellent cover for intelligence gathering activities.

&quot;Success&quot; sailed on 9 July 1826, carrying cases of coins and a distinguished passenger, Admiral Sir James Saumarez, Knight Companion of the Bath, a hero of the Napoleonic Wars. Ellen and one year old Andrew remained at home at Woodbridge. One of Stirling&#x27;s officers was 3rd Lieutenant William Preston, who would marry Ellen&#x27;s sister Hamilla seven years later. &quot;Success&quot; arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 September, discharged its passenger, took on provisions and set sail again, arriving at Sydney Heads on 28 November.

Captain Jules d&#x27;Urville arrived in Sydney Harbour on 2 December on the French corvette &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; was on a voyage of exploration, which gave Stirling an opportunity to assess French interest in the region. Stirling and d&#x27;Urville dined together several times and Stirling discovered that &quot;Astrolabe&quot; had a detailed chart of the Swan River. Before leaving England, Stirling had studied the available charts of the west coast of Australia and had concluded that the Swan was a possible site for a harbour and settlement and had hoped to be the first European to explore and chart it. However, d&#x27;Urville indicated that the French did not consider that the Swan would be a suitable site for a harbour, because of the difficulty of access and lack of fresh water. This gave Stirling a free hand.

A ship arrived from Melville Island on the same day as &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot;, bringing reassuring news that scurvy was under control and the settlement was progressing more satisfactorily. The Governor, Major General Ralph Darling, advised Stirling to delay his visit to Melville until later in the year. Stirling then made a report to Darling, setting out detailed arguments for a mission to the Swan River. Darling gave his approval and, on 17 January 1827, &quot;Success&quot; sailed from Sydney for the Swan, via Hobart in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, where several cases of coins were delivered. On board &quot;Success&quot; were the Colonial Botanist Charles Frazer, the surgeon Frederick Clause and the landscape artist Frederick Garling.

===Swan River exploration===
The Nyoongar people call the river Derbarl Yerrigan. 
On 10 January 1697, the Dutch sea captain Willem De Vlamingh renamed it to the Swan River (Zwaanenrivier in Dutch) after the large number of black swans they observed there. One hundred and thirty years later, the British ship &quot;Success&quot; arrived off the west coast of Australia on 5 March 1827 and anchored near the north east corner of Rottnest Island. The following day, the ship moved cautiously towards the coast and anchored about a mile from the mouth of the Swan. Lieutenant Carnac and the ship&#x27;s Master, Millroy, were left to take soundings and look for channels and possible landing places. Meanwhile, Stirling, Frazer and Lieutenant Preston made a preliminary reconnaissance up the river in the gig. They sailed about five miles upstream, reaching a wide section which Stirling named &quot;Melville Water&quot;. Other features were named after Stirling&#x27;s brother Walter and Lieutenant Preston. During the next day more soundings were taken, and &quot;Isle Berthelot&quot; and &quot;Isle Buache&quot; were renamed &quot;Carnac Island&quot; and &quot;Garden Island&quot;. Stirling gave the name &quot;Cockburn Sound&quot; to the &quot;Magnificent Sound between that Island and the Main possessing great attractions for a Sailor in search of a Port&quot;.

At mid-day on 8 March the exploration party - Stirling, Frazer, Garling, Clause, Lieutenant Belches, Midshipman Heathcote, the ship&#x27;s clerk Augustus Gilbert, 7 seamen and 4 marines - left &quot;Success&quot; in the cutter and the gig and sailed to &quot;Point Belches&quot;. There the boats grounded and, as the party was unable to find a channel, the boats were unloaded and dragged across the shallows until nightfall. While this was being done, Stirling, Frazer and Garling climbed the commanding hill on the west bank, which Stirling named &quot;Mount Eliza&quot; in honour of Eliza Darling, the New South Wales Governor&#x27;s wife. While there, Garling painted a watercolour landscape view showing the entrance to the river on the opposite side of Melville Water. Stirling later named this &quot;Canning River&quot; after the British Prime Minister at that time.

The next day, dragging across the shallows started at daybreak and continued until nightfall. Frazer, exploring on land, found a freshwater brook and Stirling named the nearby point of land &quot;Point Frazer&quot;. Frazer also found a lagoon of fresh water and the party moved camp to beside it. On the following morning three armed Aboriginal warriors demonstrated their anger at the &quot;invasion&quot; (Stirling&#x27;s word) of their territory with violent gestures, but eventually retired. During the day, the boats reached the Heirisson Islands and in the channel above them progress was much easier, but still slow, due to the winding of the river. On 11 March the boats passed through a long narrow stretch and encountered more Aboriginal people who threatened the boats with their spears from higher ground. When the boats reached more level terrain, gestures of goodwill defused the situation and the Aboriginals moved on.

On 12 March the boats reached a place where a tributary, later named &quot;Helena River&quot;, joined the Swan from the east. The party also found another fresh water stream, which they named &quot;Success&quot;, on the west side of the Swan. From this point on, the Swan narrowed and there were many obstructions. The next day, the cutter was holed and had to be repaired, after which the party reached a creek which Stirling named &quot;Ellen Brook&quot;, after his young wife. The Swan was not navigable any further and Stirling and Garling set off on foot for the hills to the east, arriving at about sunset. On their return to camp they lost their way in the dark, but Frazer sent out search parties to guide them back. On 14 March the party split into three groups. Frazer went east and Belches and Heathcote north. Stirling and Clause went west and discovered a freshwater lagoon, some Aboriginal huts and a fertile region which so pleased Stirling that he named it &quot;Henley Park&quot; after his Surrey home.

The return journey was much quicker, being downstream and through previously charted areas. On arrival at Melville Water, Belches was sent to explore the Canning River. The rest of the party returned to &quot;Success&quot; and spent the next four days surveying the surrounding islands and finding a safe channel into Cockburn Sound. On 21 March &quot;Success&quot; weighed anchor and three days later arrived at Geographe Bay, in order to carry out Governor Darling&#x27;s instructions to explore and report on the region. Geographe Bay was named in May 1801 by French explorer Nicolas Baudin. &quot;Success&quot; then sailed to King George Sound, to pick up Major Edmund Lockyer and unload provisions for the settlement there, after which the ship returned to New South Wales, anchoring off Sydney Heads on 16 April.

Stirling&#x27;s report to Darling and Frazer&#x27;s report on the quality of the land were enclosed with Darlings report of 21 April 1827 to the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom. Stirling&#x27;s report consisted of a diary &quot;Narrative of Operations&quot; and a section &quot;Observations on the Territory&quot;, which included a report by Clause on the healthiness of the climate. Later events showed that all three reports were over enthusiastic, the party having explored only the strip of soil in the vicinity of the Swan. Frazer was heavily criticised for this later. However, in their defence, both Clause and Frazer were subject to Stirling&#x27;s intense enthusiasm for the project and may have been unduly influenced by it. Stirling wrote a second report on the Swan River on 31 August. This was addressed to the Admiralty and was shorter, placing more emphasis on naval concerns and the strategic value of the area.

===Melville Island and North Australia===
Stirling&#x27;s original mission included a task to carry supplies to Melville Island. However, Darling had received further instructions to investigate the formation of a new settlement on the coast to the east of Melville Island. Accordingly, &quot;Success&quot; left Sydney on 19 May 1827 carrying an establishment force for a new settlement and accompanied by the brig &quot;Mary Elizabeth&quot;. The two ships separated. &quot;Mary Elizabeth&quot; sailed to Melville Island and on 15 June &quot;Success&quot; anchored in Palm Bay, on the western side of Croker Island. Stirling quickly established that the island was unsuitable for settlement and sent a boat across to the mainland to explore Raffles Bay. The report being favourable, Stirling looked no further and on 18 June he went ashore with his officers to take possession of Raffles Bay and the surrounding territory in His Majesty&#x27;s name. The establishment force and supplies were landed and Stirling named the settlement Fort Wellington. A month later, believing all to be well, Stirling set sail for Melville island.

&quot;Success&quot; arrived at Fort Dundas on Melville Island on 25 July and set sail again four days later for Madras, and then to Penang, to report to Admiral Gage, Commander of the Eastern Station. Stirling was keen to return home to see his family and to further his case for a settlement at the Swan River. However, Gage instructed him to base &quot;Success&quot; in Trincomalee Harbour, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he arrived on 4 January 1828. There he succumbed rapidly to the tropical climate and on 21 February three Royal Navy surgeons certified that he was so ill he should return immediately to England.

The settlements at Fort Dundas and Fort Wellington rapidly got into difficulties with outbreaks of scurvy and fever, supply shortages and communication failures. The Melville Island outpost was abandoned in November 1828 and the Raffles Bay settlement was broken up in July 1829.

===Western Australia===

On returning to London in 1828, Stirling lobbied the Foreign Office and the Admiralty for support for a settlement in the vicinity of the Swan River, describing it as ideal for a permanent establishment. He emphasised the defensive prospects of Mount Eliza, the large hill on which Kings Park is now situated, &quot;as it is near the narrows of the Swan River, which would make defending the colony from gunships easy, with just a few cannons.&quot;

On 21 August 1828, Stirling and his friend the colonial expert Thomas Moody wrote to Under-Secretary Robert Hay to offer to form an association of private capitalists to using their own money settle Australia in fulfilment of the &quot;principles&quot; of William Penn&#x27;s settlement of Pennsylvania. Moody was endorsed by the Tories in Parliament, who had recently commended his report to Parliament on slavery. Moody had previously advised Stirling&#x27;s relation James Mangles about the settlement of the Swan River Colony at minimal cost to the British Government.

Parliament initially rejected the proposal of Stirling and Moody, but rumours of a new French interest in the region provoked Sir George Murray, on 5 November, to request that the Admiralty send a ship-of-war &quot;to proceed to the Western Coast of New Holland and take possession of the whole territory in His Majesty&#x27;s name.&quot; This task was given to under the command of Captain Charles Fremantle and, a week later, a further order was issued to prepare to carry a detachment of troops to the Swan River.

On 31 December Murray wrote to Stirling confirming his title as Lieutenant-Governor of the new colony and on the same day his Under-Secretary, Robert Hay, confirmed the appointment of the members of the civil establishment including Colonial Secretary Peter Brown, Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe, Harbourmaster Mark John Currie, naturalist James Drummond, a surgeon, a storekeeper, a cooper, a blacksmith and a boatbuilder. After hectic preparations, on 6 February 1829 these pioneers, with their assistants, families, servants and livestock, departed Plymouth in &quot;Parmelia&quot; under Captain J H Luscombe out of Spithead in company with &quot;Sulphur&quot;, carrying 100 men of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, under the command of Major Frederick Irwin, and three years&#x27; of army stores, 10,000 bricks and £1,000 to meet all expenses of government.

On arrival on 31 May at Garden Island, at what became known as the Swan River Colony, they re-erected a wooden house that had first been assembled at Lieutenant Preston&#x27;s home in Sutton Green, Surrey, that would become the Governor&#x27;s home. These pioneers were responsible for laying the foundations of Perth, Fremantle and the market-town named Guildford that is now a suburb of Perth.
Stirling administered the Swan River settlement from June 1829 until 11 August 1832, when he left on an extended visit to England where he was knighted, and again from August 1834 until December 1838. However, he was commissioned as Governor of Western Australia only from 6 February 1832, rectifying the absence of a legal instrument providing the authority detailed in Stirling&#x27;s Instructions of 30 December 1828. Stirling had said I believe I am the first Governor who ever formed a settlement without Commission, Laws, Instructions and Salary.

With the creation of the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1830, Stirling automatically became an official member.

In October 1834 Stirling led a detachment of 25 armed troopers and settlers including Septimus Roe and Thomas Peel that attacked an encampment of 60-80 Pindjarep Aboriginal people. The Pindjarep fled into the bush and were later encircled near a crossing on the Murray River at Pinjarra, Stirling referred to this as the Battle of Pinjarra. Settlers accounts claim between 10 and 80 Aboriginal people died, compared to Aboriginal oral history which claim 150 people died.

Stirling remained entirely unsympathetic to the needs of Aboriginal people in Western Australia, and never recognised their prior ownership of the land despite the fact that the Buxton Committee of the British House of Commons informed him that this was a mistake for which the new colony would suffer. Stirling mentioned in dispatches that the Aborigines &quot;must gradually disappear&quot; and the &quot;most anxious and judicious measures of the local government [could] prevent the ulterior extinction of the race&quot;.

As recognition of his service in establishing the colony Stirling was granted land near Beverley, Western Australia. This land, along with neighbouring properties was re-acquired by the Western Australian Government, who later subdivided the land into farmlets for returning soldiers. The remaining land was later used to establish the Avondale Agricultural Research Station, which includes Stirling&#x27;s restored homestead.

===Harvey===
In 1829 Stirling selected of land in Harvey and called it the &quot;Harvey River Settlement&quot;. However, the only improvement made was a convict built cottage on the banks of the Harvey River. The cottage featured a shingled roof and pit-sawn jarrah walls with hexagonal-shaped paving blocks fitted together to form firm flooring. A replica cottage known as Stirling&#x27;s Cottage has been built on the site and includes one of the original paving blocks in its history room.

==Mediterranean and west coast of Europe==

===HMS &quot;Indus&quot;===
In 1840 Stirling was given command of and instructions to join the Mediterranean Fleet. The British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, considered it was necessary to show a strong British naval presence in the Mediterranean. Muhammad Ali Pasha had triggered the Oriental Crisis of 1840 by declaring himself Khedive of Egypt, which had been until then a province of the Ottoman Empire. Also King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and Naples, had been persuaded by a British naval blockade of Naples to restore to a British company the monopoly for Sicilian sulphur, an essential ingredient of gunpowder. &quot;Indus&quot; reached Gibraltar in August 1841 and made herself felt along the Algerian coast on her way to the Mediterranean station at Malta. For a few months she was deployed around Sicily and the boot of Italy, but in November Stirling received new instructions to show a presence and monitor the situation at Lisbon. Portugal had been in turmoil for several years and the British Admiralty had received intelligence that Lisbon was threatened by a 5,000 strong revolutionary army and the Portuguese Government was preparing for conflict. Stirling was directed not to take part in any action, but to safeguard British subjects and the Portuguese royal family. In the event, the conflict was resolved peacefully.

In June &quot;Indus&quot; was ordered back to Malta and then to Smyrna, where there had been an insurrection and British subjects and property in the region were thought to be at risk. This threat also failed to materialise and after three months at Piraeus in Greece &quot;Indus&quot; sailed to Naples to take part in the farewell celebrations sending the Princess Teresa Cristina on her way to marry the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. This was a major diplomatic event and Stirling entertained the British Ambassador and British Consul on board and was received by King Ferdinand. The harbour was filled with vessels of the Neapolitan, Brazilian and British navies as well as an American warship and Stirling sent a detailed report on the foreign warships to the Admiralty.

A brief spell at Gibraltar was followed by a visit to Cadiz to prevent a planned blockade of the harbour by rebel troops. Then, in September 1843, Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Owen, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, received an urgent request for assistance from Sir Edmund Lyons, the British Consul in Athens. King Otto of Greece had rejected a proposed new constitutional government for Greece and was facing an armed rebellion. Stirling was to join , under the command of Sir Charles Sullivan, place himself at the disposal of Sir Edmund and arrange for the protection of British subjects. Stirling&#x27;s charm and diplomatic skill, combined with the presence of three British warships in the harbour, calmed the situation and, despite the King&#x27;s reluctance to adopt the new constitution, Sullivan and Stirling persuaded him that acceptance was the wisest course. In gratitude for their help in quelling the rebellion and negotiating with his ministers, the King bestowed on Sullivan and Stirling Greece&#x27;s high honour, Knight Commander of the Order of the Redeemer. Following this, Stirling returned to England, where &quot;Indus&quot; was paid off on 13 June 1844.

===HMS &quot;Howe&quot;===
Stirling received his fourth command, the 120-gun first rate ship of the line in May 1847 and joined the Channel Fleet under the command of the newly appointed Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Napier on . In September he received special orders. He was to conduct Her Majesty, the Dowager Queen Adelaide, Queen Victoria&#x27;s aunt, on trips to Lisbon and Madeira and then back to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Flying the Royal Standard at the main, &quot;Howe&quot; entered the River Tagus on 22 October. Sir Charles Napier immediately boarded to pay his respects, followed shortly afterwards by Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg Gotha, King of Portugal, and two princes. The next day, all the captains in the squadron donned full dress and white trousers and were formally presented to the Dowager Queen, after which Napier and Stirling escorted her to the royal Palace of Necessidades, where they were received by Queen Maria II.

After five days of sightseeing, the party set sail for Madeira. Leaving the Tagus, &quot;Howe&quot; was struck by a large wave and the Queen slipped and nearly fell overboard, but was saved by Stirling, who in so doing lost his ceremonial sword overboard. The grateful Queen later presented him with a magnificent replacement, a fine gold plated dress sword and scabbard which had been specially made for her. She also presented him with a silver snuff box with an inscription thanking him for his presence of mind on the occasion. After delivering the Queen in Madeira, &quot;Howe&quot; returned to Lisbon and took part in various exercises and manoeuvres before leaving again to collect her for the return voyage. She arrived at Osborne House on 27 April and Stirling learned a year later that she had honoured him by appointing him as her naval aide-de-camp.

He now had a few weeks with his family before receiving orders to report at Malta to Vice-Admiral Sir William Parker, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, who had succeeded Sir Edward Owen. During the next few years, the presence of the British and French fleets encouraged an uneasy peace in the eastern Mediterranean. In 1849 &quot;Howe&quot; was recalled. She reached England on 2 July and two weeks later the ship&#x27;s company was paid off.

==Far East==
In July 1851, Stirling was promoted to rear admiral and in the following year served as Third Naval Lord at the Admiralty. From January 1854 to February 1856 Stirling was commander in chief of the East Indies and China Station. Using gunboat diplomacy he signed the first British treaty with Japan (the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty) on 14 October 1854.

In November 1854, with Hong Kong Governor John Bowring, he led a fleet up the Pearl River to Canton to support the Viceroy of Liangguang (modern day Guangdong and Guangxi) Ye Mingchen and his forces besieged by the Tiandihui army. The fleet carried weapons and ammunition, food and Qing reinforcements.

==Retirement==
Stirling was promoted vice admiral in August 1857. He became an admiral in November 1862 and died in comfortable retirement at his home in Woodbridge Park, near Guildford in Surrey, on 22 April 1865 aged 74. There is a memorial tablet within St Marks Church, Wyke. Ellen survived him by nine years. Stirling and his wife were buried in the extension to the graveyard of St John&#x27;s Church on Stoke Road, near Guildford where they had been married.

==Honours==
The plant genus &quot;Stirlingia&quot;, was named in his honour by Stephan Endlicher in 1838. A variety of Pittosporum is also named in his honour. In England, Stoke Church&#x27;s social centre and hall is named &quot;The Stirling Centre&quot;.

In Western Australia the suburb of Stirling is named after him, as is a seat in the lower House of the federal Parliament and Governor Stirling Senior High School. The Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s Indian Ocean Fleet is based at HMAS Stirling, near Rockingham. Stirling Highway (which links Perth and Fremantle) was named so in his honour. There are also many buildings and businesses named after him throughout Perth and Fremantle.

==Dishonours==
Following the well-conceived ambush leading to a massacre lasting at least one hour and now known as the Pinjarra Massacre that Stirling led personally, Stirling threatened the Noongar people with genocide should they continue to resist colonisation. Given historical records of his involvement,
In 2020 a statue of Stirling on Hay Street in Perth&#x27;s central business district was defaced amid Black Lives Matter protests. The statue had its neck and hands painted red, and the Australian Aboriginal flag was painted over the plaque on the ground in front of the statue.

Increasingly there are efforts to remove Stirling&#x27;s name from Western Australian landmarks. In 2019, a petition to rename Stirling Highway received little support. In 2021, &quot;residents at a [City of] Stirling council electors meeting voted in favour of changing their local government&#x27;s name&quot;, although the city &quot;eventually passed a motion that made no mention of any name change&quot;, with one councillor saying &quot;while nobody condoned historical atrocities, a name change would cost &#x27;millions of dollars&#x27;, would set a dangerous precedent and should be &#x27;nipped in the bud″.&quot; However, shortly afterwards, Western Australian senators called for a broader review of Western Australian &quot;place names, such as Stirling Range, linked to colonial figures with known racist histories ... such as William Dampier, John Forrest and John Septimus Roe.&quot;

<text>Othmar Spann (1 October 1878 – 8 July 1950) was a conservative Austrian philosopher, sociologist and economist. His radical anti-liberal and anti-socialist views, based on early 19th century Romantic ideas expressed by Adam Müller et al. and popularized in his books and lecture courses, helped antagonise political factions in Austria during the interwar years.

== Early life ==

Othmar Spann was the son of Josef Spann, a manufacturer and inventor. He grew up in Altmannsdorf, a suburban area of Vienna, Austria. He had three siblings and after the early death of his mother, his father was no longer able to provide for the family. From the age of 12 Spann therefore grew up with his maternal grandmother, whose husband was a former sergeant and whose military-oriented lifestyle was in contrast to that of his father. He attended a &quot;Bürgerschule&quot; and graduated in 1898. Afterwards, he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, followed by political sciences of Zürich and Bern. He received his doctorate in political science from the University of Tübingen in 1903.

From 1903 to 1907, Spann worked for the &quot;Center for Private Welfare Service&quot; in Frankfurt. He was responsible for empirical studies of this population of workers. By the end of 1904 Spann, along with Hermann Beck and Hanns Dorn founded a newspaper called &quot;Critical Pages for the whole Social Sciences&quot;.

On October 17, 1906, Spann married the poet Erika Spann-Rheinsch (1880–1967), with whom he had sons Adalbert Spann (1907–1942) and Rafael Spann (1909–1983). The grave of Othmar Spann and his wife has been preserved at the local cemetery in Bergwerk.

In 1907, Spann wrote his &quot;Habilitation in Political Economy&quot; for the Hochschule in Brünn. From 1907 to 1909, he was given the position of &quot;Privatdozent&quot; which allowed him to teach and collect fees from students. As early as 1908, Spann began working as the full-time imperial-royal vice-secretary of the statistic central commission in Vienna. He was given the position of creating a new census for Austria between 1909 and 1910.

In 1909 he was appointed to the German Technical University in Brno as an extraordinary professor, and from 1911 to 1919 as a full professor of economics and statistics.

From 1914 to 1918, during the First World War, Spann was a first lieutenant of the reserve. He was injured during the Battle of Lemberg, (now Lviv, Ukraine) on 27 August 1914. When he recovered he was first a commander of a company of Russian prisoners and then until later in 1918 he was given a position on the &quot;scientific committee for wartime economy&quot; with the war Ministry in Vienna.

In 1919, at the instigation of the Austrian Minister of Education Emerich Czermak, he was appointed full professor of economics and social studies at the University of Vienna, where he was supposed to form a philosophical counter-position to Austro-Marxism. The city of Vienna was considered a stronghold of Austro-Marxist positions, and at the law faculty they represented the dominant university philosophy. With the appointment of Spann, the Christian-social teaching administration aimed to create an ideological bulwark against Austrian social democracy and Bolshevism. With his 1920 lecture series entitled &quot;The True State,&quot; Spann began to set the direction for his corporatist theory, &quot;universalism&quot;. In 1921 the lectures were published in book form under the same title. In his work, he developed a holistic theory based on Adam Heinrich Müller. The anti-democratic and anti-Marxist ideas propagated in it were particularly popular with German nationalist and conservative Catholic student groups in Austria and the Sudetenland and he quickly rose to a cult figure.

Spann was popular with students, not only for his lectures which would spill out into the hallways at the University, but also for mid-summer festivals which he would hold in the woods where he would teach that &quot;the ability to intuit essences was nurtured by jumping over the fire...&quot; (Caldwell 2004, 138-9)

== Activism and career ==

In 1928 he also became a board member of the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur (KfdK).The first public event of the Kampfbund took place on February 23, 1929 in the auditorium maximum of the University of Munich, where he gave a speech about &quot;the cultural crisis of the present&quot;, which was well received in the media at the time. Spann called for the authoritarian corporate state as a &quot;“third way”&quot; between democracy and Marxism. However, due to differences with the organization’s leadership, he was expelled from the Kampfbund in 1931.

From 1933 he was editor of the &quot;Ständisches Leben magazine,&quot; which was closely related to Nazism. He supported the burning of books, but not the extent of anti-Semitism. Beginning in 1935, his ideas were increasingly attacked by Nazi organs. Between 1936 and 1938, when the NSDAP was banned in Austria, there was an illegal printing shop in his castle in Bergwerk.

Repeatedly, Spann tried to draw the ruling powers&#x27; attention to his authoritarian theory of a corporate state, which he thought should be introduced immediately for the benefit of all. Around 1930, he also joined the Nazi Party. In 1933 the Austro-Hungarian social philosopher Karl Polanyi wrote that Spann had given Fascism its first comprehensive philosophical system, and that his idea of &quot;anti-individualism&quot; had become its guiding principle.

== Spannian &quot;universalism&quot; ==
Spann&#x27;s authoritarian-corporate holistic doctrine of &quot;universalism&quot; (also known as &quot;Spannism&quot;) was based on an ontological metaphysics that Spann created by connecting various lines of thought from politics, social science and economics.  In terms of the history of ideas, his &quot;universalism&quot; was essentially based on Plato&#x27;s theory of ideas, medieval German mysticism, Hegel&#x27;s idealism and the philosophy of romanticism. He published works from these schools of thought in his multi-volume anthology &quot;Die Herdflamme&quot;.

Spann saw the most important task of &quot;universalism&quot; in “overcoming individualistic social and economic theory”. During his academic career, Spann wrote numerous socio-political writings, of which his work &quot;The True State&quot; of 1921 is considered the most important. The term &quot;spannism&quot; is also used for &quot;universalism&quot;. In it he developed a “social model based on medieval guilds, structured by estates and characterized by hierarchy, which, instead of equal voting rights for the citizens, knew the election of a supreme leader by the leaders of the diverse, structured masses and associations.”  According to Spann, the people were neither constituted by the state, nor by race or language, but only through a &quot;spiritual community&quot;. Spann saw this in the Germans in their ethnic “people” and their “people’s property”.  This universalistic-idealistic social doctrine was directed against rationalism, liberalism, materialism and Marxism and called for a reorganization of state and society on a professional basis (corporate state).

The universalist teachings of Spann did not describe the world as an atomistic structure in the sense of market theory, but as an organic structure in the sense of structure theory. Within this organic whole, in which &quot;each individual member could only be adequately defined in relation to the unit superior to it&quot;, the hierarchically structured social unit took precedence over the individual. Spann thought of the economic system in a tiered structure with the world economy at the top, which is further subdivided in descending order into national economies, regional economies, business associations, companies and individual economists.

== Notable students ==
* Oskar Morgenstern
* Friedrich Hayek, winner of the 1974 Nobel prize
* Eric Voegelin

== Removal from teaching ==
Although to a large degree in tune with the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, he repeatedly met with disapproval until, in 1938, right after the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, he was briefly imprisoned by the Nazis and eventually barred from his professorship at the University of Vienna, which he had held since 1919.

In 1938 he was arrested and allegedly interned for four months in the Dachau concentration camp, where he is said to have contracted serious eye problems as a result of the abuse. A detention in the Dachau concentration camp could not be proven in the archives.

Living as a recluse till the end of the war, Spann tried to get his university post back in 1945, aged 67. However, he was not allowed to resume his teaching and died in 1950, disappointed and embittered.

== Reception ==

=== Economics ===
According to Helmut Woll (1994), Othmar Spann is considered &quot;the most influential economist of the Weimar period&quot;. Woll attributes Spann&#x27;s &quot;universalism&quot; to the history of dogma.

=== Austrian representative of the &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; ===
According to Armin Pfahl-Traughber, Spann applies to his corporate state theory as an Austrian representative of the ultra-nationalist &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot;. Pfahl-Traughber counts Spann as part of this intellectual current because of his positions, specifically as a representative of the young conservatives. According to Pfahl-Traughber, unlike many other conservative revolutionaries, Spann&#x27;s corporate state theory provided a &quot;concrete and comprehensive counter-proposal to the rejected democratic constitutional state&quot;. As an intellectual living and working in Austria, he only played a limited role in the formation and development of the Conservative Revolution, but his thinking also helped shape its main protagonists such as Edgar Julius Jung. Karl Bruckschwaiger (2005) assigns Othmar Spann&#x27;s thinking to the Conservative Revolution, as defined in Rolf Peter Sieferle&#x27;s work.

=== Placement and influence in political Catholicism ===
The universalists around Spann are assigned to the &quot;socio-romantic&quot; currents within political Catholicism, all of which represented &quot;more or less backward-looking, oriented towards &quot;romanticism&quot;, feudalism and urban economy&quot; views. In addition to the universalists around Spann, the groups around Anton Orel, Karl Lugmayer, Joseph Eberle and Ernst Karl Winter also count among the social romantics. In doing so, Spann rose with his direction in the interwar period &quot;to the decisive exponent of the socio-romantic world of ideas&quot;. Jonas Hagedorn (2016) emphasizes that Spann&#x27;s authoritarian-corporatist model of society is only one of a total of three variants of corporatism represented by political Catholicism. In sharp contrast to anti-democratic and centralist universalism were the variants of free corporatism, represented by the &quot;Catholic socialists&quot; in the social-democratic concept of &quot;economic democracy&quot; and by the &quot;solidarists&quot;.

=== Relationship to Fascism and Nazism ===
According to Reinhold Knoll (2005), Spann never identified himself as a fascist or Nazi. He had become the “central figure” of a “new Catholic”, “conservative right” in Germany and Austria. According to Knoll, Spann had the ambition to become the “ideologue of a &#x27;new Germany&#x27;” but was clearly inferior to his Nazi opponent Alfred Rosenberg.  Helmut Woll also sees Spann in contrast to German Nazism. Woll argues that Spann &quot;proclaimed a more than hundred-year-old Counter-Reformation through his universalism.&quot; According to Woll, Spann “essentially only aimed against atheistic individualism, not against Christianity”. Spann used the term &quot;universalism&quot; in the sense Aristotle understood: &quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; In contrast, according to Alfred Rosenberg, Nazism was directed against the individual in general and demanded the &quot;primacy of race&quot; - for the Nazis, &quot;race&quot; was the universal. &quot;Although Spann and Rosenberg used the term universalism,&quot; Woll states, &quot;they mean completely different things by it.&quot;

=== Influence in Austria ===
Jonas Hagedorn (2016) judges that Spann&#x27;s apprenticeship intellectually paved the way for the Austrian Dollfuss-Schuschnigg government.  Spann&#x27;s &quot;universalism&quot; was also able to have a certain influence on German political Catholicism. In particular, the Catholic Academic Association declared Spann&#x27;s teaching to be its doctrine.  According to Walter Euchner et al. (2000), Spann had &quot;considerable influence [sic!]&quot; on Catholicism in German-speaking countries.  Robert Kriechbaumer states in a similar way(2005) that Spann became “the eloquent and influential prophet of political neo-romanticism” in Austria’s First Republic, whose corporate-authoritarian, anti-liberal ideas influenced academic youth “to a considerable extent.” Stefan Breuer (1995) describes Spann as the &quot;leader of the Catholic Right&quot;.  ​​Emmerich Tálos (2013) attests Spann to have “theoretically underpinned the criticism of the parliamentary representative system and of the parties as well as the efforts made in connection with the economic crisis to find an authoritarian solution for mediating state and social interests.” &quot;Universalism&quot; has not been implemented in Austria in terms of realpolitik, but has &quot;contributed significantly&quot; to the content of the estate discussion. In this way, Spann had an indirect influence on the Home Guard and, via Ignaz Seipel, on the Christian Social Party.

From 1929, Spann was close to the Home Guard, especially the Styrian Homeland Security Service, with whose leader Walter Pfrimer he also appeared at events and whose publishing house published his essay &quot;Die Irrungen des Marxismus&quot;. Spann&#x27;s close associate Walter Heinrich became head of the federal organization of the Austrian Home Guard in 1930 and is considered the author of the Korneuburg Oath.  Hans Riehl (social scientist), another student of Spann, also served as propaganda director for the federal association. Heinrich founded the Comradeship Association for national and socio-political education (KB), through which Spann&#x27;s teachings decisively shaped the political movement of the Sudeten Germans before 1938. Its members were also known as the Spannkreis .

Spann, especially in his book &quot;The True State&quot;, developed the idea of an authoritarian and largely static organization of a corporate society directed against parliamentary democracy and the labor movement alike. The estates, which were conceived as compulsory professional organizations, were given extensive state sovereign rights and the workers were subject to the rule of the &quot;business leaders&quot;.  His positions mediated “between the intellectual tradition of socially conservative ideologies and the practice of fascist mass movements. … The conglomerate of clerico-romantic and German-nationalist ideologemes,” according to historian Willibald Holzer, “as it was based on Spann’s recourse to both romantic-clerical and national-imperialist traditions, is essential to Spann’s turn to Italian fascism, the German National Socialists, and all three Austrian fascisms favored and its integrative function within the Austrian right made possible in the first place.&quot; and closely tied to the traditions of political Catholicism from Seipel to Dollfuss.

In relation to his biography, the historian and ÖVP politician Geraldario regards Spann as an atypical representative of the Austrian intelligentsia in the 20th century: “He had resisted being taken over by the corporate state and the Nazi dictatorship, but despite the physical injuries he suffered in the concentration camp impairments – he was considered persona non grata in the Second Republic. This manifests an atypical career: Spann managed to be unpopular in three consecutive different phases of Austrian politics.&quot;

=== Influence in Slovakia ===
Spann&#x27;s corporative-authoritarian doctrine also exerted a &quot;great attraction&quot; on the clerical-nationalist party wing of the Ludak party in Slovakia. It was initially taken over by the radical Catholic circle of intellectuals around the magazine &quot;Nástup&quot; (“The Inauguration”) and then also represented by the later party leader Jozef Tiso.  The state ideology of the Slovak State, as formulated by party ideologist Štefan Polakovič in 1939 and 1941, was inspired to a significant extent by Spann&#x27;s teachings.

<doc id="362453" wikidata="Q1162123" url="?curid=362453" title="Swan River Colony">
<text>The Swan River Colony, also known as the Swan River Settlement, or just &quot;Swan River&quot;, was a British colony established in 1829 on the Swan River, in Western Australia. This initial settlement place on the Swan River was soon named Perth, and it became the capital city of Western Australia.

The name was a &quot;pars pro toto&quot; for Western Australia. On 6 February 1832, the colony was renamed the Colony of Western Australia, when the colony&#x27;s founding lieutenant-governor, Captain James Stirling, belatedly received his commission. However, the name &quot;Swan River Colony&quot; remained in informal use for many years.

==European exploration==

The first recorded Europeans to sight land where the city of Perth is now located were Dutch sailors. Most likely the first visitor to the Swan River area was Frederick de Houtman on 19 July 1619, travelling on the ships and . His records indicate he first reached the Western Australian coast at latitude 32°20&#x27;, which is approximately at Warnbro Sound. He did not land because of heavy surf, and so proceeded northwards without much investigation.

On 28 April 1656, en route to Batavia (now Jakarta) was shipwrecked north of the Swan River near Ledge Point. Of the 193 on board, only 75 made it to shore. A small boat that survived the wreckage then sailed to Batavia for help, but a subsequent search party found none of the survivors. The wreck was rediscovered in 1963.

In 1658, three Dutch Republic ships, also partially searching for &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot; visited the area. &quot;Waekende Boey&quot; under Captain S. Volckertszoon, &quot;Elburg&quot; under Captain J. Peereboom and &quot;Emeloort&quot; under Captain A. Joncke sighted Rottnest but did not proceed any closer to the mainland because of the many reefs. They then travelled north and subsequently found the wreck of &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot; (but still no survivors). They gave an unfavourable opinion of the area partly due to the dangerous reefs.

The Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh was the next European in the area. Commanding three ships, &quot;Geelvinck&quot;, &quot;Nijptangh&quot; and &quot;Weseltje&quot;, he arrived at and named Rottnest on 29 December 1696, and on 10 January 1697 visited and named the Swan River. His ships could not sail up the river because of a sand bar at its mouth, so he sent out a sloop which even then required some dragging over the sand bar. They sailed until reaching mud flats probably near Heirisson Island. They saw some Aboriginal people but were not able to meet any close up. Vlamingh was also not impressed with the area, and this was probably the reason for a lack of Dutch exploration from then on.

In 1801, the French ships &quot;Géographe&quot; captained by Nicolas Baudin and &quot;Naturaliste&quot; captained by Emmanuel Hamelin visited the area from the south. While &quot;Géographe&quot; continued northwards, &quot;Naturaliste&quot; remained for a few weeks. A small expedition dragged longboats over the sand bar and explored the Swan River. They also gave unfavourable descriptions regarding any potential settlement due to many mud flats upstream and the sand bar (the sand bar wasn&#x27;t removed until the 1890s when O&#x27;Connor built Fremantle harbour).

Later in March 1803, &quot;Géographe&quot;, with another ship &quot;Casuarina&quot;, passed by Rottnest on their way eventually back to France, but did not stop longer than a day or two.

The next visit to the area was the first Australian-born maritime explorer, Phillip Parker King in 1822 on &quot;Bathurst&quot;. King was also the son of former Governor Philip Gidley King of New South Wales. However, King also was not impressed with the area.

==Background to the settlement==

The founding father of Western Australia was Captain James Stirling who, in 1827, explored the Swan River area in which first anchored off Rottnest, and later in Cockburn Sound. He was accompanied by Charles Fraser, the New South Wales botanist.

Their initial exploration began on 8 March in a cutter and gig with parties continuing on foot from 13 March. In late March, moved to Sydney, arriving there on 15 April. Stirling arrived back in England in July 1828, promoting in glowing terms the agricultural potential of the area. His lobbying was for the establishment of a free settlementunlike penal colonies at New South Wales, Port Arthur and Norfolk Islandin the Swan River area with himself as its governor. As a result of these reports, and a rumour in London that the French were about to establish a penal colony in the western part of Australia, possibly at Shark Bay, the Colonial Office assented to the proposal in mid-October 1828.

In December 1828, a Secretary of State for Colonies despatch reserved land for the Crown, as well as for the clergy, and for education, and specified that water frontage was to be rationed. The most cursory exploration had preceded the British decision to found a settlement at the Swan River; the most makeshift arrangements were to govern its initial establishment and the granting of land; and the most sketchy surveys were to be made before the grants were actually occupied. A set of regulations were worked out for distributing land to settlers based on land grants. Negotiations for a privately run settlement were also started with a consortium of four gentlemen headed by Potter McQueen, a member of Parliament who had already acquired a large tract of land in New South Wales. The consortium withdrew after the Colonial Office refused to give it preference over independent settlers in selecting land, but one member, Thomas Peel, accepted the terms and proceeded alone. Peel was allocated , conditional on his arrival at the settlement before 1 November 1829 with 400 settlers. Peel arrived after this date with only 300 settlers, but was still granted .
==Events of the settlement==
The first ship to reach the Swan River was . After she anchored off Garden Island on 25 April 1829 and then in Cockburn Sound on 27 April, Captain Charles Fremantle declared the Swan River Colony for Britain on 2 May.

 arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 June carrying Stirling and his party, and arrived on 8 June carrying members of the 63rd Regiment and families. Three merchant ships arrived shortly after: &quot;Calista&quot; on 5 August, &quot;St Leonard&quot; on 6 August and on 23 August.

A series of accidents followed the arrivals which probably nearly caused the abandonment of the expedition. &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Sulphur&quot; both struck rocks while entering Cockburn Sound and were fortunate to escape with only minor damage. &quot;Parmelia&quot; however, under Stirling&#x27;s &quot;over confident pilotage&quot;, also ran aground, lost her rudder and damaged her keel, which necessitated extensive repairs. With winter now set in, the settlers were obliged to land on Garden Island. Bad weather and the required repairs meant that Stirling did not manage to reach the mainland until 18 June, and the remaining settlers on &quot;Parmelia&quot; finally arrived in early August. In early September a major disaster occurred: &quot;Marquis of Anglesea&quot; was driven ashore during a gale and wrecked beyond repair. The ship did not break up, as had been expected, but instead survived to become Western Australia&#x27;s first prison hulk.

The first reports of the new colony arrived back in England in late January 1830. They described the poor conditions and the starving state of the colonists, deemed the land totally unfit for agriculture, and reported (incorrectly) that the settlers had abandoned the colony. As a result of these reports, many people cancelled their migration plans or diverted to Cape Town in South Africa, or to the more well-established New South Wales colony.

Nevertheless, a few settlers arrived and additional stores were dispatched. By 1832 the population of the colony had reached about 1,500. Aboriginal people were not counted at that time, but in the south west have been estimated to number 15,000. The difficulty of clearing land to grow crops was so great that by 1850 the population of settlers had increased only to 5,886. This population had settled mainly around the southwestern coastline at Bunbury, Augusta and Albany.

Edward Gibbon Wakefield used the Swan River Colony to illustrate the importance of combined labour and the danger of a dispersed population. In his &quot;Letter from Sydney&quot;, published anonomously in 1829, and later in his &quot;England and America&quot;, published in 1833, Wakefield criticised the Swan River land grants for failing to encourage the development of a necessary class of wage-labourers. 

Karl Marx, in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, used Wakefield&#x27;s ideas and the Swan River Colony to illustrate a point about the necessity of a dependent workforce for capitalist production and colonisation.

<doc id="362454" wikidata="Q7178405" url="?curid=362454" title="Petite Riviere Bridge, Nova Scotia">
<text>Petite Rivière is a rural community on Route 331 in Lunenburg County on the South Shore of Nova Scotia in Canada. It was formerly known as Petite Rivière Bridge.

The Nova Scotia tourism office refers to route 331 as the Lighthouse Route, a scenic drive along Nova Scotia&#x27;s south shore, known not only for its lighthouses, but for its white sand beaches, historic settlements, and spectacular ocean views. Petite Rivière&#x27;s year-round population of about 200 swells during the summer when occupants of vacation houses, cottage renters, and campers arrive. There are no hotels or large restaurants here, but about fifteen minutes away in Bridgewater there are supermarkets, banks, a hospital, doctors, and other services.

The village of Petite Rivière lines both sides of the river which bears the same name. Early French settlers gave the river its name in contrast to the nearby much larger LaHave River. Samuel de Champlain arrived in the area in 1604 and mapped the offshore islands which are still sparsely settled despite their beauty and proximity to the mainland. Native Mi&#x27;kmaq had a summer encampment in Petite before the 17th Century, and they were followed by a few French Acadians whose community did not survive for long. Today a small burying ground contains the remains of both Acadians and natives.

When the English had control of Nova Scotia in the mid-eighteenth century, they brought in many Palatine Germans to settle the area around today&#x27;s Lunenburg. Some of these people and their descendants along with some English spread out to settle in adjacent areas such as Petite Rivière. The river provided access to the Atlantic Ocean. This access encouraged fishing and boat-building. By the nineteenth century tourists began flocking to Petite to enjoy its beaches and scenery

Today the center of the village is at the crossroad of Route 331 and Green Bay Road. Here the General Store supplies the everyday needs of residents and tourists and is the morning gathering place for coffee and conversation. Across the road is the local volunteer fire department which not only provides fire and emergency services but is a meeting hall for local groups and serves public breakfasts, suppers, and the occasional wedding reception. There are two other commercial buildings at this intersection as well as the Petite Villa, which before its renovation was the post office for Petite Rivière Bridge, Canada Post&#x27;s official name for the community. An elementary school occupies a large lot not too far away, and two churches serve the village.

From the village center route 331 leads across the river and curves along the shore past Risser&#x27;s Beach, a provincial campground which offers a long beach, a canteen, and a boardwalk above the marsh. The route continues to Crescent Beach on which cars are allowed for the convenience of sail boarders, paddle boarders, swimmers, and photographers. At the end of the beach a narrow bridge carries cars to the LaHave Islands where a museum welcomes visitors and displays a history of the islands.

In the other direction from the village center, Green Bay Road wanders along the western shore of the river until it reaches Green Bay on the ocean. Waterfront houses line Green Bay Road as it leaves the village center. At the intersection of the road with Drew&#x27;s Hill Road, a cluster of elegant Victorian houses attests to the local prosperity of that era. Further along are summer cottages of many types, a group of short-term rental cottages, another beach, and a canteen. Where the road ends for automobiles a remnant of an old road provides an oceanside pathway for hikers to walk all the way to the next village.

The Petite Rivière is itself the primary reason people have been attracted to this place for centuries. For the earliest native inhabitants the river provided fish and shellfish, fresh water, and a pleasant place to spend the summer. The French settlers found the same advantages, and the English and German settlers found it a good spot for sea-based enterprises. When tourists discovered the village, they found abundant Atlantic salmon in the river, white sand beaches for swimming, waters for canoes and rowboats, and oceanside scenery for viewing, photographing or painting.

Through the years, artists have flocked to Petite Rivière with their legacy being works of art demonstrating the village&#x27;s beauty. In the 1920s J.E.H. MacDonald came to Petite Rivière with Lewis Smith and his sister Edith Smith. All were artists, and MacDonald was one of the famous Canadian Group of Seven. Together they created paintings of Petite Rivière&#x27;s bridge, the ocean, United Church, and many other buildings. A 1990 exhibition at the Dalhousie Art Gallery in Halifax brought many of their paintings together for public view. (Dalhousie Art Gallery, 1990, ). Later in the twentieth century John Cook and Joan Dewar added to the list of professional artists working in Petite Rivière. Today there are many more artists working in the area and it is not unusual to see both amateur and professional artists in the village. Resident professional artists include Tom Alway and Peter Blais who own the Maritime Painted Saltbox gallery. Here they display their own fine art and folk art and arrange shows of the works of other area artists. River House features the work of rug hookers who produce their own form of art. Mariner Craft is a historic store that manufactures and sells a distinctive style of glass and other Canadian crafts.

It is located between Rissers Beach Provincial Park and the community of Green Bay. The local people commonly call the village simply &quot;Petite&quot;.

The bridge over the Petite Rivière was destroyed in 2002 and has been replaced by a single-lane &quot;temporary&quot; bailey bridge.

Petite Rivière Elementary School is located in the community and has approximately 90 pupils.

Samuel de Champlain is said to have given the river its name after landing at the location in the early 17th century.

<text>Panhala (Pronunciation: ) is a city and a Hill station Municipal Council (3177 feet above sea level) 18 km northwest of Kolhapur, in Kolhapur district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Panhala is the smallest city in Maharashtra and being a Municipal Council the city is developing rapidly. The city sprawls in the Panhala fort commands a panoramic view of the valley below. The main historical attraction here is the Panhala fort. There are many places of interest, each with its share of haunting anecdotes.

==History==

The history of Panhala is closely linked with the history of the Maratha empire, and with its founder, Chatrapati (King) Shivaji Raje. Panhala is the only fort where Shivaji spent more than 500 days, other than his childhood homes. It was Maratha State capital until 1782. In 1827 it became part of the British Empire.

This imposing fort, 20 km northwest of Kolhapur, is built on an outlying spur of the Sahyadris, rising more than 400 m above the plain, and is the largest of all the Deccan forts. The strategic importance of Panhala, guarding one of the principal routes through the Western Ghat, can be judged from its long and varied history. Built between 1178 and 1209, it first served as the headquarters of the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II, and subsequently passed into hands of the Yadavas. It was a favorite outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar; Mahmud Gawan, the powerful prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469. By the beginning of the 16th century Panhala was absorbed into the kingdom of Bijapur. The Adil Shahis were responsible for strengthening and rebuilding the ramparts and gateways. The fort was raided by Shivaji in 1659, but it was not until 1673 that he was able to occupy it permanently.

After Sambhaji&#x27;s death in 1689, it was captured by Aurangzeb. However, it was re-captured in 1692 by Kashi Ranganath Sarpotdar under the guidance of Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi. In 1701, Panhala was finally surrendered to Aurangzeb, and it was here that the Mughal Emperor received the English Ambassador, Sir William Norris. Within a few months, the fort was retaken by the Maratha forces under Pant Amatya Ramachandra. Tarabai who asserted her autonomy by founding an independent dynasty. In 1782, these rulers shifted their headquarters to Kolhapur. After a local rebellion in 1844, Panhala was taken by the British. More than 7 km of fortifications define the approximately triangular zone of Panhala fort. The walls are protected for long sections by steep escarpments, reinforced by a parapet with slit holes. The remaining sections have 5–9 m high ramparts, strengthened by round bastions. Unfortunately, the East Gate called Char Darawaja, through which the road passes on arrival at fort, was demolished by the British.

The fort has another satellite fort visible. It is said that there were wells full with Ghee to cure the soldiers. The well-known poet Moropant stayed here. Nearby are the Sambhaji temple, Someshwar temple, Teen Darwaza, and Raj Dindi, Sajja Kothi, Ambabai Temple, where Shivaji used to seek blessings before venturing on expeditions. Pavankhind, where Baji Prabhu Deshpande laid down his life to cover Shivaji&#x27;s escape.

=== Parashar caves ===

Panhala was traditionally considered the residence of Maharishi Parashara. The Karvir or Kolhapur Puran, a modern (1730) compilation, mentions Panhala as Pannagalay (home of serpents). In old inscriptions, the name appears as Pranlak and Padmanal. These are supposed to be the caves where the sage Parashar lived. Moropant, an 18th-century Marathi poet, wrote most of his work in these caves. Moropant&#x27;s birthplace is Panhala. These caves are mentioned in the Karvir Puraan as tirths (holy water).

<doc id="362464" wikidata="Q899140" url="?curid=362464" title="Genentech">
<text>Genentech, Inc. is an American biotechnology corporation headquartered in South San Francisco, California, wholly owned by the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company, the Roche Group. It became an independent subsidiary of Roche in 2009. Genentech Research and Early Development operates as an independent center within Roche. Historically, the company is regarded as the world&#x27;s first biotechnology company.

As of July 2021, Genentech employed 13,539 people.

==History==
The company was founded in 1976 by venture capitalist Robert A. Swanson and biochemist Herbert Boyer. Boyer is considered to be a pioneer in the field of recombinant DNA technology. In 1973, Boyer and his colleague Stanley Norman Cohen demonstrated that restriction enzymes could be used as &quot;scissors&quot; to cut DNA fragments of interest from one source, to be ligated into a similarly cut plasmid vector. While Cohen returned to the laboratory in academia, Swanson contacted Boyer to found the company. Boyer worked with Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura from the Beckman Research Institute, and the group became the first to successfully express a human gene in bacteria when they produced the hormone somatostatin in 1977. David Goeddel and Dennis Kleid were then added to the group, and contributed to its success with synthetic human insulin in 1978.

In 1990 F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG acquired a majority stake in Genentech.

In 2006 Genentech acquired Tanox in its first acquisition deal. Tanox had started developing Xolair and development was completed in collaboration with Novartis and Genentech; the acquisition allowed Genentech to keep more of the revenue.

In March 2009 Roche acquired Genentech by buying shares it didn&#x27;t already control for approximately $46.8 billion.

In July 2014, Genentech/Roche acquired Seragon for its pipeline of small-molecule cancer drug candidates for $725 million cash upfront, with an additional $1 billion of payments dependent on successful development of products in Seragon&#x27;s pipeline.

==Research==
Genentech is a pioneering research-driven biotechnology company that has continued to conduct R&amp;D internally as well as through collaborations.

Genentech&#x27;s research collaborations include:

* In 2008 Genentech entered into a collaboration with Roche and its subsidiary GlycArt to develop obinutuzumab.
* In February 2010 Genentech entered into a collaboration with University of California, San Francisco after having worked with them in about fifteen other collaborations, this time to collaborate on small molecule drug discovery in neurology.

==Facilities==

Genentech&#x27;s corporate headquarters are in South San Francisco, California (), with additional manufacturing facilities in Vacaville, California; Oceanside, California; and Hillsboro, Oregon. In March 2024, it was announced the Swiss pharmaceutical company, Lonza had acquired the Vacaville site from parent-company, Roche for $1.2 billion.

In December 2006, Genentech sold its Porriño, Spain, facility to Lonza and acquired an exclusive right to purchase Lonza&#x27;s mammalian cell culture manufacturing facility under construction in Singapore. In June 2007, Genentech began the construction and development of an &quot;E. coli&quot; manufacturing facility, also in Singapore, for the worldwide production of Lucentis (ranibizumab injection) bulk drug substance.

In 2023, the company announced plans to close down its manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, while expanding its manufacturing capabilities in Oceanside.

==Controversy==

===Disputes===
In November 1999, Genentech agreed to pay the University of California, San Francisco $200 million to settle a nine-year-old patent dispute. In 1990, UCSF sued Genentech for $400 million in compensation for alleged theft of technology developed at the university and covered by a 1982 patent. Genentech claimed that they developed Protropin (recombinant somatotropin/human growth hormone), independently of UCSF. A jury ruled that the university&#x27;s patent was valid in July 1999, but wasn&#x27;t able to decide whether Protropin was based upon UCSF research or not. Protropin, a drug used to treat dwarfism, was Genentech&#x27;s first marketed drug and its $2 billion in sales has contributed greatly to its position as an industry leader. The settlement was to be divided as follows: $30 million to the University of California General Fund, $85 million to the three inventors and two collaborating scientists, $50 million towards a new teaching and research campus for UCSF, and $35 million to support university-wide research.

In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Genentech&#x27;s talking points on health care reform appeared verbatim in the official statements of several Members of Congress during the national health care reform debate. Two U.S. Representatives, Joe Wilson and Blaine Luetkemeyer, both issued the same written statements: &quot;One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India.&quot; The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech.

<text>The Italy national football team () has represented Italy in men&#x27;s international football since its first match in 1910. The national team is controlled by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), the governing body for football in Italy, which is a co-founder and member of UEFA. Italy&#x27;s home matches are played at various stadiums throughout Italy, and its primary training ground and technical headquarters, Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, is located in Florence.

Italy is one of the most successful national teams in the history of football and the World Cup, having won four titles (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), appearing in two other finals (1970, 1994), and reaching also a third (1990) and a fourth (1978) place. Italy also won two European Championships (1968, 2020), and appeared in two other finals of the tournament (2000, 2012). Italy&#x27;s team also finished as runners-up in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 2022, and in third place at both the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 and at the UEFA Nations League in 2021 and 2023.

The team is known as &quot;gli Azzurri&quot; (the Blues), because Savoy blue is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional paint of the royal House of Savoy, which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy. In 1938, Italy became the first team to defend its World Cup title, and due to the outbreak of World War II, retained the title for a further twelve years. Italy had also previously won two Central European International Cups (1927–30, 1933–35). Between its first two World Cup victories, Italy won the Olympic football tournament (1936). After the majority of the team was killed in a plane crash in 1949, Italy obtained poor results in the 1950s, even failing to qualify for the 1958 World Cup. Failure to qualify for the World Cup did not happen again until the consecutive editions of 2018 and 2022. However, the team was unbeaten from October 2018 to October 2021, and holds the world record for most consecutive matches without defeat (37).

Italy has notable rivalries with other footballing nations, such as Brazil, France, Germany and Spain. In the FIFA World Rankings, in force since August 1993, Italy has occupied first place several times, in November 1993 and during 2007 (February, April–June, September), with its worst placement in August 2018 in 21st place.

==History==
===Origins and first two World Cup titles in 1934 and 1938===

An early attempt to create an Italian national team occurred on 30 April 1899, when an Italian selection played a Swiss eleven, losing 0–2 in Torino. The team&#x27;s first official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910. Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy&#x27;s first goal scored by Pietro Lana. The Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and consisted of: De Simoni; Varisco, Calì; Trerè, Fossati, Capello; Debernardi, Rizzi, Cevenini I, Lana, Boiocchi. The first captain of the team was Francesco Calì.

The first success in an official tournament came with the bronze medal in 1928 Summer Olympics, held in Amsterdam. After losing the semi-final against Uruguay, an 11–3 victory against Egypt secured third place in the competition. In the 1927–30 and 1933–35 Central European International Cup, Italy achieved first place out of five Central European teams, topping the group with 11 points in both editions of the tournament. Italy would also later win the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics with a 2–1 victory in extra time in the gold medal match over Austria on 15 August 1936.

After declining to participate in the inaugural World Cup (1930, in Uruguay) the Italy national team won two consecutive editions of the tournament in 1934 and 1938, under the direction of coach Vittorio Pozzo and the performance of Giuseppe Meazza, who is considered one of the best Italian football players of all time by some. Italy hosted the 1934 World Cup, and played their first ever World Cup match in a 7–1 win over the United States in Rome. Italy defeated Czechoslovakia 2–1 in extra time in the final in Rome, with goals by Raimundo Orsi and Angelo Schiavio to achieve their first World Cup title. They achieved their second title in 1938 in a 4–2 defeat of Hungary, with two goals by Gino Colaussi and two goals by Silvio Piola in the World Cup that followed. It is rumored that before the 1938 finals fascist Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini sent a telegram to the team, saying &quot;Vincere o morire!&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Win or die!&quot;). However, no record remains of such a telegram, and World Cup player Pietro Rava said when interviewed: &quot;No, no, no, that&#x27;s not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never &#x27;win or die&#x27;.&quot;

===Reconstruction in the 1950s and 1960s===

In 1949, 10 of the 11 players in the team&#x27;s initial line-up were killed in a plane crash that affected Torino, winners of the previous five Serie A titles. Italy did not advance further than the first round of the 1950 World Cup, as they were weakened severely due to the air disaster. The team had travelled by boat rather than by plane, fearing another accident.

In the World Cup finals of 1954 and 1962, Italy failed to progress past the first round, and did not qualify for the 1958 World Cup due to a 2–1 defeat to Northern Ireland in the last match of the qualifying round. Italy did not take part in the first edition of the European Championship in 1960 (then known as the European Nations Cup), and was knocked out by the Soviet Union in the first round of the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup qualifying.

Their participation in the 1966 World Cup was ended by a 0–1 defeat at the hands of North Korea. Despite being the tournament favourites, the &quot;Azzurri&quot;, whose 1966 squad included Gianni Rivera and Giacomo Bulgarelli, were eliminated in the first round by the semi-professional North Koreans. The Italian team was bitterly condemned upon their return home, while North Korean scorer Pak Doo-ik was celebrated as the David who killed Goliath. Upon Italy&#x27;s return home, furious fans threw fruit and rotten tomatoes at their transport bus at the airport.

===European champions and World Cup runners-up (1968–1974)===

In 1968, Italy hosted the European Championship and won the tournament in its first participation, beating Yugoslavia in Rome and winning their first major competition since the 1938 World Cup. The final ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time, and the rules of the time required the match to be replayed a few days later. This would be the only time the final of the European Championship or World Cup was replayed. On 10 June 1968, Italy won the replay 2–0 (with goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi) to take the trophy.

In the 1970 World Cup, exploiting the performances of European champions&#x27; players like Giacinto Facchetti, Gianni Rivera and Gigi Riva and with a new centre-forward Roberto Boninsegna, the team were able to come back to a World Cup final match after 32 years. They reached this result after one of the most famous matches in football history—the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;, the 1970 World Cup semifinal between Italy and West Germany that Italy won 4–3 in extra time, with five of the seven goals coming in extra time. They were later defeated by Brazil in the final 4–1.

After losing to Belgium in the quarter-finals to qualify for the 1972 European Championship, this generation&#x27;s cycle ended at the 1974 World Cup, where the team was eliminated in the group stage after a 2–1 loss against Poland in the last match of the group.

===Third World Cup title generation (1978–1986)===
Under the initial guide of Fulvio Bernardini and later that of head coach Enzo Bearzot, a new generation of Italian players came to the international stage in the second half of the 1970s. At the 1978 World Cup, Italy was the only team in the tournament to beat the eventual champions and host team Argentina, and the &quot;Azzurri&quot; made it to the third-place final, where they were defeated by Brazil 2–1. In the second round group stage match against the Netherlands, which prevented Italy from reaching the final, Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff was beaten by a long-distance shot from Arie Haan, and Zoff was criticized for the defeat. Italy hosted the 1980 European Championship, the first edition to be held between eight teams instead of four, automatically qualifying for the finals as hosts. After two draws with Spain and Belgium and a narrow 1–0 win over England, Italy were beaten by Czechoslovakia in the third-place match on penalties 9–8 after Fulvio Collovati missed his kick.


After a scandal in Serie A, where some National team players such as Paolo Rossi were prosecuted and suspended for match fixing and illegal betting, the &quot;Azzurri&quot; qualified for the second round of the 1982 World Cup after three uninspiring draws against Poland, Peru, and Cameroon. Having been loudly criticized, the Italian team decided on a press black-out from then on, with only coach Enzo Bearzot and captain Dino Zoff appointed to speak to the press. Italy&#x27;s regrouped in the second round group, a group of death with Argentina and Brazil. In the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina, with Italy&#x27;s goals, both left-footed strikes, were scored by Marco Tardelli and Antonio Cabrini. After Brazil defeated Argentina 3–1, Italy needed to win in order to advance to the semi-finals. Twice Italy went in the lead with Paolo Rossi&#x27;s goals, and twice Brazil came back. When Falcão scored to make it 2–2, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute Rossi scored the winning goal, for a hat-trick, in a crowded penalty area to send Italy to the semifinals after one of the greatest games in World Cup history. Italy then progressed to the semi-final where they defeated Poland with two goals from Rossi.

In the final on 11 July 1982, Italy met West Germany in Madrid. The first half ended scoreless, after Antonio Cabrini missed a penalty awarded for a Hans-Peter Briegel foul on Bruno Conti. In the second half Paolo Rossi again scored the first goal, and while the Germans were pushing forward in search of an equaliser, Marco Tardelli and substitute Alessandro Altobelli finalised two &quot;contropiede&quot; counterattacks to make it 3–0. Paul Breitner scored home West Germany&#x27;s consolation goal seven minutes from the end. Tardelli&#x27;s screaming celebration after his goal was one of the defining images of Italy&#x27;s 1982 World Cup triumph. Paolo Rossi won the Golden Boot with six goals as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament, and 40-year-old captain-goalkeeper Dino Zoff became the oldest player to win the World Cup.

Subsequently, Italy failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championship, and then entered as reigning champions in the 1986 World Cup, but were eliminated by reigning European Champions, France, in the round of 16.

===Vicini years and World Cup runners-up with Sacchi (1986–1994)===
In 1986, Azeglio Vicini was appointed as new head coach, replacing Bearzot. He granted a central role to players such as Walter Zenga and Gianluca Vialli, and conceded a chance to young players coming from the U21 team; Vialli scored goals that gave Italy a 1988 European Championship pass, and he was shown like Altobelli&#x27;s successor, having his same goal attitude. Both forwards stroke the target in Germany, where Soviet Union defeated the &quot;Azzurri&quot; in semi-finals.
Italy hosted the World Cup for the second time in 1990. The Italian attack featured talented forwards Salvatore Schillaci and a young Roberto Baggio. Italy played nearly all of their matches in Rome and did not concede a single goal in their first five matches; however, they lost the semi-final in Naples to defending champion Argentina. Argentinian player Maradona, who played for Napoli, made comments prior to the game pertaining to the North–South inequality in Italy and the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, asking Neapolitans to root for Argentina in the game. Italy lost 4–3 on penalty kicks following a 1–1 draw after extra time. Schillaci&#x27;s first-half opener was equalised in the second half by Claudio Caniggia&#x27;s header for Argentina. Aldo Serena missed the final penalty kick with Roberto Donadoni also having his penalty saved by goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. Italy went on to defeat England 2–1 in the third-place match in Bari, with Schillaci scoring the winning goal on a penalty to become the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with six goals.

After failing to qualify for the 1992 European Championship, Vicini was replaced by former AC Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi, who brought a new style of play. In November 1993, FIFA ranked Italy first in the for the first time since the ranking system was introduced in December 1992.

At the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Italy lost the opening match against Ireland 0–1 at Giants Stadium in New York City. After a 1–0 win against Norway in New York and a 1–1 draw with Mexico at the RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Italy advanced from Group E based on goals scored among the four teams tied on points. During their round of 16 match at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston, Italy was down 0–1 late against Nigeria, but Baggio rescued Italy with an equaliser in the 88th minute and a penalty in extra time to take the win. Baggio scored another late goal against Spain at their quarter-final match in Boston to seal a 2–1 win and two goals against Bulgaria in their semi-final match in New York for another 2–1 win. In the final, which took place in Los Angeles&#x27;s Rose Bowl stadium 2,700 miles (4,320 km) and three time zones away from the Northeastern United States where they had played all their previous matches, Italy, who had 24 hours less rest than Brazil, played 120 minutes of scoreless football, taking the match to a penalty shootout, the first time a World Cup final was settled in a penalty shootout. Italy lost the subsequent shootout 3–2 after Baggio, who had been playing with the aid of a pain-killer injection and a heavily bandaged hamstring, missed the final penalty kick of the match, shooting over the crossbar.

===Euro 2000 runners-up (1996–2000)===
The vice World champions, still led by Sacchi, qualified for Euro 1996 in England, but did not progress beyond the group stage. Having defeated Russia 2–1 and losing by the same score against the Czech Republic, Italy required a victory in their final group match against Germany to progress to the quarter-finals. However, Gianfranco Zola failed to convert a decisive penalty in a 0–0 draw against the Germans, who eventually won the tournament.

Relegated to second place behind England in the qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup, Italy booked a place at the final tournament after defeating Russia in a play-off, with Pierluigi Casiraghi scoring the winning goal in a 2–1 aggregate victory on 15 November 1997. After finishing first in their group and overcoming Norway in the second round, Italy faced a penalty shoot-out in the quarterfinals, for the third World Cup in a row. The Italian side, where Alessandro Del Piero and Baggio renewed the controversial &quot;staffetta&quot; () between Mazzola and Rivera from 1970, held the eventual World Champions and host team, France, to a 0–0 draw after extra time, but lost 4–3 in the shoot-out. With two goals scored in this tournament, Baggio remains the only Italian player to have scored in three different FIFA World Cup editions.

 Two years later, at the Euro 2000, with four consecutive victories the team led by former captain Dino Zoff made it all the way to the semifinals, facing another penalty shoot-out but emerging victorious over the co-hosts, the Netherlands. Italian goalkeeper Francesco Toldo saved one penalty during the match and two in the shootout, while striker Francesco Totti scored his penalty with a &quot;cucchiaio&quot; () chip. Italy finished the tournament as runners-up, losing the final 2–1 against France (to a golden goal in extra time) after conceding an equalising goal just 30 seconds before the expected end of injury time. After the defeat, coach Dino Zoff resigned in protest after being criticized by AC Milan club president and politician Silvio Berlusconi.

===Trapattoni years (2000–2004)===
Giovanni Trapattoni took charge of the team in July 2000 following the resignation of Dino Zoff. Playing in Group 8 of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification process, Italy finished undefeated after facing Romania, Georgia, Hungary and Lithuania. In the final tournament, a 2–0 victory against Ecuador with a double from Christian Vieri was followed by a series of controversial matches. During the match against Croatia, English referee Graham Poll incorrectly disallowed two regular goals resulting in a 2–1 defeat to Italy. Despite two goals being ruled for offsides, a late headed goal from Alessandro Del Piero helped Italy to a 1–1 draw with Mexico, proving enough to advance to the knockout stages.

Co-host country South Korea eliminated Italy in the round of 16 by a score of 2–1. The match proved controversial with members of the Italian team, most notably striker Francesco Totti and coach Giovanni Trapattoni, suggesting a conspiracy to eliminate Italy from the competition. Trapattoni even obliquely accused FIFA of ordering the official to ensure a Korean victory so that one of the two host nations would remain in the tournament. The most contentious decisions by the game referee Byron Moreno were an early penalty awarded to South Korea (saved by Buffon), a golden goal by Damiano Tommasi incorrectly ruled offside, and the sending off of Totti after being presented with a second yellow card for an alleged dive in the penalty area. FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that the linesmen had been a &quot;disaster&quot; and admitted that Italy suffered from bad offside calls during the group matches, but he denied conspiracy allegations. While questioning Totti&#x27;s sending off by Moreno, Blatter refused to blame Italy&#x27;s loss entirely on the referees, stating: &quot;Italy&#x27;s elimination is not only down to referees and linesmen who made human not premeditated errors. Italy made mistakes both in defense and in attack.&quot;

Trapattoni stayed on and guided the team at Euro 2004 in Portugal, where after draws against Denmark and Sweden along with a victory over Bulgaria in Group C, Italy were eliminated following a three-way five point tie based on the number of goals scored in matches among the tied teams. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and then Italian football federation president Franco Carraro accused the Swedish and Danish teams of fixing the result of their final match (2-2 was the result which consented both teams to advance). Despite calls, then-UEFA spokesperson Robert Faulkner said the organization would not investigate the result.

===2006 World Cup victory===

The Italian Football Federation replaced Trapattoni with Marcello Lippi. With controversy plaguing the domestic league, Italy entered the 2006 World Cup as one of the eight seeded teams. Italy finished first in Group E with wins against Ghana and the Czech Republic and a draw with the United States. In the round of 16, Italy secured a 1–0 victory over Australia with Francesco Totti scoring a penalty. Italy overcame Ukraine, 3–0, after taking an early lead through Gianluca Zambrotta and additional goals coming from Luca Toni. In the semi-finals, Italy beat hosts Germany 2–0 with goals Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero in the last minutes of extra time.

On 9 July 2006, the &quot;Azzurri&quot; won their fourth World Cup title after defeating France in the final. French captain Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the seventh minute before Marco Materazzi scored from a corner kick, twelve minutes later. The score remained level and during extra-time and Zidane was sent off for headbutting Materazzi. Italy went on to win the penalty shootout 5–3, with all Italian players scoring their kicks. The decisive penalty goal was scored by Grosso.

FIFA named seven Italian players — Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluca Zambrotta, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso, Francesco Totti and Luca Toni — to the 23-man tournament All Star Team. Buffon also won the Lev Yashin Award, given to the best goalkeeper of the tournament; he conceded only two goals in the tournament&#x27;s seven matches, the first an own goal by Zaccardo and the second from Zidane&#x27;s penalty kick in the final, and remained unbeaten for 460 consecutive minutes. In honour of Italy winning a fourth World Cup, members of the squad were awarded the Italian Order of Merit of &quot;Cavaliere&quot;.

===The decline of the World champions===
Marcello Lippi, who had announced his resignation three days after the World Cup triumph, was replaced by Roberto Donadoni. Italy qualified from their Euro 2008 qualifying group ahead of France. On 14 February 2007, Italy climbed to first in the FIFA World Rankings for the second time. At Euro 2008, the &quot;Azzurri&quot; lost 3–0 to the Netherlands in the opening match of the group stage. The following game against Romania ended 1–1 thanks to a penalty save from Gianluigi Buffon. Italy would win their final group game against France 2–0, a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final. The &quot;Azzurri&quot; were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties to eventual champions Spain. Within a week of the game, Roberto Donadoni&#x27;s contract was terminated and Marcello Lippi was rehired as coach.

Italy qualified for their first ever FIFA Confederations Cup held in South Africa in June 2009 by virtue of winning the 2006 World Cup. They won their opening match of the tournament against the United States, but subsequent defeats to Egypt and Brazil meant that they finished third in the group on goals scored (points level with the US and Egypt), and were eliminated.

At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, reigning champions Italy were unexpectedly eliminated in the first round, finishing last place in their group. After being held to 1–1 draws with Paraguay and New Zealand, they suffered a 3–2 loss to Slovakia. It was the first time Italy failed to win a single game at a World Cup tournament, and in doing so became only the third nation to be eliminated in the first round while being reigning World Cup champions.

===Euro 2012 runners-up and fluctuating results (2010–2016)===
Marcello Lippi stepped down after Italy&#x27;s World Cup campaign and was replaced by Cesare Prandelli, although Lippi&#x27;s successor had already been announced before the tournament.

At UEFA Euro 2012, Italy finished second in their group behind Spain, which earned them a quarter-final tie against England. After a mostly one-sided affair in which Italy failed to take their chances, they managed to beat England on penalties. In the semi-final against Germany, two first-half goals by Mario Balotelli saw the Italians through to the final. In the final, Italy fell to a 4–0 defeat to Spain.

During the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, Italy reached the semi-finals, losing 7–6 on penalties to Spain. Italy did manage to beat Uruguay in the third place play-off. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Italy defeated England 2–1 in their first match before succumbing to underdogs Costa Rica 1–0 in the second group stage match. In Italy&#x27;s last group match, they were knocked out by Uruguay 1–0, in a controversial match, where Italian player Claudio Marchisio was controversially sent off whilst Uruguay&#x27;s Luis Suarez bit Italy&#x27;s Giorgio Chiellini without any sanction. Shortly after this loss, coach Cesare Prandelli resigned.

Former Juventus manager Antonio Conte was selected to replace Prandelli. On 10 October 2015, Italy qualified for Euro 2016, courtesy of a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan; the result meant that Italy had gone 50 games unbeaten in European qualifiers. On 4 April 2016, it was announced that Antonio Conte would step down as Italy coach after Euro 2016 to become head coach of Chelsea. The 23-man squad was initially criticised by many fans and members of the media for its lack of quality, which saw notable absences, such as Andrea Pirlo and Sebastian Giovinco being controversially left out. Italy opened Euro 2016 with a 2–0 victory over Belgium and qualified thanks to a win against Sweden in the second match, which made their defeat 1–0 to Ireland in the final group stage match irrelevant for access to the round of 16. Italy subsequently defeated reigning European champions Spain 2–0 in the round of 16. However, Italy were defeated by reigning world champions Germany, in the quarter-finals on penalties, after a 1–1 draw.

===Failure to qualify for 2018 World Cup===
After Conte&#x27;s planned departure following Euro 2016, Gian Piero Ventura took over as manager for the team. During qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Italy finished second in Group G, five points behind Spain. Italy would compete in the play-off round against Sweden, where they lost 1–0 on aggregate and therefore eliminated; the first time that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1958. Following the match, veterans Andrea Barzagli, Daniele De Rossi and captain Gianluigi Buffon all declared their retirement from the national team. On 15 November 2017, Ventura was dismissed as head coach, and on 20 November 2017, Carlo Tavecchio resigned as president of the Italian Football Federation. Luigi Di Biagio was called as caretaker manager and led the team in subsequent friendlies in March 2018, including the last of Buffon&#x27;s 176 appearances on 23 March in a friendly against Argentina.

===Mancini era (2018–2023)===

====Resurgence and second European title====
On 14 May 2018, Roberto Mancini was announced as the new manager. On 16 August 2018, in the FIFA World Ranking that followed the 2018 World Cup, Italy dropped to their lowest ever ranking of 21st. On 18 November 2019, Italy finished the Euro 2020 qualifying with ten wins in all ten matches, becoming only the sixth national side to qualify for a European Championship with a perfect record. On 17 March 2020, UEFA confirmed that Euro 2020 would be postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the delayed Euro 2020, Italy finished top of Group A, ahead of Turkey, Switzerland, and Wales. Being one of the host nations, Italy played all three group games at Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico, and it became the first team in European Championship history to win each group stage match without conceding. In the round of 16, Italy defeated Austria 2–1 at Wembley Stadium after extra time. In the quarter-finals, Italy secured a 2–1 victory over Belgium, before beating Spain on penalties in the semi-finals.

In the final, on 11 July 2021, Italy won the European Championship defeating hosts England at Wembley Stadium on penalties after a 1–1 draw, for their second European title and their first since 1968. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma also won the &quot;Player of the Tournament&quot; award, given to the best player of the tournament. On 16 July, all members of the European Championship-winning squad were awarded the Italian Order of Merit of &quot;Cavaliere&quot;.

====Failure to qualify for 2022 World Cup====
In October 2021, Italy participated in the UEFA Nations League Finals as hosts, and lost the semi-final against Spain, 2–1 at the San Siro. This match meant the end of the record 37 game unbeaten run and the first defeat for Italy in more than three years. Four days later, Italy won the third-place play-off, 2–1 against Belgium. On 15 November, Italy drew 0–0 with Northern Ireland in their final 2022 World Cup qualifying Group C match and finished in second place, two points behind Switzerland. On 24 March 2022, Italy lost 1–0 in the semi-final of the play-offs against North Macedonia which was their first ever world Cup qualifying defeat at home, therefore, failing to qualify for the World Cup for a second consecutive time. On 1 June, Italy took part in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions match, rebranded as the 2022 Finalissima, losing 3–0 against defending Copa América champion Argentina.

On 26 September 2022, Italy qualified for the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals after beating Hungary 2–0 in Budapest. On 15 June 2023, Italy played the semi-final against Spain, losing 2–1. Three days later, Italy won the third-place final 3–2 against the Netherlands. Mancini&#x27;s stay on Italy&#x27;s bench ended two months later following his resignation.

===Spalletti years (2023–present)===
Luciano Spalletti was chosen as the new coach, and as of September 2023 he led the team in the last six games of Euro 2024 qualifying, managing to achieve direct qualification to the European Championship. Italy were eliminated from the tournament in the round of 16 following a 2–0 loss to Switzerland.

==Rivalries==
* Italy vs. Brazil: matches between the nations are known as the World Derby (Portuguese: &quot;Clássico Mundial&quot;). The most successful football nations in the world, they have achieved nine World Cups between one another. Since their first match at the 1938 World Cup, they have played against each other a total of five times in the World Cup, most notably in the 1970 World Cup Final and the 1994 World Cup final in which Brazil won 4–1 and 3–2 on penalties after a goalless draw respectively.
* Italy vs. France: matches between the two nations officially began on 15 May 1910, Italy&#x27;s first recorded match ending in a 6–2 victory. Notable matches in the World Cup and the European Football Championship include the 2006 World Cup Final, when the Italians defeated the French 5–3 in the penalty shoot-out, after a 1–1 draw, and the 2000 European Championship, won by France with an extra-time golden goal by David Trezeguet.
* Italy vs. Germany: matches between the two nations have cumulated in five matches in the World Cup, notably in the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;, the 1970 World Cup semifinal between the two countries that Italy won 4–3 in extra time, with five of the seven goals coming in extra time. Germany has also won three European Championships while Italy has won it twice. The two countries have faced each other four times in the European championship, with three draws (one German penalty shoot-out victory) and one Italian victory. Germany had never defeated Italy in a major tournament match until their victory in the Euro 2016 quarterfinals, on penalties (though statistically considered a draw), with all Germany&#x27;s other wins over Italy being in friendly competitions.
* Italy vs. Spain: this is a less heated and less heartfelt rivalry for the Italians, especially when compared to those with Germany and France. Matches between Italy and Spain are known as the Mediterranean Derby (Spanish: &quot;Rivalidad futbolística Italia-España)&quot;, named after the Mediterranean Sea that separates the two nations. Matches between them have been contested since 1920, and although they are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of their representative clubs in UEFA competitions. Since the quarterfinal match between them at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match being the UEFA Euro 2012 final, which Spain won 4–0.

===Kits and crest===

The first shirt worn by the Italy national team, in its debut against France on 15 May 1910, was white. The choice of colour was due to the fact that a decision about the appearance of the kit had not yet been made, so it was decided not to have a colour, which was why white was chosen. After two games, for a friendly against Hungary in Milan on 6 January 1911, the white shirt was replaced by a blue jersey (specifically Savoy azure)—blue being the border colour of the royal House of Savoy crest used on the flag of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946); the shirt was accompanied by white shorts and black socks (which later became blue). The team later became known as &quot;gli Azzurri&quot; (the Blues).

In the 1930s, Italy wore a black kit, ordered by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. The black kit debuted on 17 February 1935 in a friendly against France at the Stadio Nazionale PNF in Rome. A blue shirt, white shorts and black socks were worn at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin the following year. At the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France, the all-black kit was worn once in the match against France.

After World War II, the fascist regime fell and the monarchy was abolished in 1946. The same year saw the birth of the Italian Republic, and the blue-and-white kit was reinstated. The cross of the former Royal House of Savoy was removed from the flag of Italy, and consequently from the national team&#x27;s badge, now consisting solely of the &quot;Tricolore&quot;. For the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the country&#x27;s name in Italian, &quot;ITALIA&quot;, was placed above the tricolour shield, and for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, &quot;FIGC&quot;, the abbreviation of the Italian Football Federation, was incorporated into the badge.

In 1983, to celebrate the victory at the World Cup of the previous year, three gold stars replaced &quot;ITALIA&quot; above the tricolour, representing their three World Cup victories until that point. In 1984, a round emblem was launched, featuring the three stars, the inscriptions &quot;ITALIA&quot; and &quot;FIGC&quot;, and the tricolour.

The first known kit manufacturer was Adidas in 1974. From 2003 to 2022, the kit was made by Puma. Since the 2000s, an all-blue uniform including blue shorts has occasionally been used, particularity in international tournaments. After Italy&#x27;s 2006 World Cup victory, a fourth star was added to the tricolour badge. In March 2022, after almost 20 years with Puma, it was announced that Adidas will be Italy&#x27;s kit manufacturer from 2023 as part of a four-year deal.

==Coaching staff==
During the earliest days of Italian nation football, it was common for a Technical Commission to be appointed. The Commission took the role that a standard coach would currently play. Ever since 1967, the national team has been controlled only by the coach. For this reason, the coach of the Italy national team is still called &quot;Technical Commissioner&quot; (&quot;&quot;) or &quot;CT.&quot; The use of this title has since then expanded into other team sports in Italy.

<text>The Gavin Crawford Show is a Canadian sketch comedy series, which aired from June 19, 2000, to July 1, 2003, on The Comedy Network. Following the first season in 2000, production on &quot;The Gavin Crawford Show&quot; was temporarily interrupted by Crawford&#x27;s participation in the short-lived American sketch comedy series &quot;Hype&quot;, but resumed when Crawford returned to Canada after &quot;Hype&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, having two further seasons and producing 26 episodes altogether.

The show starred comedian Gavin Crawford, along with an ensemble cast of supporting performers including Tracy Dawson, Marypat Farrell, Cathy Gordon-Marsh, Jennifer Irwin, Griffin Malcolm, Doug Morency, Christen Nelson, Lisa Brooke and Panou. Many of its cast members had previously worked together as part of The Second City&#x27;s Toronto cast in 1998.

In addition to Crawford, the show&#x27;s writers included Kyle Tingley, Jennifer Whalen, Cathy Gordon and Alex Pugsley.

Characters included Ron and Ocean Breeze, a New Age folk music duo who expressed their marital disputes in song; Red Ronnie Rocker, an aspiring rock star; Hugey McBalls, a porn star and author of the self-help book &quot;Acting for the Adult Camera&quot;; nerdy teenager Mark Jackson; and male feminist motivational speaker Len Henderson.

Following its run, Crawford and his character Mark Jackson moved on to &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; in 2003. Crawford subsequently also developed &quot;Gavin Crawford&#x27;s Wild West&quot; for CBC Television, although the series was not picked up and only its pilot aired as a one-off comedy special.

<doc id="362470" wikidata="Q7154086" url="?curid=362470" title="Paul Truong">
<text>Paul Truong (born June 2, 1965) is an American and Cambodian chess player, trainer, and organizer. He was born Trương Hoài Nhân in Saigon, South Vietnam. Truong holds the USCF title of National Master and the FIDE title of FIDE Master.

He is married to former Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion Susan Polgár. He is also Polgár&#x27;s business manager, and vice-president of the Susan Polgar Foundation. He organized and/or promoted most of the events in which Polgár has been involved since she relocated to the United States. In 2007, Truong become the director of marketing and PR of the Susan Polgar Institute for Chess Excellence (SPICE) and coach and chief strategist of the Texas Tech University chess team, with Polgár as the executive director of SPICE and head coach. The SPICE Program relocated to Webster University in 2012. Truong has served as the coach and chief strategist of the Webster University chess team and director of marketing for the SPICE Program since then.

In 2004, Truong was the captain and business manager of the U.S. women&#x27;s team for the 36th Chess Olympiad,[6] which won a silver medal.[7] While Truong served as coach and chief strategist, the Texas Tech University chess team was U.S. National Collegiate Champion in 2011 and 2012 and the Webster University team won in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The Webster University chess team also won (or tied for first) in the Pan American Intercollegiate Championships every year from 2012 to 2018.[8]

Truong played for the &quot;Collins Kids&quot; founded by John W. Collins. He was on the team that went to Iceland in 1980. He also played when the U.S. hosted Iceland in a return match in New York City in 1981. In 2001, he won the U.S. Open Blitz Championship in Framingham, Massachusetts, ahead of Hikaru Nakamura.

==Early life==

Truong&#x27;s father, Tien, was a South Vietnamese official working at the U.S. embassy in Saigon during the Vietnam War. Truong learned the rules of chess along with his father at the age of five and played at the National Sports Center (CSS) in Saigon, a center for chess in the country. From an early age, he won the CSS&#x27;s annual tournaments, which were informally recognized as the National Championships of South Vietnam. In all, he claims to have won the annual under-21 event four times, starting when he was five years old, and the annual adult event five times, starting when he was eight. Truong has been inactive as a competitive chess player since 1986.

==Chess journalist and photographer==

Truong is editor-in-chief of &quot;Chess Daily News &amp; Information&quot;.

Truong has collaborated with Polgár on most of her books and videos, and he has co-authored with her numerous chess columns and articles. In 2003, Polgár and Truong won the Cramer Award for Best Chess Column and three Chess Journalist of America Awards for Best Magazine Column, Best Endgame Analysis Column, and Best Chess Promotion column. They also won the 2004 Chess Journalist of America Award for the best endgame column in &quot;Chess Horizons&quot;.

Following is a list of books that Truong has co-authored:
* &quot;Alpha Teach Yourself Chess in 24 Hours&quot; by Susan Polgár, Paul Truong and Leslie Horvitz (2003); 
* &quot;A World Champion&#x27;s Guide to Chess&quot; by Susan Polgár and Paul Truong (2005); 
* &quot;Breaking Through: How the Polgar Sisters Changed the Game of Chess&quot; by Susan Polgár and Paul Truong (2005); 
* &quot;Chess Tactics for Champions&quot; by Susan Polgár and Paul Truong (2006); 

Truong is a prolific photographer who has taken as many as 30,000 pictures per year at chess-related events in several countries. He posts his digital files in the public domain, usually on the day they are taken, for use free of charge by news outlets and blogs. Truong&#x27;s photos have appeared on multiple book and magazine covers.

==USCF election and resignation==

In 2007, Truong ran for the USCF Executive Board and won, along with his wife, Susan. Sam Sloan, one of the defeated candidates, filed suit to overturn the election results. During the ensuing litigation, four members of the board asked Truong to step down from his position on the Board for &quot;neglecting his fiduciary duties&quot;. The lawsuits eventually were all dismissed or settled, and Truong severed his affiliation with the USCF, with none of the parties admitting to any wrongdoing.

<text>Zygmunt Janiszewski (12 July 1888 – 3 January 1920) was a Polish mathematician.

==Early life and education==
He was born to mother Julia Szulc-Chojnicka and father, Czeslaw Janiszewski who was a graduate of the University of Warsaw and served as the director of the Société du Crédit Municipal in Warsaw.

Janiszewski left Poland to study mathematics in Zürich, Munich and Göttingen, where he was taught by some of the most prominent mathematicians of the time, such as Heinrich Burkhardt, David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski and Ernst Zermelo. He then went to Paris and in 1911 received his doctorate in topology under the supervision of Henri Lebesgue. His thesis was titled &quot;Sur les continus irréductibles entre deux points (On the Irreducible Continuous Curves Between Two Points)&quot;. In 1913, he published a seminal work in the field of topology of surface entitled &quot;On Cutting the Plane by Continua&quot;.

== Career ==
Janiszewski taught at the University of Lwów and was professor at the University of Warsaw. At the outbreak of World War I he was a soldier in the Polish Legions of Józef Piłsudski, and took part in operations around Volyn. Along with other officers, he refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Austrian government. He subsequently left the Legions and went into hiding under an assumed identity, Zygmunt Wicherkiewicz, in Boiska, near Zwoleń. From Boiska he moved on to Ewin, near Włoszczowa, where he directed a shelter for homeless children.
In 1917 he published an article &quot;O potrzebach matematyki w Polsce&quot; (&quot;On the Needs of Mathematics in Poland&quot;) in the journal &quot;Nauka Polska&quot; (&quot;Polish Learning&quot;), thus initiating the Polish School of Mathematics. He also founded the journal &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;. Janiszewski proposed the journal&#x27;s name in 1919, but the first issue was published only after his death in 1920.

Janiszewski devoted the family property that he had inherited from his father to charity and education. He also donated all the prize money that he received from mathematical awards and competitions to the education and development of young Polish students.

== Death ==
Janiszewski was engaged to Janina Kelles-Krauz, daughter of Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz. The wedding date had been set, but he died before they could marry. His life was cut short by the influenza pandemic of 1918–19, at Lwów, on 3 January 1920, at age 31. He willed his body for medical research, and his cranium for craniological study, desiring to be &quot;useful after his death&quot;.

Samuel Dickstein wrote a commemorative address after Janiszewski&#x27;s death, honoring his humility, kindness and dedication to his work:

While Janiszewski is best remembered for his many contributions to topological mathematics in the early 20th century, for the founding of &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, and for his enthusiasm for teaching young minds, his loyalty to his homeland during World War I perhaps gives the greatest insight into his psyche. The orphans&#x27; shelter that he set up during the war doubtless saved many lives and was perhaps his greatest contribution to the world.

On 3 January 2020, the 100th anniversary of his death, a researcher from Australia traveled to Lviv and met with the director of Lychakiv Cemetery. Restoration of the grave was arranged, and the stone was restored. Janiszewski is buried in field 58, plot 82 of Lychakiv Cemetery.

<doc id="362472" wikidata="Q837855" url="?curid=362472" title="Qi (state)">
<text>Qi, or Ch&#x27;i in Wade–Giles romanization, was a regional state of the Zhou dynasty in ancient China, whose rulers held titles of &quot;Hou&quot; (), then &quot;Gong&quot;（公）, before declaring themselves independent Kings （王）. Its capital was Linzi, located in present-day Shandong. Qi was founded shortly after the Zhou conquest of Shang, . Its first monarch was Jiang Ziya (Lord Tai; 1046–1015 BCE ), minister of King Wen and a legendary figure in Chinese culture. His family ruled Qi for several centuries before it was replaced by the Tian family in 386BCE. Qi was the final surviving state to be annexed by Qin during its unification of China.

==History==

===Foundation===

During the Zhou conquest of Shang, Jiang Ziya, a native of Ju County served as the chief minister to King Wu, the same position he had held in service to King Wu&#x27;s father. Following the Zhou victory, the lands comprising much of the Shandong peninsula and some nearby surrounds were established as the state of Qi, with Jiang charged with ruling and defending them. After King Wu&#x27;s death, Ziya remained loyal to the Duke of Zhou&#x27;s regency during the Three Guards&#x27; failed rebellion. The Shang prince Wu Geng had joined the revolt along with the Dongyi polities of , Xu, and Pugu, located within the boundaries of Qi. These were suppressed by 1039BCE, but the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; suggest that the native people of Pugu continued to revolt for about another decade before being destroyed a second time .

Transmitted documents from the Western Zhou period are scant, but it is known that King Yi of Zhou (865–858 BCE) attacked Qi and boiled Duke Ai to death. During the time of King Xuan of Zhou ( 827–782), there was a local succession struggle. Throughout this period, many of the native Dongyi peoples were absorbed into the Zhou cultural sphere.

===Spring and Autumn period===

The succession crisis following the violent death of King You of Zhou led to a dramatic and unrecoverable loss of political and military authority in the Zhou royal court. Under this new geopolitical situation, Qi rose to prominence under Duke Huan of Qi ( 685–643BCE ). He and his minister Guan Zhong strengthened the state by consolidating power in the hands of the central government at the expense of the landed aristocracy, establishing a system of counties () ruled directly by ministers of the state court. Qi annexed 35 neighboring polities – including Tan – and brought others into submission. Guan Zhong&#x27;s administrative reforms also included state monopolies on salt and iron, and in general were characteristic of the later political philosophy of Legalism.

In 667BCE, the lords of Qi, Lu, Song, Chen, and Zheng assembled in one of the first great interstate conferences, and Duke Huan was elected as their leader. Subsequently, King Hui of Zhou pronounced him &quot;Bà&quot; (), the &quot;hegemon-protector&quot; sworn to protect the royal house of Zhou and uphold the authority of the Son of Heaven (the Zhou king). The first of five such hegemons, he earned a tribute from the other states, and had the honour of paying the royal court a larger tribute than anyone else. His calls to arms were as binding as the king&#x27;s own. Using this authority, during the first eleven years of his hegemony, Duke Huan intervened in a power struggle in Lu; protected Yan from encroaching Western Rong nomads; drove off Northern Di nomads after their invasions of Wey and Xing, providing the people with provisions and protective garrison units; and led an alliance of eight states to conquer Cai and thereby block the northward expansion of Chu.

After Duke Huan&#x27;s death, a war of succession between rival claimants greatly weakened Qi and ending its reign of hegemony. In 632BCE, Qi helped Jin defeat Chu at the Battle of Chengpu, only to be defeated by Jin itself at the Battle of An in 589. In 579, the four great powers of Qin, Jin, Chu, and Qi met to declare a truce and limit their military strength.

===Warring States period – Tian Qi===

Early in the period, Qi annexed a number of smaller states. Qi was one of the first states to patronize scholars. In 532BCE, the Tian clan destroyed several rival families and came to dominate the state. In 485, the Tian clan killed the heir to the house of Jiang and fought several rival clans. Four years later, the Tian chief killed a puppet ruler, most of his family, and a number of rival chiefs. He took control of most of the state and left the monarch with only the capital of Linzi and the area around Mount Tai. In 386, the house of Tian fully replaced the house of Jiang as rulers of Qi. The Warring States period ended with the Qin conquest of Qi, which was the last to fall, in 222. So ended Qi, and the era of Imperial China began.

==Culture of Qi==
Before Qin unified China, each state&#x27;s customs, culture, dialects, and orthography had pronounced differences. According to the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; or &quot;Tribute of Yu&quot;, composed in the fourth or fifth century BCE and included in the &quot;Classic of Documents&quot;, there were nine distinct cultural regions of China, which are described in detail. The work focuses on the travels of the titular sage, Yu the Great, throughout each of the regions.

Other texts also discussed these cultural variations. One of these texts was &quot;The Book of Master Wu&quot;, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain of the environment in which they inhabited. Of Qi, he said:

While visiting Qi, Confucius was deeply impressed with perfection of performance of Shao music () therein.

During the Warring States period, Qi was famous for Linzi&#x27;s Jixia Academy, where renowned scholars of the era from all over China would visit. Modern scholarship understands the Jixia Academy not to be a physical institution, but an informal collaboration of sponsored scholars engaged in intellectual work. One impressive surviving achievement of the Jixia school of thought is the &quot;Yanzi Chunqiu&quot;.

==Qi architecture==

The state of Qi was known for having well organized cities that were nearly rectangular in shape, with roads that were neatly knit into a grid-like pattern. The palace was strategically positioned facing the south. To the left (eastwardly direction) of the palace resided the ancestral temple, to its right (westward) the temple of the gods, both one hundred paces away. This ensured that balance was achieved. In front of the palace was the court also one hundred paces away and to the back of the palace was the city. This type of layout influenced greatly the way cities were designed in subsequent generations.

Smaller estates known as &quot;chengyi&quot; () were abundant throughout Qi. They typically stretched 450 meters from south to north and 395 meters from east to west. The perimeter was usually surrounded by a wall with the living headquarters situated within and a nearly perfect square-shaped courtyard occupying the center.

The Great Wall of Qi () is the oldest existing Great Wall in China. Construction of the wall started in 441 BCE to defend against attacks from the states of Jin and Yue. Construction ended during the Warring States period, with the wall enhancing Qi&#x27;s defense against enemies states like Ju, Lu, and Chu. The wall stretches from Guangli village of today&#x27;s Changqing District, Jinan, running across the mountain ridges of central Shandong Province to the Yellow Sea in the present-day city of Qingdao. Its total length has been estimated at . Most of the wall is still visible.

==Qi in astronomy==

Qi is represented by the star Chi Capricorni in the &quot;Twelve States&quot; asterism in the &quot;Girl&quot; lunar mansion in the &quot;Black Turtle&quot; symbol. Qi is also represented by the star 112 Herculis in the &quot;Left Wall&quot; asterism in the &quot;Heavenly Market&quot; enclosure.

<text>A visitor, in English and Welsh law and history, is an overseer of an autonomous ecclesiastical or institution, often a charitable institution set up for the perpetual distribution of the founder&#x27;s alms and bounty, who can intervene in the internal affairs of that institution. Those with such visitors are mainly chapters, chapels, schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals.

Many visitors hold their role &quot;ex officio&quot;, by serving as the British sovereign, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Chief Justice, or the bishop of a particular diocese. Others can be appointed in various ways, depending on the constitution of the organization in question. Bishops are usually the visitors to their own cathedrals. The King usually delegates his visitatorial functions to the Lord Chancellor.

During the reform of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the 19th century, Parliament ordered visitations to the universities to make inquiries and to reform the university and college statutes.

There is a ceremonial element to the role, and the visitor may also be called upon to give advice where an institution expresses doubt as to its powers under its charter and statutes. However, the most important function of the visitor was within academic institutions, where the visitor had to determine disputes arising between the institution and its members.

The right of the visitor, and not the courts, to adjudge on alleged deviations from the statutes of academic colleges was affirmed in the case of &quot;Philips v. Bury&quot;, 1694, in which the House of Lords overruled a judgment of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench.

The Higher Education Act 2004 transferred the jurisdiction of visitors over the grievances of students in English and Welsh universities to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.

==Outside England and Wales==
The position has also existed in universities in other countries which have followed the English and Welsh model (there being no such office in Scotland), although in many countries the visitor&#x27;s role in complaints has been transferred to other bodies.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, the Universities Act 1997 redefines the appointment, function and responsibility of a visitor. Where a university does not have a visitor, a visitor may be appointed by the government and must be either a current or retired judge of the High Court or a retired judge of the Supreme Court.

=== Fiji ===
In Fiji, the Court of Appeal in &quot;Muma v USP&quot; declared that in default of appointment, the country&#x27;s president was the visitor of a university established by the Queen, since Fiji had subsequently become a republic.

=== Australia ===
The Governor of Victoria is the visitor to all Victorian universities, but has only ceremonial duties.

The Governor of New South Wales is the visitor to Macquarie University, Sydney Grammar School, and the University of Sydney pursuant to statute. The governor is also the visitor of the University of Wollongong by the University of Wollongong Act 1989. Only ceremonial duties can be exercised by the Governor of NSW in his or her role as visitor; this is mandated under the same act.

===Canada===
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as a member of the Canadian royal family, served as the visitor to Upper Canada College from 1955 to his death in 2021. Priorly, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, acted as the school&#x27;s visitor between 1919 and 1936.

The governor general of Canada, as the King&#x27;s representative, serves as the visitor to McGill University. Similarly, the lieutenant governor of Ontario serves as the visitor to the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, and the lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador serves as the visitor to Memorial University of Newfoundland.

The Anglican Bishop of Montreal serves as the visitor to Bishop&#x27;s University in Lennoxville, Quebec, and the Anglican Bishop of Huron serves as the visitor to Renison University College in Waterloo, Ontario.

=== India ===
In India, the President of India is the visitor to 126 central government institutes, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the office of visitor, from its early use at some colleges and other institutions, evolved specifically into that of a trustee. Certain colleges and universities, particularly of an earlier, often colonial founding, are governed by boards of visitors, often chaired by a rector (rather than regents or trustees, etc.). Examples include the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia.

=== Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, the visitor in publicly funded tertiary institution is the most senior member of government. This is usually the president in federally-funded universities or the governor for state-funded universities.

==In literature==
In the Jill Paton Walsh continuation of the Lord Peter Wimsey series of detective novels, &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;, Lord Peter (now the Duke of Denver) is the visitor of the fictional St Severin&#x27;s College in Oxford, which is central to the plot.

<text>Antoni Zygmund (December 26, 1900 – May 30, 1992) was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked mostly in the area of mathematical analysis, including especially harmonic analysis, and he is considered one of the greatest analysts of the 20th century. Zygmund was responsible for creating the Chicago school of mathematical analysis together with his doctoral student Alberto Calderón, for which he was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1986.

==Biography==
Born in Warsaw, Zygmund obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw (1923) and was a professor at Stefan Batory University at Wilno from 1930 to 1939, when World War II broke out and Poland was occupied. In 1940 he managed to emigrate to the United States, where he became a professor at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1945–1947 he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1947, until his retirement, at the University of Chicago.

He was a member of several scientific societies. From 1930 until 1952 he was a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (&quot;TNW&quot;), from 1946 of the Polish Academy of Learning (&quot;PAU&quot;), from 1959 of the Polish Academy of Sciences (&quot;PAN&quot;), and from 1961 of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. In 1986 he received the National Medal of Science.

In 1935 Zygmund published in Polish the original edition of what has become, in its English translation, the two-volume &quot;Trigonometric Series&quot;. It was described by Robert A. Fefferman as &quot;one of the most influential books in the history of mathematical analysis&quot; and &quot;an extraordinarily comprehensive and masterful presentation of a ... vast field&quot;. Jean-Pierre Kahane called the book &quot;The Bible&quot; of a harmonic analyst. The theory of trigonometric series had remained the largest component of Zygmund&#x27;s mathematical investigations.

His work has had a pervasive influence in many fields of mathematics, mostly in mathematical analysis, and particularly in harmonic analysis. Among the most significant were the results he obtained with Calderón on singular integral operators. George G. Lorentz called it Zygmund&#x27;s crowning achievement, one that &quot;stands somewhat apart from the rest of Zygmund&#x27;s work&quot;.

Zygmund&#x27;s students included Alberto Calderón, Paul Cohen, Nathan Fine, Józef Marcinkiewicz, Victor L. Shapiro, Guido Weiss, Elias M. Stein and Mischa Cotlar. He died in Chicago.

==Family==
Antoni Zygmund, who had three sisters, married Irena Parnowska, a mathematician, in 1925. Upon his death he was survived by four grandsons.

<text>Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna (&quot;Ancient and Modern Sweden&quot;) is a collection of engravings collected by Erik Dahlbergh during the middle of the 17th century. &quot;Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna&quot; can be described as a grand vision of Sweden during its period as a great power. Dahlberg&#x27;s direct source of inspiration was the topographical publications issued by the Swiss publisher Matthäus Merian. In 1661 Dahlberg was granted a royal privilege enabling him to realize his plans, which kept him occupied for a good decade, and a work that would not be printed until after his death. In its final state &quot;Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna&quot; comprised three volumes containing 353 plates.

<doc id="362481" wikidata="Q469088" url="?curid=362481" title="Karol Borsuk">
<text>Karol Borsuk (8 May 1905 – 24 January 1982) was a Polish mathematician. His main area of interest was topology. He made significant contributions to shape theory, a term which he coined. He also obtained important results in functional analysis. He was a professor of mathematics at the University of Warsaw, a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Polish Mathematical Society and a leading representative of the Warsaw School of Mathematics.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Borsuk was born in 1905 in Warsaw to father Marian, a surgeon, and mother Zofia (née Maciejewska). In 1923, he graduated from the Stanisław Staszic State Gymnasium in Warsaw. Between 1923–1927, he studied mathematics at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Warsaw.

He received his master&#x27;s degree and doctorate from Warsaw University in 1927 and 1930, respectively. His PhD thesis title was &quot;On the Subject of Topological Characterization of Euclidean Spheres&quot; and his advisor was Stefan Mazurkiewicz. From 1929 to 1934, he worked at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. He became a professor in 1938. In the interwar period, Borsuk visited Lwów, which was a thriving center of mathematics of the Second Polish Republic, and began his collaboration with Stanisław Ulam, especially in the field of topology. Borsuk joined the mathematicians in the Scottish Café and contributed to the open problems which they wrote down in the famous book.

===World War II===
During World War II, he run a stationary store and provided a secret meeting place for the Home Army. He designed and published a number of board games including &quot;Animal Husbandry&quot;, which enjoyed great popularity and was re-released in 1997 as &quot;Superfarmer&quot;. In the years 1939–1944, he gave secret lectures at the University of Warsaw. In 1943, he was arrested for his participation in the resistance movement and spent a couple of months at the Pawiak Prison. During the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, he was transported alongside his family to the Dulag 121 Camp in Pruszków. He managed to escape from the camp and remained in hiding until the end of the war.

===Later career===
In 1945, he completed a project in collaboration with Bronisław Knaster and Kazimierz Kuratowski concerning the establishment of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1946, he returned to the University of Warsaw where he served as the Head of the Institute of Mathematics from 1952 to 1964. In 1952, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and in 1953, a corresponding member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of the Polish Mathematical Society. He worked as an editor-in-chief of &quot;Dissertationes Mathematicae&quot; and deputy editor-in-chief of &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;. In 1946–47, he lectured at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, in 1959–60 at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1963–64 at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and in 1967–68 at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. In 1954, he received the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for his &quot;outstanding contributions to science&quot;. In 1976, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Zagreb.

Borsuk&#x27;s students include: Samuel Eilenberg, Andrzej Kirkor, Jan Jaworowski, Andrzej Granas, Antoni Kosiński, Karol Sieklucki, Włodzimierz Holsztyński, Rafał Molski, Hanna Patkowska, Andrzej Jankowski, Włodzimierz Kuperberg, Stanisław Spież, Krystyna Kuperberg, Jerzy Dydak, Andrzej Trybulec, Marian Orłowski, Alfred Surzycki.

==Research==

Borsuk introduced the theory of absolute retracts (ARs) and absolute neighborhood retracts (ANRs), and the cohomotopy groups, later called Borsuk–Spanier cohomotopy groups. He also founded shape theory. He has constructed various beautiful examples of topological spaces, e.g. an acyclic, 3-dimensional continuum which admits a fixed point free homeomorphism onto itself; also 2-dimensional, contractible polyhedra which have no free edge. 

His topological and geometric conjectures and themes stimulated research for more than half a century; in particular, his open problems stimulated the infinite-dimensional topology. Some of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Borsuk&#x27;s name include Borsuk&#x27;s conjecture, Borsuk–Ulam theorem and Bing–Borsuk conjecture.

==Private life==
In 1936, he married Zofia Paczkowska. One of his two daughters, Magdalena, who was a Professor of Paleontology, was married to Polish mathematician Andrzej Białynicki-Birula. He died in Warsaw in 1982 and was buried at the Powązki Cemetery. In 2008, a commemorative plaque in honour of Borsuk was unveiled at the entrance to the tenement house in Warsaw at Filtrowa 63 Street where the mathematician used to live.

<doc id="362488" wikidata="Q2475371" url="?curid=362488" title="Hope College">
<text>Hope College is a private Christian liberal arts college in Holland, Michigan, United States. It was originally opened in 1851 as the Pioneer School by Dutch immigrants four years after the community was first settled. The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862, and Hope received its state charter in 1866. Hope College is affiliated with the Reformed Church in America and retains a Christian atmosphere. Its campus is adjacent to the downtown commercial district and has been shared with Western Theological Seminary since 1884. The Hope College campus is located near the eastern shores of Lake Michigan and is 2.5 hours away from two major cities, Chicago and Detroit.

==History==
Hope&#x27;s motto is taken from Psalm 42:6: &quot;Spera in Deo&quot; (&quot;Hope in God&quot;). The college&#x27;s emblem is an anchor. This is drawn from a speech by Albertus van Raalte, the leader of the community, on the occasion of the founding of the Pioneer School in 1851: &quot;This is my anchor of hope for this people in the future,&quot; (an allusion to Hebrews 6:19). The primary-level Pioneer School was later expanded to secondary and college-level education as Hope College. Van Vleck Hall, which originally housed the Pioneer School, is the oldest building on campus (1858) and serves as a dormitory. It is the city&#x27;s second-oldest building. The first college class matriculated in 1862, and Hope received its state charter in 1866. The college admitted its first female students in 1878.

2015 marked Hope College&#x27;s 150th year of education. In honor of this, Hope held many events in 2015. The celebration began with the 150th commencement on May 3, 2015. The year held two grand openings, the Kruizenga Art Museum and the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts, and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Jim and Martie Bultman Student Center. The college also sponsored the Presidential Colloquium lecture series, which featured an address by David Brooks on Christian education in the 21st century.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected in 2019 by the Michigan Historical Commission. The inscription reads:

In 1851, four years after settlers from the Netherlands founded Holland, the Pioneer School was established to meet some of the educational needs of the young colony. This school, the predecessor of Hope College, received direction and financial support from the General Synod of the Reformed Church in America. The school evolved into the Holland Academy, which in 1862 enrolled its first college class. On May 14, 1866, the institution was chartered as Hope College, and on July 17, 1866, the first class of eight students was graduated. The college’s name, seal, and motto are derived from a statement of the founder of Holland, Rev. Albertus C. Van Raalte, who said of the Pioneer School, “This is my Anchor of Hope for this people in the future.” In the decades that followed, a strong college of arts and sciences was developed which continues to serve the church and the community.

== Hope Forward ==
Hope College believes that every student should have access to a life-changing education, regardless of their financial situation. To achieve this, the college is implementing Hope Forward, a model that allows students to receive a tuition-free education. Instead of paying upfront, students are invited to support future students through donations after they graduate.

The pillars of the Hope Forward model are community, generosity, and access.

Here’s how Hope Forward works:

* No Tuition: Students&#x27; tuition is covered by donations from alumni and other supporters, so students don’t have to worry about paying for their education while they’re in school.
* Giving Back After Graduation: Graduates aren’t required to repay tuition but are encouraged to “pay it forward” by giving back to Hope College when they can, ensuring future students have the same opportunity.
* Fostering Gratitude and Generosity: Through a unique program, Hope Forward students learn about community, generosity, and positive impact, forming lasting connections with the college and each other.
* Equal Opportunity for All: Ultimately, the goal is to extend Hope Forward to cover tuition for every student at Hope College, providing equal access to education without financial barriers.

To fully realize Hope Forward for all students, Hope College seeks to raise over $1 billion. The college has taken initial steps by launching the Anchored Tuition Pledge, which guarantees that tuition costs for current students remain the same throughout their time at Hope.

Hope Forward has gained national attention, including an episode of in June 2023 of Malcolm Gladwell’s &quot;Revisionist History&quot; podcast, titled &quot;A Good Circle&quot;, which highlights the potential for this innovative model to transform higher education.

===Accreditation===

Hope College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==Campus life==

=== Housing ===

On-campus housing is provided in 11 residence halls, 24 apartment buildings, and 70+ houses (called &quot;cottages&quot;) that the college owns near the campus. A small percentage of students—primarily juniors, seniors, and Holland, Michigan residents—live off-campus. All full-time students without commuter status are required to live in on-campus housing for three years.

===Demographics ===

Most Hope students come from the greater Great Lakes region. In 2023 approximately 90% of the student body came from Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Approximately 79% of the student body is white; students from minority backgrounds account for about 16% of the student body. Approximately 3% of the student body is international.

=== Student organizations ===
The college offers 80 student-led clubs and organization such as Dance Marathon and Relay for Life, an FM radio station (WTHS), newspaper (&quot;The Anchor&quot;), literary magazine (&quot;Opus&quot;), and yearbook (&quot;Milestone&quot;), plus a variety of academic, musical, spiritual, literary, social and athletic clubs. About 10–12% of students belong to social fraternities and sororities, which are local to Hope rather than chapters of larger organizations, with the exception of one fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa. Hope also houses the 6th oldest fraternity that is still in existence, Omicron Kappa Epsilon. The college holds Sunday evening worship services (&quot;The Gathering&quot;) and Monday/Wednesday/Friday Chapel services on campus. Attendance at these events has been voluntary since 1970, yet students routinely fill Dimnent Memorial Chapel to its capacity of greater than 1,000 students at each service.

=== &quot;The Pull&quot; ===

&quot;The Pull&quot; is an annual tug-of-war between the freshman and sophomore classes at Hope College. It takes place across the Black River in Holland on the last Saturday of September every year (until 1993 it was held on a Friday). The Pull dates to 1898. Each team has 19 students on the rope as &quot;pullers,&quot; and another 19 acting as guides and morale boosters, or &quot;moralers&quot;, as well as one pull &quot;anchor&quot; on each team. The freshmen are coached by juniors, and the sophomores by seniors. This arrangement has led to the rivalry between even and odd year classes. Even years&#x27; colors are red and white, while Odd years&#x27; colors are maroon and gold. The competition is limited to three hours; it previously had no time limit. The winner is the team that takes the most rope.

=== &quot;IMAGES: A Reflection of Cultures&quot; ===

IMAGES: A Reflection of Cultures is an annual international showcase featuring an array of skits, dance, song and other clips of culture and language performed by students from around the world.

=== &quot;The Nykerk Cup Competition&quot; ===

The Nykerk Cup Competition is a multifaceted tradition between freshmen and sophomore women involving song, play, and oration. As in the Pull, freshmen are coached by juniors and sophomores by seniors, also contributing to the &quot;Odd Year&quot; and &quot;Even Year&quot; competitions. Junior and senior coaches arrange the music, write the plays, and guide the orators as they craft seven-minute monologues. Upperclassmen also apply and are selected for a leadership board that plays an essential role in making this event a reality. Men participate in the competition as &quot;moralers&quot; by supporting the participants while building sets and coordinating scene changes. The competition takes place during Family Weekend in late fall each year. A panel of judges scores the performances of each class and the winning team claims the highly coveted Nykerk Cup. The tradition was started in 1936 by Dr. John Nykerk, Hope professor and founder of the college’s music department.

=== &quot;Winter Fantasia&quot; ===

One formal dance is offered by the college in February. Students may attend in large groups or with dates, and the college offers transportation to Grand Rapids, where it takes place.

=== &quot;Dance Marathon&quot; ===

The students of Hope College hold the annual Dance Marathon to raise money for Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals, particularly Helen DeVos Children&#x27;s Hospital in Grand Rapids. This event takes place in the spring semester. Students volunteer to be dancers or moralers for the event. The “Dream Team” leadership board is composed of four student directors and various student leaders chairing committees such as hospital relations, decorations, publicity, finance, and catering. Dancers stand on their feet and dance for 24 hours while moralers take shifts supporting the dancers. Children of the hospital and their families often visit to show their thanks and share their stories of resilience and hope. To date, Hope College Dance Marathon has raised over $4 million for Helen Devos Children’s Hospital in the last 24 years. Hope was also recognized by Dance Marathon in both 2020 and 2022 as the #10 program with the highest monetary growth.

=== Christmas Vespers ===

Each December, Hope College hosts a musical Christmas service in Dimnent Chapel. The service has been held annually since 1941 and features over 200 students, staff and faculty. It includes music performed by the Chapel Choir, College Chorus, Orchestra, and small ensembles. There are usually two to three performances each year, all of which draw a crowd that fills the chapel. The event is regularly recorded and televised on PBS stations during the Christmas season.

== Campus events ==

The Jack Ridl Visiting Writers Series sponsors authors for free public readings. The series is named for poet and Hope College professor emeritus Jack Ridl, who founded the series in 1982.

== Employment ==

For 18 consecutive years, Hope College has been listed among the &quot;101 best and brightest companies to work for in West Michigan&quot; survey of the Michigan Business and Professional Association.

Additionally, Hope College has been honored with the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from &quot;INSIGHT Into Diversity&quot; magazine. This award recognizes U.S. colleges and universities that demonstrate an outstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion.

== Campus renovation ==

The college marked the completion of the &quot;Greater Hope&quot; campaign in October 2015 with the dedication of the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts. In September 2015, the college dedicated the opening of Kruizenga Art Museum, designed by C Concept Design, and broke ground on construction of the Jim and Martie Bultman Student Center.

As of October 2015, the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts and the Kruizenga Art Museum are open and in use by students and faculty. The Jim and Martie Bultman Student Center opened for the 2017–2018 school year.

The Jim and Eileen Heeringa Dance Wing addition and Dow Center renovations, opened in fall of 2024, provide a dedicated performance space, expand wellness facilities, maintain arts accreditation and foster professional partnerships for Hope’s dance and theatre departments.

==Athletics==

Hope College competes in the MIAA conference, and is a Division III member of the NCAA. It fields 20 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity teams. The college has constructed several new outdoor athletic venues in recent years—Jim Heeringa Athletic Center (2021) DeVos Fieldhouse (2005), Boeve Baseball Stadium (2008), Wolters Softball Stadium (2008), Van Andel Soccer Stadium (2009) and Heeringa-Vande Poel Tennis Stadium (2012). The college acquired Holland Municipal Stadium from the City of Holland and renamed it the Ray and Sue Smith in honor of a longtime coach and his wife. In 2006, the women&#x27;s basketball team won the National Championship in its division, the second in school history, which has won three NCAA titles.

Hope has won the MIAA All-Sports/Commissioner&#x27;s Cup Championship more than any other member school. Hope has won the honor a league-leading 34 times. In 2012–2013 Hope athletes and/or teams qualified for nine NCAA championships.

The school&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Flying Dutchmen (men) and the Flying Dutch (women). The school colors are blue and orange (possibly chosen because the Dutch royal family is the House of Orange-Nassau). The college sponsors club ice hockey and rugby in addition to a popular intramural sports program.

<text>Samuel Dickstein (12 May 1851 – 28 September 1939) was a Polish mathematician of Jewish origin. He was one of the founders of the Jewish party &quot;Zjednoczenie&quot; (&quot;the union&quot;), which advocated the assimilation of Polish Jews.

He was born in Warsaw and was killed there by a German bomb at the beginning of World War II. All the members of his family were murdered during the Holocaust.

==Work==

Dickstein wrote many mathematical books and founded the journal &quot;Wiadomości Mathematyczne&quot; (&quot;Mathematical News&quot;), now published by the Polish Mathematical Society. He was a bridge between the times of Cauchy and Poincaré and those of the Lwów School of Mathematics. He was also thanked by Alexander Macfarlane for contributing to the &quot;Bibliography of Quaternions&quot; (1904) published by the Quaternion Society.

He was also one of the personalities, who contributed to the foundation of the Warsaw Public Library in 1907.

<text>Francis Willughby (sometimes spelt Willoughby, ) FRS (22 November 1635 – 3 July 1672) was an English ornithologist, ichthyologist and mathematician, and an early student of linguistics and games.

He was born and raised at Middleton Hall, Warwickshire, the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist John Ray, who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when Ray lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the Act of Uniformity. Willughby was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1661, then aged 27.

Willughby, Ray, and others such as John Wilkins were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of Aristotle and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.

Willughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of pleurisy in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and invertebrates, the &quot;Ornithologiae Libri Tres&quot;, &quot;Historia Piscium&quot; and &quot;Historia Insectorum&quot;. The &quot;Ornithology&quot; was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of life science, including their effect on subsequent natural history writers and their importance in the development of Linnaeus&#x27;s binomial nomenclature.

== Early life ==
Francis Willughby was born at Middleton Hall, Warwickshire on 22 November 1635, the only son of Sir Francis Willoughby and his wife Cassandra (née Ridgeway). His grandfathers were Sir Percival Willoughby of Wollaton Hall, and Thomas Ridgeway, 1st Earl of Londonderry. The family were affluent gentry, whose main seat, inherited by Francis, was Wollaton Hall, now in Nottingham. The younger Francis studied at Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield and Trinity College, Cambridge. He appears to have read widely, his library at his death containing an estimated 2,000 books, including literary, historical and heraldic works as well as natural science volumes.

Willughby commenced his studies at Trinity aged 17 as a Fellow-commoner. His tutor was James Duport, who shared the Willughbys&#x27; royalist sympathies in the English Civil War. John Ray, then a mathematics fellow at Trinity, arranged for his student Isaac Barrow to teach Willughby that subject. The two became friends, and in 1655 Barrow dedicated his &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; to Willughby and two other wealthy fellow pupils.

Although affluent students often left university without a degree, Willughby graduated BA in January 1656, and this was later promoted to MA by seniority in July 1660. In 1657 he joined Gray&#x27;s Inn, not an unusual step for a man of property who might have to deal with legal disputes. Willughby and Ray had collaborated at Trinity on several &quot;chymistry&quot; projects, including making &quot;sugar of lead&quot; and extracting antimony, and in 1663 Willughby, then aged 27, was elected a founder Fellow of the Royal Society on the nominations of Ray and John Wilkins, who became Master of Trinity College in 1660, and eventually Bishop of Chester. In 1667 Ray was also elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, but was excused the subscription because of his relative poverty.

== Travels ==
In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Francis Bacon had advocated the advancement of knowledge through observation and experiment, rather than relying on the authority of Aristotle and the church. The Royal Society and its members such as Ray, Wilkins and Willughby sought to put the empirical method into practice, including travelling to collect specimens and information. Willughby helped Ray in collecting plants for his botanical work &quot;Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam Nascentium&quot; (the &quot;Cambridge Catalogue&quot;), which was published anonymously in February 1660.

Later that year, Ray and Willughby journeyed through northern England to the Lake District, the Isle of Man and the Calf of Man, seeing a Manx shearwater chick at the last site. Willughby then briefly visited the University of Oxford to consult some rare natural history books.

=== Cheshire and Wales ===

In May 1662, Willughby, Ray and Philip Skippon, Ray&#x27;s student, set out on a second journey through Nantwich and Chester and west to Anglesey. They returned inland to Llanberis and were shown a local lake fish called a &quot;torgoch&quot;, which Willughby recognised as essentially the same as the Windermere charr he had described previously in the Lake District. The party then headed south through west Wales to Pembroke, visiting Bardsey Island on the way. They then proceeded back along the Welsh south coast to Tenby, where they saw many fish species, and Aberavon, where they were shown a rare black-winged stilt.

Willughby interviewed Welsh speakers to attempt a systematic study of the language that, although never published, influenced subsequent scholars. It was during this trip that Ray and Willughby decided to attempt to classify all living things, with Ray mainly working on plants and Willughby on animals. The tables of species they produced were used by Wilkins as part of a unifying scheme later published in 1668 as &quot;An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language&quot;. Wilkins&#x27; intention was to create a universal terminology to describe the natural world, and the study of languages and writing systems was meant to create a logical linguistic framework for his classification.

Willughby and his companions parted company when he fell ill at Gloucester while they continued through the West Country to Land&#x27;s End. When Willughby had recovered, he spent part of the summer birdwatching in Lincolnshire. Ray and Willughby later visited the West Country together in 1667, returning via Dorset, Hampshire and London.

=== Europe ===
In August 1662 Ray resigned his Fellowship at Cambridge, being unwilling to subscribe to the requirements of the Act of Uniformity imposed on Church of England clerics. Unemployed and without a source of income, his position might have been difficult, but Willughby offered him accommodation and work at Middleton, writing &quot;I am likely to spend much of my life afterwards in wandring or else in Private Studiing at Oxford. having but little heart to thinke of settling, or ingaging in a family. I shall bee Verie glad of your constant company and assistance in my studies&quot;.

In April 1663, Willughby, Ray, Skippon and Nathaniel Bacon (another friend from Trinity) departed for continental Europe on a pre-planned itinerary armed with the requisite passports and letters of introduction to notable personages, with Willughby&#x27;s wealth making the trip financially viable. They intended to visit museums, libraries and private collections, and also study local animals and plants. Given the limitations of time on their demanding schedule, fish and bird markets were a useful source of information and specimens. Although all kept journals, most of Willughby&#x27;s are lost, and the journey is mainly documented in Ray&#x27;s &quot;Observations topographical, moral &amp; physiological made in a journey through part of the Low-Countries, Germany, Italy and France&quot;, which included Willughby&#x27;s notes from Spain.

The travellers visited Brussels, the University of Leuven, Antwerp, Delft, The Hague and Leiden&#x27;s university and public library. On 5 June they visited a colony of cormorants, grey herons and spoonbills at Zevenhuizen, and Willughby dissected a spoonbill chick obtained there. The party continued north through Haarlem, Amsterdam and Utrecht before heading to Strasbourg, where Willughby made a diversion to buy a handwritten book from its author, Leonard Baldner. This book was illustrated with paintings of birds, fish and other animals.

Baldner was a prosperous former fisherman, town councillor and self-taught naturalist who, like the Englishmen, only wrote about what he saw. Frederick Slare FRS made a translation of the German text into English, later added to Willughby&#x27;s copy after his death. Ray claimed in his preface to the &quot;Ornithology&quot;: &quot;For my part, I must needs acknowledge that I have received much light and information from the Work of this poor man, and have been thereby inabled to clear many difficulties, and rectifie some mistakes in Gesner.&quot;, although in practice few of Baldner&#x27;s insights were incorporated into the text.
The party continued through Liège, Cologne and Nuremberg, and arrived in Vienna on 15 September where they stayed for several days before leaving on 24 September for Venice. The journey through the Alps was arduous, with poor mountain tracks, bad weather and little food except bread, and it was 6 October before they reached their destination, where Skippon listed 60 species of fish and 28 kinds of birds he had noted in the Venetian markets.

The group remained in Venice from 6 October 1663 to 1 February 1664, apart from a trip to Padua, where they investigated medical procedures including the dissection of human corpses. They then travelled through northern Italy, stopping in Ferrara, Verona, Bologna, Milan and Genoa. In Bologna they toured the public museum of the &#x27;Bologna Aristotle&#x27;, Ulisse Aldrovandi, &quot;by the favor of Dr. Ovidio Montalbani,&quot; its current curator. On 15 April 1664 they set sail for Naples from Livorno. It was here that the party divided, Willughby and Bacon heading to Rome, where they spent May, June and July, while Ray and Skippon went on to Sicily and Malta.

Throughout the continental journey, Willughby and Skippon in particular had continued their research into languages. In Vienna, apart from visiting the local collections, they had taken the opportunity to study Turkish and several Slavic languages, and surviving manuscripts show comparison tables for seventeen languages including Basque, Armenian and Persian.

Bacon contracted smallpox somewhere in Northern Italy, and Willughby continued with just a servant to Montpellier, where Ray was already present. Willughby entered Spain on 31 August and progressed through Valencia, Granada, Seville, Cordoba and Madrid, reaching Irun on 14 November. Willughby found little of scientific interest in Spain, which he considered backward. He also disliked the land and the people: &quot;almost desolate... tyrannical inquisition... multitude of whores... wretched laziness... very like the Welsh and Irish.&quot;

== Later life and death ==
In Seville, Willughby had received a letter saying that his father was seriously ill, so he had hastened his return to Middleton where he arrived shortly before Christmas 1664. His father died in December 1665 and Francis then became responsible for the estate. Willughby was soon being urged by his relatives to find a wife, but procrastinated knowing that this would restrict his researches.

In 1661 he had sent the Royal Society the first paper to describe the life cycle of insects, and he and Ray also verified the parasitoidism of caterpillars by ichneumon wasps. Willughby also bred and studied leaf-cutter bees, his chosen research species later being named after him as Willughby&#x27;s leaf-cutter bee, &quot;Megachile willughbiella&quot;. Willughby was the first person to unambiguously distinguish the honey buzzard from the common buzzard, and in 2018 it was suggested that the former species should be renamed &quot;Willughby&#x27;s Buzzard&quot; to commemorate this.

In 1668 Willughby married Emma Barnard, daughter of Sir Henry Barnard of Bridgnorth and London. They had three children. Their first child, Francis, died at the age of nineteen, while their daughter Cassandra Willoughby married the Duke of Chandos, who was a patron of the English naturalist Mark Catesby. The second son, Thomas, was created Baron Middleton in 1711 by Queen Anne.

Willughby and Ray continued their researches, now mainly on birds, with the help of Francis Jessop, another Trinity alumnus, who sent them specimens from the Peak District, including twite and red grouse. They also were the first to investigate the active flow of sap in birches.

Willughby had suffered several periods of illness, including violent fevers, between 1668 and 1671, described by Ray as &quot;tertian ague&quot; (malaria), and the additional physical and financial demands occasioned by having to defend a bitterly disputed inheritance put him under more strain. On 3 June 1672 he became seriously ill again, and signed his will on 24 June, disbarring any Catholic descendants from inheriting. He died on 3 July. The immediate cause of death was pleurisy, probably related to pneumonia. He was buried at St. John the Baptist parish church, Middleton, with Ray, Skippon and Jessop present with the family at the interment. The church contains a large memorial commemorating Francis, his parents, Francis senior and Cassandra, and his son, also Francis; this was erected by his second son, Thomas.

== Subjects of his studies ==

As well as being a friend, John Ray was one of five executors of Willughby&#x27;s will, in which he was left the sum of £60 a year for life. He saw it as his duty to complete and publish his colleague&#x27;s work on animals.

=== Birds ===
Willughby&#x27;s &quot;Ornithology&quot; was intended to describe all the then-known birds worldwide. Its innovative features were an effective classification system based on anatomical features, such the bird&#x27;s beak, feet and overall size, and a dichotomous key, which helped readers to identify birds by guiding them to the page describing that group. The authors also placed an asterisk against species of which they had no first-hand knowledge, and were therefore unable to verify. Willughby had been keen to add details of &quot;characteristic marks&quot; to help with identification. The authors also largely avoided the practice of previous writers, such as Conrad Gessner, by not including extraneous material relating to the species, such as proverbs, references in history and literature, or use as an emblem. The book was published in Latin as &quot;Ornithologiae Libri Tres&quot; (&quot;Three Books of Ornithology&quot;) in 1676.

The first of the three sections included an introduction to bird biology, an explanation of the new classification system and the dichotomous key. The second and third sections described land birds and seabirds respectively. Emma Willughby paid for the 80 metal-engraved plates that completed the work, and this is acknowledged on the title page. The English-language version, &quot;The Ornithology of Francis Willughby of Middleton&quot;, published in 1678, included additional material, including a section on fowling to broaden its appeal, but had no mention of Willughby&#x27;s widow. Its commercial success is unknown, but its influence was profound.

=== Fish ===
The next book, on fish, was many years in the making; Willughby&#x27;s widow had remarried, and her new husband, Josiah Child, had barred Ray from accessing his friend&#x27;s papers. Furthermore, there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe, and Ray was working on his own &quot;History of Plants&quot;. The &quot;Historia Piscium&quot; was finally published in Latin in 1686 with a dedication to Samuel Pepys, President of the Royal Society, who had made a generous financial contribution to the project. The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; cetaceans; cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays); and bony fish, the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.

=== &quot;Insects&quot; ===

In the seventeenth century, the term &quot;insect&quot; had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, &quot;Historia Insectorum&quot;, included many other invertebrates, such as worms, spiders and millipedes. It excluded molluscs, perhaps because Martin Lister, another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own &quot;Historia Animalium&quot; that covered that group. Ray&#x27;s problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father&#x27;s papers and possessions.

Ray died in January 1705, and little happened with the &quot;Historia Insectorum&quot; until William Derham and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray&#x27;s name only. Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research, including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions. The book had four sections, starting with an innovative classification system based on metamorphosis. The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray&#x27;s observations of butterflies and moths and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles. Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.

=== Games and probability ===

Willughby&#x27;s &quot;Book of Games&quot; was unfinished at his death, but was published with accompanying interpretative material in 2003. He gave details of dozens of games and sports, including cards, cockfighting, football and word games; some are now unfamiliar, such as &quot;Lend me your Skimmer&quot;. For each entry he included the rules, equipment and manner of play. He also studied the first games that babies and children play, and wrote a more mathematical section &quot;On the rebounding of tennis balls&quot;. As with his biological works, the &quot;Book of Games&quot; is organised on the empirical principles of observation, description, and classification.

A lost work appears to have been one that, according to his daughter Cassandra, &quot;shews the chances of most games&quot;, which may have been titled &quot;The Book of Dice&quot; (&quot;Historii Chartitudii&quot;). Willughby was a competent mathematician, and there is evidence that the lost text considered probability with regard to card and dice games.

=== Illustrations and sources ===
The numerous plates illustrating the species in the bird and fish books came from a number of sources. Willughby&#x27;s own extensive collection included paintings he had bought on his European travels, and he also borrowed pictures owned by friends like Skippon and Sir Thomas Browne. Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers, and some were based on Francis Barlow&#x27;s oil-paintings of birds in Charles II&#x27;s aviary in St James&#x27;s Park.

The illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by Ulisse Aldrovandi, Pietro Olina, Georg Marcgrave and Willem Piso. Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication. In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by Carolus Clusius, Adriaen Collaert, Gervase Markham, Juan Eusebio Nieremberg and Ole Worm. Olina&#x27;s &quot;Ucelliera&quot;, at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the &quot;Ornithology&quot;, since the later version contains a description of territorial behaviour by the nightingale absent from the earlier work.

== Legacy ==
Much of Willughby&#x27;s written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest; what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive. The &quot;Ornithology&quot; influenced Réamur in organising his great bird collection, and Brisson in the compilation of his own work on the topic. Georges Cuvier commented on the influence of the &quot;Historia Piscium&quot;, and Carl Linnaeus from 1735 onwards relied heavily on Willughby and Ray&#x27;s books in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, the basis of binomial nomenclature.

The lack of physical evidence, together with Willughby&#x27;s early death and the publication of his books by Ray, means that the relative contributions of the two men has subsequently been disputed. Willughby&#x27;s work was initially well-regarded, but Ray&#x27;s reputation grew as time passed, and, in 1788, the English botanist James Edward Smith wrote that Willughby&#x27;s contribution had been overstated by his friend, who gave himself too little credit. The opposite view was given by William Swainson, who felt that Ray&#x27;s fame rested entirely on that of his patron, and he lacked the genius to have achieved anything on his own.

The pendulum swung again when Charles E. Raven wrote his 1942 biography of Ray, seeing him as the senior partner and saying that Willughby had &quot;less knowledge, patience and judgment&quot; than Ray, whom he considered a scientist of genius, and whose contributions he tended to compare favourably with the achievements of most other writers. Raven was unaware of the Willughby family archive at the University of Nottingham when he wrote his book, and access to that and other new material have led to modern appraisals giving a more balanced picture, with the two men seen to have made significant individual contributions, each demonstrating his own strengths.

Willughby and Ray discovered several previously undescribed species of birds, fish and invertebrates. The names of the Windermere charr (&quot;Salvelinus willughbii&quot;), Willughby&#x27;s leaf-cutter bee (&quot;Megachile willughbiella&quot;) and the tropical plant genus &quot;Willughbeia&quot; all commemorate the younger man. However, Willughby and Ray&#x27;s main influence was through their three books, especially the &quot;Ornithology&quot;, with their emphasis on systematic description and classification. Even Willughby&#x27;s own collection of 170 plates and nature paintings seems to be intended not just to provide individual illustrations, but to be an integral part of a collection intended to reinforce the order of nature.

<text>Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (6 October 1903 – 25 June 1995) was an Irish physicist who shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics with John Cockcroft &quot;for their pioneer work on the transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles&quot;. According to their Nobel Prize citation: &quot;Thus, for the first time, a nuclear transmutation was produced by means entirely under human control&quot;.

==Early years==

Ernest Walton was born in Abbeyside, Dungarvan, County Waterford, to a Methodist minister father, the Rev. John Walton (1874–1936), who was from Cloughjordan in County Tipperary, and his wife, Anna Sinton (1874–1906), who was from Richhill in County Armagh. In those days a general clergyman&#x27;s family moved once every three years, and this practice carried Ernest and his family, while he was a small child, to Rathkeale, County Limerick (where his mother died), and to County Monaghan. He attended day schools in counties Down and Tyrone, and at Wesley College Dublin before becoming a boarder at Methodist College Belfast in 1915, where he excelled in science and mathematics.

In 1922, Walton won scholarships to Trinity College Dublin for the study of mathematics and science, and would go on to be elected a Foundation Scholar in 1924. He was awarded bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from Trinity in 1926 and 1927, respectively. During these years at college, Walton received numerous prizes for excellence in physics and mathematics (seven prizes in all), including the Foundation Scholarship in 1924. Following graduation, he was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 and was accepted as a research student at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Sir Ernest Rutherford, Director of Cambridge University&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory. At the time there were four Nobel Prize laureates on the staff at the Cavendish lab and a further five were to emerge, including Walton and John Cockcroft. Walton was awarded his PhD in 1931 and remained at Cambridge as a researcher until 1934.

During the early 1930s, Walton and John Cockcroft collaborated to build an apparatus that split the nuclei of lithium atoms by bombarding them with a stream of protons accelerated inside a high-voltage tube (700 kilovolts). The splitting of the lithium nuclei produced helium nuclei. They went on to use Boron and Carbon as targets for their &#x27;disintegration&#x27; experiments, and to report artificially induced radioactivity. These experiments provided verification of theories about atomic structure that had been proposed earlier by Rutherford, George Gamow, and others. The successful apparatus – a type of particle accelerator now called the Cockcroft-Walton generator – helped to usher in an era of particle-accelerator-based experimental nuclear physics. It was this research at Cambridge in the early 1930s that won Walton and Cockcroft the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951.

==Career at Trinity College Dublin==
Ernest Walton returned to Ireland in 1934 to become a fellow of Trinity College Dublin in the physics department, and in 1946 was appointed Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. Walton&#x27;s lecturing was considered outstanding as he had the ability to present complicated matters in simple and easy-to-understand terms. His research interests were pursued with very limited resources, yet he was able to study, in the late 1950s, the phosphorescent effect in glasses, secondary-electron emissions from surfaces under positive-ion bombardment, radiocarbon dating and low-level counting, and the deposition of thin films on glass.

Walton was associated with the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies for over 40 years, where he served long periods on the board of the School of Cosmic Physics and on the council of the Institute. Following the 1952 death of John J. Nolan, the inaugural chairman of the School of Cosmic Physics, Walton assumed the role and served in that position until 1960, when he was succeeded by John H. Poole.

==Later years and death==

Although he retired from Trinity College Dublin in 1974, he retained his association with the Physics Department at Trinity up to his final illness. Shortly before his death, he marked his lifelong devotion to Trinity by presenting his Nobel medal and citation to the College. Ernest Walton died in Belfast on 25 June 1995, aged 91. He is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery, Dublin.
==Family life==

Ernest Walton married Winifred Wilson, a Methodist minister&#x27;s daughter, in 1934. Their four children are Alan Walton (a physicist at the University of Cambridge), Marian Woods, Philip Walton (Professor of Applied Physics, NUI Galway), and Jean Clarke. He served on a committee of Wesley College, Dublin.

==Religious views==

Raised as a Methodist, Walton has been described as someone who was strongly committed to the Christian faith. He gave lectures about the relationship of science and religion in several countries after he won the Nobel Prize, and he encouraged the progress of science as a way to know more about God.

Walton is quoted as saying:

Walton held an interest in topics about the government and the Church, and after his death, the organisation &quot;Christians in Science Ireland&quot; established the &quot;Walton Lectures on Science and Religion&quot; (an initiative similar to the Boyle Lectures). David Wilkinson, Denis Alexander, and others have given Walton Lectures in universities across Ireland.

Along with Lochlainn O&#x27;Raifeartaigh and Michael Fry, Walton helped found the Irish Pugwash group, opposing the nuclear weapons race.

==Honours==

Walton and Sir John Cockcroft were recipients of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for their &quot;work on the transmutation of the atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles&quot; (popularly known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot;). They are credited with being the first to disintegrate the lithium nucleus by bombardment with accelerated protons (or hydrogen nuclei) and identifying helium nuclei in the products in 1930. More generally, they had built an apparatus which showed that nuclei of various lightweight elements (such as lithium) could be split by fast-moving protons.

In 1935, Walton was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA). Walton and Cockcroft received the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1938. In much later years – predominantly after his retirement in 1974 – Walton received honorary degrees or conferrals from numerous Irish, British, and North American institutions.

The &quot;Walton Causeway Park&quot; in Walton&#x27;s native Dungarvan was dedicated in his honour with Walton himself attending the ceremony in 1989. After his death the Waterford Institute of Technology named a building the &quot;ETS Walton Building&quot; and a plaque was placed on the site of his birthplace.

Other honours for Walton include the Walton Building at Methodist College Belfast, the school where he had been a boarder for five years, and a memorial plaque outside the main entrance to Methodist College. Wesley College in Dublin, where he attended and for many years served as chairman of the board of Governors, established the Walton Prize for Physics, and a prize with the same name at Methodist College is awarded to the pupil who obtains the highest marks in A Level Physics. There is also a scholarship in Waterford named after Walton. In 2014, Trinity College Dublin set up the &quot;Trinity Walton Club&quot;, an extracurricular STEM Education centre for teenagers.

<text>Samuel Eilenberg (September 30, 1913 – January 30, 1998) was a Polish-American mathematician who co-founded category theory (with Saunders Mac Lane) and homological algebra.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Warsaw, Kingdom of Poland to a Jewish family. He spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University.

He earned his Ph.D. from University of Warsaw in 1936, with thesis &quot;On the Topological Applications of Maps onto a Circle&quot;; his thesis advisors were Kazimierz Kuratowski and Karol Borsuk. He died in New York City in January 1998.

==Career==
Eilenberg&#x27;s main body of work was in algebraic topology. He worked on the axiomatic treatment of homology theory with Norman Steenrod (and the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms are named for the pair), and on homological algebra with Saunders Mac Lane. In the process, Eilenberg and Mac Lane created category theory.

Eilenberg was a member of Bourbaki and, with Henri Cartan, wrote the 1956 book &quot;Homological Algebra&quot;.

Later in life he worked mainly in pure category theory, being one of the founders of the field. The Eilenberg swindle (or &quot;telescope&quot;) is a construction applying the telescoping cancellation idea to projective modules.

Eilenberg contributed to automata theory and algebraic automata theory. In particular, he introduced a model of computation called X-machine and a new prime decomposition algorithm for finite state machines in the vein of Krohn–Rhodes theory.

==Art collection==
Eilenberg was also a prominent collector of Asian art. His collection mainly consisted of small sculptures and other artifacts from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Central Asia. In 1991–1992, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York staged an exhibition from more than 400 items that Eilenberg had donated to the museum, entitled &quot;The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art From the Samuel Eilenberg Collection&quot;. In reciprocity, the Metropolitan Museum of Art donated substantially to the endowment of the Samuel Eilenberg Visiting Professorship in Mathematics at Columbia University.
