<text>Edward Charles Allan &quot;Eddie&quot; Brock is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by David Michelinie and Todd McFarlane, making a cameo appearance in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #18 (September 1986), before making his first full appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #300 (May 1988) as the most well-known host of the [[Venom (character)|Venom]] symbiote. The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications, including &quot;Venom&quot;. He has endured as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most prominent villains, and was initially regarded as one of his three archenemies, alongside the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. He later evolved into an antihero, slowly distancing himself from his initial goal to ruin Spider-Man&#x27;s life to instead do good, even occasionally allying with Spider-Man.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who publicly exposes the identity of a man he believes is a serial killer, the Sin-Eater, only to find his reputation ruined when Spider-Man captures the real killer. Disgraced and suicidal with a growing irrational hatred for Spider-Man, Eddie comes into contact with an alien symbiote, rejected by Peter Parker. The symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom, together seeking out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems &quot;innocent&quot; and avoid any collateral damage in his clashes with Spider-Man. In 2008, after being separated from the Venom symbiote, he serves as the anti-hero host of the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote which is sacrificed to help cure the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; epidemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he was bonded to the [[Eddie Brock|Toxin]] symbiote, reuniting with the Venom symbiote in 2016. While Eddie was originally a human with no powers, the Venom symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of Spider-Man&#x27;s powers, culminating in him becoming a living symbiote and the King in Black at the conclusion of the event of the same name in 2021 (leaving his son Dylan to join up with Venom), and be stuck in a time loop with his future selves Tyro, Wilde, Finnegan, Bedlam, Meridius, and The Eventuality forming the symbiote ruling council of the Kings in Black. On the loop&#x27;s breakage, Eddie reconciles with and becomes the host of the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote, training it as an anti-hero.

Debuting in the Modern Age of Comic Books, the character has featured in various Marvel-endorsed products outside of comics, including feature films, animated television series, and video games; and merchandise such as action figures, and trading cards. Topher Grace portrays Eddie Brock/Venom in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), while Tom Hardy portrays the character in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe&#x27;s films &quot;Venom&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024) as well as a post-credits scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

One of Spider-Man&#x27;s most famous rogues and a fan-favorite character, the Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom was rated 33rd on the 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters by &quot;Empire&quot;, and ranked 22nd on IGN&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Comic Villains of All Time. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: &quot;What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger&#x27;s greatest nightmares&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Creation and conception===
Writer David Michelinie and artist Todd McFarlane are generally credited with the character&#x27;s creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine &quot;Wizard&quot;, which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as &quot;co-creator&quot; of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character&#x27;s sole creator, while acknowledging that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.

Writer Peter David corroborated Michelinie&#x27;s view in his &quot;But I Digress&quot; column in the June 4, 1993 &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; and wrote the &quot;Sin Eater&quot; storyline from which Eddie Brock&#x27;s backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on &quot;Amazing&quot;. Because the artist who illustrates a character&#x27;s first published appearance is generally credited as its co-creator (especially if that artist is the one who designs the character&#x27;s visual appearance), Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom&#x27;s appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.

Erik Larsen responded to Michelinie&#x27;s letter with one of his own that was printed in &quot;Wizard&quot; #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie&#x27;s contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely &quot;swiped&quot; the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane&#x27;s rendition of the character that made it commercial.

The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself—to which Michelinie did not contribute—have also been noted. The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived of by a Marvel Comics reader from Norridge, Illinois named Randy Schueller. Marvel purchased the idea for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, Jim Shooter, sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel&#x27;s desire to acquire the idea from him, in 1982. Schueller&#x27;s design was then modified by Mike Zeck, becoming the Symbiote costume. For example, Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new Spider-Woman, with artists Mike Zeck and Rick Leonardi, as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume.

Writer/artist John Byrne asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on &quot;Iron Fist&quot; to explain how that character&#x27;s costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that Roger Stern later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man&#x27;s alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being, and that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; that preceded Michelinie&#x27;s. Regardless, Peter David&#x27;s position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a &quot;separate&quot; character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie&#x27;s, as was Eddie Brock&#x27;s backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character&#x27;s basic design (&quot;a big guy in the black costume&quot;). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; &quot;I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit&quot;.

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders of Image Comics.

Venom&#x27;s existence was first indicated in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoves Peter Parker in front of a subway train without Parker&#x27;s spider-sense warning him, though only Eddie Brock&#x27;s hand is seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom&#x27;s existence was in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; editor Jim Salicrup required a villain for that book&#x27;s 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien symbiote grafted onto the body of a human female; seeking revenge for the deaths of her husband and miscarried baby who would accidentally die as the unfortunate result of Spider-Man battling another supervillain. Due to cultural sensibilities at the time and issues with the character&#x27;s back story potentially angering the moral majority, Salicrup forced Michelinie to create a male character instead. Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298–299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book. In a 2014 interview with the YouTube channel ComicPop, Michelinie said he was disappointed that the female character arc was never explored, but felt that changing the character to male ultimately had minimal effect on his vision for the character. In the same interview, Michelinie remarked that he was largely happy with the treatment Eddie Brock had received by successive Marvel writers.

==Fictional character biography==
===Backstory===
The 1993 limited series &quot;&quot; describes Brock&#x27;s history before bonding with the symbiote. As a child, Edward Brock is raised in a Roman Catholic household in San Francisco. Eddie&#x27;s mother Jamie dies from complications during his birth. As a result, his father Carl Brock is cold and unaffectionate towards him. Eddie excels in academics and sports in an attempt to earn his father&#x27;s approval but does not succeed. In college, Brock switches his major to journalism after reading an article on the Watergate scandal. At one point after getting drunk, he accidentally hit and killed a child with Carl&#x27;s car. Eddie wanted to get what he deserved, but his father did not let him to go to prison much to Eddie&#x27;s dismay. After graduating and romancing Anne Weying, he moves to New York City and obtains a job as a journalist for the &quot;Daily Globe&quot;. Though he proves himself to be a highly talented journalist, his father still only treats him with indifference.

As a reporter, Brock investigates the serial killer Sin-Eater and is contacted by Emil Gregg, who claims to be the killer. Pressured by the authorities to reveal the killer&#x27;s identity, Brock writes an exposé announcing Gregg as the Sin-Eater. However, the real Sin-Eater is caught by Spider-Man and Brock is revealed to have been interviewing a compulsive confessor. Brock is fired from his job in disgrace and Anne divorces him. Unable to find reputable work, he is forced to work for tabloid magazines and Carl disowns him. Unable to cope with his own mistakes, Brock becomes obsessed with gaining revenge against Spider-Man, blaming him for catching the real Sin-Eater. Brock takes up bodybuilding to reduce stress but his anger and depression remain. Meanwhile, Spider-Man uses the sound of bells at a church to remove his symbiote costume after realizing it is attempting to permanently bond with him. His professional and personal life shattered, Brock contemplates suicide and goes to the same church, where he prays to God for forgiveness. The Symbiote, having waited in the rafters of the church since leaving Spider-Man, senses Brock and bonds with him, granting him powers equal and greater to those of Spider-Man, and imparting knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity.

===Venom===
Venom begins a campaign of torment against Peter, who is still unaware of his existence. He first pushes Peter in front of a moving subway and later reaches from behind a window and dislodges him as he scales a building, both times without activating his spider-sense. He eventually terrorizes Spider-Man&#x27;s wife Mary Jane, and baits the hero to his apartment for their first confrontation, where Venom reveals his true identity to Spider-Man, claiming &quot;You may call me Venom, for that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paid to spew out these days!&quot; Spider-Man discovers that the Symbiote has completely bonded with Brock and cannot be killed without also killing Brock. Eventually Venom is tricked into weakening himself by expending too much webbing until the suit lacks enough material to produce more. Venom is incarcerated in the Vault, from which he makes repeated escapes and escape attempts, only to suffer defeats and returns to the Vault.

Brock eventually fakes suicide and escapes after being taken to the morgue. During a battle with Spider-Man, the Symbiote is seemingly killed by the plague-inducing villain Styx, giving its life to protect Brock. Brock is incarcerated and Spider-Man disposes of the Symbiote&#x27;s remains. The Symbiote survives by entering a comatose state to fight off the illness and it returns to Brock, enabling him to again escape from jail. During the escape, the symbiote asexually reproduces and leaves behind its spawn. The offspring quickly bonds to Brock&#x27;s cellmate, Cletus Kasady, creating Carnage. Venom abducts Spider-Man and transports him to a remote island to do battle. Spider-Man fakes his own death to convince Venom that his vendetta is over. Venom, content with the outcome, resigns himself to life on the island. Spider-Man eventually faces Carnage but is unable to defeat him. Spider-Man is forced to ask Venom for help, promising him freedom in exchange. However, after they defeat Carnage, Spider-Man betrays Venom (who had also resumed his plan of revenge and tried to throttle the arachnoid hero to death) by summoning the Fantastic Four and sending him back to prison.

===Anti-hero===
After seeing a photo of Spider-Man&#x27;s recently returned parents, Brock escapes from prison, and kidnaps them. During the resulting fight, Brock&#x27;s ex-wife, Anne Weying, is nearly crushed under a falling ferris wheel, but Spider-Man saves her. Seeing this act, Venom makes peace with Spider-Man. In &quot;Venom: Lethal Protector&quot; (1993), Venom moves to San Francisco and acts as the protector of an underground society of homeless people. He is later taken prisoner by the Life Foundation who harvest the last five spawn within the symbiote to create super-powered policemen and Brock is forcibly separated from the symbiote. With Spider-Man&#x27;s help, Brock is reunited with the symbiote and they seemingly destroy his spawn, Phage, Lasher, Riot, Scream and Agony, before escaping. After saving the homeless people, Venom is accepted into their society and remains their protector.

In the 1993 crossover &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot;, Carnage reemerges and begins a massacre in New York City, and Brock returns to help, feeling responsible. Venom finds he is no match for Carnage, and seeks help from Spider-Man, but Spider-Man refuses to work with Venom&#x27;s violent methods. Venom, accompanied by Black Cat, Cloak, Morbius, and Spider-Man, repeatedly confront Carnage and his allies. Venom ultimately tackles Carnage into high-voltage generators, rendering Carnage unconscious and allowing his capture by the Avengers. Brock goes into hiding.

Brock returns in the 1994 limited series &quot;&quot;, in which he is captured and separated from the symbiote for a government research project. Venom&#x27;s spawn: Phage, Lasher, Scream, Riot, and Agony are revealed to still be alive and arrive to free Brock, seeking his help to gain control over their symbiotes. Brock is ultimately reunited with the symbiote, but the experience forces him to evaluate his relationship with the costume. The 1995 &quot;Planet of the Symbiotes&quot; event continued the narrative from &quot;Separation Anxiety&quot;, with Brock forcing the symbiote to leave him, concerned about how much influence it may be having on him. The symbiote unleashes a telepathic scream of sorrow and pain that attracts the other members of its species to Earth. The story follows the efforts of Brock, Spider-Man, and Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) to stop the invasion and defeat an escaped and empowered Carnage. Brock is forced to bond completely and irrevocably with the symbiote to inflict psychic trauma on the symbiotes, causing them to commit suicide.

===Return to villainy===
When Anne Weying is shot by a new Sin-Eater, Brock forces the Symbiote to bond with her to heal her injuries. In the process she temporarily becomes She-Venom but Brock demands the Symbiote return after Ann loses control and kills a pair of muggers, leaving Ann traumatized. Brock helps kill the new Sin-Eater. Ann is taken into custody by the police as they try to hunt Venom and Brock sends her his Symbiote so she can escape. As She-Venom she again struggles to control herself, with Brock, Weying and current Spider-Man Ben Reilly becoming caught in the middle of a joint DEA/FBI operation against a major drug smuggler when Weying and Brock rendezvous at the same location where the drug group are meeting. When Brock takes back the Symbiote, Anne tells him to keep himself and the Symbiote away from her after witnessing his brutality against the criminals.

Brock is captured in his sewer hideout and put on trial, with Matt Murdock acting in his defense, his symbiote held in check by a chemical inhibitor. Cletus Kassady is called as a witness, but when the case becomes heated both Kassady and Brock overcome their inhibitors. Venom, Spider-Man, and Daredevil team up and subdue Carnage. However, before the trial can continue Venom is unexpectedly taken into custody by a secret government organization offering him amnesty in exchange for him becoming their agent. Though Venom at first enjoyed his newfound immunities, he left after being abandoned during a dangerous mission. After receiving a head wound, Eddie suffers amnesia. He is later separated from the symbiote, which is presumed killed by the government Overreach Committee.

The symbiote survives and tracks down the amnesiac Brock, turning him into Venom again. Venom infiltrates Ravencroft prison seeking Carnage and absorbs the Carnage Symbiote. Brock temporarily joins the Sinister Six to get Spider-Man but after being betrayed by them, he begins hunting down the members for revenge. He ultimately cripples Sandman by biting him and taking out a chunk of his mass, leading to Sandman&#x27;s apparent death. He also causes serious wounds to Electro and Kraven the Hunter.

Venom&#x27;s rivalry with Spider-Man is renewed when Ann, who lives in fear since bonding with the Symbiote, commits suicide after seeing Brock become Venom. Venom however, believes Spider-Man swinging by Ann&#x27;s window in his black costume to be the cause. Before he can take revenge however, the Symbiote is forcefully removed from him by the human/alien hybrid Senator Ward to learn more about symbiosis. An alien race, secretly operating within the United States government, clones the Venom symbiote. Venom absorbs the clone, gains its knowledge, and decides to carry out the aliens&#x27; orders.

===Cancer and post-Venom===

The 2003 story &quot;The Hunger&quot; introduced new elements to Brock&#x27;s origin, revealing that Brock had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which feeds the symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues Spider-Man also out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than just for revenge over his lost career. Brock dies after the symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host. Spider-Man tricks the symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.

When Carnage gives birth to a new symbiote, Venom names it Toxin and hopes to turn it into an ally. When Toxin shows compassion, Venom tries to kill him. Toxin is rescued by Spider-Man and Black Cat.

In the 2004 story &quot;Venomous&quot;, Brock experiences a crisis of faith and decides to sell the symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his cancer without it, intending to donate the $100 million received from the sale to charity on the grounds that the symbiote would find another host once he dies anyway. The symbiote is purchased by crime boss Don Fortunato for his son Angelo Fortunato. Angelo briefly becomes the second Venom but proves an unworthy host, and the symbiote abandons him mid-jump allowing him to fall to his death. Upon learning of Angelo&#x27;s death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting his wrists. Brock next appeared in the 2007 story &quot;The Last Temptation of Eddie Brock&quot;, where he is rapidly succumbing to cancer, and experiencing hallucinations of &quot;Venom&quot;. Finding a comatose Aunt May in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot, the Venom hallucination persuades him to kill her. Brock, dressed in a novelty replica of Spider-Man&#x27;s black costume at the demand of &quot;Venom&quot;, murders an &quot;angel of mercy&quot; nurse to test if he can still kill, but ultimately refuses to kill May because she is innocent. When Peter visits May, he finds Eddie, who has repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of &quot;Venom&quot;. Eddie asks for Peter&#x27;s forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see &quot;Venom&quot; but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows that Brock is in control.

===Anti-Venom===

The 2008 story &quot;New Ways to Die&quot; features the return of Brock. Matt Murdock convinces a court of law that Brock is not responsible for his actions while bonded to the symbiote and has criminal charges against him dropped. Brock gets a job at a soup kitchen under Martin Li. Brock is unknowingly cured of his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, and Brock believes it to be a miracle. After Brock is attacked by the new Venom, Mac Gargan, the symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock. Brock&#x27;s skin becomes caustic to the symbiote, and he is enveloped in a new white symbiote forged from the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body bonding with his white blood cells charged with Li&#x27;s healing energy, becoming Anti-Venom. Brock defeats Gargan and nearly kills the Venom symbiote. When Brock detects remnants of the symbiote inside Spider-Man, he attempts to &quot;cure&quot; him, draining radiation from his body and nearly de-powering him. While later saving Spider-Man from Norman Osborn, Brock again fights a battle-suit enhanced Gargan and the recovering symbiote. Gargan hits Anti-Venom with his stinger, injecting a poisonous formula that seemingly destroys Brock&#x27;s suit. When Gargan attempts to kill Brock, the Venom symbiote stops him. Brock&#x27;s Anti-Venom suit later reforms.

Brock later faces Negative and discovers that he and Li are the same person. Learning that the man he idolized is a supervillain causes a breakdown for Brock, making him question his faith, referring to himself as a monster. After this revelation he becomes increasingly unstable mentally, murdering small-time criminals as he did during his &quot;lethal protector&quot; days. He briefly and reluctantly teams up with the Punisher to stop a drug cartel that kidnapped a friend of Brock&#x27;s. In &quot;The Return of Anti-Venom&quot; (2011), Brock is unable to expose Negative&#x27;s true identity, believing no one will trust him. Anti-Venom starts a crusade against Negative, attacking his criminal operations. When Anti-Venom realizes that May Parker also knows Negative&#x27;s identity, he decides to attack Negative directly before Negative can silence her. Brock teams up with Spider-Man and the new Wraith to fight Negative. Wraith uses her technology to publicly reveal Mister Negative is Martin Li, sending him into hiding. Spider-Man and Anti-Venom call a truce to their rivalry.

In a 2011 &quot;New Avengers&quot; storyline, Brock joins Wonder Man&#x27;s Revengers to destroy the New Avengers. During the 2011 &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline in which 99% of New York City&#x27;s population are transformed into spiders mind-controlled by Adriana Soria, Brock is forced to sacrifice the symbiote—and being Anti-Venom—so that it can be converted into a powerful curative capable of healing the infected millions.

===Bonded to Toxin===
A powerless Brock returns in &quot;Venom&quot; vol. 2 #15 (2012), where he kills the symbiotes Hybrid and Scream as part of a crusade to destroy the aliens entirely, believing them to be evil. After failing to kill the newest Venom, Brock is captured by the villain Crime Master and forcibly bonded with the Toxin symbiote. Brock (who is being controlled by the Toxin symbiote) then tracks down Venom and attempts to kill him, but is defeated. Eddie and Agent Venom face off once more at Crime Master&#x27;s HQ, and Flash is able to subdue Toxin and separate Eddie from the symbiote using a flamethrower. Just before Flash can get Eddie out, the Toxin symbiote grabs hold of him and drags him into the flames. Eddie and the Toxin symbiote both survive the flames and track Flash to Philadelphia. Now in control of the Toxin symbiote, he confronts Flash in the high school where he works as a gym teacher. After helping Flash defend the students from a group of cybernetic parasites, Eddie forms a truce with him, promising to leave Flash alone as long as he has the Venom symbiote under control (similar to the truce he had with Spider-Man). Eddie subsequently leaves Philadelphia to resume his vigilante activities.

While fighting a drug cartel, Brock is approached by FBI agent Claire Dixon and invited to join the team she has assembled to hunt down and capture Cletus Kasady, which also includes John Jameson, and Manuela Calderon, a survivor of one of Kasady&#x27;s massacres, although Brock secretly plans to kill Kasady. After Kasady&#x27;s defeat, Brock gives up the Toxin symbiote.

===Return as Venom===
Eddie Brock decides to help the FBI against the new villainous Venom. With the FBI and Spider-Man, Brock is able to separate the symbiote from its new host, Lee Price. In the process, Spider-Man&#x27;s actions cause the symbiote to rekindle its previous hatred for him. Brock then breaks the symbiote out of custody and bonds with it again, declaring his love for it and now regularly referring to it as &quot;my darling&quot; and &quot;love&quot;. After stopping a robbery, Brock encounters Scorpion and manages to defeat him, until the symbiote takes him to a church and reveals that it attacked the priest. After finding out about a monster attack, Brock encounters a dinosaur at the church and discovers it belongs to Alchemax. While talking to Alchemax&#x27;s CEO Liz Allan, he learns that the mastermind is Stegron the Dinosaur Man. Brock then finds his lair, but is spotted and captured by Stegron&#x27;s dinosaurs. Venom found that remnants of Stegron&#x27;s Dinosaur People experiments were living in the sewers, and he had to defend them from Kraven the Hunter, Shriek, and the NYPD. With help from Tana of the Dinosaur People, Venom states to the NYPD that the Dinosaur People were surviving in the sewers and that they were not killing anyone. Upon hearing this, the NYPD arrest Kraven the Hunter and Shriek with the police captain stating that he will have a lot of paperwork to file on this.

During the Venom Inc. storyline, Eddie helps Spider-Man, Black Cat, and Flash Thompson (now under the guise of Agent Anti-Venom) take down Lee Price again, who had bonded himself with Venom&#x27;s clone Mania and was using it to take over the New York criminal underground. Eddie then tells Black Cat to give up her criminal empire, telling her that New York City always needs more heroes.

In the &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; storyline, Eddie is blackmailed by J. Jonah Jameson into helping defend Spider-Man&#x27;s inner circle against Norman Osborn, who has bonded himself with the Carnage symbiote to become the Red Goblin. Jameson sends Eddie to defend Mary Jane Watson at Stark Tower and while she does not trust him, Mary Jane disables Stark Tower&#x27;s anti symbiote defenses to allow Eddie to fight Norman. Spider-Man arrives and teams up again with Eddie to stop Red Goblin, but the villain overpowers them both. With nothing left to offer in the fight against Osborn and Carnage, Eddie allows Peter to take the Venom symbiote for himself to even the odds against his foe. Because of his offering and valiant defense of Mary Jane, Spider-Man forgives Eddie for everything he had done to him in the past.

In &quot;Venom: First Host&quot;, Venom after gave birth to its last offspring (described by Venom to Eddie as &quot;our child&quot;), Eddie gets attacked by a Warbride Skrull until a Kree intervened and started battling the Skrull. Eddie got convinced by the symbiote to save the &quot;blue skin&quot;, so he stopped the Skrull and saved the Kree. At Alchemax, the Kree revealed to Eddie that his name is Tel-Kar and that he was Venom&#x27;s first host. When the symbiote refused to go back to Tel-Kar, infuriated Tel-Kar threatened them that he would bond to the offspring and transform it into a monster, if he did not get &quot;his&quot; symbiote back. Venom who loved its child got back with Tel-Kar and then he went to his spaceship. Then Eddie confronted the Skrull who had attacked them and she introduced herself as M&#x27;Lanz and tells him that she was tasked to stop Tel-Kar. She reveals to Eddie that Tel-Kar&#x27;s body was biologically altered so he would have full control over Venom&#x27;s mind. Then the offspring bonded to Eddie calling itself Sleeper and him with M&#x27;Lanz went after Tel-Kar. They went to a Skrull research lab which contained a deadly bioweapon that Tel-Kar had planned to use on the Skrulls. When battling Tel-Kar, he separates himself from Venom because he did not need it anymore allowing Eddie to re-bond with Venom and Sleeper bonding to M&#x27;Lanz leaving Tel-Kar to explode with the lab by the Kree Empire. After M&#x27;Lanz leaves Eddie with the symbiotes on Earth, Eddie cuts every connection to Alchemax, and after that he and Harry Osborn talk for a while. Then Tel-Kar shows up in Eddie&#x27;s apartment and threatens to kill him and the humanity using the bioweapon but Sleeper steals the weapon and Tel-Kar tried to kill Sleeper, but Venom intervened and got injured. Eddie rushes to Tel-Kar throwing both of them out in the street. Suddenly Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar lobotomizing him as a punishment for what he did to them. Then Sleeper with Tel-Kar&#x27;s body bids Eddie farewell and leaves Earth to explore the cosmos.

===War with Knull===

In the &quot;Venom&quot; ongoing series, Eddie is seen struggling with the symbiote, which has returned to its violent ways. Using anti-depressants, Eddie is able to calm the symbiote and reassert control over it. While working as a freelance photographer he stumbles upon an arms deal between a gang of criminals and the mercenary Jack O&#x27;Lantern. The deal turns violent and Eddie uses the symbiote to take down Jack. The symbiote then completely overtakes Eddie, compelled by a mysterious external influence, nearly killing Jack in the process before being subdued and captured by Rex Strickland. Strickland tells Eddie that despite what was previously thought, the Venom symbiote was not the first to arrive on Earth. Strickland explains that the US Government bonded special forces operatives to symbiotes during the Vietnam War. These soldiers later went rogue, and Eddie is tasked with rescuing them and defeating their symbiotes. Though Eddie is able to locate Strickland&#x27;s men, his symbiote is again taken over by the mysterious outside influence and briefly separates from him. The symbiote again bonds with Eddie and tells him that “God is coming”.

Soon afterward, a massive dragon made up of thousands of symbiotes attacks New York City. Eddie resolves to stop the monster before it destroys the city. Before he can intervene he is attacked by Miles Morales, who uses his Venom Blast to break Venom out of the &quot;symbiote god&#x27;s&quot; influence. Miles and Eddie form a temporary truce, and the two manage to temporarily stop the symbiote god&#x27;s rampage. The symbiote god then reveals itself as a being named Knull. Knull separates Eddie from his symbiote, promising to purge the influence of humanity from it. But then Miles attacked Knull and both Eddie with Venom and Miles started falling until Venom grew a pair of wings and saved Eddie and Miles. After leaving Miles behind, Eddie went to Rex and put a hole in his head revealing that Rex was actually the symbiote (&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;) that was bonded to the original Rex Strickland. After that, they tricked the dragon to come to them and started attacking it with sonic-based weapons which weaken it. Then Eddie puts the dragon with Rex in the furnace and incinerated it to death, while Eddie and Venom got wounded in the process.

Eddie Brock recovers, and the Maker interrogates him about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and Knull while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that he is familiar with. In addition, he also talked about how the Venom symbiote was in a feral state and has been deleting Eddie&#x27;s bad memories like when he found out that his father had remarried and has a child named Dylan Brock. When Maker throws a scalpel at Eddie Brock, the Venom symbiote emerges from his shirt and catches it. Though the Venom symbiote is currently brain dread. When Eddie asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the Symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late Flash Thompson. As Maker comments that he has ways of extracting the information he needs, Eddie asks in a distraught voice if Flash is really dead. Sometime after, Maker reveals to Eddie that he got hold of Venom&#x27;s remnants left in Flash&#x27;s body prior to becoming Anti-Venom, which contained his genetic memory, and tells Eddie that it can help restore the symbiote. Maker also tells to Eddie that he&#x27;s planning to get more samples from Flash&#x27;s dead body, but Eddie who now considers Flash as a brother unleashes the symbiote to Maker and gets the sample. Afterward, he tries to escape the facility, but the sample goes to his symbiote taking the form of Flash&#x27;s version of the suit. Now the symbiote with the mind of Flash Thompson helps Eddie to escape and then Eddie goes to Flash&#x27;s grave to admit that Flash was a better host than him.

After a failed attempt to win his father&#x27;s affection, he gets to know Dylan, until he got seriously sick. Then Dylan takes Eddie to a hospital, where Maker found him again. After a confrontation with the symbiote, he recovers the memories that the symbiote had erased finds out that Dylan is actually his own son with Anne Weying. During Malekith&#x27;s invasion on Earth, Eddie temporarily uses the Dark Elf Witch&#x27;s totem to transform into a Venom-look alike, and immediately resist being the Accursed elf&#x27;s servant at will.

After being framed by a resurrected Knullified Cletus Kasady for the murder of Lee Price, Eddie and Dylan are on the run and rescued by Venom, while seeking help from many available superheroes in New York, such as Peter, Miles, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers, including the villains Mac Gargan and Maker, in order for Dylan, as well as Normie Osborn to be tested if they have symbiote codex within them. Upon learning his son is Knull&#x27;s current vessel and would be his host, Eddie and Dylan were originally with Maker but was interrupted by a mysterious bounty hunter in a painted War Machine Mark III suit named &quot;Virus&quot; (who is actually Mac Gargan), and both Eddie and Dylan end up in a universe overrun by Knullified heroes and villains led by Codex (the fallen alternate universe&#x27;s Dylan). He and Dylan are rescued by Agent Symbiotes (such as the alternate Anne Weying, Spider-Man, Deadpool, and a reformed Cletus Kasady/Carnage) and Mr. Fantastic. Dylan eventually learns that not only he is Eddie&#x27;s son, but also Anne&#x27;s. With temporary help from the prime universe&#x27;s Mac Gargan, Dylan manages to purify his older counterpart and free the Earth. One year later after spending time with alternate Anne, at a time when Eddie and Dylan return to prime Earth, they happened to learn Knull has been re-awakened and begin a full-scale invasion on Earth.

===Reign as King in Black===

After Eddie subsequently kills Knull, he becomes a human symbiote and the new King in Black, along with a council of the &quot;Kings in Black&quot; consisting of his future selves Tyro, Wilde, Finnegan, Bedlam, Meridius, and The Eventuality (all caught in a time loop), while Venom joins up with Dylan, with father and son (and future selves) eventually being drawn into &quot;war&quot; with one another.

===Bonded to Carnage===
Eddie returns in &quot;Eddie Brock: Carnage&quot;, now bonded to the Carnage symbiote, who he has come to see himself as father to, relinquishing his throne as the King in Black as Eddie elects to train Carnage to become a violent anti-hero.

==Powers and abilities==

Eddie Brock is a human and has no superpowers without the Symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.

After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human. Brock&#x27;s cancer is cured in the 2008 story &quot;New Ways to Die&quot;, and he is later shown with a restored large physique. He is also shown to be a proficient fighter and capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered enemies.

In an interview, David Michelinie stated that the reason Brock was written to be at the peak of human physical condition in the Marvel Universe was because editor Jim Salicrup felt that having an average human with no super powers becoming stronger than Spider-Man by simply bonding with the Symbiote did not seem believable. Michelinie later clarified in the interview that a healthy Eddie Brock is stronger without super powers than Peter Parker is without his super powers, which explains how the Symbiote is able to make him stronger than Spider-Man. Michelinie later toyed with this concept in early Venom stories in The Amazing Spider-Man such as &quot;Venom vs. Spider-Man Round 2&quot; and &quot;Venom Returns&quot;. In both of these stories Eddie is seen lifting weights and training himself without the help of the symbiote, remarking that making himself inherently stronger and more fit will enable the symbiote to grant him even greater super strength, speed, and agility.

Once Eddie became the new King in Black, he attended almost god-like abilities through the symbiotes Hive Mind. It granted him near omnipresent powers through the eyes of billions of symbiotes and is also capable of remote-piloting the symbiotes, though with consent unlike Knull, no matter how far away they in the universe. He also discover that he can access through the memories of the symbiotes (including his own memories), some that which are from history or even beyond dimensions; Eddie even believe that with time and patience, he may be able to travel through and even change certain events. The only consequence to obtaining this new status is that due to being a human, his body is already rapidly aging due to connecting to the hive for the past few months.

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote&#x27;s former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man&#x27;s. However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate. The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance. When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense, preventing the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.

Venom&#x27;s body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons, bullets, and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will, and camouflage itself, even emulating water. It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked. This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children. The Symbiote is capable of healing any injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise-mortal damage. The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote being able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock&#x27;s white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities. Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain. However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li. Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill and &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;cleanse&quot; them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person&#x27;s body. Following a failed attempt to &quot;cure&quot; Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man&#x27;s powers whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.

As Anti-Venom, Brock&#x27;s suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve. He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing super strength, speed, negating Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense, and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives. He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises, form items such as shields, extend his reach, attack from a distance, and create tendrils. Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound. The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic &quot;super venom&quot; created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom&#x27;s suit, and Mr. Negative&#x27;s energy. The &quot;super venom&quot; causes the suit to immediately dissolve. Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.

Dubbing himself Venom, Brock battles Spider-Man, only to be driven back by air horns. In the episode &quot;Venom Returns&quot;, Brock takes Parker&#x27;s friends and acquaintances hostage and exposes his secret identity, but Miles Morales dons a spare Spider-Man costume to refute the claim. Spider-Man defeats Venom using a sonic device to destabilize the symbiote, which also leaves Brock in a coma.

===Film===

====Sam Raimi film series====
* Eddie Brock appears in a deleted scene in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), portrayed by R.C. Everbeck. Additionally, an &quot;Eddie&quot; is referenced as a photographer employed by the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; who was unable to obtain pictures of Spider-Man, to J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s disdain. Brock also makes a brief appearance in the film&#x27;s novelization when Peter Parker first meets Jameson.
* Eddie Brock appears in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), portrayed by Topher Grace. This version is a freelance photographer, Peter Parker&#x27;s rival at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, and in a relationship with Gwen Stacy. After Peter is bonded to an alien symbiote and it negatively influences his behavior, he exposes Brock for falsifying a photograph to incriminate Spider-Man as a criminal to get a staff photographer job at the &quot;Bugle&quot;, resulting in Brock getting fired and blacklisted from every newspaper in New York City. Upon seeing Peter dating Gwen, Brock heads to a church and prays for God to kill Peter before bonding with the symbiote after Peter rejects it and becomes Venom. Now knowing Peter is Spider-Man, Venom finds and allies with Sandman to kill the webslinger before kidnapping Mary Jane Watson to use her as bait for a trap. The New Goblin joins the fray to help Spider-Man, but Venom knocks him off of his glider and attempts to kill Peter with it. However, the New Goblin sacrifices himself to save the webslinger. Peter eventually realizes the symbiote is vulnerable to high-frequency soundwaves and separates it from Brock using steel pipes. Just as Peter throws one of the New Goblin&#x27;s pumpkin bombs at the symbiote, Brock attempts to rejoin it and is killed along with it.
* In July 2007, a spin-off of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; following Brock was being developed, with Topher Grace being considered to reprise his role. In September 2008, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese signed on to write. Marvel Entertainment would have produced the film, but the project was ultimately cancelled. In March 2012, plans for a new solo film emerged. Josh Trank was in talks to direct after Gary Ross left the project.

==== Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe ====

* In March 2016, Sony hired Dante Harper to write the solo film&#x27;s script with Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach producing. At the time, the film was not planned to have any connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Spider-Man. A year later, following the success of Spider-Man&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), Sony announced &quot;Venom&quot; (2018). Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinker were hired to write the script and make the film the first in a series of Spider-Man character-related spin-off films called the &quot;Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters&quot;, later renamed to Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe. In May 2017, Tom Hardy signed on to portray Eddie Brock and Ruben Fleischer was set to direct. Additionally, voice actor Brad Venable provides additional voice work for Venom. In June 2017, Amy Pascal claimed that the film would be &quot;adjunct&quot; to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
* Hardy reprised his role as Brock in &quot;&quot; (2021). The film was released on October 1, 2021.

Jonah Jameson expose Spider-Man&#x27;s true identity as Peter Parker, as seen in the films &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). In the latter film&#x27;s mid-credits scene, Eddie and Venom begin to familiarize themselves with the new universe they found themselves in, learning about its heroes and a major event known as the Blip, only to be suddenly taken back to their home universe by Doctor Strange. However, the pair inadvertently leave behind a piece of the symbiote.

<doc id="359328" wikidata="Q891856" url="?curid=359328" title="Brighton hotel bombing">
<text>On 12 October 1984 the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) attempted to assassinate members of the British government, including the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England. Five people were killed, including the Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry; more than thirty people were injured. Thatcher was uninjured. The bombing was a key moment in the Troubles, the conflict in Northern Ireland between unionists and republicans over the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, which took place between the late 1960s and 1998.

The IRA decided to assassinate Thatcher during the 1981 Irish hunger strike. Her stance against the return of Special Category Status to republican prisoners—the status that meant they were treated as political prisoners, rather than as criminals—meant the strike was not quickly settled, and ten prisoners died. After two years of planning, including reconnoitering the 1982 and 1983 Conservative Party Conferences, a long-delay time bomb was planted in the hotel by the IRA member Patrick Magee over three weeks before the 1984 conference. The IRA knew the hotel would be occupied by Thatcher and many of her cabinet.

The bomb exploded at 2:54 am when most guests were in bed. The force of the explosion was upwards and broke through the roof, dislodging one of the hotel&#x27;s chimney stacks, which weighed . This crashed through several floors, killing or injuring many of the occupants. Thatcher decided to continue the conference as normal, and was given a standing ovation by delegates as she entered the stage just six and a half hours after the explosion.

The investigation took eight months. A partial palm print was found on the room registration card from when Magee checked in and police surveillance on IRA members led them to him. In 1986 he was tried, found guilty and sent to prison for eight concurrent life sentences, with the recommendation that he serve at least thirty-five years before being considered for parole. He was released under licence in June 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement. Negotiations between the British and Irish governments that had begun in 1980 continued despite the bombing, although the pace of the talks was slowed to ensure it did not appear that the British government was conceding to pressure because of the bomb. They resulted in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave the Irish government an advisory role in Northern Ireland&#x27;s government.

==Background==
===The Troubles in the late 1970s and 1980s===
The Troubles were the conflict in Northern Ireland that began in the late 1960s between the majority population of unionists and the republican minority. The unionists—also known as loyalists—wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the UK; Irish republicans wanted Northern Ireland to leave the UK and join a united Ireland. According to the political scientist Stephen Kelly, four events impacted the approach and policies towards Northern Ireland of Margaret Thatcher, the leader of the Opposition and then prime minister: the assassination of Airey Neave; the assassination of Lord Mountbatten and the Warrenpoint ambush, which took place on the same day; and the 1981 Irish hunger strike.

In March 1979 Neave, the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, was assassinated by the Irish National Liberation Army in a car bomb attack in the Palace of Westminster. Neave was a friend and political mentor to Thatcher, who was described by her biographer Jonathan Aitken as being &quot;numb with shock&quot; at the news of his death.

On 27 August 1979—less than four months after Thatcher became prime minister—Mountbatten was killed by a bomb on his fishing boat, off the coast of Mullaghmore, County Sligo, in the Irish Republic. The device had been planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). On the same day, the IRA also killed eighteen British soldiers near Warrenpoint, with two bombs—the highest loss of life suffered in a single incident by the British Army during the Troubles.

In March 1981 Bobby Sands, an IRA member who was imprisoned at the Maze prison, Northern Ireland, went on hunger strike for the return of Special Category Status (SCS) to prisoners. SCS involved treating those prisoners under different, more favourable, conditions with the status of political prisoners rather than as criminals. It included not having to wear prison uniform and being able to freely associate with other prisoners. While on hunger strike, Sands stood in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election and won. Thatcher remained unmoved on the point of allowing Special Category Status and said &quot;There can be no question of political status for someone who is serving a sentence for crime. Crime is crime is crime: it is not political, it is crime, and there can be no question of granting political status&quot;. Ten men died of starvation before the strike came to an end. Sands was the first to die, which he did on 5 May 1981, after 66 days of starvation; his death led to rioting in republican areas of Northern Ireland.

Because of the hunger strikes and the deaths of those involved, Thatcher was reviled by Irish republicans. According to the political scientist Richard English, Thatcher was &quot;a republican hate-figure of Cromwellian proportions&quot;. English highlights as examples comments about Thatcher from the IRA member Danny Morrison: &quot;that , self-righteous fucker&quot; and &quot;the biggest bastard we have ever known&quot;. Because of her staunch unionist position and because they considered her responsible for the deaths of the hunger strikers, the IRA leadership decided to try to assassinate her before the hunger strikes ended.
===Thatcher&#x27;s approach to Northern Ireland, 1979–1984===

Thatcher&#x27;s outlook on Northern Ireland came from an inherently unionist position; she wanted a military victory over the IRA and &quot;integration&quot;, that is, treating Northern Ireland like the rest of the UK, rather than having separate laws and political processes. Her support for integration, however, was abandoned after Neave&#x27;s death and after she came to power. According to Eamonn Kennedy, the Irish ambassador to the UK between 1978 and 1983, the murder of Neave and the deaths of British soldiers &quot;left deep psychological scars&quot; on her Irish outlook.

Thatcher&#x27;s unionist stance was intuitive; in her autobiography she wrote &quot;My own instincts are profoundly Unionist. ... But, then, any Conservative should in his bones be a Unionist too. Our party has always, throughout its history, been committed to the defence of the Union.&quot; Kelly considers that &quot;Thatcher&#x27;s attitude to Northern Ireland was a powerful blend of reactionary policies and personal indifference.&quot; She admitted ignorance of the nuances of Northern Irish politics, and said in her memoirs &quot;But what British politician will ever fully understand Northern Ireland?&quot;

According to Kelly, the focal point of Thatcher&#x27;s hardline approach to Northern Ireland was security and the need to defeat paramilitary—specifically republican—violence. There was flexibility in her approach, however. During the hunger strikes, she personally gave the go-ahead for secret talks with the IRA to bring about a negotiated end to the strike. In 1980, despite saying publicly that the Irish Republic had no right to interfere with the UK&#x27;s governing of Northern Ireland, she met Charles Haughey, the (the Irish prime minister), to discuss the relationship.

===Patrick Magee===

Patrick Magee was born in Belfast in 1951 and moved to Norwich, Norfolk, when he was two. In 1971 he returned to Belfast, and joined the IRA in 1972 after attending a —an illicit drinking den—in the Unity Flats area of Belfast, raided by British soldiers. He was beaten and detained for thirty-six hours without charge; in 2001 he said the incident left him with &quot;a sense of anger. Real anger. I felt I just couldn&#x27;t walk away from this&quot;. He was soon assigned to be one of the IRA&#x27;s &quot;engineering officers&quot;, the organisation&#x27;s term for a bomb maker. He was interned (detained without trial) at Long Kesh prison from June 1973 to November 1975. In the mid-1970s the IRA changed its structure from a battalion to a cell-based system. Each cell—also called an active service unit (ASU)—normally comprised four volunteers, of which only the leader was in contact with the level above. At this time Magee joined the England Department, the IRA&#x27;s ASU that operated in England. He was periodically active there between 1978 and 1979, and in 1983.

In 1983 Magee was part of the ASU that planned to bomb the Eagle and Child pub in Lancashire, popular with soldiers as it was situated next to Weeton Barracks. His IRA handler in England was Raymond O&#x27;Connor, who rented a flat for Magee and a comrade, and drove the pair to the location to view the target. O&#x27;Connor had been arrested by Lancashire Special Branch the previous year and been identified as a member of the IRA; he had been recruited by police as an informer and was passing details of Magee&#x27;s mission to them. Magee and his comrade became suspicious of O&#x27;Connor and realised they were under surveillance; they returned to Dublin. When the pair told their IRA superiors that they had been followed, they were not believed. Magee later wrote that &quot;There was a suspicion at home that we had panicked. No one could credit that we had narrowly escaped a trap. ... It appeared my operational days were over. I remember saying as much to a comrade, who agreed.&quot;

==Build-up==
Having decided to assassinate Thatcher, IRA intelligence officers began to monitor her movements and security arrangements. In 1982 two IRA volunteers went to the Conservative Party conference in Brighton, on Britain&#x27;s south coast. Magee and another IRA member visited Blackpool on the north-west coast, where the 1983 conference was scheduled to take place. It was decided to make the attempt in 1984 when the conference would be back in Brighton. After police arrested two members of the England Department—Thomas Quigley and Paul Kavannagh—Magee was selected as the bomb maker.

On 15 September 1984—some four weeks before the Conservative Party Conference—Magee registered at the Grand Hotel in Brighton under the pseudonym &quot;Roy Walsh&quot;. He used the name of the IRA bomber who had been convicted for his role in the IRA&#x27;s 1973 Old Bailey bombing. After completing the hotel&#x27;s registration card, Magee gave a false address (27 Braxfield Road, London, SE4), stated he was English, omitted his passport details and paid £180 for three nights&#x27; stay. He asked for, and was given, room 629, on the sixth floor; he asked for an upper floor as he thought that would be where Thatcher would stay. The higher level was because the IRA planners thought Thatcher would want for additional security in case striking miners took over areas of the hotel.

On the day he arrived Magee had lunch at the hotel&#x27;s restaurant with a man named &quot;The Pope&quot;. The man visited Magee over the following three days but did not stay overnight. Two female IRA couriers delivered bomb materials to the room; neither of the women nor the other man have been identified. The journalist Rory Carroll, who wrote a history of the bombing, considers that &quot;It is unlikely that more than four people were involved&quot;. According to Magee, the bomb comprised of gelignite; security forces later erroneously said it was of Semtex. The device was fitted with a long-delay timer, such as the type used in videocassette recorders. The timing unit was battery powered and a Memo Park timer was also incorporated into the device; Carroll considers the timer was probably part of an anti-handling device, designed to counter any interference by a bomb disposal team if the device was found before detonation.

To mask the smell of the explosives—a distinctive aroma similar to almonds—the device was wrapped in several layers of plastic. Once the bomb was set, Magee removed the side panel of the bath and placed the device within the space. He and his colleagues finished around 10:00 pm on 17 September, and ordered a bottle of vodka and three bottles of Coca-Cola to be delivered to the room. He spent the third night in the room and checked out at around 9:00 am the following day.

==Conference and explosion, 9–12 October 1984==

The conference began on 9 October 1984 and was scheduled to last four days; Thatcher&#x27;s speech was scheduled for the final day. Thatcher was staying in the hotel&#x27;s Napoleon Suite, three rooms with a sea view on the first floor. Her staff set up an office in rooms across the corridor. Before her arrival, a police dog and handler searched the suite and other rooms on the first floor, but none of the rooms on the other floors. The search was cursory; the officer spent only thirty minutes in her rooms. The officer later recalled that the suite had staff and aides walking in and out while he worked. Uniformed and plainclothes police were posted in and outside the hotel.

On the evening of 11 October Norman Tebbit—secretary of state for trade and industry—and his wife Margaret attended a reception hosted by Alistair McAlpine, the treasurer of the Conservative Party; they left at around midnight and returned to their room. A ball was being held in nearby Top Rank ballroom, which Thatcher visited for 45 minutes, returning to the hotel at about 11:45 pm. In her suite, she continued to work on her conference speech. She finished at around 2:45 am and decided to work on some government business with Robin Butler, her principal private secretary, before going to bed. She went to the toilet and returned to her desk at 2:52 am.

The bomb exploded at 2:54 am on 12 October 1984. The occupants of room 629 were Donald Maclean—the president of the Scottish Conservatives—and his wife Muriel; they were in bed at the time. She was blown sideways by the blast; he was blown upwards. In the neighbouring room, 628, Lady Shattock, the wife of Sir Gordon Shattock, the Western Area chairman of the Conservative Party, was bending over the bath; the wall between the bathroom of 629 and 628 disintegrated, and fragments of the ceramic tiles were &quot;driven into her body like bullets&quot;, according to an army explosives expert. She was decapitated and her body was blown across the corridor into room 638. Her husband fell through the collapsing floors down to the basement but survived.

The force of the explosion going upward broke through the roof and dislodged one of the hotel&#x27;s chimney stacks; tall, it weighed . It fell through the roof, through the rooms ending in 28 and clipping those ending in 29. The bomb and the falling chimney took out much of the front of the building, creating a hole deep and wide. As the chimney fell through the roof, it destroyed all the rooms ending in 28. First was 528 where Eric Taylor—the North-West Area chairman of the Conservative Party—was staying; he was killed. Room 428 accommodated John Wakeham, the chief whip; his wife Roberta was killed. In room 328 Sir Anthony Berry, the deputy chief whip, was also killed. In 228 was Norman Tebbit and his wife Margaret. Tebbit later recalled:

the ceiling came crashing down on us and then, in a hail of debris, the floor collapsed, catapulting us down under an avalanche of bricks, timber and plaster. The force of the impact was indescribable—blow after blow as the debris smashed on to my left side. Something tore into my abdomen with a terrible blow and I heard my very guts sloshing inside me. There was a colossal impact tearing a great hole in my side, then I stopped falling—with no idea where, nor even which way up I was, as the debris cascaded down.

Thatcher&#x27;s room was below the Tebbits&#x27;; her bathroom was badly damaged but she, her husband and Robin Butler were all uninjured. According to Carroll, the bomb &quot;did not even scratch her. But it came very, very close.&quot; He theorised that if she had still been in the bathroom, &quot;she would have been cut to ribbons, perhaps fatally&quot;.

==Immediate aftermath, 12 October 1984==

Sussex Police and the East Sussex Fire Brigade were soon on the scene. One of the first policemen to arrive, Paul Parton, later described what he remembered:

As we got closer and the dust was starting to settle, you could see [a policeman] laying on the ground, being supported by other policemen, people screaming, hanging off balconies, alarm bells ringing, water pouring out of broken pipes, and you could see the people up on the balcony. It was horrific.

On arrival with three fire engines, station officer Fred Bishop of the fire brigade requested ten more and as many ambulances as could be spared. Although fire brigade regulations for attending a bombing were that, unless there was a fire in progress, the fire engines were to park two streets away, maintain radio silence and wait for the bomb squad, Bishop and his crew entered the hotel. Throughout the night they tunnelled through areas of the debris to rescue the people trapped in the rubble. Muriel Maclean was found with her right leg mangled; she was rescued but died of her injuries a month later.

Inside the hotel, the Thatchers, Butler, several cabinet ministers with their partners and the Conservative secretarial staff who were still working, made their way downstairs and left the hotel through the rear entrance; they were taken to Brighton police station, which was thought the most secure place for them. Several other cabinet members were also taken to the police station, where Thatcher announced that the party conference would continue at 9:00 am. She, her husband and secretary spent the night at Lewes police college.
After the explosion Tebbit and his wife ended up next to each other, above the hotel&#x27;s reception, both alive but buried under tonnes of rubble; they held hands and talked to each other for comfort. Margaret was rescued first. She had a broken neck and was paralysed from the neck down; she had to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life because of her injuries. At 6:53 am Tebbit was finally taken out of the hotel in his pyjamas and on a stretcher; his extraction was caught on cameras as they were broadcasting live for breakfast television. The images, according to Carroll, &quot;became a defining drama of the Brighton bomb&quot;. Tebbit had severe injuries to his ribs, shoulder and pelvis. The final casualty, John Wakeham, was extracted from under timber and rubble in the foyer, having fallen from the fourth floor. Casualties were lighter than the emergency services first expected; only thirty-three people were treated in hospital. Injuries included broken bones, lacerations and crush injuries.

Magee was staying with republican sympathisers in Cork; he heard the news of the explosion at 6:00 am. Writing in 2019 he recalled that &quot;my immediate emotion was relief. Relief that the device had worked&quot;. That morning the IRA Army Council issued a statement:

The IRA claims responsibility for the detonation of 100lb of gelignite in Brighton against the British cabinet and Tory warmongers. Thatcher will now realise that Britain cannot occupy our country, torture our prisoners and shoot our people in their own streets and get away with it.Today we were unlucky, but remember we have only to be lucky once, you will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no war.

Many of the conference attendees had lost their clothes in the hotel. With the conference due to restart at 9:00 am that morning, McAlpine hired a coach and several taxis to take them to a local branch of Marks &amp; Spencer at 8:00 am, which he had arranged to be opened early for them. The Conservative Party paid for new clothes for them and had them back at the conference centre for it to open. Observing this, the BBC producer Ivor Gaber said, &quot;If you ever want to understand how the Conservatives always win elections, you just watch the organisation.&quot; The conference started at 9:30 am with a standing ovation for Thatcher as she arrived on stage, followed by a two-minute silence. At 2:00 pm she gave her close-of-conference speech, which opened with comments on the bombing:

The bomb attack on the Grand Hotel early this morning was first and foremost an inhuman, undiscriminating attempt to massacre innocent unsuspecting men and women staying in Brighton for our Conservative Conference. ... [The bomb] was an attempt not only to disrupt and terminate our Conference; it was an attempt to cripple Her Majesty&#x27;s democratically-elected Government. That is the scale of the outrage in which we have all shared, and the fact that we are gathered here now—shocked, but composed and determined—is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.

==Reactions==
The attack was condemned by world leaders. This included denunciation from Garret FitzGerald, the taoiseach, who called the bombing &quot;a gross miscalculation of the character of the British people and the nature of British democracy&quot;. Thatcher&#x27;s decision to continue with the conference was supported by her domestic political opponents, including Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party, David Steel of the Liberal Party and David Owen of the Social Democratic Party. Kinnock said &quot;That is the way we must respond to such vile acts in this democracy. There can be no concessions to the murdering madness of those who commit crimes like this bombing.&quot; The political historians Ioana Emy Matesan and Ronit Berger consider that although there was some domestic condemnation, &quot;overall the public condemnation was fairly weak&quot;. They suggest that &quot;it seems as though since the target was the Conservative party, there was no widespread public condemnation and no rise in public fear of being targeted&quot;. The singer Morrissey commented &quot;The only sorrow of the Brighton bombing is that Thatcher escaped unscathed.&quot; In 1998 the author and comedy scriptwriter John O&#x27;Farrell wrote &quot;I felt a surge of excitement at the nearness of her demise and yet disappointment that such a chance had been missed. This was me—the pacifist, anti-capital-punishment, anti-IRA liberal—wishing that they had got her.&quot; The bombing was celebrated in some quarters. Republican prisoners in the Maze prison celebrated the news of the explosion with cheers of &quot;Fuck Thatcher&quot; and &quot;Up the &#x27;Ra&quot;.

The British press was mostly condemnatory of the attack. Caroll identifies xenophobic references in the reports, including &quot;The Sunday Express&quot;″s rhetorical question &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you rather admit to being a pig than to being Irish?&quot; &quot;The Sun&quot; said the bombers &quot;must be hunted remorselessly and exterminated like rats&quot;. &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Republic&quot;)—the republican newspaper published by Sinn Féin, the political party associated with the IRA—ran the headline &quot;IRA Blitz Brits&quot;. The bombing was front page news and appeared on news reports globally; most of the leading articles in newspapers were condemnatory of the attack, although some of those in countries hostile to Britain and Thatcher, such as North Korea, took the opportunity to attack her. The editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; highlighted the possibility that the funds for the bombing may have come from US donors, and considered that &quot;Americans of conscience must reject this violence and reject association with the killers whose cowardly acts of murder and mayhem are despised on both sides of the Atlantic&quot;. Similarly, the editorial of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;the IRA has turned overseas for support it cannot find in Dublin, playing on the gullibility of a small minority among the 40 million Americans of Irish descent&quot;. In an editorial condemnatory of the IRA and the bombing, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; focused on the ongoing talks between the British and Irish governments and wrote of their hope that &quot;no bombs, no horrors, no attempts by nihilists to destroy the hope of peace, must be allowed to deflect the process&quot;.

==Investigation and Magee&#x27;s actions, 12 October 1984 – 22 June 1985==
===October 1984 to January 1985===
The investigation began at daybreak on the morning of 12 October, with police forensics teams examining the seafront and roadway directly in front of the hotel. They were unable to access the interior until the fire brigade had found the final missing guest. This turned out to be the body of Jeanne Shattock, which was located either in the evening of 12 October, or the following day. Police instructed the firemen to leave her body in situ as the location was a crime scene. Forensic teams went through the rubble, sifting and searching as they went. Over of rubble was collected in nearly 3,800 plastic dustbins and sent to the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment at Fort Halstead, Kent. Once there, it was sieved again and forensically analysed.

In the basement of the hotel, the police located the registration cards of the previous guests of the hotel; pre-computerisation of the booking system, these were the only records of those who had stayed at the Grand. After two weeks of searching, a part of the Memo Park timer was located in the U-bend of the toilet in room 329. The police searches of the hotel lasted until 30 October. The Anti-Terrorist Branch of the police informed the investigation team of an IRA cache found in Salcey Forest which had a missing timer that was possibly set to twenty-four days, six hours and thirty-six minutes. The cache had been found in January 1984 in buried dustbins that contained arms and bomb-making equipment. The haul included submachine guns, handguns, grenades, ArmaLite ammunition, mercury tilt switches and six long-delay timers, numbered between one and seven, with number four missing. All were pre-set for the same length delay. This would have meant placing the bomb on 17 September. Looking at the registration cards for the four rooms at the epicentre of the explosion—rooms 528, 529, 628 and 629—for that day, they investigated the people who had stayed on that date and established that the card for Roy Walsh showed a false name. The registration card was fingerprinted and showed a partial palm print; in January 1985 this matched with prints taken for Magee when he had been arrested in Norwich in 1967.

===January to June 1985===
With no knowledge of where Magee was, the information that he was the bomber was kept secret within the investigation team. Surveillance by the RUC Special Branch and the Garda Síochána on Magee&#x27;s wife—the RUC while she was still in Northern Ireland; the Garda when she crossed the border to the Republic—had located Magee in Ballymun, an outer suburb in the north of Dublin. Rather than request extradition to the UK, the British government, police and security services decided to wait until Magee returned to the UK. The British government chose not to tell their Irish counterparts that Magee was the bomber, but instead had the police ask the Garda to keep him under surveillance.

In 1985 the IRA planned a series of bomb attacks in British tourist destinations, mainly seaside resorts, over the summer period. The aim was to have sixteen bombs explode within fourteen days. Magee volunteered to be included in the group. A small team of four was formed: Magee; Gerry McDonnell, who was experienced with electronics and had operated in England previously; Martina Anderson, who had been charged with causing an explosion in 1981; and Ella O&#x27;Dwyer, a newcomer to the IRA&#x27;s active service who had joined their cause because of the hunger strikes.
In March 1985 Magee gave the Irish police surveillance team the slip and travelled to Britain where he and O&#x27;Dwyer rented a flat in Glasgow. On 15 June he and a female partner rented a room at the Rubens Hotel, overlooking the Royal Mews, which is situated on the grounds of Buckingham Palace. They rented room 112 for £70 for one night and planted a pre-assembled bomb that comprised of gelignite, set with a long delay timer to explode at 1:00 pm on 29 July. It was placed behind the bedside table, which had to be unscrewed from the wall for the device to be placed, and then screwed back in place. Soon after Magee rented a flat in Hackney Road to use as the England Department&#x27;s base in London.

In June 1985 the RUC undertook surveillance on Peter Sherry, the commander of the East Tyrone Brigade. He was followed from his home in Dungannon to Belfast docks, where a tip-off to police had alerted them that a member of the IRA was to be smuggled over to mainland Britain. The surveillance was picked up in Ayr, Scotland, by special branch officers from Strathclyde Police who were joined by a small detachment of RUC officers who had been trailing Sherry. He travelled to Carlisle where he stayed overnight. As he was now in England, Strathclyde Police had no jurisdiction; they contacted the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police who travelled overnight to Carlisle. The following day, 22 June 1985, Sherry went to the railway station where he met Magee, who had travelled from London. Magee was immediately identified by the surveillance team. A decision was made not to arrest the two men immediately, but to continue following them as the pair returned to the rented flat in Langside, Glasgow, where the rest of the England Department ASU were staying.

==Arrest and trial==

The police decided to raid the Langside property, although it was not known which of the building&#x27;s eight flats the men were in. It was decided that all eight flats were to be raided at the same time, with two officers assigned per flat, at least one of whom should be armed, with other officers on standby to assist. At about 7:00 pm on 22 June 1985, all the doors in the premises were knocked on. On the ground floor Magee and his compatriots were expecting the landlord to come round for the rent. As Magee answered the door he was arrested; other policemen entered the premises and arrested the four other IRA members present: Sherry, McDonnell, O&#x27;Dwyer and Anderson.

When searching McDonnell, police found the list of cities in which the England ASU had been intending to plant bombs. A tick was next to the first entry, which read &quot;London, 1st floor, 112, front, The Rubens Hotel, Buckingham Palace Road. BT plus 48&quot;. Also found was a schematic of the device, which showed &quot;BT&quot; meant booby trap. The device was soon found and disabled.

The trial of Magee, McDonnell, Sherry, Anderson and O&#x27;Dwyer opened on 6 May 1986 and lasted until 11 June. Also included with the accused was Shaun McShane, an IRA sympathiser who had assisted the England Department with providing premises where they could stay; he was charged with aiding and abetting.

During the trial the police were accused of planting a firearm on McDonnell. It had been, the police claimed, in McDonnell&#x27;s waistband when he was arrested; he denied it was his. No fingerprints were found on the weapon. Police denied they had planted evidence on him. The police were also accused of planting Magee&#x27;s palmprint on the hotel registration card, which they denied. Magee reiterated the claim in 2000, saying &quot;If that was my fingerprint I did not put it there&quot;. Sherry, McDonnell, Anderson and O&#x27;Dwyer were sentenced to life imprisonment. McShane was sentenced to eight years; this was reduced to six years on appeal. Magee was sentenced to eight life sentences, to be run concurrently, with the recommendation that he serve at least thirty-five years before being considered for parole. After the verdict was announced, Magee spoke his only words of the trial: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Our day will come&quot;).

==Repercussions and legacy==
In the early 1980s, and prior to the Brighton bomb, there were several assassinations or assassination attempts in London. The rise in such attempts, and the events at Brighton, changed the approach taken by the British government to turn Britain into a &quot;permanent counter-assassination state&quot;, according to the historian Simon Ball. The previously relaxed view of Special Branch close protection officers had already been under review prior to Brighton, and a new bodyguard system was implemented by Thatcher a few days after the bombing. In the House of Commons debate on the bomb, Leon Brittan, the home secretary, said:

Total security is impossible in a free, democratic society. Political and other leaders are vulnerable because they must be accessible. Everything that can be done will be done to prevent such outrages and to protect their targets. But we will not be bombed into boltholes by terrorists.

Measures were brought in to protect prominent politicians, including permanent security after they had left office. Special Branch provided more than a hundred officers for government and diplomatic protection to counter threats and assassination attempts, which cost the Metropolitan Police £59 million a year in 1993. The journalist David Hughes, who was covering the Brighton conference for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; writes that the bomb, and the subsequent changes in security provision &quot;marked the end of an age of comparative innocence. From that day forward, all party conferences in this country have become heavily defended citadels&quot;.

In addition to historical news coverage, the Brighton bomb has been described in books, including histories of what happened and personal memoirs from those involved. The events have also been depicted in music, film and fiction, and been examined in television documentaries.

===Northern Ireland policy===
Despite the bombing, Thatcher did not call off the ongoing talks with the Irish government. She saw these as important in stopping the political support for Sinn Féin in favour of the constitutional—and peaceful—nationalism of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. Instead she slowed the process and rejected some aspects under negotiation, as she did not want to give the impression that the bomb had resulted in any weakening of the British negotiating position. The bomb, however, left a deep impression on Thatcher and demonstrated that a solution to the violence needed to be found.

In the opinion of the political scientist Feargal Cochrane, the bomb acted as &quot;a catalyst&quot; for the discussions that led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 15 November 1985, despite opposition from within Thatcher&#x27;s own party. The agreement gave the Irish government an advisory role in Northern Ireland&#x27;s government while confirming that there would be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless a majority of its citizens voted to join the Republic.

===Magee&#x27;s release===

In 1997 Magee&#x27;s sentence was changed to a whole life order, meaning he would never be released from prison. This was later quashed as part of the Good Friday Agreement and Magee was released under licence in June 1999, despite a challenge by Jack Straw, the home secretary, to stop it. The Independent Sentence Review Commission—the body that decided whether paramilitaries should be released—endorsed his discharge.

In 2000 Magee and Jo Berry, the daughter of Sir Anthony Berry, met at Berry&#x27;s request; she wanted to understand the conflict from Magee&#x27;s perspective. Magee described it as &quot;a moment of profound significance to me&quot;. He said that about halfway through their three-hour talk:

the goodness and intelligence and value I perceived in this woman must in some measure have come from her father. And I had killed him. I had killed a fine human being. It had evidently been more comfortable for me to live with the perception that as a Tory he was simply the enemy, a warmonger, driven by greed, without a personal moral code or a rounded background. I too was guilty of demonising the enemy.

The two met again several times and became friends, giving talks together at reconciliation events; in 2009 they formed the organisation Building Bridges for Peace, which aimed to bring divided communities together through dialogue.

<text>The North American F-86 Sabre, sometimes called the Sabrejet, is a transonic jet fighter aircraft. Produced by North American Aviation, the Sabre is best known as the United States&#x27; first swept-wing fighter that could counter the swept-wing Soviet MiG-15 in high-speed dogfights in the skies of the Korean War (1950–1953), fighting some of the earliest jet-to-jet battles in history. Considered one of the best and most important fighter aircraft in that war, the F-86 is also rated highly in comparison with fighters of other eras. Although it was developed in the late 1940s and was outdated by the end of the 1950s, the Sabre proved versatile and adaptable and continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces.

Its success led to an extended production run of more than 7,800 aircraft between 1949 and 1956, in the United States, Japan, and Italy. In addition, 738 carrier-modified versions were purchased by the US Navy as FJ-2s and -3s. Variants were built in Canada and Australia. The Canadair Sabre added another 1,815 aircraft and the significantly redesigned CAC Sabre (sometimes known as the Avon Sabre or CAC CA-27), had a production run of 112. The Sabre is by far the most-produced Western jet fighter, with a total production of all variants at 9,860 units.

==Development==
North American Aviation had produced the propeller-powered P-51 Mustang in World War II, which saw combat against some of the first operational jet fighters. By late 1944, North American proposed its first jet fighter to the U.S. Navy, which became the FJ-1 Fury. It was an unexceptional transitional jet fighter that had a straight wing derived from the P-51. Initial proposals to meet a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) requirement for a medium-range, single-seat, high-altitude, jet-powered day escort fighter/fighter bomber were drafted in mid-1944. In early 1945, North American Aviation submitted four designs. The USAAF selected one design over the others and granted North American a contract to build three examples of the XP-86 (&quot;experimental pursuit&quot;). Deleting specific requirements from the FJ-1 Fury, coupled with other modifications, allowed the XP-86 to be lighter and considerably faster than the Fury, with an estimated top speed of , versus the Fury&#x27;s . Despite the gain in speed, early studies revealed the XP-86 would have the same performance as its rivals, the XP-80 and XP-84. Because these rival designs were more advanced in their development stages, it was feared that the XP-86 would be cancelled.

Crucially, the XP-86 was not able to meet the required top speed of ; North American had to quickly devise a radical change that could leapfrog its rivals. The F-86 was the first American aircraft to take advantage of flight research data seized from the German aerodynamicists at the end of World War II. These data showed that a thin, swept wing could greatly reduce drag and delay compressibility problems that had bedeviled fighters such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning when approaching the speed of sound. By 1944, German engineers and designers had established the benefits of swept wings based on experimental designs dating back to 1940. A study of the data showed that a swept wing would solve their speed problem, while a slat on the wing&#x27;s leading edge that extended at low speeds would enhance low-speed stability.

Because development of the XP-86 had reached an advanced stage, the idea of changing the sweep of the wing was met with resistance from some senior North American staff. Despite stiff opposition, after good results were obtained in wind tunnel tests, the swept-wing concept was eventually adopted. Performance requirements were met by incorporating a 35° swept-back wing, using modified NACA four-digit airfoils, NACA 0009.5–64 at the root and NACA 0008.5–64 at the tip, with an automatic slat design based on that of the Messerschmitt Me 262 and an electrically adjustable stabilizer, another feature of the Me 262A. Many Sabres had the &quot;6–3 wing&quot; (a fixed leading edge with a 6-inch extended chord at the root and a 3-inch extended chord at the tip) retrofitted after combat experience was gained in Korea. This modification changed the wing airfoils to the NACA 0009-64 modified configuration at the root and the NACA 0008.1–64 mod at the tip.

The XP-86 prototype, which led to the F-86 Sabre, was rolled out on 8 August 1947. The first flight occurred on 1 October 1947 with George Welch at the controls, flying from Muroc Dry Lake (now Edwards AFB), California.

The United States Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command had F-86 Sabres in service from 1949 through 1950. The F-86s were assigned to the 22nd Bomb Wing, the 1st Fighter Wing, and the 1st Fighter Interceptor Wing. The F-86 was the primary U.S. air combat fighter during the Korean War, with significant numbers of the first three production models seeing combat.

The F-86 Sabre was also produced under license by Canadair, Ltd, as the Canadair Sabre. The final variant of the Canadian Sabre, the Mark 6, is generally rated as having the highest capabilities of any Sabre version.

===Breaking sound barrier and other records===
The F-86A set its first official world speed record of on September 15, 1948, at Muroc Dry Lake, flown by Major Richard L. Johnson, USAF. Five years later, on 18 May 1953, Jacqueline Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier, flying a &quot;one-off&quot; Canadian-built F-86 Sabre Mk 3, alongside Chuck Yeager. Col. K. K. Compton won the 1951 Bendix air race in an F-86A with an average speed of 553.76 mph (891.19 km/h).
On 2 February 1958, a team of Pakistan Air Force F-86 Sabres called &quot;Falcons&quot; set a world record at PAF Base Masroor by performing a loop while in a 16 aircraft diamond formation. The team was led by then Wing Commander Zafar Masud.

==Design==

===Overview===
The F-86 was produced as both a fighter-interceptor and fighter-bomber. Several variants were introduced over its production life, with improvements and different armament implemented (see below). The XP-86 was fitted with a General Electric J35-C-3 jet engine that produced of thrust. This engine was built by GM&#x27;s Chevrolet division until production was turned over to Allison. The General Electric J47-GE-7 engine was used in the F-86A-1 producing a thrust of , while the General Electric J73-GE-3 engine of the F-86H produced of thrust.
The fighter-bomber version (F-86H) could carry up to of bombs, including an external fuel-type tank that could carry napalm. Unguided rockets were used on some fighters on training missions, but rockets were later carried on combat operations. The F-86 could also be fitted with a pair of external jettisonable jet fuel tanks (four on the F-86F beginning in 1953) that extended the range of the aircraft. Both the interceptor and fighter-bomber versions carried six M3 Browning machine guns with electrically-boosted feed in the nose (later versions of the F-86H carried four cannon instead of machine guns). Firing at a rate of 1,200 rounds per minute, the guns were harmonized to converge at in front of the aircraft, using armor-piercing (AP) and armor-piercing incendiary (API) rounds, with one armor-piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) for every five AP or API rounds. The API rounds used during the Korean War contained magnesium, which were designed to ignite upon impact, but burned poorly above as oxygen levels were insufficient to sustain combustion at that height. Initial planes were fitted with the Mark 18 manual-ranging computing gun sight. The last 24 F-86A-5-Nas and F-86Es were equipped with the A-1CM gunsight-AN/APG-30 radar, which used radar to automatically compute a target&#x27;s range, which later proved to be advantageous against MiG opponents over Korea.

===Flying characteristics===
The transition to the Sabre&#x27;s swept wings and jet engine saw many accidents and incidents, since even experienced pilots had to learn new handling techniques and flying characteristics. Early on in the jet age, some US manufacturers instituted safety and transition programs where experienced test and production pilots toured operational fighter squadrons to provide instruction and demonstrations designed to lower the accident rate.

As F-86 models continued to be upgraded, the learning process continued. Important design changes included switching from an elevator/stabilizer to an all-flying tail, discontinuation of leading edge slats for a solid wing with a small forward-mounted wing fence, increased internal fuel capacity, increased engine power, and an internal missile bay (F-86D). While the solid leading edge and increased internal fuel capacity increased combat performance, they exacerbated a dangerous and often fatal handling characteristic: the nose was raised prematurely from the runway during take-off. The danger of over-rotation is now a major area of instruction and concern for current F-86 pilots. The 1972 Sacramento Canadair Sabre accident resulting in 22 fatalities and 28 other casualties was a result of over-rotation on take-off.

==Operational history==
===Korean War===
The F-86 entered service with the USAF in 1949, joining the 1st Fighter Wing&#x27;s 94th Fighter Squadron and became the primary air-to-air jet fighter used by the Americans in the Korean War. While earlier straight-winged jets such as the P-80 and F-84 initially achieved air victories, when the swept-wing MiG-15 was introduced in November 1950, it outperformed all UN-based aircraft.

====Introduction of the MiG-15 and comparisons====
In response, three squadrons of F-86s were rushed to the Far East in December. The MiG-15 was superior to early F-86 models in ceiling, firepower, acceleration, turning, rate of climb, and ability to zoom climb. The F-86 was marginally faster, and could out-dive the MiGs. When the F-86F was introduced in 1953, the two aircraft became more closely matched, and by the end of the war, many American combat-experienced pilots were claiming a marginal superiority for the F-86F.

The heavier firepower of the MiG, and many other contemporary fighters, was addressed by “Project Gun-Val” which saw the combat testing of seven F-86Fs each armed with four 20 mm T-160 cannons (such F-86s were designated as F-86F-2s). Despite being able to fire only two of the four 20 mm cannon at a time, the experiment was considered a success and signaled the end of the decades-long use of the Browning .50 caliber in the air-to-air role.

Although the F-86A could be safely flown through Mach 1, the F-86E&#x27;s all-moving tailplane greatly improved maneuverability at high speeds. The MiG-15 could not safely exceed Mach 0.92, an important disadvantage in near-sonic air combat. Far greater emphasis had been given to the training, aggressiveness, and experience of the F-86 pilots. American Sabre pilots were trained at Nellis, where the casualty rate of their training was so high, they were told, &quot;If you ever see the flag at full staff, take a picture.&quot; Despite rules of engagement to the contrary, F-86 units frequently initiated combat over MiG bases in the Manchurian &quot;sanctuary&quot;.

In October 1951, the Soviets managed to recover a downed Sabre, and in their investigation of the type they concluded that the Sabre&#x27;s advantage in combat was due to the APG-30 gun-sight that facilitated accurate fire at longer ranges.

====Deployment of MiGs and Sabres====
The needs of combat operations balanced against the need to maintain an adequate force structure in Western Europe led to the conversion of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing from the F-80 to the F-86 in December 1951. Two fighter-bomber wings, the 8th and 18th, converted to the F-86F in the spring of 1953. No. 2 Squadron, South African Air Force (SAAF) also distinguished itself flying F-86s in Korea as part of the 18 FBW.
The MiGs flown from bases in Manchuria by Chinese, North Korean, and Soviet VVS pilots were pitted against two squadrons of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing forward-based at K-14, Kimpo, Korea. The North Koreans and their allies periodically contested air superiority in MiG Alley, an area near the mouth of the Yalu River (the boundary between Korea and China) over which the most intense air-to-air combat took place.

On 17 June 1951, at 01:30, Suwon Air Base was bombed by two Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes, who each dropped a pair of fragmentation bombs. One scored a hit on the 802nd Engineer Aviation Battalion&#x27;s motor pool, damaging some equipment, and two bombs burst on the flightline of the 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. One F-86A Sabre (FU-334 / 49-1334) was struck on the wing and began burning, eventually gutting the aircraft. Prompt action by personnel who moved aircraft away from the burning Sabre prevented further loss. Eight other Sabres were damaged in the brief attack, four seriously, and one F-86 pilot was among the wounded. The North Koreans subsequently credited Lt. La Woon Yung with this attack.

====Evaluations of the success of the F-86====
By the end of hostilities, F-86 pilots were initially credited by American sources with shooting down 792 MiGs for a loss of only 78 Sabres in air-to-air combat, a victory ratio of 10:1. Of the 41 American pilots who earned the designation of ace during the Korean War, all but one flew the F-86 Sabre, the exception being a Navy Vought F4U Corsair night fighter pilot. However, after the war, the USAF reviewed its figures in an investigation code-named &quot;Sabre Measure Charlie&quot; and downgraded the kill ratio of the North American F-86 Sabre against the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 by half, to 5:1. Internally, the USAF accepted that its pilots had actually downed about 200 MiGs

Soviet data records only 335 MiG-15s in Korea to all causes, including accidents, antiaircraft fire, and ground attacks. Chinese claims of their losses amount to 224 MiG-15s in Korea. North Korean losses are not known, but according to North Korean defectors, their air force lost around 100 MiG-15s during the war. Thus, 659 MiG-15s are admitted as being lost, many of these to F-86 Sabres The Soviets claimed to have downed over 600 Sabres, together with the Chinese claims (211 F-86s shot-down), although these cannot be reconciled with the number of Sabres recorded as lost by the US.

Suggested reasons for the F-86&#x27;s success include the fact that many of the American pilots were experienced World War II veterans, while the North Koreans and the Chinese lacked combat experience, but United Nations pilots suspected many of the MiG-15s were being flown by experienced Soviet pilots who also had combat experience in World War II. Former Communist sources now acknowledge Soviet pilots initially flew the majority of MiG-15s that fought in Korea, but they also dispute that more MiG-15s than F-86s were shot down in air combat. Later in the war, North Korean and Chinese pilots increased their participation as combat flyers.

The status of many claimed air-to-air victories in the Korean War has been increasingly debated as more data becomes available, showing that instances of over-claiming abounded on both sides. The research by Dorr, Lake and Thompson claimed an F-86 kill ratio closer to 2:1. A recent RAND report made reference to &quot;recent scholarship&quot; of F-86 v MiG-15 combat over Korea and concluded that the actual kill:loss ratio for the F-86 was 1.8:1 overall, and likely closer to 1.3:1 against MiGs flown by Soviet pilots. However, this ratio did not count the number of aircraft of other types (including the B-29, A-26, F-80, F-82, F-84 and Gloster Meteor) shot down by MiG-15 pilots.

Data-matching with Soviet records suggests that US pilots routinely attributed their own combat losses to &quot;landing accidents&quot; and &quot;other causes&quot;. According to official US data (&quot;USAF Statistical Digest FY1953&quot;), the USAF lost 224 F-86 fighters in Korea. Of these, 184 were lost in combat (78 in air-to-air combat, 19 by anti-aircraft guns, 26 were &quot;unknown causes&quot; and 61 were &quot;other losses&quot;) and 66 in incidents. South African Air Force lost 6 F-86s in the war. This gives 256 confirmed F-86 losses during the Korean War.

===1958 Taiwan Strait crisis===

The Republic of China Air Force was an early recipient of surplus USAF Sabres. From December 1954 to June 1956, the ROC Air Force received 160 ex-USAF F-86F-1-NA through F-86F-30-NA fighters. By June 1958, the Republic of China on Taiwan had built up an impressive fighter force, with 320 F-86Fs and seven RF-86Fs having been delivered.

Sabres and MiGs were shortly to battle each other in the skies of Asia once again in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. In August 1958, the Chinese Communists of the People&#x27;s Republic of China attempted to force the Nationalists off the islands of Quemoy and Matsu by shelling and blockade. ROCAF F-86Fs flying combat air patrol over the islands found themselves confronted by People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force MiG-15s and MiG-17s, and numerous dogfights resulted.

During these battles, the ROCAF Sabres introduced a new element into aerial warfare. Under a secret effort designated Operation Black Magic, the U.S. Navy had provided the ROC with the AIM-9 Sidewinder, its first infrared-homing air-to-air missile, which was just entering service with the United States. A small team from VMF-323, a Marine FJ-4 Fury squadron with later assistance from China Lake and North American Aviation, initially modified 20 of the F-86 Sabres to carry a pair of Sidewinders on underwing launch rails and instructed the ROC pilots in their use flying profiles with USAF F-100s simulating the MiG-17. The MiGs enjoyed an altitude advantage over the Sabres, as they had in Korea, and PLAAF MiGs routinely cruised over the ROCAF Sabres, only engaging when they had a favorable position. The Sidewinder took away that advantage and proved to be devastatingly effective against the MiGs.

===Pakistan Air Force===

In 1954, Pakistan started receiving the first of a total of 102 F-86F Sabres under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. Many of these aircraft were F-86F-35s from USAF stocks, but some were from the later F-86F-40-NA production block (made specifically for export). Many of the F-35s were brought up to F-40 standards before they were delivered to Pakistan, but a few remained F-35s. The F-86 was operated by nine Pakistan Air Force (PAF) squadrons at various times: Nos. 5, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 26 Squadrons.

Moreover, in April 1959, a PAF F-86F flown by Flight Lieutenant Yunis of the No. 15 Squadron &quot;Cobras&quot; shot down an Indian Canberra Spy Plane over Rawalpindi marking the first aerial victory for the Pakistan Air Force.

In 1966, Pakistan acquired 90 ex-Luftwaffe CL-13 Mk.6s via Iran due to postwar US sanctions. They were known as the F-86E in the PAF, not to be confused with the North American F-86E variants).

The last of the Sabres were withdrawn from PAF service in 1980 and were replaced with the Shenyang F-6 fighters. In total Pakistani pilots flew 320,185 hours in the Sabres out of which about 4,500 hours were flown in wartime operations. They are now on display at PAF Museum and various cities around Pakistan.

====1960–1961 Bajaur Campaign====

In late 1960, regular and irregular Afghan forces invaded the Bajaur area of North West Frontier Province in an attempt to annex the region. In response, PAF F-86s were sent in order to support the Pakistani Forces and local Pakistani Pashtun tribesmen who were fighting the Afghan infiltrators. The Sabres also executed bombing runs on Royal Afghan Army positions in Kunar which were attacking Frontier Corps border posts. Although the Royal Afghan Air Force had seven MiG-17 squadrons and another MiG-21 squadron being operationalized, no known dogfight has been recorded between the two sides.

====Indo–Pakistani War of 1965====
The Sabre was no longer a world-class fighter (due to availability of supersonic jets). However, various sources state the F-86 gave the PAF a technological advantage in 1965.

*Air to air combat

In the air-to-air combat of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the PAF Sabres claimed to have shot down 15 Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft, comprising nine Hunters, four Vampires, and two Gnats. India, however, admitted a loss of 14 combat aircraft to the PAF&#x27;s F-86s. The F-86s of the PAF had the advantage of being armed with AIM-9B/GAR-8 Sidewinder missiles, whereas none of its Indian adversaries had this capability. Despite this, the Indian Air Force claimed that seven F-86 Sabres were shot down by Folland Gnats and six F-86 Sabres were shot down by Hawker Hunters.

*Ground attack
The F-86F remained a potent aircraft for use against ground targets. On the morning of 6 September 1965, six F-86s of No. 19 Squadron struck advancing columns of the Indian army using 5-in (127-mm) rockets along with their six .50-in (12.7-mm) M3 Browning machine guns. On the same day, eight F-86 fighters of the same squadron executed airstrikes on the IAF Pathankot.
In East Pakistan, F-86s from the No. 14 Squadron struck the Indian airbases of Kalaikunda, Bagdogra, Barrackpore and Agartala which resulted in the destruction of more than 20 Indian aircraft. The airstrikes on kalaikunda in particular were highly successful after which the No. 14 Squadron was nicknamed &quot;Tail Choppers&quot;.

In total, Pakistani B-57 Canberras and F-86s destroyed around 39 Indian warplanes on the ground at various IAF airbases. However, India claims of losing 22 aircraft on the ground.

====1971 Civil conflict and subsequent Indo–Pakistani war====
*Air to Air combat

The CL-13B Mk.6 Sabres (known as the F-86E in PAF) were the mainstay of the PAF&#x27;s day-fighter operations during the 1971 War, and had the challenge of dealing with the threat from IAF Folland Gnats, Hawker Hunters, Sukhoi Su-7s and Mig-21s.

At the beginning of the war, PAF had eight squadrons of F-86 Sabres. Along with the newer fighter types such as the Mirage III and the Shenyang F-6, the Sabres were tasked with the majority of operations during the war. In East Pakistan, PAF&#x27;s only Tail Choppers squadron was equipped with 16 F-86Es out of which 4 were modified to fire AIM-9/GAR-8 missiles.

In the Battle of Boyra Indian Folland Gnats of 22 Squadron IAF shot down two F-86Es and severely damaged one F-86E.

PAF F-86s performed well, with Pakistani claims of downing 31 Indian aircraft in air-to-air combat. These included 17 Hawker Hunters, eight Sukhoi Su-7 &quot;Fitters&quot;, one MiG 21, and three Gnats while losing seven F-86s. The most interesting of these was a battle between two Sabres and four MiG-21s. One MiG was shot down, without any Sabres lost. This was achieved due to the greater low-speed performance of the Sabre in comparison to the delta-winged MiG-21.

India, however, claims to have shot down 11 PAF Sabres for the loss of 11 combat aircraft to the PAF F-86s. The IAF numerical superiority overwhelmed the sole East Pakistan Sabres squadron (and other military aircraft) which were either shot down, or grounded by Pakistani fratricide as they could not hold out, enabling complete air superiority for the IAF.
*Ground Attack
In East Pakistan, the F-86Es of the Tail Choppers took active part in several CAS and COIN missions against Mukti Bahini militants and irregular Indian forces.

On 15 April 1971, a formation of 4 Sabres led by Flight Lt. Abbas Khattak strafed and rocketed many rebel strongholds at Bhairab Bazar to support the Pakistan Army&#x27;s efforts in re-capturing food stocks and silos from the Mukti-Bahini militants.

On 26 April 1971, Flight Lt. Abbass led another Sabre formation at Patuakhali where surviving rebels had regrouped after facing a defeat at Barisal by the hands of the Army. The Sabres struck several rebel strongpoints to soften up resistance after which SSG units were inserted via Mi-8s to clear out the area.

On the Western Front, F-86Es and F-86Fs from various PAF squadrons played a vital role in backing the Pakistan Army&#x27;s counter attacks at several sectors with Air support.

At Shakargarh and Marala sectors, PAF F-86F/Es from the No. 17, No. 18 and 26 Squadrons alongside Shenyang F-6s took part in air support missions backing Pakistan&#x27;s I Strike Corps counter attacks against the Indian army&#x27;s I Corps. Although ill-equipped for anti-tank roles, the Sabres were modified to carry general purpose bombs in an effort to provide as much effective air support as possible.

In the Battle of Chamb, F-86Fs from the No. 26 Squadron &quot;Black Spiders&quot; and F-86Es from the No. 18 Squadron supported Iftikhar Janjua&#x27;s forces in capturing Chumb flying 146 air support sorties. At one point, the Indian Army suffered a major blow at Akhnur when sabres from the No. 18 Squadron destroyed their ammunition dumps.

At Sulemanki, F-86Es of the No. 17 Squadron &quot;Tigers&quot; flew 55 CAS sorties in support of the IV Corps offensive in which they claimed 6 Indian tanks and a number of military vehicles destroyed.

At Thar, F-86E and Fs belonging to the No. 19 Squadron struck Indian army positions during their Close Air Support missions. In total, they destroyed 8 Indian Tanks and several military vehicles while also damaging 2 Military trains.

===Guinea-Bissau War of Independence===
In 1958, the Forca Aerea Portuguesa (FAP) received 50 F-86Fs from ex-USAF stocks. A few former Norwegian Air Force F-86Fs were also purchased as spares in 1968–69.

The FAP deployed some of its F-86F Sabres to Portuguese Guinea in 1961, being based at AB2 – Bissalanca Air Base, Bissau. These aircraft formed &quot;Detachment 52&quot;, initially equipped with eight F-86Fs (serials: 5307, 5314, 5322, 5326, 5354, 5356, 5361, and 5362) from the &quot;Esquadra 51&quot;, based at the BA5 – Monte Real Air Base. These aircraft were used in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, in ground-attack and close-support operations against the insurgent forces. In August 1962, 5314 overshot the runway during an emergency landing with bombs still attached on underwing hardpoints and burned out. F-86F 5322 was shot down by enemy ground fire on 31 May 1963; the pilot ejected safely and was recovered. Several other aircraft suffered combat damage but were repaired.

In 1964, 16 F-86Fs based at Bissalanca returned to mainland Portugal due to U.S. pressure. They had flown 577 combat sorties, of which 430 were ground-attack and close-air-support missions.

===Philippine Air Force===
The Philippine Air Force (PAF) first received the Sabres in the form of F-86Fs in 1957, replacing the North American P-51 Mustang as their
primary interceptor. F-86s first operated from Basa Air Base, known infamously as the &quot;Nest of Vipers&quot;, where the 5th Fighter Wing of the PAF was based. Later on, in 1960, the PAF acquired the F-86D as their first all-weather interceptor. The most notable use of the F-86 Sabres was in the Blue Diamonds aerobatic display team, which operated eight Sabres until the arrival of the newer, supersonic Northrop F-5. The F-86s were subsequently phased out of service in the 1970s as the Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and Vought F-8 Crusaders became the primary fighters and interceptors of the PAF. Antonio Bautista was a Blue Diamonds pilot and a decorated officer. He was killed on 11 January 1974 during a combat sortie against rebels in the south of the country.

===Soviet Sabre===
During the Korean War the Soviet search for an intact U.S. F-86 Sabre for evaluation and study purposes was largely frustrated due to the U.S. military&#x27;s policy of destroying disabled or abandoned weapons and equipment, with USAF pilots destroying most of their downed Sabres by strafing or bombing. One F-86 was downed in a tidal area, and subsequently submerged, preventing its destruction. The aircraft was ferried to Moscow and a new OKB (Soviet Experimental Design Bureau) was established to study the F-86, which later became part of the Sukhoi OKB. &quot;At least one F-86… was sent to the Soviet Union, the admitted, and other planes and prizes such as U.S. G-suits and radar gun sights also went.&quot;

The Soviets studied and copied the optical gunsight and radar from the captured aircraft to produce the ASP-4N gunsight and SRC-3 radar. Installed in the MiG-17, the gunsight system was later used against American fighters in the Vietnam War. The F-86 studies also contributed to the development of aircraft aluminum alloys such as V-95.

===Feather Duster===
The old but nimble MiG-17 had become such a serious threat against the Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam that the USAF created project &quot;Feather Duster&quot; to test which tactics supersonic American fighters could use against fighters such as the MiG-17. ANG F-86H units proved to be an ideal stand-in for the Soviet jets. One pilot remarked, &quot;In any envelope except nose down and full throttle&quot;, either the F-100 or F-105 was inferior to the F-86H in a dogfight.

Sabre Fs had much improved high-speed agility, coupled with a higher landing speed of over . The F-35 block had provisions for a new operational role: the tactical nuclear attack using newer, smaller, and lighter nuclear weapons (&quot;second generation&quot; nuclear ordnance). The F-40 had a new slatted wing with a slightly higher span, resulting in a slight decrease in speed, but also much better agility at both high and low speeds and a reduced landing speed of . The USAF upgraded many previous F versions to the F-40 standard. One E and two Fs were modified for improved performance via rocket boost.
;F-86F(R): F-86F-30 (52-4608) had a Rocketdyne AR2-3 with thrust at , giving a top speed of mach 1.22 at .

Four F-86E-10s (serial numbers 51-2803, 2819, 2826 and 2836) and six F-86F-1s (serial numbers 51-2855, 2861, 2867, 2868, 2884 and 2900) were production-line aircraft modified in October 1952 with enlarged and strengthened gun bays, then flight tested at Edwards Air Force Base and the Air Proving Ground at Eglin Air Force Base in November. Eight were shipped to Japan in December and seven forward-deployed to Kimpo Airfield as &quot;Project GunVal&quot; for a 16-week combat field trial in early 1953. Two were lost to engine compressor stalls after ingesting excessive propellant gases from the cannons.

===North American FJ Fury===
: &quot;See: North American FJ-2/-3 Fury for production figures of U.S. Navy versions.&quot;

===CAC Sabre (Australia)===

Two types based on the U.S. F-86F were built under licence by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) in Australia, for the Royal Australian Air Force as the CA-26 (one prototype) and CA-27 (production variant). The RAAF operated the CA-27 from 1956 to 1971. The CAC Sabres included a 60% fuselage redesign, to accommodate the Rolls-Royce Avon Mk 26 engine, which had roughly 50% more thrust than the J47, as well as 30 mm Aden cannon and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. As a consequence of its powerplant, the Australian-built Sabres are commonly referred to as the Avon Sabre. CAC manufactured 112 of these aircraft. Ex-RAAF Avon Sabres were operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (&quot;TUDM&quot;) between 1969 and 1972. From 1973 to 1975, 23 Avon Sabres were donated to the Indonesian Air Force (&quot;TNI-AU&quot;); five of these were ex-Malaysian aircraft.

CA-27 marques:
*Mk 30: 21 built, wing slats, Avon 20 engine.
*Mk 31: 21 built, 6–3 wing, Avon 20 engine.
*Mk 32: 69 built, four wing pylons, F-86F fuel capacity, Avon 26 engine.

===Canadair Sabre===

The F-86 was also manufactured by Canadair in Canada as the CL-13 Sabre to replace its de Havilland Vampires, with the following production models:
;Sabre Mk 1: one built, prototype F-86A
;Sabre Mk 2: 350 built, F-86E-type, 60 to USAF, three to RAF, 287 to RCAF
;Sabre Mk 3: one built in Canada, test-bed for the Orenda jet engine
;Sabre Mk 4: 438 built, production Mk 3, 10 to RCAF, 428 to RAF as Sabre F-4
;Sabre Mk 5: 370 built, F-86F-type with Orenda engine, 295 to RCAF, 75 to Luftwaffe
;Sabre Mk 6: 655 built, 390 to RCAF, 225 to Luftwaffe, six to Colombia and 34 to South Africa

===Production summary===

<text>The Sheffield Botanical Gardens are Grade II listed botanical gardens situated off Ecclesall Road in Sheffield, England, with 5,000 species of plants in 19 acres (77,000 m2) of land.

==History==
The Sheffield Botanical and Horticultural Society was formed in 1833 and by 1834 had obtained £7,500 () in funding. The money was raised selling shares, permitting the purchase of of south-facing farmland from the estate of local snuff manufacturer Joseph Wilson. 

The gardens were designed by Robert Marnock and first opened on 29 June 1836. The &quot;Sheffield Iris&quot; of 5 July 1836 describes the gardens thus:The walks assume all the intricacy and mystery of a labyrinthine maze, while the monkey cages, the bear’s den, the eagles’ habitation, water-works &amp;c. give a variety and effect to the whole, calculated to interest the visitor for hours together.

12,000 people visited the Gardens on their opening in the summer of 1836. To attract people to continue to visit the gardens, the committee organised balloon launches. The first of these took place in 1837. On Tuesday 3 October, Margaret Graham made a second ascent from the gardens. Initially it was hoped that the gas filled balloon would carry her and Mr Charles Brown, but it would not lift until Mr Brown left the basket. Mrs Graham flew alone. Once aloft she ejected a monkey with a parachute which descended successfully to the ground. Mrs Graham landed near Conisbrough with some difficulty.

Sheffield&#x27;s Town Trust assumed the management of the gardens in the closing years of the 19th. century, when they repaid the shareholders the nominal value of their £5 shares. The Trust abolished the existing entry charge and since that time entry to the Botanical Gardens has remained free. Though the Town Trust are still the owners, Sheffield Corporation signed a 99-year lease on 18 December 1951, thereby taking over management.

The most notable feature of the gardens are the Grade II* listed glass pavilions by Benjamin Broomhead Taylor, restored and reopened in 2003. Other notable structures are the main gateway, the south entrance lodge and a bear pit containing an 8&#x27; tall steel statue of an American Black Bear called Robert the Bear. In the rose garden is a bronze sculpture &quot;Pan: Spirit of the Wood&quot;, a gift in 1934 from Sir Charles Clifford, owner of the &quot;Sheffield Telegraph and Star&quot;, to the city. The sculptor is not known.

The gardens hold the national collection of the genus &quot;Sarcococca&quot;, &quot;Weigela&quot; and the closely related &quot;Diervilla&quot;.

<text>Dancing Stage is a series of music video games developed and published by Konami. It is a spin-off of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; for the European market as well as a few Japanese titles. Games were released for arcade, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Wii.

==European releases==
===&quot;Dancing Stage&quot;===
Dancing Stage is a music video game, developed by Konami, released in arcades on March 9, 1999. This game was released as Dance Dance Revolution in North America. It includes 13 songs: nine composed by Naoki Maeda, and four licenses. It uses the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix&quot; engine. In North America, the game received a PlayStation port, which omits &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Make It Better (So-Real Mix)&quot;. Songs in the arcade version include:

* &quot;AM-3P&quot; by kTz
* &quot;Boom Boom Dollar&quot; by King Kong &amp; D.Jungle Girls
* &quot;Brilliant 2U&quot; by Naoki
* &quot;Brilliant 2U (Orchestra-Groove)&quot; by Naoki
* &quot;Butterfly&quot; by Smile.dk
* &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot; by The Olivia Project
* &quot;Make It Better&quot; by mitsu-O!
* &quot;Make It Better (So-Real Mix)&quot; by mitsu-O!
* &quot;My Fire&quot; by X-Treme

* &quot;Put Your Faith In Me&quot; by UZI-LAY
* &quot;Put Your Faith In Me (Jazzy Groove)&quot; by UZI-LAY
* &quot;Trip Machine&quot; by De-Sire
180, kTz, mitsu-O! and UZI-LAY and are pen names for Naoki Maeda. Songs with &quot;Groove&quot; or &quot;Mix&quot; in the title require certain criteria to be unlocked by the player.

Dancing Stage Internet Ranking was released exclusively in Europe. It adds another three licensed covers, credited with the original artists:
* &quot;It&#x27;s Like That&quot; (cover of Run–D.M.C. vs. Jason Nevins)
* &quot;Last Thing On My Mind by Step Ahead (cover of Steps)
* &quot;Uh La La La&quot; by Party All Night (cover of Alexia)

===&quot;Dancing Stage EuroMix&quot;===

Dancing Stage EuroMix was released in 2000, and is based on the Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix engine. It includes 28 tracks and can be expanded to a total of 34 tracks with Internet Ranking enabled. Contrary to 3rdMix, EuroMix does not use a PC Card. The game&#x27;s console port was released for PlayStation on June 1, 2001 and contains 24 songs. It removes the Dancemania licenses and all but one song added in the Internet Ranking version, but adds five Konami Original songs.

===&quot;Dancing Stage EuroMix 2&quot;===

Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 was released in 2002, and is based on the &quot;DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution 7thMix&quot; engine. It includes 68 tracks, of which 52 are new and 16 are Konami originals from &quot;EuroMix&quot;. &quot;EuroMix 2&quot; requires a PC Card and omits the Internet Ranking feature.

In contrast to &quot;EuroMix&quot;, there is no home version of &quot;EuroMix 2&quot;. However, &quot;Dancing Stage MegaMix&quot; features a similar interface. This game features 28 songs, including 11 Konami originals from &quot;EuroMix 2&quot; and a remix of &quot;Let the beat hit em!&quot;


===&quot;Dancing Stage Fusion&quot;===

&quot;Dancing Stage Fusion&quot; is the first arcade release to be powered by the PlayStation 2 through a Bemani Python board. Despite the improved hardware, this game has fewer songs than its predecessor. &quot;Fusion&quot; features 49 songs, of which ten were available in previous &quot;Dancing Stage&quot; arcade releases, ten are from the arcade release of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Extreme&quot; and seven are from older Japanese arcade releases. The remaining 21 songs premiered in &quot;Fusion&quot;: six are Konami Originals that later appeared in &quot;Dancing Stage SuperNova&quot;, while 15 are licenses that do not return in later arcade releases, with the exception of &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; by P.A.T&#x27;s reappearance in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2&quot; and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution X&quot;.

===&quot;Dancing Stage SuperNova&quot;===

&quot;Dancing Stage SuperNova&quot; used the Bemani Python 2 board.

===Console exclusives===
* Dancing Stage Disney Mix is a direct port of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix&quot;, the American equivalent of the Japanese &quot;Dancing Stage featuring Disney&#x27;s Rave&quot;. It was released on September 28, 2001 for the PlayStation.
* Dancing Stage Party Edition is a port of the American &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Konamix&quot;, with the addition of 5 licensed songs and the removal of 6 Konami Original songs for a total of 51 songs. It was released on November 15, 2002.
* Dancing Stage Unleashed is the European counterpart to the North American &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix&quot; series for the Xbox console. Three games were released annually from 2004 to 2006: &quot;Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Unleashed 2&quot; and &quot;Unleashed 3&quot;, each with exclusive songs replacing some of the &quot;Ultramix&quot; songs. No European counterpart to &quot;Ultramix 4&quot; was released. These games cannot be played on the Xbox 360 or newer consoles.
* Dancing Stage Fever is the second European DDR game to be released for the PlayStation 2, although a port for PlayStation was also released. The PS2 edition uses a recolored &quot;DDRMAX2&quot; engine with an aqua blue background complemented with star motifs instead of black and gray, while the PS edition uses a recolored &quot;DDR 4thMix&quot; engine. Also, the PS edition omits freeze arrows and full motion videos.

: The PlayStation 2 edition has 29 songs: 8 licenses, 16 Konami originals (of which 14 are also on &quot;Dancing Stage SuperNova&quot; for arcades) and 5 Bemani crossovers (of which 4 are also on &quot;Dancing Stage SuperNova&quot; for arcades). The PlayStation edition only features 15 of these songs: 5 licenses, 8 Konami originals and 2 Bemani crossovers.

: All licensed songs, with one exception, are exclusive to &quot;Fever&quot;. Both &quot;Fever&quot; releases include &quot;All That She Wants&quot;, &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; and &quot;Virtuality&quot; (by VBirds). On the PlayStation 2, these songs feature their music video, except for &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;. The &quot;Virtuality&quot; music video notably shows the VBirds members dancing on flying dance pads to the rhythm of the arrows shown on screen. The PlayStation 2 version also exclusively features &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; (with its music video) and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. &quot;Wannabe&quot; was once exclusive to both &quot;Fever&quot; releases, but it was later included on &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection&quot;.
* Dancing Stage Universe is the European counterpart to the North American &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Universe&quot; series for the Xbox 360. &quot;Dancing Stage Universe&quot; was released in 2007 in Europe and Australia, while &quot;Universe 2&quot; was released in 2008 for Europe only. Both games feature exclusive songs, replacing some of the North American songs. No European counterpart to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3&quot; was released, as Konami launched a Chinese edition of &quot;Universe 3&quot; in 2009 instead. These games cannot be played on the Xbox One or newer consoles.
* Dancing Stage SuperNova 2 was originally meant to complement the planned arcade release of the same name. The arcade version was cancelled, however, making this a console exclusive.

==Japanese releases==
===&quot;Dancing Stage featuring True Kiss Destination&quot;===
 is the first &quot;Dancing Stage&quot; title of the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series released in Japan and other parts of Asia on July 27, 1999. The Dancing Stage games in Japan all deviate away from the main DDR series of games and for True Kiss Destination, it features a themed set of music by the Japanese group of the same name as well as original music from Konami&#x27;s in house artists.

On December 9, 1999 Konami released the game on the Sony PlayStation. It was part of their &quot;Dance Simulation&quot; series of titles for the PlayStation.

This game notably includes the songs &quot;Celebrate Nite&quot; and &quot;Sexy Planet&quot;, credited to aliases of Naoki Maeda, which returned in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000&quot; and later &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 4thMix Plus&quot;. With the exception of &quot;DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix&quot;, these songs were subsequently kept in every main DDR release, including the current title, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution A20&quot;.

===&quot;Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True&quot;===
 is the second Japanese Dancing Stage video game. The gameplay is similar to Dance Dance Revolution and it has songs performed by the J-Pop group, Dreams Come True.

<doc id="359343" wikidata="Q152905" url="?curid=359343" title="Jean-Claude Trichet">
<text>Jean-Claude Trichet (; born 20 December 1942) is a French economist who was President of the European Central Bank from 2004 to 2011. Previous to his assumption of the presidency he was Governor of the Bank of France from 1993 to 2004.

After stepping down from the European Central Bank, Trichet has taken speaking arrangements across France and was on the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements. He was asked to join the non-doctrinal think tank, Bruegel, to consult on economic policy. In 2008, Trichet ranked fifth on &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s most powerful along with economic triumvirs Ben Bernanke (fourth) and Masaaki Shirakawa (sixth).

==Early life and education==
Trichet was born in 1942 in Lyon, the son of a professor of Greek and Latin. He was educated at the École des Mines de Nancy, from which he graduated in 1964. He later earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Paris and then trained at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris (best known as Sciences Po), finishing in 1966, and the École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA) from 1969–1971, two French higher education institutions in the field of political science and state administration.

==Career==
=== Career in the public sector ===
From 1987, Trichet was head of the Trésor public. In this capacity, he also chaired the Paris Club of creditor nations in the mid-1980s and was closely involved in debt problems that struck Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. He also became a member of Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty. Soon after taking office at Trésor, Trichet oversaw the change to an anti-inflationary &quot;franc fort&quot; (strong franc) policy, to pave the way for currency union with Germany. In 1993, he led Trésor’s move to grant the Bank of France independence to set its own interest rates.

In 1993, Trichet was appointed governor of Banque de France. Both as director of the French Treasury and then governor of the Banque de France, he was widely seen as one of the architects of the European monetary union.

By 1997, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac proposed Trichet as France’s candidate for the position as president of the European Central Bank; this way they opposed Wim Duisenberg, the candidate preferred by the majority of the Eurozone members. Under a compromise laid out by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Duisenberg would resign midway through his eight-year term to make way for Trichet. On 1 November 2003 he succeeded Wim Duisenberg.

During his time in office, Trichet oversaw the ECB’s response to the European debt crisis, including its Securities Markets Programme to stem the crisis in eurozone government bond markets. In 2011, ECB board member Jürgen Stark resigned in what was widely seen as a protest against this policy.

=== Career in the private sector ===
On 28 January 2012, the board of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company approved Trichet’s nomination to the Board, where he represented (with Dominique d’Hinnin of the Lagardère Group) the French state’s holding company SOGEADE.

Trichet succeeded Mario Monti as chairman of the European branch of the Trilateral Commission in 2012. 

Trichet was a member of the Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance, which was established by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors for the period from 2017 to 2018. In early 2021, Trichet was appointed by the G20 to the High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on financing the global commons for pandemic preparedness and response, co-chaired by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Lawrence Summers.

== Other activities ==
=== International organizations ===
* European Central Bank, Chair of the Ethics Committee (2016–2019)
* European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), Chair (2010–2011)
=== Corporate boards ===
* PIMCO, Member of the Global Advisory Board (since 2015)
=== Non-profit organizations ===
* Bretton Woods Committee, Member of the Advisory Council (since 2020)
* Scope Foundation, Member of the Honorary Board (since 2020)
* Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), Distinguished Fellow (since 2019)
* Bruegel, Chairman of the Board (since 2012) 
* Bilderberg Group, Member of the Steering Committee 
* European Horizons, Advisor
* Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic Instabilities (CRISIS), Member of the Advisory Board
* Institute for Law and Finance at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Member of the Academic Advisory Board
* Systemic Risk Council (SRC), Senior Advisor

== Political positions ==
At the height of the euro crisis, Trichet publicly criticized President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had agreed at a meeting in Deauville in 2010 that sovereign debt could be restructured in a bailout to make private investors pay their share; the plan was never implemented.

At the ceremony for the Charlemagne Prize in 2011, Trichet called for the creation of a central finance ministry to oversee spending by countries that use the euro.

On 5 August 2011 Trichet wrote, together with Mario Draghi, a letter to the Italian government to push for a series of economic measures that would soon be implemented in Italy.

In 2015, Trichet joined forces with two other former governors of the Bank of France – Michel Camdessus and Jacques de Larosière – in publicly supporting President François Hollande’s appointment of François Villeroy de Galhau to head the central bank.

In a 2019 article for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Trichet publicly hit back against some of his former colleagues at the European Central Bank – including Jürgen Stark and Otmar Issing, who both worked as ECB chief economist under Trichet’s presidency –, calling them &quot;misguided&quot; in their criticism of the loose monetary policy pursued by his successor as president Mario Draghi.

== Controversy ==
=== Crédit Lyonnais scandal ===
In January 2003, Trichet was put on trial with eight others charged with irregularities at Crédit Lyonnais, one of France&#x27;s biggest banks. Trichet was in charge of the French treasury at that time. He was cleared in June 2003, which left the way clear for him to move to the ECB. A parliamentary inquiry found no wrong-doing by Trichet, other civil servants or the three finance ministers in office during the critical period.

===2009 banking crisis===
Within the European Central Bank, Trichet strongly resisted any contemplation of Greece defaulting on its debt. It was only in October 2011, with the end of his term imminent, that consensus was reached to allow a 50% cut in the value of Greek bonds.
=== Hypo Alpe Adria bailout ===
As part of a 2015 investigation launched by Austria’s parliament into defunct lender Hypo Alpe Adria, then opposition party NEOS named Trichet among 200 people it wanted to question. At the time of Austria purchasing Hypo Alpe Adria from BayernLB in late 2009, Trichet had lobbied for the deal.

Trichet has been criticised for the ECB&#x27;s response to the Great Recession, which emphasised price stability over recovery and growth.
He was also criticized when he refused to answer a question about a possible conflict of interests concerning his successor&#x27;s involvement at Goldman Sachs before taking charge as head of the ECB.

==Personal life==
At age 22, Trichet married Aline Rybalka, a diplomat and translator whose parents immigrated to France from Ukraine. They have two sons: Pierre-Alexis Trichet (born 1971), a marketing strategy director at telecommunications company Orange SA; and Jean-Nicolas Trichet (born 1974), a musician and producer.

<text>Acid Eaters is the thirteenth studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones.

Released in 1993, towards the end of the Ramones&#x27; career, the album is the band&#x27;s only album entirely composed of covers. &quot;Acid Eaters&quot; forms a musical tribute to the Ramones&#x27; favorite artists of the 1960s and highlights the influences the Ramones took from garage rock bands like the Seeds and the Amboy Dukes, as well as from popular bands such as the Beach Boys, the Who and the Rolling Stones (all of whom are covered on this album).

==Background==
Although &quot;Acid Eaters&quot; is specifically made of covers from the sixties, it was not the first time that the Ramones had played or recorded cover songs, with the band having released cover versions on most of their albums, almost all of them from the sixties, starting with a cover of Chris Montez&#x27;s hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (written by and credited to Jim Lee) on their debut album. Other notable covers previously performed by the group include: the Rivieras&#x27; &quot;California Sun&quot; (originally recorded by Joe Jones); the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; (originally recorded by Bobby Freeman); the Trashmen&#x27;s &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;; the Searchers&#x27; &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; (written by Sonny Bono and Jack Nitzsche, originally recorded by Jackie DeShannon); the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;; the Music Explosion&#x27;s &quot;Little Bit O&#x27; Soul&quot;; the Chambers Brothers&#x27; &quot;Time Has Come Today&quot;; Freddy Cannon&#x27;s &quot;Palisades Park&quot;; and the Doors&#x27; &quot;Take It as It Comes.&quot; Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Surf City&quot; had been performed live by the Ramones on one occasion on August 20, 1982, in New York City, but makes its studio debut here.

==Production==
In his 2012 autobiography &quot;Commando&quot;, Johnny Ramone called the album &quot;hit-and-miss,&quot; stating that many of the songs &quot;were done with studio work, arrangements, and tricks, which was really different for us&quot;, and that the band &quot;experimented to mixed success.&quot; He added that &quot;we were getting all kinds of suggestions from everybody, and it was getting to be a pain in the ass. I mean, &#x27;She&#x27;s Not There&#x27; by the Zombies?&quot; Johnny awarded the album a &quot;B−&quot; grade. Bassist C.J. Ramone gave the album a &quot;D&quot; grade, saying that it was done strictly for the money.

The album features several guest singers on backing vocals, namely Pete Townshend on &quot;Substitute,&quot; Sebastian Bach on &quot;Out of Time&quot; and Traci Lords on &quot;Somebody to Love.&quot; According to Johnny Ramone, while he considered Townshend &quot;one of the greats and one of my guitar heroes&quot;, Townshend was a half an hour late for his session, resulting in Johnny giving up and leaving the studio to watch a Yankee game.

According to C.J. Ramone, &quot;Acid Eaters&quot; was only going to be an EP before manager Gary Kurfirst promised a bigger advance as well as a bigger cut if they made it a full release.

==Promotion==
The band promoted the album on the animated Cartoon Network talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, in the first-season episode &quot;Bobcat&quot;.

<text>George Ord, Jr. (March 4, 1781 – January 24, 1866) was an American zoologist who specialized in North American ornithology and mammalogy. Based in part on specimens collected by Lewis and Clark in the North American interior, Ord&#x27;s article &quot;Zoology of North America&quot;&quot;&quot; (1815), which was published in the second American edition of William Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Geographical, Historical, and Commercial Grammar&quot; (Johnson and Warner), has been recognized as the &quot;first systematic zoology of America by an American&quot;.

Ord (1815) published the first scientific descriptions of Pronghorn antelope (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;), Grizzly bear (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;)&quot;,&quot; Meadow vole (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;), Bushy-tailed woodrat (&quot;Neotoma cinerea&quot;), Eastern gray squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus&quot;), Columbian ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus columbianus&quot;), black-tailed prairie dog (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;), Bonaparte&#x27;s gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus philadelphia&quot;), ring-billed gull (&quot;Larus delawarensis&quot;), Tundra swan (&quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot;), and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus&quot;).

Ord is widely known for challenging the works of John James Audubon.

== Early life ==
Ord was born and died at the same residence, 784 Front St., in Philadelphia. His mother was Swedish, and his father, Captain George Ord, Sr. (1741–1806), a celebrated naval captain during the American Revolution, was the proprietor of a rope-making business and served as Warden of the Port of Philadelphia. Ord joined the family business and continued it after his father&#x27;s death.

== &quot;American Ornithology&quot; ==

Ord met Alexander Wilson in the summer of 1811, and accompanied him on two collecting expeditions (each four weeks duration) to Cape May, New Jersey, during the spring migration seasons of May 1812 and May 1813. During the 1812 trip, Ord collected a bird that neither he nor Wilson could identify. Wilson illustrated Ord&#x27;s specimen and named it &quot;Cape May Warbler / &quot;Sylvia maritima&quot;&quot; in volume 6 of &quot;American Ornithology&quot; (1812), writing:&quot;This new and beautiful little species was discovered in a maple swamp, in Cape May county, not far from the coast, by Mr. George Ord of this city, who accompanied me on a shooting excursion to that quarter in the month of May last. Through the zeal and activity of this gentleman I succeeded in procuring many rare and elegant birds among the sea islands and extensive salt marshes that border that part of the Atlantic ; and much interesting information relative to their nests, eggs, and particular habits. I have also at various times been favored with specimens of other birds from the same friend, for all which I return my grateful acknowledgments.&quot;The letter-press for volume 8 of &quot;American Ornithology&quot; (1814) was complete by August 1813, but Wilson&#x27;s &quot;great anxiety to conclude the work, condemned him to an excess of toil, which, inflexible as was his mind, his bodily frame was unable to bear.&quot; Wilson died of complications from dysentery on August 23, 1813; one week earlier, he named Ord an executor of his &quot;last Will and testament&quot;. After Wilson&#x27;s death, Ord completed the publishing and distribution, and compiled Wilson&#x27;s unpublished writings for a final (9th) volume which contained an extended &quot;Biographical sketch of Alexander Wilson&quot;.

Ord published a second edition of &quot;American Ornithology&quot; in 1824–25. The first 6 volumes were faithful reprints of the originals, confusingly so because they bear the dates of the first editions on their title pages (1808–12). In contrast, volumes 7–9 were revised and expanded by Ord and included a much larger version of his &quot;Life of Wilson&quot; (198 pp., versus 36 pages in the original 1814 version).

== Academic life ==
In 1815, Ord was elected to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP), where he would later serve as vice president from (1816–34) and president (1851–58). He became a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1817, and later served as secretary (1820–27), vice president (1832–35), councilor (1839), treasurer (1842–47), and librarian (1842–48).

In 1817, he joined the &quot;first private, museum sponsored exploration in the United States&quot;, when he, Thomas Say, Titian Ramsay Peale and William Maclure went on a collecting expedition to Georgia and Florida, sponsored by the ANSP.

Ord, a supporter of scientific peer review, frequently served on ANSP publications committees, reviewing the work of his peers. He was a reviewer of three influential papers authored by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1824 and 1825, which included the original taxonomic descriptions of Wilson&#x27;s Storm Petrel (&quot;Procellaria Wilsonii&quot;) in 1824, and Transvolcanic Jay (&quot;Aphelocoma ultramarina&quot;), and Yellow-winged Cacique (&quot;Cassiculus melanicterus&quot;) in 1825. In 1829 he retired from the rope-making business to devote more time to science.

Ord authored peer-reviewed articles on a wide variety of topics including feather molt, the mating behavior of the Eastern Box Turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot;), and the taxonomy of the Florida Scrub Jay (&quot;Aphelocoma coerulescens&quot;). His publication about &quot;An account of an American species of the genus &quot;Tantalus&quot; or Ibis&quot; (1817) was the first account of the Glossy Ibis (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;) in the United States, as noted by Bonaparte in his quasi-continuation of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;American Ornithology&quot; (1833):&quot;The credit of having added this beautiful species [&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;] to the fauna of the United States is due to Mr. Ord, the well known friend and biographer of Wilson, who several years ago gave a good history and minute description of it in the Journal of the Academy of Philadelphia, under the name &quot;Tantalus mexicanus&quot;? His excellent memoir would have been sufficient to establish its identity with the species found so extensively in the old world, even if the specimen itself, carefully preserved in the Philadelphia Museum, did not place this beyond the possibility of doubt.&quot;Ord was a vocal opponent of John James Audubon.

He also wrote biographical memoirs of Charles Alexandre Lesueur, published in 1849, and Thomas Say, published in 1859, that have been valuable sources of information for modern scholars.

== Death and Burial ==

Ord died on January 23, 1866, and is buried in a family plot at Gloria Dei Church cemetery.

<text>The Ur-Quan Masters is a 2002 open-source fangame modification, based on the action-adventure science fiction game &quot;Star Control II&quot;. The original game was released for PCs in 1992 and ported to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994. It has been frequently mentioned among the best games of all time, with additional praise for its writing, world design, character design, and music.

After the &quot;Star Control II&quot; copyrights reverted to creators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford, they licensed their content to their fan community under the GNU General Public License, to keep their series in the public eye. The open-source development team remade the 3DO version as a port to modern operating systems, and allowed fan-made modifications to add improvements absent in the original release. Released under the title &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; (the subtitle of the original game), the modified remake has since been downloaded nearly two million times, earning critical reception as one of the best free games available, with additional praise for a high-definition graphics fan modification.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; is a re-make of &quot;Star Control II&quot;, an action-adventure science fiction game set in an open universe. The game includes exploration, resource-gathering, combat, and diplomacy. Much of the game is played from a top-down perspective, and features real-time combat between alien ships with different abilities. The player can freely explore a galaxy with hundreds of stars, planets, and moons, which contain resources for the player to scan and retrieve in a lander vehicle. In diplomacy, the player converses with alien races in branching dialog sequences, with the goal of rallying an alliance to defeat the titular antagonists, the Ur-Quan. The combat featured in the story can also be played as a separate mode called &quot;Super Melee&quot;.

The player plays the role of the captain of a spaceship, which returns to Earth after a lost research mission. The captain quickly discovers that Earth has been conquered by the Ur-Quan, and begins a quest to acquire knowledge, resources, and allies in order to free humanity from slavery. During the story, the Ur-Quan become entangled in a civil war, allowing the captain to contact dozens of unique alien races, and ultimately influence the outcome of the conflict. After rallying humanity&#x27;s former allies, the captain is able to overcome and defeat the Ur-Quan.

== Development ==

The &quot;Star Control&quot; series was created by Fred Ford and Paul Reiche, and published by Accolade. The first release in 1990 was a space strategy and action game, inspired by the 1961 space combat game &quot;Spacewar!&quot;. &quot;Star Control II&quot;, the 1992 sequel, abandoned the first game&#x27;s strategic elements and greatly expanded the story, wrapping the combat system into an adventure-based narrative. Its port to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console in 1994 added fully voiced dialog and other updates to the sound and graphics. &quot;Star Control&quot; received awards upon release, and &quot;Star Control II&quot; received even more. Journalists have listed &quot;Star Control&quot; among their best games of all time, with &quot;Star Control II&quot; earning even more &quot;best game&quot; rankings through the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. &quot;Star Control II&quot; is also remembered among the best games in several creative areas, including writing, world design, character design, and music.

By the early 2000s, the &quot;Star Control II&quot; copyrights reverted to Ford and Reiche, triggered by a contractual clause where the game was no longer generating royalties. With the game no longer available in stores, Ford and Reiche wanted to keep the game in the public eye so that they could one day make another game in the series. Ford and Reiche still owned the rights to &quot;Star Control I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, but they could not successfully purchase the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark from publisher Accolade, so they chose the title &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot;. Their independent studio Toys for Bob hired Chris Nelson as their first summer intern, who was enthusiastic for open-source software. Nelson worked with Ford to port the game to modern operating systems. Ford recalled, &quot;we haven&#x27;t made a sequel yet, so we thought the least we could do is release the source code and let the fans revive it on modern computers&quot;.

The open-source project officially launched in 2002, when Ford and Reiche licensed the source code from the 3DO version of &quot;Star Control II&quot; as open source under the GNU General Public License. Ford and Reiche own all the copyrighted content in the first two &quot;Star Control&quot; games, and granted the fan-operated project a free, perpetual license to the &quot;Star Control II&quot; content and the &quot;Ur-Quan Masters&quot; trademark. The first version of &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; suffered from performance issues, but Nelson knew skilled contacts in the open-source community who could make progress on the project. The fan community continued the project with further support, enhancements, and modifications. The credits screen names the &quot;core team&quot; as Serge van den Boom, Mika Kolehmainen, Michael Chapman Martin, Chris Nelson, and Alex Volkov. Ford and Reiche personally credit the open-source remake for making their creation available from 2001 to 2011, before &quot;Star Control&quot; became available for sale digitally through GOG.com. In an interview, the fans-turned-developers stated that a for-profit company would not be able to justify the port and remake, and that &quot;without the open-source philosophy, &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; would never have existed&quot;.

Ford and Reiche launched a development studio, Pistol Shrimp, using it to take the open-source to create a new version of &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; for modern systems. This will be released for free in February 2024 for Windows computers under the name &quot;Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; as to avoid the intellectual property issue with Stardock. Pistol Shrimp have also started developing a sequel to this game, titled &quot;Ghosts of the Precursors&quot;.

== Modifications ==

&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; has an active fanbase, maintaining both the open-source project and an extensive wiki. The most essential modifications extended the original code to operate on newer operating systems, resolving compatibility issues with the native DOS game. Fans have since modified and extended the project several times. Reiche has commented, &quot;our policy has been to let people do whatever they want, as long as they don&#x27;t turn our characters into mass murderers or make money with it. If you&#x27;re making money with our stuff, we&#x27;d like a pizza&quot;.

&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; introduced features from the 3DO version that were previously unavailable on other platforms, including improved graphics and full voice acting. The extensions further added mod support and online multiplayer combat, neither of which were supported in the original games. The most notable fan modification is the high-definition version of the game, &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters HD&quot;, which was released in 2013. It was created by re-painting every frame of animation by hand.

== Reception ==
Since its 2002 release, &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; has been downloaded nearly two million times as of 2021. Soon after its debut, the game was featured in &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; in its compilation of free games, celebrating it as a &quot;timeless classic&quot; from the &quot;golden age of gaming&quot;. Finnish magazine &quot;Pelit&quot; rated it five stars in 2004 for its timeless appeal, as well as new features and remixed music. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; featured &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; on the cover of their June 2005 edition. They further praised Ford and Reiche for making such a high-quality game available as an open-source project, stating that &quot;this small Californian group has seen fit to grace the gaming world with one of its finest achievements, and at no cost&quot;. In a 2011 feature about open-source games, Michael Blake of &quot;IGN&quot; lauded &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; as one of the greatest games and a &quot;pitch-perfect port to modern operating systems&quot;, which &quot;completely hooked me, with the genius single-player storyline and the hectic multiplayer of Super Melee mode both good enough to warrant the download on their own&quot;. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; also called it &quot;a brilliant port and a fantastic initiative to keep old games relevant&quot;.

&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; has been included on several best games lists since its release. In 2008, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; named &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; as one of the best free games. &quot;Game Developer Magazine&quot; featured the game in its 2010 list of open-source space games, praising its scale and charm, as well as its new features. The game was also listed in &quot;Maximum PC&quot;&#x27;s 2015 &quot;best free games&quot; feature. &quot;Tom&#x27;s Guide&quot; included &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; in its list of top classic games re-released for free, praising its staying power: &quot;few games today feature the same mix of narrative depth, sandbox exploration and enjoyable space combat that have won the game a cult following to this day&quot;. In 2019, &quot;PCGamesN&quot; ranked &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; as one of the top 15 space games ever made and &quot;one of the best free PC games you&#x27;ll ever find&quot;, noting its characters, dialog and sense of discovery.

=== &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters HD&quot; ===
&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters HD&quot; has received praise of its own. &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; celebrated it as an &quot;ambitious and well-received fan-made (and free) remake&quot;, which &quot;retains a certain 1990s vibe despite being made more appropriate to modern machines. It lends it a certain psychedelic silliness that today&#x27;s more self-regarding space games seem to lack.&quot; &quot;Kotaku&quot; likewise praised the HD updates to the visuals and sound, and Dominic Tarason of &quot;PCGamesN&quot; described the detailed hand-painted modification as &quot;a genuinely impressive piece of work&quot;. Since its release, &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters HD&quot; has been downloaded over 200,000 times on SourceForge.

== Sequel ==
=== &quot;Free Stars: Children of Infinity&quot; ===
On October 24, 2023, the developers, consisting of Fred Ford, Dan Gerstein, Paul Reiche III and Ken Ford, announced the new name of the sequel, Free Stars: Children of Infinity, and launched its corresponding website. The official trailer was shown on the April 4, 2024 on GameSpot YouTube channel. A Kickstarter campaign was launched on April 16, 2024 to further the game development of the sequel. Within 3 hours, they met their initial $100 000 USD goal. The planning release date for the game is August 2025.

<doc id="359352" wikidata="Q381307" url="?curid=359352" title="Oscar Zariski">
<text>Oscar Zariski (April 24, 1899 – July 4, 1986) was an American mathematician. The Russian-born scientist was one of the most influential algebraic geometers of the 20th century.

==Education==
Zariski was born Oscher (also transliterated as Ascher or Osher) Zaritsky to a Jewish family (his parents were Bezalel Zaritsky and Hanna Tennenbaum) and in 1918 studied at the University of Kyiv. He left Kyiv in 1920 to study at the University of Rome where he became a disciple of the Italian school of algebraic geometry, studying with Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi.

Zariski wrote a doctoral dissertation in 1924 on a topic in Galois theory, which was proposed to him by Castelnuovo. At the time of his dissertation publication, he changed his name to Oscar Zariski.

==Johns Hopkins University years==
Zariski emigrated to the United States in 1927 supported by Solomon Lefschetz. He had a position at Johns Hopkins University where he became professor in 1937. During this period, he wrote &quot;Algebraic Surfaces&quot; as a summation of the work of the Italian school.
The book was published in 1935 and reissued 36 years later, with detailed notes by Zariski&#x27;s students that illustrated how the field of algebraic geometry had changed. It is still an important reference.

It seems to have been this work that set the seal of Zariski&#x27;s discontent with the approach of the Italians to birational geometry. He addressed the question of rigour by recourse to commutative algebra. The Zariski topology, as it was later known, is adequate for &quot;biregular geometry&quot;, where varieties are mapped by polynomial functions. That theory is too limited for algebraic surfaces, and even for curves with singular points. A rational map is to a regular map as a rational function is to a polynomial: it may be indeterminate at some points. In geometric terms, one has to work with functions defined on some open, dense set of a given variety. The description of the behaviour on the complement may require infinitely near points to be introduced to account for limiting behaviour &quot;along different directions&quot;. This introduces a need, in the surface case, to use also valuation theory to describe the phenomena such as blowing up (balloon-style, rather than explosively).

==Harvard University years==
After spending a year 1946–1947 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Zariski became professor at Harvard University in 1947 where he remained until his retirement in 1969. In 1945, he fruitfully discussed foundational matters for algebraic geometry with André Weil. Weil&#x27;s interest was in putting an abstract variety theory in place, to support the use of the Jacobian variety in his proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, a direction rather oblique to Zariski&#x27;s interests. The two sets of foundations weren&#x27;t reconciled at that point.

At Harvard, Zariski&#x27;s students included Shreeram Abhyankar, Heisuke Hironaka, David Mumford, Michael Artin and Steven Kleiman—thus spanning the main areas of advance in singularity theory, moduli theory and cohomology in the next generation. Zariski himself worked on equisingularity theory. Some of his major results, Zariski&#x27;s main theorem and the Zariski theorem on holomorphic functions, were amongst the results generalized and included in the programme of Alexander Grothendieck that ultimately unified algebraic geometry.

Zariski proposed the first example of a Zariski surface in 1958.

==Views==
Zariski was a Jewish atheist.

==Awards and recognition==
Zariski was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1944, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948, and the American Philosophical Society in 1951. Zariski was awarded the Steele Prize in 1981, and in the same year the Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Lars Ahlfors. He wrote also &quot;Commutative Algebra&quot; in two volumes, with Pierre Samuel. His papers have been published by MIT Press, in four volumes. In 1997 a conference was held in his honor in Obergurgl, Austria.

<doc id="359354" wikidata="Q1757581" url="?curid=359354" title="Lost in La Mancha">
<text>Lost in La Mancha is a 2002 documentary film about Terry Gilliam&#x27;s first attempt to make &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, a film adaptation of the 1605/1615 novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes. The documentary was shot in 2000 during pre-production and filming and it was intended as a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary for the film. However, Gilliam&#x27;s failure to complete his film resulted in the documentary filmmakers retitling their work as &quot;Lost in la Mancha&quot; and releasing it independently.

Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; presents Gilliam&#x27;s effort to make &quot;Don Quixote&quot; as a parallel to Quixote&#x27;s quest to become a hero. It co-stars Johnny Depp, Jean Rochefort, and Vanessa Paradis, who were cast as stars for &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;. It is narrated by Jeff Bridges.

Gilliam ultimately succeeded in making &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, which was released in 2018. Fulton and Pepe have made a follow-up documentary, titled &quot;He Dreams of Giants&quot;, which covers Gilliam&#x27;s entire scope of work on the Quixote project.

== Background ==
Finding the source material written by Miguel de Cervantes too vast, Gilliam and his co-writer decided to create their own version of the Quixote story. They made a major change inspired by Mark Twain&#x27;s 1889 novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;. They planned to have the character of Sancho Panza appear only early in the film. He was to be replaced by character Toby Grisoni, a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time, whom Don Quixote mistakes for Panza.

Gilliam was excited about the film, as he felt that the story of Don Quixote embodies many of his own themes (such as the individual versus society, the concept of sanity, etc.). He intended to film it entirely in Spain and other nations in Europe. Jean Rochefort was cast to play Don Quixote, in preparation for which he spent seven months learning English. Toby was to be played by Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis would have been his love interest.

Fulton and Pepe had previously filmed a making-of documentary about Giliam&#x27;s earlier film &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;.

== Production ==
&quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; explores how the film&#x27;s production issues soon overran schedule and budget. Gilliam tells his crew not to be afraid to tell him that something is too complicated or expensive to be done, because he needs to be restrained sometimes. In another interview, he says he wants his films to be seen and enjoyed by the widest audience possible. But natural forces were more important than his excesses.

On the first day of shooting, the crew discovered that their outdoor filming location, in the area known as Bardenas Reales, was plagued by nearly constant noise from a nearby NATO aircraft target practice area. Gilliam decided to continue shooting footage, knowing that he could replace the audio in post-production. But during the second day of shooting, hail and a flash flood damaged equipment. In addition, it permanently changed the appearance of the location, where some shots had not yet been completed. The entire sequence would have to be reshot.

More significantly, days later it became apparent that Rochefort was injured. Within a week Gilliam learned that Rochefort had a herniated disc and would be unable to continue filming. This ended production completely, resulting in a record $15 million insurance claim. The insurance company owned the rights to the screenplay for several years, until they were transferred back to Gilliam. He restarted production of &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot; in 2008.

Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe had previously made a documentary about the making of Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; titled &quot;The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys&quot;. They were strongly supported by Gilliam throughout their filming on the Don Quixote project. Gilliam reportedly often has people documenting the making of films so that should something go wrong, he has a record of the events from his perspective.

==Reception==
Released in 2002, &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; received positive reception from critics. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of critics have given &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; a positive review based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. It also holds a &quot;Top Critics&quot; score of 89%. The website&#x27;s critical consensus is &quot;A remarkable behind-the-scenes look at a movie that wasn&#x27;t, &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; is an incisive, entertaining document of the difficulties inherent in the moviemaking process.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 35 critics.

Critic Leonard Maltin has described &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; as one of the best films about the process of filmmaking.

It was nominated for various awards, including a BAFTA Award and a Satellite Award for Best Documentary Film. It won a Satellite Award for Best Documentary DVD.

== Sequel ==
In May 2018, a few days before the premiere of &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, Fulton and Pepe said they would release a follow-up documentary, to be titled &quot;He Dreams of Giants&quot;. It would cover the entire history of the film&#x27;s making, with particular focus on what happened after the events depicted in &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;.

Pepe said that the film would be &quot;more introspective&quot; than &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;, saying, 
&quot;This is more a film about an internal struggle in an artist’s mind. What is it like for an artist to be standing on the brink of actually finishing this project finally? [...] Even on the set we would say the conflicts raging around Terry right now of making the movie are not nearly as interesting as what’s going on inside his head.&quot;

The film premiered at DOC NYC on 10 November 2019. The filmmakers have not said whether it will be a bonus feature on &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;″s home media release, or will be released independently, as was &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;.

<doc id="359355" wikidata="Q300349" url="?curid=359355" title="Stephen Dorrell">
<text>Stephen James Dorrell (born 25 March 1952) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He served as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Loughborough between 1979 and 1997 and then for Charnwood from 1997 to 2015.

Dorrell most recently served for four years as Chairman of the House of Commons Health Select Committee from 2010 to 2014. In the 1990s he was a full member of John Major&#x27;s Cabinet for almost three years, whilst serving as both Secretary of State for National Heritage and then Secretary of State for Health until the 1997 general election. He did not contest the 2015 general election and retired from the House of Commons. Returning to politics in 2019, he left the Conservatives and stood as a Change UK candidate at the 2019 European Parliament election. After failing to be elected, he defected to the Liberal Democrats and was the unsuccessful Liberal Democrat candidate for Buckingham in the 2019 general election.

==Early life and education==
Dorrell was born in Worcester and educated at Uppingham School, Rutland, and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was a member of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve for two years from 1971.

==Political career==
During the February 1974 general election, Dorrell acted as a personal assistant to Conservative minister Peter Walker. Aged only 22, he contested the safe Labour seat of Kingston upon Hull East at the October 1974 general election, but was heavily defeated by the sitting MP (and later Deputy Prime Minister), John Prescott, who was returned with a majority of 25,793 votes.

At the 1979 general election, the Conservatives were returned to office under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. Dorrell, then 27, was elected to the House of Commons for the marginal seat of Loughborough, ousting the veteran Labour MP John Cronin by 5,199 votes. He remained an MP until standing down from Parliament at the 2015 General Election.

On his election he was the Baby of the House of Commons, an informal title for the youngest member. He was succeeded as the Baby of the House on 9 April 1981 when Bobby Sands was elected at the April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election; however, Sands died on 5 May 1981 whilst on hunger strike in Long Kesh Prison. Dorrell again became the Baby of the House until 20 August 1981, when Sands&#x27; successor Owen Carron was elected at the August 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election. Dorrell nonetheless remained the youngest MP to take his seat in the House of Commons until the 1983 election, when Charles Kennedy succeeded him—Sands and Carron never took their seats, following the same rationale as Sinn Féin with whom they were closely aligned.

Following his election to Parliament in 1979, Dorrell was a member of the Transport Select committee. After the 1983 general election he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to his old boss Peter Walker, who had now become the Secretary of State for Energy.

===In government===
Dorrell was promoted to government after the 1987 general election by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as an Assistant Government Whip, and in 1988 became a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury—a &#x27;full&#x27; whip. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health in by Thatcher in 1990, and continued in that role under the premiership of John Major. After the 1992 General Election he became the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

Dorrell was promoted to the Major Cabinet as the Secretary of State for National Heritage in 1994, and on appointment became a Member of the Privy Council. He headhunted Jennie Page for the job of Millennium Dome Chief Executive according to &quot;The Observer&quot;. He was transferred to become the Secretary of State for Health in 1995, and remained in position until the end of the Conservative administration at the 1997 general election.

===After government===
When constituency boundaries were revised for the 1997 election, he moved with his key rural voters into the new Charnwood constituency. He won the seat comfortably with a majority of 5,900, although Loughborough was lost to Andy Reed of Labour. 

He launched a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1997, but withdrew before the first ballot when it became clear his support amongst Conservative MPs was negligible. Instead he threw his support behind Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s bid. Under William Hague he became shadow Secretary of State for Education and Employment, but left the shadow cabinet in 1998, and was a backbencher for the remainder of his parliamentary career.

====Chairman of Health Select Committee and views on NHS reforms====
In June 2010, Dorrell was elected Chairman of the Health Select Committee. In June 2011, following concerns over the unpopularity of Andrew Lansley&#x27;s NHS reforms, Dorrell was tipped as a possible successor but stated that he wanted to continue as the committee chairman for the full parliament. An alternate view was that David Cameron would not want any more &quot;Tory retreads&quot; from previous governments. Dorrell acknowledged that resources would become tighter but changes driven by new medicines and new expectations were inevitable and integration of health care and social care would be both better and more efficient.

Interviewed in 2012, Dorrell stated that the 4% per year for four years efficiency targets, agreed before the 2010 election and described as &quot;a huge challenge&quot;, were taking too long to achieve. Whilst the bill had good points, e.g. involving clinicians and local authorities, more independence for public health etc. savings required a change in the way care is delivered not just changes in management structure. The reforms were acting as a &quot;disruption and distraction&quot;. They were a secondary issue compared with the need to make efficiency savings of £20bn, he added.

Dorrell resigned in June 2014 and was succeeded by Sarah Wollaston.

====Expenses investigation over &quot;secret flat rent deal&quot; with care home owners====
In November 2012 Dorrell was reported to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) after arranging to sell his London flat to “friends” who owned a chain of nursing homes, subsequently renting it back at £1,400 a month, funded by the taxpayer. His impartiality as chairman was questioned as the Health Select Committee was investigating social care, and some of the chain&#x27;s nursing homes had been criticised by the Care Quality Commission. Committee members were not aware of the financial connection. David Cameron refused to get involved, saying it was a matter for IPSA. IPSA said that the rules banned MPs from renting from family members, not from friends.

===Standing down from Parliament===
In November 2014, he surprised local party members and staff by announcing his future retirement from the House to take a job with consultancy KPMG in &quot;a senior role supporting their health and public service practice...&quot;. The role, he said, was &quot;incompatible with seeking re-election to the House of Commons&quot;. Fellow Leicestershire Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen also expressed surprise, but said that the prestige of Parliament had fallen since the expenses scandal, and a number of experienced MPs were leaving. Neighbouring Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan described him as &quot;a really important political figure in Leicestershire since 1979. He has been a great support to me&quot;. She denied claims she would stand in Dorrell&#x27;s Charnwood seat (rather than Loughborough) at the 2015 general election, saying that these were &quot;rumour-mongering&quot; by members of the Labour Party. (In May 2015 she held the Loughborough seat with an increased majority.)

The Labour candidate for Charnwood, Sean Kelly Walsh, paid tribute to Dorrell&#x27;s long service and constituency work, as well as his roles as Secretary of State for Health and chairman of the Health Affairs Select Committee.

===Resignation call over conflict of interest===
In December 2014, Dorrell was criticised for alleged conflict of interest when it became clear that he would be working both as an MP and KPMG consultant for six months until the election, and that KPMG were considering bidding for a £1 billion NHS contract. Pointing out that Dorrell had previously admitted the two roles were incompatible, Dr Clive Peedell, co-leader of the National Health Action Party, called for him to resign from one of the posts. Dorrell responded saying no issues were raised as he was not seeking re-election.

In January 2015, a group of six pensioners, who called at Dorrell&#x27;s offices in Thurmaston to hand in a 2,286 signature petition calling on him to resign, were told they were trespassing and the police would be called. Hanif Asmal, Chairman of Charnwood Conservative Association claimed police were called as the group didn&#x27;t have an appointment.

According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Dorrell&#x27;s extra-parliamentary work took up 1,736 hours, or 33.4 hours per week, in 2014. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; also stated he voted in 63% of opportunities in Parliament, ranking him 517 out of 650 MPs.

==Criticisms of business practice==
Dorrell was criticised for his actions when, in 2009, his family-owned firm went into a prepack administration, a &quot;controversial&quot; but legal procedure which the Government&#x27;s Insolvency Service said was &quot;mocking rules&quot;. 
David Blake, Director of the Cass Business School in London, believes the method is used to dump pension fund liabilities. The controversy may have deterred David Cameron from inviting Dorrell to join the Front Bench. His stake was in clothing company, Faithful, a family business established in the 19th century which made blue collar workwear in Worcester. Finance Director Steve Hall reported the company had been quite profitable until 2004 when it was split between Dorrell and his brother.

By 2005, after loss-making acquisitions, the company pensions deficit was almost £3 million. The pension scheme was changed to money purchase, and the factory site was pledged to support it. However, when the site was sold, some of the money was used to buy another business, and the firm was bought by stock market-listed Wensum. None of the money was paid into the pension scheme. According to Dorrell, the scheme then required 10% of annual turnover, making (debt or equity) restructuring (by financiers) impossible. An independent trustee was appointed, the pension fund received nothing and Wensum continued as a company. In May 2009, Wensum was put into a prepack administration which allowed a new company, GG125, to acquire Wensum&#x27;s assets for £7.9 million, whilst leaving its debts unpaid.
GG125 was then renamed Wensum Group Limited. The deal was completed in a day, Dorrell receiving a director salary (increased to £200,000 in September 2009) plus 15% share ownership in the new company. As company contributions had ceased, the workers were put into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which caps (often reducing) personal payouts and tends to erode with inflation. Hall expected 30–40% pension loss to him as such. Dorrell and his wife had already withdrawn their pensions. Dorrell claimed he had lost £550,000 because of the failure and that the alternative to the prepack would have offered less.

The prepack was criticised as &quot;completely immoral&quot;, and inappropriate for listed companies, by a South African creditor, LA group. It had sold a clothing manufacturer to Wensum in May 2009 for Wensum shares which became worthless and ceased after the prepack. Another Wensum shareholder compared the deal to a &quot;spider eviscerating a fly it has caught, taking all the good bits, then dropping the useless carcass, which is the creditors, the shareholders and of course the taxpayer&quot;.

==After Parliament==
He was reckoned by the &quot;Health Service Journal&quot; to be the 24th most influential person in the English NHS in 2015 after he became Chair of the NHS Confederation.

In 2016 he became Chair of the European Movement UK, succeeding Richard Corbett, in order to lead its campaign to stop Brexit. He stood down in 2021.

In 2018, Dorrell became a committee member of the Tories Against Brexit campaign, which is run by Citizens4Britain.org. He also became the chair of healthcare consultancy LaingBuisson, where he is now a Non Executive Director in addition to being a Director of NHS change consultancy Four Eyes Insight, global policy institute Public Policy Projects and its holding company Dorson Transform, and affiliate Dorson Inform 

He became a supporter of Change UK in 2019. He stood for the party in the 2019 European Parliament elections in the constituency of the West Midlands.

Dorrell stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 general election as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Buckingham to succeed former Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, having joined the Lib Dems in August from Change UK. He was beaten by the Conservative Greg Smith, who had a majority of over 20,000.

==Personal life ==
Dorrell is married to Penelope Taylor and has three sons and a daughter.

He is a Trustee of Uppingham School and a Governor of Loughborough Endowed Schools. He was Chairman of Trustees at Uppingham from 2008 to 2017.

<text>Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan (1 July 17314 August 1804) was a British admiral who defeated the Dutch fleet off Camperdown on 11 October 1797. This victory is considered one of the most significant actions in naval history.

==Life==
Adam was the second son of Alexander Duncan, Baron of Lundie, Angus, (d. May 1777) Provost of Dundee, and his wife (and first cousin once removed) Helen, daughter of John Haldane of Gleneagles. He was born at Dundee. In 1746, after receiving his education in Dundee, he entered the Royal Navy on board the sloop &quot;Trial&quot;, under Captain Robert Haldane, with whom, in and afterwards in , he continued until the peace in 1748. In 1749, he was appointed to , then commissioned for service in the Mediterranean, by the Hon. Augustus Keppel (afterwards Viscount Keppel), with whom he was afterwards in on the coast of North America, and was confirmed in the rank of lieutenant on 10 January 1755.

==Seven Years War==

In August 1755, he followed Keppel to , and in January 1756 to &quot;Torbay&quot;, in which he continued until his promotion to commander&#x27;s rank on 21 September 1759, and during this time was present in the expedition to Basque Roads in 1757, at the reduction of Gorée in 1758, and in the blockade of Brest in 1759, up to within two months of the Battle of Quiberon Bay, from which his promotion just excluded him.

From October 1759 to April 1760, he had command of &quot;Royal Exchange&quot;, a hired vessel employed in petty convoy service with a miscellaneous ship&#x27;s company, consisting to a large extent of boys and foreigners, many of whom (he reported) could not speak English, and all impressed with the idea that as they had been engaged by the merchants from whom the ship was hired they were not subject to naval discipline. It would seem that a misunderstanding with the merchants on this point was the cause of the ship&#x27;s being put out of commission after a few months.

As a commander, Duncan had no further service, but on 25 February 1761, he was posted and appointed to , fitting for Keppel&#x27;s broad pennant. In her he had an important share in the reduction of Belle Île in June 1761, and of Havana in August 1762. He returned to Britain in 1763, and, notwithstanding his repeated request, had no further employment for many years.

==Peacetime==
During this time, he lived principally at Dundee, and married Henrietta, daughter of Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord President of the Court of Session on 6 June 1777. It would seem that his alliance with this influential family obtained him the employment which he had been vainly seeking during fifteen years. Towards the end of 1778, he was appointed to , from which he was almost immediately moved into .

In January 1779, he sat as a member of the court-martial of Admiral Keppel for the poor performance of the Channel Fleet during the First Battle of Ushant. During the course of the trial Duncan objected several times to stop the prosecutor in irrelevant and in leading questions, or in perversions of answers. The Admiralty was therefore desirous that he should not sit on the court-martial of Sir Hugh Palliser for failure to obey orders during the same battle. The court-martial was set for April. The day before the assembling of the court the admiralty sent down orders for &quot;Monarch&quot; to go to St. Helens. Her crew, however, refused to weigh the anchor until they were paid their advance; and as this could not be done in time, &quot;Monarch&quot; was still in Portsmouth harbour when the signal for the court-martial was made; so that, sorely against the wishes of the admiralty, Duncan sat on this court-martial also.

During the summer of 1779, &quot;Monarch&quot; was attached to the Channel fleet under Sir Charles Hardy; in December was one of the squadrons with which Rodney sailed for the relief of Gibraltar, and had a prominent share in the action off St. Vincent on 16 January 1780. On returning to Britain, Duncan quit &quot;Monarch&quot;, and had no further command until after the change of Ministry in March 1782, when Keppel became first lord of the admiralty. He was then appointed to of 90 guns, and commanded her during the year in the Grand Fleet under Howe, at the relief of Gibraltar in October, and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel. He afterwards succeeded Sir John Jervis in command of , and after the peace commanded as guardship at Portsmouth for three years. He attained flag rank on 24 September 1787, became vice admiral 1 February 1793, and was promoted to admiral 1 June 1795. In February 1795, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, North Sea, and hoisted his flag on board .

==In action with the Dutch==
During the first two years of Duncan&#x27;s command, the work was limited to enforcing a rigid blockade of the enemy&#x27;s coast, but in the spring of 1797, it became more important from the knowledge that the Dutch fleet in the Texel was getting ready for sea.

The situation was one of extreme difficulty, for the mutiny which had paralysed the fleet at the Nore broke out also amongst the crews under Duncan, and kept him for some weeks in enforced inactivity. Duncan&#x27;s personal influence and some happy displays of his vast personal strength held the crew of &quot;Venerable&quot; to their duty; but with one other exception, that of , the ships refused to quit their anchorage at Yarmouth, leaving &quot;Venerable&quot; and &quot;Adamant&quot; alone to keep up the pretence of the blockade.

Fortunately, the Dutch were not at the time ready for sea; and when they were ready and anxious to sail, with thirty thousand troops, for the invasion of Ireland, a persistent westerly wind detained them in harbour until they judged that the season was too far advanced. For political purposes, however, the French Revolutionaries who controlled the government in Holland (despite the contrary opinion of their admiral, De Winter), ordered him to put to sea in the early days of October.

Duncan, with the main body of the fleet, was at the time lying at Great Yarmouth revictualling, the Texel being watched by a small squadron under Captain Henry Trollope in , from whom he received early information of the Dutch being at sea. He at once weighed anchor, and with a fair wind approached the Dutch coast, saw that the fleet was not returned to the Texel, and steering towards the south sighted it on the morning of 11 October about seven miles from the shore and nearly halfway between the villages of Egmont and Camperdown. The wind was blowing straight on shore, and though the Dutch forming their line to the north preserved a bold front, it was clear that if the attack was not made promptly they would speedily get into shoal water, where no attack would be possible. Duncan at once realised the necessity of cutting off their retreat by getting between them and the land. At first, he was anxious to bring up his fleet in a compact body, for his numbers were at best equal to those of the Dutch; but seeing the absolute necessity of immediate action, without waiting for the ships astern to come up, without waiting to form line of battle, and with the fleet in very irregular order of sailing, in two groups, led respectively by himself in &quot;Venerable&quot; and Vice-admiral Richard Onslow in &quot;Monarch&quot;, he made the signal to pass through the enemy&#x27;s line and engage to leeward.

It was a bold departure from the absolute rule laid down in the &quot;Fighting Instructions,&quot; still new, though warranted by the more formal example of Howe on 1 June 1794; and on this occasion, as on the former, it was crowned with complete success. The engagement was long and bloody; for though Duncan, by passing through the enemy&#x27;s line, had prevented their untimely retreat, he had not advanced further in tactical science, and the battle was fought out on the primitive principles of ship against ship, the advantage remaining with those who were the better trained to the great gun exercise, though the Dutch inflicted great loss on the Royal Navy.

It had been proposed to De Winter to make up for the want of skill by firing shell from the lower deck guns, and some experiments had been made during the summer which showed that the idea was feasible. However, want of familiarity with an arm so new and so dangerous presumably prevented its being acted on in the battle.

==Rewards==

The news of the victory was received in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed the power and the prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: &quot;Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …&quot;. It was not, however, until 1831, many years after Duncan&#x27;s death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.

Duncan was awarded the Large Naval Gold Medal and an annual pension of £3,000, to himself and the next two heirs to his title – this was the biggest pension ever awarded by the British government. Additionally, he was given the freedom of several cities, including Dundee and London.

==Death==

Duncan continued in command of the North Sea fleet until 1801, but without any further opportunity of distinction. Three years later, 4 August 1804, he died quite suddenly, aged seventy-three, at the inn at Cornhill, a village on the border, where he had stopped for the night on his journey to Edinburgh (ib. 252) and was buried in Lundie west of Dundee.

===Memorial===

There is a memorial to him within St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Character==
Duncan was of size and strength almost gigantic. He is described as in height, and of corresponding breadth. When a young lieutenant walking through the streets of Chatham, his grand figure and handsome face attracted crowds of admirers, and to the last he is spoken of as singularly handsome.

Nelson wrote to Duncan&#x27;s son, Henry, a fellow Royal Navy officer, on 4 October 1804, including a newspaper with the account of Duncan&#x27;s death, &quot;There is no man who more sincerely laments the heavy loss you have sustained than myself; but the name of Duncan will never be forgot by Britain, and in particular by its navy, in which service the remembrance of your worthy father will, I am sure, grow up in you. I am sorry not to have a good sloop to give you, but still an opening offers which I think will insure your confirmation as a commander&quot;.

==Family==

Duncan&#x27;s uncle was Sir William Duncan, physician-extraordinary to King George III and first of the Duncan baronets. On 6 June 1777 Duncan married Henrietta (1749–1832), daughter of Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord President of the Court of Session. On his death Duncan left a family of four daughters and two sons. His eldest son succeeded to the peerage and later became Earl of Camperdown; the second son, Henry, died a captain in the navy and K.C.H. in 1835.

His sister Margaret was mother to James Haldane Tait who served under him several times and rose to the rank of Rear Admiral.

Henrietta and her children are buried in Canongate Kirkyard in Edinburgh east of the church.

==Heraldry==
The paternal arms of the 1st Viscount were: &quot;Gules, two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn in base argent stringed azure&quot; (Clan Duncan). In the centre of his paternal coat the 1st Viscount was granted an augmentation of honour: &quot;Pendant by a ribbon argent and azure from a naval crown or a gold medal thereon two figures the emblems of Victory and Britannia; Victory alighting on the prow of an antique vessel, crowning Britannia with a wreath of laurel; and below the word &quot;Camperdown&quot;&quot;

Crest: &quot;A first rate ship of war, with masts broken, rigging torn and in disorder, floating on the sea, all proper and over, the motto &quot;Disce Pati&quot;&quot; (&quot;learn to suffer&quot;).

Supporters: &quot;On the dexter side an Angel, mantle purpure; on the head a celestial crown; the right hand supporting an anchor proper; in the left a palm branch Or. On the sinister a sailor, habited and armed proper; his left hand supporting a staff, thereon hoisted a flag azure; the Dutch colours, wreathed about the middle of the staff. Motto: &quot;Secundis Dubiisque Rectus&quot;&quot;

<text>The Province of Vaasa ( ; , , ; ) was a province of Finland, established in 1775 when Finland was an integrated part of Sweden from the southern part of Ostrobothnia County and disbanded in 1996. The province was named after the city of Vaasa.

On the death of Tsar Nicholas I in 1855, a small group of citizens in the city of Vaasa tendered a petition to change the name of the city after him. The name of the city came from the Royal House of Vasa and despite that only 15 citizens were backing the proposal the name of the city was changed to Nikolaistad (, ).

In 1960 the eastern part was separated as the Province of Central Finland. In 1997 it was reunited with Central Finland, together they merged with the northern part of the Province of Häme and the Province of Turku and Pori to establish the new Province of Western Finland. 

The former province corresponds to the current regions of Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia and Southern Ostrobothnia.

<doc id="359366" wikidata="Q606874" url="?curid=359366" title="Homosexuality in China">
<text>Homosexuality has been documented in China since ancient times. According to one study by Bret Hinsch, for some time after the fall of the Han dynasty, homosexuality was widely accepted in China but this has been disputed. Several early Chinese emperors are speculated to have had homosexual relationships accompanied by heterosexual ones. 

There exists a dispute among sinologists as to when negative views of homosexual relationships became prevalent among the general Chinese population, with some scholars arguing that it was common by the time of the Ming dynasty, established in the 14th century, following homophobia entrenched in the Mongol empire and the Yuan dynasty, and others arguing that anti-gay attitudes became entrenched during the Westernization efforts of the late Qing dynasty and the early Republic of China in the 19th and 20th centuries. For most of the 20th century homosexuality in China had been legal, except for a period between 1979 and 1997 where male anal sex was punishable as &quot;hooliganism&quot;.

In a 2016 survey by the organization WorkForLGBT of 18,650 lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, 3% of males and 6% of females surveyed described themselves as &quot;completely out&quot;. A third of the men surveyed, as well as 9% of the women surveyed said they were in the closet about their sexuality. 18% of men surveyed answered they had come out to their families, while around 80% were reluctant due to family pressure.

There was a step forward for the China LGBT community after the Weibo incident in April 2018, where the public outcry over the platform for banning homosexual content led the platform to withdraw the decision. Yet, in 2021 Weibo and WeChat censored the accounts of numerous LGBT student organizations without any prior warning.

==Terminology==
Traditional terms for homosexuality included &quot;the passion of the cut sleeve&quot; (), and &quot;the divided peach&quot; (). An example of the latter term appears in a 6th-century poem by Liu Xiaozhuo:
— She dawdles, not daring to move closer, / Afraid he might compare her with leftover peach.Other, less literary, terms have included &quot;male trend&quot; (), &quot;allied brothers&quot; (), and &quot;the passion of Longyang&quot; (), referencing a homoerotic anecdote about Lord Long Yang in the Warring States period. The formal modern word for &quot;homosexuality/homosexual(s)&quot; is &quot;tongxinglian&quot; () or &quot;tongxinglian zhe&quot; (, homosexual people). Instead of that formal word, &quot;tongzhi&quot; (), simply a head rhyme word, is more commonly used in the gay community. &quot;Tongzhi&quot; (; sometimes along with &quot;nü tongzhi&quot;, ), which was first adopted by Hong Kong researchers in Gender Studies, is used as slang in Mandarin Chinese to refer to homosexuals. Such usage is seen in Taiwan. However, in mainland China, &quot;tongzhi&quot; is used both in the context of the traditional &quot;comrade&quot; sense (e.g., used in speeches by Chinese Communist Party officials) and to refer to homosexuals. In Cantonese, &quot;gei1&quot; (), adopted from English &quot;gay&quot;, is used. &quot;Gay&quot; is sometimes considered to be offensive when used by heterosexuals or even by homosexuals in certain situations. Another slang term is &quot;boli&quot; (), which is not so commonly used. Among gay university students, the acronym &quot;datong&quot; (), which also refers to utopia, in Chinese is becoming popular. &quot;Datong&quot; is short for &quot;daxuesheng tongzhi&quot; (university students [that are] homosexuals).

Lesbians usually call themselves &quot;lazi&quot; () or &quot;lala&quot; (, ). These two terms are abbreviations of the transliteration of the English term &quot;lesbian&quot;. These slang terms are also commonly used in mainland China now.

==History==

The story of Dong Xian, which details the same-sex relationship between Emperor Ai of Han and one of his male concubines, has been cited by Hinsch as evidence of the historical tolerance of homosexuality within the Chinese empire. However, critics have cited the fact that the relationship ended in tragedy and violence to argue that the story was therefore critical rather than supportive of homosexual relationships.

Ming dynasty literature, such as &quot;Bian Er Chai&quot; (), portrays homosexual relationships between men as enjoyable relationships. Writings from the Liu Song dynasty claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century:
Some scholars argue that Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Critics have argued that under Confucian teachings, not having children was one of the greatest sins against filial piety, contending that while procreational bisexuality was tolerated, exclusive homosexuality was not. Emperors were still obligated to marry women and raise heirs, and same-sex sexual activities and relationships were merely tolerated as secondary practices. Confucian ideology did emphasize male friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the &quot;closeness of the master-disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality&quot;.

Although Taoist alchemy regarded heterosexual sex, without ejaculation, as a way of maintaining a male&#x27;s &quot;life essence&quot;, homosexual intercourse was seen as &quot;neutral&quot;, because the act has no detrimental or beneficial effect on a person&#x27;s life essence.

In a similar way to Buddhism, Taoist schools sought throughout history to define what would be sexual misconduct. Broadly speaking, the precept against &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; in Taoism relates to extramarital sex. The term for a married couple () usually in Chinese suggests a male with a female, though Taoist scripture itself does not explicitly say anything against same-sex relations. Many sorts of precepts mentioned in the Yunji Qiqian (), The Mini Daoist Canon, does not say anything against same-sex relations, maintaining neutrality.Opposition to homosexuality in China rose in the medieval Tang dynasty, but did not become fully established until the late Qing dynasty and the Chinese Republic. There exists a dispute among sinologists as to when negative views of homosexual relationships became prevalent among the general Chinese population, with some scholars arguing that it was common by the time of the Ming dynasty, established in the 14th century, and others arguing that anti-gay attitudes became entrenched during the Westernization efforts of the late Qing dynasty and the early Republic of China in the 19th and 20th centuries.

In Ancient Fujian, the region had developed a sexual culture isolated from that of the rest of the Chinese empire. During the Qing dynasty, the local population began worshipping a Taoist deity known as Tu Er Shen, who served as the guardian of same-sex love. The deity was originally a human by the name of Hu Tianbao. Hu was executed after having been caught peeping on a nobleman he had become attracted to. He was originally destined to go to hell, but the guardians of the spirit realm took pity on him, as his crime was committed out of love. He was then appointed as the guardian of same-sex love.

The Central Qing government of Beijing labeled followers of Tu Er Shen &quot;cultists&quot; and demanded for their persecution and elimination. It was during this dynasty that China&#x27;s very first law against non-commercial same-sex sexual conduct was enacted. However, the newly created offense of homosexuality carried the most lenient penalty possible in the Qing legal system. Today, the Wei-ming temple dedicated to Tu Er Shen, located in New Taipei, serves as the world&#x27;s only religious temple dedicated exclusively to same-sex love.

The earliest law against a homosexual act dates from the Song dynasty, punishing &quot;young males who act as prostitutes&quot;. The first statute specifically banning homosexual intercourse was enacted in the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty.

Ming dynasty China banned homosexual sodomy (anal sex) in the Ming Code since the Jiajing emperor&#x27;s reign and continued into the Qing dynasty until 1907, when western influence led to the law being repealed. The Chinese mocked and insulted Puyi and the Japanese as homosexuals and presented it as proof of their perversion and being uncivilized. The only time homosexual sodomy has been banned in Japan was for short time for 8 years in 1872-1880 due to western influence.

Lu Tonglin, author of &quot;Misogyny, Cultural Nihilism &amp; Oppositional Politics: Contemporary Chinese Experimental Fiction&quot;, said &quot;a clear-cut dichotomy between heterosexuality and homosexuality did not exist in traditional China.&quot;

Male prostitution was forbidden during the Yuan dynasty (descended from the Mongol Empire) and the following Ming dynasty, and evidence suggests that there was a crackdown on homosexuality during this period as a continuation of the Mongol Empire&#x27;s hostility to homosexuality.

==Same-sex relationships in literature==
Same-sex love can sometimes be difficult to differentiate in Classical Chinese because the pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; were not distinguished. And like many East and Southeast Asian languages, Chinese does not have grammatical gender. Thus, poems such as Tang dynasty poems and other Chinese poetry may be read as either heterosexual or homosexual, neutral in that regard, depending on the context. 

Another complication in trying to separate heterosexual and homosexual themes in Chinese literature is that for most of Chinese history, writing was restricted to a cultivated elite, amongst whom blatant discussion of sex was considered vulgar. Until adopting European values late in their history, the Chinese did not even have nouns to describe a heterosexual or homosexual person per se. Rather, people who might be directly labeled as such in other traditions would be described by veiled allusions to the actions they enjoyed, or, more often, by referring to a famous example from the past. The most common of these references to homosexuality referenced Dong Xian and Mizi Xia.

The Chen dynasty&#x27;s &quot;Book of Chen&quot;, records the relationship between Emperor Wen of Chen and his favorite male lover, Han Zigao. Chen famously said to Han: &quot;people say I am destined to be an Emperor, if it comes true, you will become my queen.&quot; Chen did become an Emperor in 559, but he was unable to keep his promise to Han and instead, he made him a general. Han spent all his time with Chen until the latter died in 566. Outside the tomb of Chen, discovered in 2013, two statues of &quot;pixiu&quot; were found, different from the usual male and female design, since both of them are male, and are believed to represent Emperor Chen and Han Zigao.

The Tang dynasty &quot;Poetical Essay on the Supreme Joy&quot; is another good example of the allusive nature of Chinese writing on sexuality. This manuscript sought to present the &quot;supreme joy&quot; (sex) in every form known to the author; the chapter on homosexuality comes between chapters on sex in Buddhist monasteries and sex between peasants. It is the earliest surviving manuscript to mention homosexuality, but it does so through phrases such as &quot;cut sleeves in the imperial palace&quot;, &quot;countenances of linked jade&quot;, and &quot;they were like Lord Long Yang&quot;, phrases which would not be recognizable as speaking of sexuality of any kind to someone who was not familiar with the literary tradition.

While these conventions make explicit mentions of homosexuality rare in Chinese literature in comparison to the Greek or Japanese traditions, the allusions which do exist are given an exalted air by their frequent comparison to former Golden Ages and imperial favorites. A Han dynasty scholar describes in Garden of Stories the official Zhuang Xin making a nervous pass at his lord, Xiang Cheng of Chu. The ruler is nonplussed at first, but Zhuang justifies his suggestion through allusion to a chancellor who received the confessions of a fisherman by singing a song. At that, &quot;Lord Xiang Cheng also received Zhuang Xin&#x27;s hand and promoted him.&quot; A remarkable aspect of traditional Chinese literature is the prominence of same-sex friendship. Bai Juyi is one of many writers who wrote dreamy, lyrical poems to male friends about shared experiences. He and fellow scholar-bureaucrat Yuan Zhen made plans to retire together as Taoist recluses once they had saved enough funds, but Yuan&#x27;s death kept that dream from being fulfilled.

Other works depict less platonic relationships. A Ming dynasty rewriting of a very early Zhou dynasty legend recounts a passionate male relationship between Pan Zhang &amp; Wang Zhongxian which is equated to heterosexual marriage, and which continues even beyond death. The daring 17th century author Li Yu combined tales of passionate love between men with brutal violence and cosmic revenge. &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, one of China&#x27;s &quot;Four Great Classical Novels&quot; from the Qing dynasty, has scenes that depict men engaging in both same-sex and opposite-sex acts.

There is a tradition of clearly erotic literature, which is less known. It is supposed that most such works have been purged in the periodic book burnings that have been a feature of Chinese history. However, isolated manuscripts have survived. Chief among these is the anthology &quot;Bian er chai&quot; (), a series of four short stories in five chapters each, of passion and seduction. The first short story, &quot;Chronicle of a Loyal Love&quot;, involves a twenty-year-old academician chasing a fifteen-year-old scholar and a bevy of adolescent valets. In another, &quot;Qing Xia Ji&quot; (), the protagonist, Zhang, a valiant soldier with two warrior wives, is seduced by his younger friend Zhong, a remarkable arrangement as it is stereotypically the older man who takes the initiative with a boy. The work appeared in a single edition some time between 1630 and 1640.

More recently, Ding Ling, an author of the 1920s in China, was a prominent and controversial feminist author, and it is generally agreed that she had lesbian (or at least bisexual) content in her stories. Her most famous piece is &quot;Miss Sophia&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a seminal work in the development of a voice for women&#x27;s sexuality and sexual desire. Additionally, a contemporary author, Wong Bik-Wan, writes from the lesbian perspective in her story &quot;She&#x27;s a Young Woman and So Am I&quot; (). Author Pai Hsien-yung created a sensation by coming out of the closet in Taiwan, and by writing about gay life in Taipei in the 1960s and 70s.

Same-sex love was also celebrated in Chinese art, many examples of which have survived the various traumatic political events in recent Chinese history. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls and paintings on silk can be found in private collections.

==Gay, lesbian and queer culture in contemporary mainland China==
Gay identities and communities have expanded in China since the 1980s as a result of resurfacing dialogue about and engagement with queer identities in the public domain. Since the 1990s, the preferred term for people of diverse sexuality, sex and gender is &quot;tongzhi&quot; (). While lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) culture remains largely underground, there are a plethora of gay cruising zones and often unadvertised gay bars, restaurants and discos spread across the country. The recent and escalating proliferation of gay identity in mainland China is most significantly signaled by its recognition in mainstream media despite China&#x27;s media censorship. There are also many gay websites and LGBT organisations which help organise gay rights&#x27; campaigns, AIDS prevention efforts, film festivals and pride parades. Yet public discourse on the issue remains fraught - a product of competing ideologies surrounding the body; the morality of its agency in the public and private arena.

Like most modern societies, public sentiment on homosexuality in China sits within a liminal space. While it is not outright condemned, neither is it fully accepted as being part of the social norm. In many instances, those who associate with the queer community also associate with another marginalised group, such as rural-to-urban migrants and sex workers, and therefore the stigma that is attached to aspects of queer identity is often a manifestation of perceived social disobedience against different intersecting vectors of &#x27;moral rights&#x27;. As Elaine Jeffreys and Haiqing Yu note in their book, Sex in China, individuals who interact within the queer community do not necessarily identify as being homosexual. &#x27;Money boys&#x27;, men who provide commercial sexual services to other men, but do not identify as being homosexual, are an example of such a social group. Their minority status is imbued with aspects of criminality and poverty. This suggests that the &#x27;perverseness&#x27; attached to homosexuality in mainland China is not purely informed by a biological discourse, but, depending on the circumstances, can also be informed by accepted notions of cultural and social legitimacy.

The influence of Western gay and lesbian culture on China&#x27;s culture is complex. While Western ideas and conceptions of gayness have begun to permeate the Chinese gay and lesbian identity, some Chinese gay and lesbian activists have pushed back against the mainstream politics of asserting one&#x27;s own identity and pushing for social change due to its disruption of &quot;family ties and social harmony&quot;. Most of the exposure to Western gay and lesbian culture is through the internet or the media, but this exposure is limited—mainstream symbols of gay and lesbian culture (such as the rainbow flag) are not widely recognisable in China.

Justice Anthony Kennedy quoted Confucius in his majority ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; leading to discussion of the ruling on Sina Weibo. Chinese microblogging services also facilitate discourse on things like coming out to parents and articles in the People&#x27;s Daily on gay men.

==Later occurrences==
In 2009, a male couple held a symbolic wedding in public and &quot;China Daily&quot; took the photo of the two men in a passionate embrace across its pages. Other symbolic gay and lesbian weddings have been held across the country and have been covered positively by the Chinese media.
In 2012, Luo Hongling, a university professor, committed suicide because she knew her husband was a gay man. She alleged their marriage was just a lie since the man could not admit he was gay to his parents. Luo was considered a &quot;tongqi&quot;, local slang for a woman married to a homosexual male akin to the English term &quot;beard&quot;.

In 2016, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television banned images of homosexuals on television.

On April 13, 2018, Sina Weibo, one of China&#x27;s largest and most popular microblogging platforms, announced a new policy to ban all pieces of contents related to pornography, violence, and homosexuality. According to Weibo, this act was requested by the &quot;Network(Cyber) Security Law.&quot; However, it is unclear which &quot;Network Security Law&quot; Weibo was referring to. In the newest edition of &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China Network(Cyber) Security Law&quot; put into effect on June 1, 2017, by the government, media related to pornography is banned, yet the issue of homosexuality is not mentioned. It remains unclear if Weibo&#x27;s decision reflects its company&#x27;s own discrimination against the LGBTQ community, or if it foreshadows the government&#x27;s future policy against this group.

Weibo&#x27;s announcement led to the anger of China&#x27;s LGBTQ community as well as many other Chinese citizens. A Weibo user called &quot;&quot;Zhu Ding Zhen&quot; &quot; made a post, saying, &quot;&quot;I am gay, what about you?&quot; &quot; This post was read more than 2.4 billion times and shared by about 3 million users, commented by 1.5 million users, and liked by 9.5 million users in less than 3 days. On April 16, Weibo posted another announcement to reverse its previous decision, stating that Weibo would stop banning pieces of contents related to homosexuality and expressed thanks to its users&#x27; &quot;discussions&quot; and &quot;suggestions&quot;.

In 2021, China&#x27;s government began to crack down on the presence of what it called &quot;sissy men&quot; and &quot;effeminate men&quot; in television, making many in the country&#x27;s LGBTQ community feel &quot;deeply uneasy&quot;. Films with gay characters like &quot;Call Me By Your Name&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; have also been curbed in the country.

This restrictions also come as social media star Zhou Peng committed suicide just a few months later saying that he was bullied and called a &quot;sissy&quot;. &quot;Boys are supposed to be naughty, fight, and swear, and boys who are too quiet and polite are effeminate,&quot; he wrote in a suicide letter. &quot;I was called &#x27;sissy&#x27; at school. I might somewhat appear like a girl when I was younger, but I dressed &#x27;normally&#x27; and didn&#x27;t attempt to imitate girls.&quot;

==Legal status==

Adult, consensual and non-commercial homosexuality has been legal in China since 1997, when the national penal code was revised. Homosexuality was removed from the Chinese Society of Psychiatry&#x27;s list of mental illnesses in 2001 and the public health campaign against HIV/AIDS pandemic does include education for men who have sex with men. Officially, overt police enforcement against gay people is restricted to gay people engaging in sex acts in public or prostitution, which are also illegal for heterosexuals. In addition, the declassification in 2001 was never officially recognised by the Ministry of Health (Now National Health Commission).

However, despite these changes, no civil rights law exists to address discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Households headed by same-sex couples are not permitted to adopt children and do not have the same privileges as heterosexual married couples.

On January 5, 2016, a court in Changsha, southern Hunan province, agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Furong district civil affairs bureau for its June 2015 refusal of the right to register to marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On April 13, 2016, with hundreds of gay marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China. On May 17, 2016, Sun and Hu were married in a private ceremony in Changsha, expressing their intention to organize another 99 LGBT weddings across the country to normalize gay marriage in China.

In 2014, a Beijing court issued an unanticipated ruling against the practice of gay conversion therapy. This ruling, however, did not apply nationwide and different district courts have issued various conflicting rulings. In 2016, a Henan court awarded civil damages to a victim of gay conversion therapy who had been physically and psychologically traumatized as a result of the procedure. However, the Court did not expressly prohibit the practice. In parallel to the previous decision, the Henan&#x27;s court&#x27;s decision also did not apply nationwide. At the national level, no action has been taken against gay conversion therapy and the practice continues to be promoted on a national level. LGBT activists have been pressuring the central government for a complete nationwide ban.

== Sham marriages in contemporary mainland China ==
Due to social pressure, gay men and women sometimes enter into heterosexual-presenting relationships for appearances. When a straight woman marries a gay man, the woman is known as tongqi; when a straight man marries a lesbian woman, they are known as tongfu. When a lesbian woman and a gay man marry each other, the resulting marriage is known as xinghun, or cooperative marriage.

Much more research has been done on tongqi than tongfu, although neither has been extensive. Researchers at the Harbin Institute of Technology conducted a study on tongqi and tongfu in China. In their research, they were able to find over 200 tongqi to interview but only about 10 tongfu. They hypothesized this was because men are less likely to take their complaints online, and are less likely to be aware they are married to a queer person than their female counterparts, so they are less likely to be represented in self-help groups. They also hypothesized that men are more likely to be pressured into marriage than women, due to the social pressure to produce an heir. It is estimated that over 80% of bisexual and gay men in China marry straight women but the percentage of lesbian and bisexual women who marry straight men is unknown.

Xinghun, or formality marriage, is a tradition among Chinese queers that has seen uptake in recent years. Due to the rise of the internet, and specifically, online dating sites, Chinese entrepreneurs have created services to expedite the marriages of gay men and women to each other. Some examples of these services are the Queers app created to facilitate lavender marriage and Chinagayles.com, a service created in 2005 with over 380,000 registered accounts that has claimed to facilitate over 20,000 sham marriages.

The practice of Xinghun has become more accessible with the rise of the internet, but has also come under more scrutiny in recent years. Most people opposed to the practice were born in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Deng Xiaoping was the chairman of China. Xiaoping&#x27;s economic policy of &quot;reform and re-opening up&quot; opened up China to foreign imports but also foreign ideas, such as acceptance of homosexuality and autonomy in marriage choices. Xiaoping&#x27;s policies led to a more market-based economy in China and a populace that was more willing to express their ideas. Young Chinese people raise issues about the complications that could arise from sham marriages, such as male violence through rape or assault towards an unwilling wife, or the issues that come from raising a child who does not know the full extent of their parents&#x27; identities and relationship.

== &quot;出柜&quot; (Coming out) ==
Coming out (出柜) is a crucial component of the experience of homosexuality in China, as it requires navigating complex cultural, social, and political factors. Coming out involves revealing one&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity to others, and it can pose significant challenges and risks for LGBTQ+ individuals in Chinese society. The act of coming out can have a profound impact on the lives and well-being of members of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly in a country like China, where strong traditions and family values are deeply ingrained in the fabric of society. These strong traditions and family values often emphasize the importance of maintaining a harmonious family structure and fulfilling filial duties. One of these duties is to marry and have children, ensuring the continuation of the family line. In this context, coming out as LGBTQ+ may be perceived as a betrayal of these expectations, causing tension and conflict within the family unit. This can lead to social isolation, strained relationships, and even disownment, as family members may feel ashamed or dishonored by an LGBTQ+ relative&#x27;s disclosure. Additionally, traditional Chinese values place great importance on preserving social harmony, which can manifest in a preference for conformity and adherence to social norms. As a result, LGBTQ+ individuals who come out may face ostracism, discrimination, and harassment from their communities, as their sexual orientation or gender identity may be considered disruptive to the social order. These challenges can make the coming-out process incredibly difficult and emotionally taxing for LGBTQ+ individuals in China. Historically, homosexuality was largely taboo in Chinese society, and individuals who identified as LGBTQ+ faced significant social and legal consequences for their sexual orientation or gender identity, examples range from when the People&#x27;s Republic of China was just established, being an LGBTQ+ individual was criminalized under &quot;hooliganism&quot; laws, which led to the arrest, imprisonment, and sentenced to re-education through the labor, to homosexuality has been listed as a mental disorder in the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders before it was taken out of the list in 2001.

In recent years, there has been a notable shift in China towards greater awareness and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly among younger generations who are more exposed to global perspectives on sexual diversity. This progress is evidenced by the growing visibility of LGBTQ+ communities, increased media representation, and the emergence of support networks and advocacy organizations. Despite these positive developments, coming out remains a challenging and often daunting process in China, as LGBTQ+ individuals must navigate a myriad of diverse and complex concerns. They may fear rejection or discrimination from their families, who might struggle to reconcile traditional values with their loved one&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. Additionally, LGBTQ+ individuals could face ostracism from their peers, colleagues, or employers, further complicating the decision to come out. Legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in China remain limited. Same-sex marriage is not recognized, and there are no comprehensive anti-discrimination laws that specifically protect LGBTQ+ individuals. Consequently, many LGBTQ+ people may choose to conceal their identities to avoid discrimination or persecution in various aspects of their lives.

Despite these challenges, coming out can be a powerful and transformative experience for LGBTQ+ individuals in China. Sharing their experiences and identities not only enables personal growth and self-acceptance but also helps to promote greater understanding and acceptance of sexual diversity in Chinese society. As more people come out, the visibility of the LGBTQ+ community increases, fostering conversations and challenging misconceptions and stereotypes. Moreover, the growing support for LGBTQ+ rights in China has led to the formation of advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations, and community-based initiatives that provide crucial resources, safe spaces, and support networks for LGBTQ+ individuals. These efforts contribute to a more inclusive and supportive environment for sexual minorities, which can, in turn, improve their health and well-being.

===Family and societal expectations===

One significant factor influencing the coming out process in China is the deeply ingrained cultural concept of filial piety. The notion of filial piety, originating from Confucianism and Chinese traditions, promotes a collection of ethical principles, ideals, and behaviors that emphasize reverence and compassion towards one&#x27;s parents. Filial piety also places great emphasis on continuing the family line through procreation. A famous saying in Chinese, &quot;不孝有三，无后为大&quot;, suggests that among the three major ways to be disrespectful to your parents and ancestors, the most severe one is not having offspring. This saying reifies the Chinese individual&#x27;s natural obligation to contribute more children to the family, a hallmark of filial culture that fundamentally focuses on collective and familial flourishing. Filial piety, deeply ingrained in Chinese culture, is seen as a moral obligation. It is believed in the Chinese culture that, by fulfilling this duty, one can bring honor to their family and ancestors. Failing to fulfill the moral obligation would be considered unfilial, bringing shame to the entire family. As such, this cultural expectation often discourages LGBTQ+ individuals from coming out, for fear that they will disappoint their families or fail to fulfill their apparent duties. In order to continue the family line in a society where same-sex marriage is the norm - legally and socially - two situations arise. The first situation concerns those who would like to come out before reaching marriageable age which is 22 for the man and 20 for the woman. For them, the most difficult situation is that coming out will lead their parents to strongly oppose their children&#x27;s self-selection in fear that it contradicts the notion of filial piety to continue the bloodline and the traditional gender concepts. One such example is the story of Ying Xin. Ying Xin was born in the small city of Xiangyang in Hubei Province, she has been the executive director at the Beijing LGBT Center for seven years and has helped transform the Beijing LGBT Center into the biggest queer community safe space in China. Ying Xin shared her coming out story, and her mother thought she was joking at first and became angry and said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I would have a daughter like this kind of freak.&quot; Then, she asked, &quot;Don&#x27;t you feel ashamed to do that kind of thing with girls?&quot;. Addressing the second problem that arises for individuals who wish to come out, for individuals who come to realize their sexual orientation or gender identity after they have already married and established a family, the situation can be particularly challenging. These individuals may have been deeply influenced by traditional gender concepts and societal expectations, which may have prevented them from recognizing or acknowledging their true identity earlier in life. They usually face the daunting challenge of potentially jeopardizing their marital or family bonds due to the fear associated with coming out.

===Conversion therapy===

Despite being extensively discredited by mental health professionals around the world, conversion therapy—a set of practices aimed at changing an individual&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity—continues to be practiced in China. Unfortunately, many LGBTQ+ people are coerced into undergoing conversion therapy by family members who, see it as a way to &quot;cure&quot; their loved ones&#x27; homosexuality. the family usually uses verbal threats and emotional manipulation to force the child into this so-called conversion therapy. These conversion therapy practices can take various forms, including electroconvulsive therapy, aversion techniques, and prescription of inappropriate medications without informing the individuals about its purpose and side-effect, examples like giving unknown pills and injecting &quot;colorless liquid&quot;. All of these methods have been proven to be not only ineffective but also harmful to the individuals subjected to them. The lasting effects of conversion therapy on individuals&#x27; mental health are profoundly negative, often leading to severe depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, the trauma inflicted by these practices can cause feelings of isolation, self-loathing, and difficulty forming healthy relationships. The consequences of conversion therapy extend beyond the immediate psychological impact, affecting individuals&#x27; overall well-being and their ability to lead fulfilling lives.

===Workplace discrimination and career implications===

Examining the impact of prejudice in the labor market, taste-based discrimination (TBD) is an economic model that sheds light on how personal biases against specific cultures or communities can lead employers to discriminate against minority groups, including the LGBTQ community, in the workplace. This model posits that some employers, driven by personal biases or prejudices against particular cultures or communities, may discriminate against minority groups. In an effort to avoid engaging with minority applicants, including transgender individuals, companies may display bias, even though it can have a detrimental effect on their financial performance. In the workplace, many LGBTQ employees face challenges due to stigma and a lack of supportive policies that protect them from harassment and discrimination. The Chinese Labor Law explicitly provides protection against discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and gender, it does not include provisions addressing discrimination related to sexual orientation or gender identity. In the same vein, the Employment Promotion Law prohibits discriminatory practices in recruitment and employment but fails to explicitly reference issues concerning sexuality or gender identity. Since many companies lack protective policies and guidelines for LGBTQ employees, a majority of these individuals do not disclose their sexual orientation or self-identification in the workplace. A previous study carried out by grassroots organizations in 2013 identified various motives behind LGBTQ+ employees hiding their identity: 60.9 percent were concerned about being marginalized, 51.7 percent believed it might hinder their chances of promotion, and 22.5 percent were apprehensive about losing their jobs. These career-related anxieties are supported by evidence, as another survey discovered that approximately one-fourth of individuals whose sexual orientation was disclosed were either terminated from their jobs or forced to resign. These fear of revealing sexual orientation and negative experiences related to that can contribute to reduced job satisfaction, decreased productivity, and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. It is crucial for companies to establish inclusive policies and offer training that fosters a safe and supportive environment for all employees. However. By addressing these issues and promoting a more inclusive work climate, companies can create a healthier, more productive environment for all employees.

In 2015, film-maker Fan Popo sued government censors for pulling his gay documentary &quot;Mama Rainbow&quot; from online sites. The lawsuit concluded in December 2015 with a finding by Beijing No.1 Intermediate People&#x27;s Court that the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) had not requested that hosting sites pull the documentary. Despite this ruling, which Fan felt was a victory because it effectively limited state involvement, &quot;the film is still unavailable to see online on Chinese hosting sites.&quot;

On December 31, 2015, the China Television Drama Production Industry Association posted new guidelines, including a ban on showing queer relationships on TV. The regulations stated: &quot;No television drama shall show abnormal sexual relationships and behaviors, such as incest, same-sex relationships, sexual perversion, sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual violence, and so on.&quot; These new regulations have begun to affect web dramas, which have historically had fewer restrictions:

&quot;Chinese Web dramas are commonly deemed as enjoying looser censorship compared with content on TV and the silver screen. They often feature more sexual, violent and other content that is deemed by traditional broadcasters to fall in the no-no area.&quot;

In February 2016 the popular Chinese gay web series &quot;Addicted (Heroin)&quot; was banned from being broadcast online 12 episodes into a 15-episode season. Makers of the series uploaded the remaining episodes on YouTube, and production of a planned second season remains in doubt.

<text>Närke and Värmland County () was the earlier name of Örebro County in Sweden, between 1634 and 1779. In that year Värmland ceded to form Värmland County. Since Närke only corresponded the southern part of the remaining territory and the name was changed to reflect the city where the Governor resided, namely Örebro.

<doc id="359377" wikidata="Q4833865" url="?curid=359377" title="Abstract structure">
<text>In mathematics and related fields, an abstract structure is a way of describing a set of mathematical objects and the relationships between them, focusing on the essential rules and properties rather than any specific meaning or example.

For example, in a game such as chess, the rules of how the pieces move and interact define the structure of the game, regardless of whether the pieces are made of wood or plastic. Similarly, an abstract structure defines a framework of objects, operations, and relationships. These structures are studied in their own right, revealing fundamental mathematical principles. While a real-world object or computer program might &quot;represent, instantiate,&quot; or &quot;implement&quot; an abstract structure, the structure itself exists as an abstract concept, independent of any particular representation. 

This abstraction allows to see common patterns across seemingly different areas of mathematics and to apply the same reasoning and tools to analyze them. Abstract structures are studied not only in logic and mathematics but in the fields that apply them, as computer science and computer graphics, and in the studies that reflect on them, such as philosophy (especially the philosophy of mathematics).

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a concept or an idea. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question, and it must be free from contradictions. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of democracy, but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess (for example Kasparovian approaches).

==Examples== 
* A sorting algorithm is an abstract structure, but a recipe is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
* A simple melody is an abstract structure, but an orchestration is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
* Euclidean geometry is an abstract structure, but the theory of continental drift is not, because it depends on the geology of the Earth.
* A formal language is an abstract structure, but a natural language is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.

<doc id="359380" wikidata="Q2733" url="?curid=359380" title="Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm">
<text>The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. It has been used in the 7z format of the 7-Zip archiver since 2001. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm published by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and features a high compression ratio (generally higher than bzip2) and a variable compression-dictionary size (up to 4 GB), while still maintaining decompression speed similar to other commonly used compression algorithms.

LZMA2 is a simple container format that can include both uncompressed data and LZMA data, possibly with multiple different LZMA encoding parameters. LZMA2 supports arbitrarily scalable multithreaded compression and decompression and efficient compression of data which is partially incompressible.

== Overview ==
LZMA uses a dictionary compression algorithm (a variant of LZ77 with huge dictionary sizes and special support for repeatedly used match distances), whose output is then encoded with a range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which is encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder: many encodings are possible, and a dynamic programming algorithm is used to select an optimal one under certain approximations.

Prior to LZMA, most encoder models were purely byte-based (i.e. they coded each bit using only a cascade of contexts to represent the dependencies on previous bits from the same byte). The main innovation of LZMA is that instead of a generic byte-based model, LZMA&#x27;s model uses contexts specific to the bitfields in each representation of a literal or phrase: this is nearly as simple as a generic byte-based model, but gives much better compression because it avoids mixing unrelated bits together in the same context. Furthermore, compared to classic dictionary compression (such as the one used in zip and gzip formats), the dictionary sizes can be and usually are much larger, taking advantage of the large amount of memory available on modern systems.

==Compressed format overview==
In LZMA compression, the compressed stream is a stream of bits, encoded using an adaptive binary range coder. The stream is divided into packets, each packet describing either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded. Each part of each packet is modeled with independent contexts, so the probability predictions for each bit are correlated with the values of that bit (and related bits from the same field) in previous packets of the same type. Both the lzip and the LZMA SDK documentation describes this stream format.

There are 7 types of packets:

LONGREP[*] refers to LONGREP[0–3] packets, *REP refers to both LONGREP and SHORTREP, and *MATCH refers to both MATCH and *REP.

LONGREP[n] packets remove the distance used from the list of the most recent distances and reinsert it at the front, to avoid useless repeated entry, while MATCH just adds the distance to the front even if already present in the list and SHORTREP and LONGREP[0] don&#x27;t alter the list.

The length is encoded as follows:
As in LZ77, the length is not limited by the distance, because copying from the dictionary is defined as if the copy was performed byte by byte, keeping the distance constant.

Distances are logically 32-bit and distance 0 points to the most recently added byte in the dictionary.

The distance encoding starts with a 6-bit &quot;distance slot&quot;, which determines how many further bits are needed.
Distances are decoded as a binary concatenation of, from most to least significant, two bits depending on the distance slot, some bits encoded with fixed 0.5 probability, and some context encoded bits, according to the following table (distance slots 0−3 directly encode distances 0−3).

== Decompression algorithm details ==

No complete natural language specification of the compressed format seems to exist, other than the one attempted in the following text.

The description below is based on the compact XZ Embedded decoder by Lasse Collin included in the Linux kernel source from which the LZMA and LZMA2 algorithm details can be relatively easily deduced: thus, while citing source code as reference is not ideal, any programmer should be able to check the claims below with a few hours of work.

===Range coding of bits===

LZMA data is at the lowest level decoded one bit at a time by the range decoder, at the direction of the LZMA decoder.

Context-based range decoding is invoked by the LZMA algorithm passing it a reference to the &quot;context&quot;, which consists of the unsigned 11-bit variable &quot;prob&quot; (typically implemented using a 16-bit data type) representing the predicted probability of the bit being 0, which is read and updated by the range decoder (and should be initialized to , representing 0.5 probability).

Fixed probability range decoding instead assumes a 0.5 probability, but operates slightly differently from context-based range decoding.

The range decoder state consists of two unsigned 32-bit variables, &quot;range&quot; (representing the range size), and &quot;code&quot; (representing the encoded point within the range).

Initialization of the range decoder consists of setting &quot;range&quot; to , and &quot;code&quot; to the 32-bit value starting at the second byte in the stream interpreted as big-endian; the first byte in the stream is completely ignored.

Normalization proceeds in this way:
# Shift both &quot;range&quot; and &quot;code&quot; left by 8 bits
# Read a byte from the compressed stream
# Set the least significant 8 bits of &quot;code&quot; to the byte value read

Context-based range decoding of a bit using the &quot;prob&quot; probability variable proceeds in this way:
# If &quot;range&quot; is less than , perform normalization
# Set &quot;bound&quot; to 
# If &quot;code&quot; is less than &quot;bound&quot;:
## Set &quot;range&quot; to &quot;bound&quot;
## Set &quot;prob&quot; to &quot;prob&quot; + 
## Return bit 0
# Otherwise (if &quot;code&quot; is greater than or equal to the &quot;bound&quot;):
## Set &quot;range&quot; to &quot;range&quot; − &quot;bound&quot;
## Set &quot;code&quot; to &quot;code&quot; − &quot;bound&quot;
## Set &quot;prob&quot; to 
## Return bit 1

Fixed-probability range decoding of a bit proceeds in this way:
# If &quot;range&quot; is less than , perform normalization
# Set &quot;range&quot; to 
# If &quot;code&quot; is less than &quot;range&quot;:
## Return bit 0
# Otherwise (if &quot;code&quot; is greater or equal than &quot;range&quot;):
## Set &quot;code&quot; to &quot;code&quot; − &quot;range&quot;
## Return bit 1

The Linux kernel implementation of fixed-probability decoding in codice_1, for performance reasons, does not include a conditional branch, but instead subtracts &quot;range&quot; from &quot;code&quot; unconditionally. The resulting sign bit is used to both decide the bit to return and to generate a mask that is combined with &quot;code&quot; and added to &quot;range&quot;.

Note that:
# The division by when computing &quot;bound&quot; and floor operation is done before the multiplication, not after (apparently to avoid requiring fast hardware support for 32-bit multiplication with a 64-bit result)
# Fixed probability decoding is not strictly equivalent to context-based range decoding with any &quot;prob&quot; value, due to the fact that context-based range decoding discards the lower 11 bits of &quot;range&quot; before multiplying by &quot;prob&quot; as just described, while fixed probability decoding only discards the last bit

===Range coding of integers ===

The range decoder also provides the bit-tree, reverse bit-tree and fixed probability integer decoding facilities, which are used to decode integers, and generalize the single-bit decoding described above.
To decode unsigned integers less than &quot;limit&quot;, an array of 11-bit probability variables is provided, which are conceptually arranged as the internal nodes of a complete binary tree with &quot;limit&quot; leaves.

Non-reverse bit-tree decoding works by keeping a pointer to the tree of variables, which starts at the root. As long as the pointer does not point to a leaf, a bit is decoded using the variable indicated by the pointer, and the pointer is moved to either the left or right children depending on whether the bit is 0 or 1; when the pointer points to a leaf, the number associated with the leaf is returned.

Non-reverse bit-tree decoding thus happens from most significant to least significant bit, stopping when only one value in the valid range is possible (this conceptually allows to have range sizes that are not powers of two, even though LZMA does not make use of this).

Reverse bit-tree decoding instead decodes from least significant bit to most significant bits, and thus only supports ranges that are powers of two, and always decodes the same number of bits. It is equivalent to performing non-reverse bittree decoding with a power of two &quot;limit&quot;, and reversing the last bits of the result.

In the function in the Linux kernel, integers are actually returned in the range (with &quot;limit&quot; added to the conceptual value), and the variable at index 0 in the array is unused, while the one at index 1 is the root, and the left and right children indices are computed as 2&quot;i&quot; and 2&quot;i&quot; + 1. The function instead adds integers in the range to a caller-provided variable, where &quot;limit&quot; is implicitly represented by its logarithm, and has its own independent implementation for efficiency reasons.

Fixed probability integer decoding simply performs fixed probability bit decoding repeatedly, reading bits from the most to the least significant.

=== LZMA configuration ===
The LZMA decoder is configured by an &quot;properties&quot; byte and a dictionary size. The value of the byte is , where:
* &quot;lc&quot; is the number of high bits of the previous byte to use as a context for literal encoding (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 3)
*&quot;lp&quot; is the number of low bits of the dictionary position to include in (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 0)
*&quot;pb&quot; is the number of low bits of the dictionary position to include in (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 2)

In non-LZMA2 streams, &quot;lc&quot; must not be greater than 8, and &quot;lp&quot; and &quot;pb&quot; must not be greater than 4.
In LZMA2 streams, and &quot;pb&quot; must not be greater than 4.

In the 7-zip LZMA file format, configuration is performed by a header containing the &quot;properties&quot; byte followed by the 32-bit little-endian dictionary size in bytes. In LZMA2, the properties byte can optionally be changed at the start of LZMA2 LZMA packets, while the dictionary size is specified in the LZMA2 header as later described.

=== LZMA coding contexts ===

The LZMA packet format has already been described, and this section specifies how LZMA statistically models the LZ-encoded streams, or in other words which probability variables are passed to the range decoder to decode each bit.

Those probability variables are implemented as multi-dimensional arrays; before introducing them, a few values that are used as indices in these multidimensional arrays are defined.

The &quot;state&quot; value is conceptually based on which of the patterns in the following table match the latest 2–4 packet types seen, and is implemented as a state machine state updated according to the transition table listed in the table every time a packet is output.

The initial state is 0, and thus packets before the beginning are assumed to be LIT packets.
The &quot;pos_state&quot; and &quot;literal_pos_state&quot; values consist of respectively the &quot;pb&quot; and &quot;lp&quot; (up to 4, from the LZMA header or LZMA2 properties packet) least significant bits of the dictionary position (the number of bytes coded since the last dictionary reset modulo the dictionary size). Note that the dictionary size is normally the multiple of a large power of 2, so these values are equivalently described as the least significant bits of the number of uncompressed bytes seen since the last dictionary reset.

The &quot;prev_byte_lc_msbs&quot; value is set to the &quot;lc&quot; (up to 4, from the LZMA header or LZMA2 properties packet) most significant bits of the previous uncompressed byte.

The &quot;is_REP&quot; value denotes whether a packet that includes a length is a LONGREP rather than a MATCH.

The &quot;match_byte&quot; value is the byte that would have been decoded if a SHORTREP packet had been used (in other words, the byte found at the dictionary at the last used distance); it is only used just after a *MATCH packet.

&quot;literal_bit_mode&quot; is an array of 8 values in the 0–2 range, one for each bit position in a byte, which are 1 or 2 if the previous packet was a *MATCH and it is either the most significant bit position or all the more significant bits in the literal to encode/decode are equal to the bits in the corresponding positions in &quot;match_byte&quot;, while otherwise it is 0; the choice between the 1 or 2 values depends on the value of the bit at the same position in &quot;match_byte&quot;.

The literal/Literal set of variables can be seen as a &quot;pseudo-bit-tree&quot; similar to a bit-tree but with 3 variables instead of 1 in every node, chosen depending on the &quot;literal_bit_mode&quot; value at the bit position of the next bit to decode after the bit-tree context denoted by the node.

The claim, found in some sources, that literals after a *MATCH are coded as the XOR of the byte value with &quot;match_byte&quot; is incorrect; they are instead coded simply as their byte value, but using the pseudo-bit-tree just described and the additional context listed in the table below.

The probability variable groups used in LZMA are those:
=== LZMA2 format ===
The LZMA2 container supports multiple runs of compressed LZMA data and uncompressed data. Each LZMA compressed run can have a different LZMA configuration and dictionary. This improves the compression of partially or completely incompressible files and allows multithreaded compression and multithreaded decompression by breaking the file into runs that can be compressed or decompressed independently in parallel.
Criticism of LZMA2&#x27;s changes over LZMA include header fields not being covered by CRCs,
and parallel decompression not being possible in practice.

The LZMA2 header consists of a byte indicating the dictionary size:
* 40 indicates a 4 GB − 1 dictionary size
* Even values less than 40 indicate a 2&quot;v&quot;/2 + 12 bytes dictionary size
* Odd values less than 40 indicate a 3×2(&quot;v&quot; − 1)/2 + 11 bytes dictionary size
* Values higher than 40 are invalid

LZMA2 data consists of packets starting with a control byte, with the following values:
* 0 denotes the end of the file
* 1 denotes a dictionary reset followed by an uncompressed chunk
* 2 denotes an uncompressed chunk without a dictionary reset
* 3–0x7f are invalid values
* 0x80–0xff denotes an LZMA chunk, where the lowest 5 bits are used as bit 16–20 of the uncompressed size minus one, and bit 5–6 indicates what should be reset

Bits 5–6 for LZMA chunks can be:
* 0: nothing reset
* 1: state reset
* 2: state reset, properties reset using properties byte
* 3: state reset, properties reset using properties byte, dictionary reset

LZMA state resets cause a reset of all LZMA state except the dictionary, and specifically:
* The range coder
* The &quot;state&quot; value
* The last distances for repeated matches
* All LZMA probabilities

Uncompressed chunks consist of:
* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the data size minus one
* The data to be copied verbatim into the dictionary and the output

LZMA chunks consist of:
* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the low 16 bits of the uncompressed size minus one
* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the compressed size minus one
* A properties/lclppb byte if bit 6 in the control byte is set
* The LZMA compressed data, starting with the 5 bytes (of which the first is ignored) used to initialize the range coder (which are included in the compressed size)

=== xz and 7z formats ===

The .xz format, which can contain LZMA2 data, is documented at &quot;tukaani.org&quot;, while the .7z file format, which can contain either LZMA or LZMA2 data, is documented in the 7zformat.txt file contained in the LZMA SDK.

== 7-Zip reference implementation ==
The LZMA implementation extracted from 7-Zip is available as LZMA SDK. It was originally dual-licensed under both the GNU LGPL and Common Public License, with an additional special exception for linked binaries, but was placed by Igor Pavlov in the public domain on December 2, 2008, with the release of version 4.62.

LZMA2 compression, which is an improved version of LZMA, is now the default compression method for the .7z format, starting with version 9.30 on October 26, 2012.

The reference open source LZMA compression library was originally written in C++ but has been ported to ANSI C, C#, and Java. There are also third-party Python bindings for the C++ library, as well as ports of LZMA to Pascal, Go and Ada.

The 7-Zip implementation uses several variants of hash chains, binary trees and Patricia trees as the basis for its dictionary search algorithm.

In addition to LZMA, the SDK and 7-Zip also implements multiple preprocessing filters intended to improve compression, ranging from simple delta encoding (for images) and BCJ for executable code. It also provides some other compression algorithms used in 7z.

Decompression-only code for LZMA generally compiles to around 5 KB, and the amount of RAM required during decompression is principally determined by the size of the sliding window used during compression. Small code size and relatively low memory overhead, particularly with smaller dictionary lengths, and free source code make the LZMA decompression algorithm well-suited to embedded applications.

== Other implementations ==
In addition to the 7-Zip reference implementation, the following support the LZMA format.
* xz: a streaming implementation that contains a gzip-like command line tool, supporting both LZMA and LZMA2 in its xz file format. It made its way into several software of the Unix-like world with its high performance (compared to bzip2) and small size (compared to gzip). The Linux kernel, dpkg and RPM systems contains xz code, and many software distributors like kernel.org, Debian and Fedora now use xz for compressing their releases.
* lzip: another LZMA implementation mostly for Unix-like systems to be directly competing with xz. It mainly features a simpler file format and therefore easier error recovery.
* ZIPX: an extension to the ZIP compressions format that was created by WinZip starting with version 12.1. It also can use various other compression methods such as BZip and PPMd.

== LZHAM ==
LZHAM (LZ, Huffman, Arithmetic, Markov), is an LZMA-like implementation that trades compression throughput for very high ratios and higher decompression throughput. It was placed by its author in the public domain on 15 September 2020.

It lies along the Martil Valley and is one of the two major ports of Morocco on the Mediterranean Sea, a few miles south of the Strait of Gibraltar, and about E.S.E. of Tangier. In the 2014 Moroccan census, the city recorded a population of 380,787 inhabitants. It is part of the administrative division Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima.

The city has witnessed many development cycles spanning over more than 2,000 years. The first settlements, discovered a few miles outside of the modern city limits, belonged to the ancient Mauretanians and date back to the 3rd century BC. A century later, Phoenicians traded there and after them the site—known now as the ancient town of Tamuda—became a Roman colony under Emperor Augustus.

In the late 13th century, the Marinids started by building a casbah and mosque in what is now the old city. Soon after in 1305, the scale of the settlement was expanded by sultan Abu Thabit Amir, who fortified the place. Around the early 15th century, the Castilians destroyed the settlement in retaliation for piracy.

The modern history of the city starts around the late 15th century. It was re-built and fortified by Ali al-Mandri, who emigrated from the Nasrid city of Granada in the decade before it fell in the hands of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile as the War of Granada was completed in 1492. Thousands of Muslims and Jews from Andalusia settled in the north of Morocco and on the ruins of the city of Tétouan. The city went through a prosperous period of reconstruction and growth in various fields and became a center for the reception of Andalusian civilization. It is often linked to Granada and is nicknamed &quot;Granada&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; some families still keep keys belonging to their old homes in Granada. It is also nicknamed &quot;Pequeña Jerusalén&quot; (Little Jerusalem) by Sephardi Jews. The vast majority of the population are Muslims and small Christian and Jewish communities also exist, although their presence has declined sharply in recent decades.

In 1913, Tétouan became the capital of the Spanish protectorate of Morocco, which was governed by the Khalifa (Moroccan prince serving as Viceroy for the Sultan), and the Spanish &quot;Alto Comisario&quot; accredited to him. It remained the capital until 1956, when Morocco regained its full independence.

Tétouan is a renowned multicultural center. The medina of Tétouan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Crafts and Folk Art since 2017.

== Etymology ==
According to Leo Africanus, the name comes after the Goths bestowed the government of the town upon a woman with one eye and that the inhabitants called it &quot;Tetteguin&quot;, meaning &quot;eye&quot; in their language. 

The current name is first mentioned in 9th-century Arabic chronicles, after the death of Idris II. 

== History ==
=== Phoenician and Roman presence ===

A few miles outside of the city limits lies the ancient town of Tamuda. Early settlements at the outskirts of the actual city by ancient Mauretanians date back to the 3rd century BC. Artifacts from both the Phoenician and the Roman era have been found at the site of Tamuda. It became a Roman colony under Emperor Augustus.

=== Rebuilding the city-state ===
In 1286, the Marinids built a casbah and mosque there. The first large-scale building project took place in 1305 when the settlement was expanded by the Marinid sultan Abu Thabit Amir. He fortified the place and had it serve as a base for attacks on Ceuta, which had recently come under the rule of a rebellious member of the Marinid dynasty. In 1399, it was destroyed by the Castilians, because pirates used it for their attacks. The Portuguese were already occupying the neighboring Ceuta and in 1436, its commander Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real dispatched a detachment of his garrison under his son Duarte de Menezes to raid Tétouan - which was recovering from the Castillian destruction - in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to future Portuguese operations.

By the end of the 15th century, it was rebuilt by refugees from the Reconquista (reconquest of Spain, completed by the fall of Granada in 1492), when the Andalusian Moors, led by Ali al-Mandri, a captain of the troops loyal to Boabdil, the last king of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, took refuge in the ruined city. They first raised the walls and then filled the enclosure with houses. These Andalusians came into conflict with the Beni Hozmar tribe settling in Jebala lands, after which they asked the Wattasid sultan for protection. In response, he sent 80 soldiers (according to one chronicle, 40 natives of Fez and 40 Riffians). In turn, the Andalusians paid a large amount of mithqal, thus insuring their autonomy. Instantly, the Andalusians, assisted by tribes from the surrounding mountains, started harassing the Spanish possessions on the Moroccan coast. These attacks led to the destruction of the city&#x27;s harbor by the Spanish in 1565. During this time, the city was governed by the Andalusian Abu Hassan al-Mandri and the city remained autonomous from the Saadi sultans, with the Saadis constantly trying to assert their power.

=== Piracy and &quot;Mazmorras&quot; ===

As early as the 1530s and 1540s, at the time when Spain and the Ottoman Empire were disputing control over the western part of the Mediterranean, piracy was spreading and soon Tétouan became one of the main centers of piracy in the region. Corsairs considered it as a form of retaliation against the Spanish Reconquista that led to the loss of their homes back in al-Andalus, especially that the timing coincided with the first Morisco influx to Tétouan due to the forced conversions they faced in Spain between 1501 and 1526. Their collaborators included English and Dutch renegades who were mostly Protestants, although a few had converted to Islam.

While the harbor served as a port from where piracy missions were launched, captives were taken to dungeons. There were underground prison complexes with a series of connected excavated caves called &quot;Mazmorras&quot;. The captives were faced with being sold to the slavery market if ransoms were not paid. These subterranean installations were rediscovered in the early 20th century. A chapel of 90 square meters and a few altars were also uncovered. The sacred site, named &quot;Nuestra Señora de los Dolores&quot; (Our Lady of Sorrows), was used by the captives and redeemers like their relatives or Spanish Franciscans and Portuguese Jesuits who used to make frequent visits to negotiate the Christian captives&#x27; freedom.

Miguel De Cervantes, himself a captive in Algiers, Algeria between 1575 and 1580, refers to &quot;Mazmorras&quot; in &quot;El juez de los divorcios&quot; (The Divorce Judge), where the protagonist compares his marriage to &quot;captivity in Tetouan&#x27;s caves.&quot; He also mentions it in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, in addition to talking about Tétouan in &quot;El trato de Argel&quot;, &quot;La gran sultana&quot; and &quot;La ilustre fregona&quot;. It is believed that he had contact with some prisoners who told him about the hardness of the dungeons of Tétouan. Diplomat and explorer Leo Africanus, while visiting the city, mentions in his book &quot;Description of Africa&quot; that there were 3,000 captives, although some historians dispute that figure. Other accounts came from captives themselves such as Germain Moüette, who spoke of horrible conditions lived inside those &quot;mazmorras&quot; in the late 17th century. Piracy continued and in 1829, the Austrian Empire bombarded the city in reprisal.

The underground prison was explored in 1922 by Cesar Luis de Montalban, based on a report by archaeologist Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez. The Spanish protectorate administration then commissioned architect Carlos Ovilo to study the site but they found out that no excavation could be possible without taking the risk of damaging the housing above the site. Since then, no excavation has taken place, although recently, some researchers and civil associations have called for the authorities to extend exploration and restoration before opening it to the public.

=== Late military history ===
In the 17th century, the city was governed by the wealthy al-Naksis family. At the end of the century, the city was taken by the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail, who encountered fierce resistance. Tétouan remained fragile, until it was taken by the Alaouite governor of Tangier and leader of a moroccan army that had occupied Tangier after the English had evacuated the possession. The Alaouite governor ushered in a period of stability in Tétouan, building many of the city&#x27;s landmarks such as the Meshwar palace and the Pasha mosque, the oldest standing mosque in Tétouan. After his death, the city again rebelled and was only nominally controlled by the central government.

Elements of military constructions can be found in the original fortifications such as the three forts, the seven gates, and the large outer walls that surround the old medina. They have survived despite the changes that occurred through the expansions known to the city during multiple periods.

Tétouan received a number of Algerian immigrants following the French invasion of Algiers in 1830. According to Bouhlila, they introduced baklava, coffee, and the &quot;warqa&quot; pastry now used in pastilla. For Gil Marks, it was rather the Sephardic Jews who introduced the Ottoman warqa, which the Moroccans substituted for the Spanish pastry.

=== Hispano-Moroccan War and the Spanish protectorate ===
In 1844, Morocco lost a war against the French and in 1856, it signed the Anglo-Moroccan treaties of Friendship with the British. The Spaniards saw Morocco&#x27;s defeat in 1844 and the treaties signed in 1865 as a sign of its weakness. Spurred by a national passion for African conquest, Spain declared war on Morocco in 1859 after a conflict over the borders of Ceuta.

After a few months, Tétouan was taken on 4 February 1860 under the command of General Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell, who was a descendant of an old Irish royal family, the O&#x27;Donnells of Tyrconnell. He was made hereditary Duke of Tetuán, and later served as Prime Minister of Spain. However, two years later the Spanish evacuated in May 1862.

In 1913, it became the capital of the Spanish protectorate of Morocco, which was governed by the Khalifa (Moroccan prince, serving as Viceroy for the Sultan), and the Spanish &quot;Alto Comisario&quot; accredited to him, and it remained its capital until 1956.

=== The nationalist movement ===

Tétouan was one of the most active Moroccan cities in resisting colonialism. The nationalist movement in Tétouan was led by the charismatic leader Abdelkhalek Torres and other personalities such as Abdessalam Bennuna and historian Mohammed Daoud. The movement was part of the pan-Arab nationalist movements. They established deep ties with Arab nationalist leaders such as former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Lebanese Druze prince and intellectual Shakib Arslan. When Arsalan wanted to visit Morocco in August 1930, he was not given a permit by the French protectorate so instead he went to Tangier, which then had international status under foreign colonial powers, and from there to Tétouan, where he met the group. Many of the members later joined the National Party for Istiqlal. Others joined some other nationalist parties, of which many members were women.

=== Jewish presence ===
Tétouan has been home to a significant Sephardi Jewish community which immigrated from Spain after the Reconquista and the Spanish Inquisition. This Jewish Sephardi community spoke a form of Judaeo-Spanish known as Haketia. According to the World Jewish Congress there were only 100 Moroccan Jews remaining in Tétouan by 2015.

In 1790, a pogrom occurred, started by Sultan Yazid. The mellah, where the Jews lived, was pillaged and many women raped. At this point there was an emigration of Tetouani Jews to Gibraltar, where the large Jewish population maintains links with the community in Tetouan.

In 1807, Sultan Slimane relocated the mellah south of the medina to build a large mosque at its previous location inside the medina.

The &quot;Mellah&quot; of Tetuan was sacked in the Hispano-Moroccan War of 1860, when there were 16 to 18 synagogues. This was followed by appeals in the European Jewish press to support Jewish communities like the one in Tetuan, leading to an international effort called &quot;The Morocco Relief Fund.&quot; The Paris-based international Jewish organization &quot;Alliance Israélite Universelle&quot;, along with Rabbi Isaac Ben Walid of Tetuan, then opened its first school in Tetuan in 1862.

Following the exodus of Jews from Morocco after 1948, there were very few Jews left in Tétouan. By 1967, only 12 remained (López Álvarez, 2003). During that period, many emigrated to South America and much later to Israel, Spain, France, and Canada. Today, the only synagogue remaining is the Rabbi Isaac Bengualid Synagogue, which serves as a museum.

===Modern history===
Tétouan was further expanded when it became the capital of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco between 1913 and 1956. The Spanish administration built several new neighborhoods outside the walled medina. The city underwent an intense urban transformation for which its new neighborhoods and buildings, called &quot;Ensanche&quot; (meaning extension), acquired an image very similar to those of other Spanish cities of the time. Its structure was organized around a large circular plaza, now called &#x27;Plaza Mulay el Mehdi&#x27; (formerly Plaza Primo de Rivera). The influence of the protectorate has remained important even after the independence of the country in 1956.

In January 1984, and in the midst of the Years of Lead under the reign of King Hassan II (died 1999), a revolt spread into several cities for a number of days due to price hikes for basic goods following the implementation of the IMF&#x27;s and the World Bank&#x27;s structural adjustment programme. The revolt was thwarted by a military intervention. Twenty people were killed in Tétouan and many others were arrested and received heavy sentences.

Many people in the city still speak Spanish. On road signs, names are often written both in Spanish and in Arabic, though many signs are in Arabic and French, the second language of modern Morocco.

== Culture ==
=== Culture ===
Tétouan is famed for its fine craftsmanship and musical delicacy and has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Crafts and Folk Art since 2017. Its cultural heritage is the product of the interaction between different cultural influences throughout centuries. It is mainly characterized by its Andalusian style and way of living, but Berber, Jewish, and colonial Spanish influences are present too.

=== Literature ===
The city has produced many scholars in different disciplines throughout centuries. One of the first newspapers in Morocco, &quot;El Eco de Tetuan&quot;, was published in the city in 1860. In the colonial period, whereas France took measures to censor publications in Arabic in the area under its control, Tetuan, the capital of the northern Spanish area, became a center of publishing and the capital of Moroccan literary life. Many historic newspapers were published in Tetuan, including the first nationalist publication in Morocco, &quot;as-Salaam&quot; October 1933, followed by &quot;al-Hurriya&quot; and others. These were published by members of this intellectual circle in Tetuan that included figures like Abdesalam Bennuna, Muhammad Daoud, Abdelkhaleq Torres, and Abdellah Guennoun.

=== Religion ===
The vast majority of the population are Muslims. There is a small Christian community. The numbers of the Jewish community have declined sharply in recent decades. It numbered no more than a dozen persons in 2014. Notable spiritual leaders include Sufi saint Ahmad ibn Ajiba and Jewish Rabbis Yosef Maimon and Isaac Ben Walid. Tetuan also had a vibrant Sephardi Jewish community with ties to Al-Andalus.

=== Architecture ===
The streets are fairly wide and straight, and many of the houses belonging to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from Al-Andalus by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses and riads the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in Hispano-Moresque designs, such as are found in the Alhambra of Granada, and the tilework for which Tétouan is known may be seen on floors, pillars, and dados. The city has seven gates which were closed at night up until the early 20th century. Many Sufi Zawiyas are scattered inside the walled old city.

=== Food ===
Tétouan has rich culinary traditions unique within Moroccan cuisine, and the influence of, Arab, Amazigh, Andalusi, Turkish and Spanish cuisines is noted in the variety of dishes and pastries.

Amazigh and Arab cuisine are present in staples of Moroccan cuisine such as cuscus and &quot;rafissa&quot; or &quot;thrid&quot;, respectively.

As in other Moroccan cities like Salé and Fes, Tétouan inherited Andalusi culinary traditions through the waves of migration terminating with the arrival of the expelled Moriscos 1609–1614. This manifests itself in classic dishes such as &quot;pastilla&quot;. However, the pastilla traditionally made in Tetouan is more savory than sweet, with more preserved lemon and no sugar or almonds.

Tétouan has been also influenced by Algerian and Ottoman cuisine, and this is due to the wave of migrants from Algeria following the French conquest of Algeria. This influence manifests itself prominently in the sweets of Tetouan, which include &quot;qatayef&quot; and baklava.

=== Crafts ===
Traditional craftsmanship is concentrated in the old medina where every industry has its own quarter with the same name where workshops and shops are found. Among them are Zellige (tilework), pottery, plaster engravings, embroidery, inlaying with silver wire, the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as capes and skirts by Jebala women in rural areas.

=== Museums and festivals ===
The Lucas Museum of Religious Heritage () is housed in the historic Madrasat Lucas in Tetuan. In addition to archaeological, traditional, and modern art museums, as well as an archival library, Tétouan hosts a school of music and many artisan schools. Different music genres of local or regional origins can be found in Tétouan. Traditional Andalusian classical music is the most popular and folk singers such as Abdessadeq Cheqara are widely known in Morocco. Other popular local genres like Taktoka Jabaliya also exist and are usually played at weddings.

Tétouan hosts many international festivals such as the International Mediterranean Film Festival, and the International Oud and Women&#x27;s Voice (أصوات نسائية) Festival.

On November 20, 2013, the city&#x27;s &quot;Centro de Arte Moderno&quot; (Center of Modern Art) was launched and currently holds between 180 and 200 artworks from both self-trained artists and graduates of the city&#x27;s National Institute of Fine Arts.

=== Dialect ===
The city has its own dialect, a particular &quot;citadin&quot; variant of non-Hilalian Arabic which is distinct from Arabic Jeblia. However, Jeblia, which is a dialect of Darija, is predominant since people from the neighboring rural areas settled in the city during the 20th-century rural flights. The use of Spanish and French is still widespread, especially among businessmen and intellectual elites, due to past colonial ties and the geographic proximity to Europe.

== Geography ==

The city is situated about 60 km east of the city of Tangier and 40 km south of the Strait of Gibraltar. To the south and west of the city, there are mountains. Tétouan is situated in the middle of a belt of orchards that grow oranges, almonds, pomegranates, and cypress trees. The Rif Mountains are nearby, as the city is located in the Martil Valley. It is picturesquely situated on the northern slope of a fertile valley down which flows the Martil river, with the harbour of Tétouan, Martil, at its mouth. Behind rise rugged masses of rock, the southern wall of the Anjera country, once practically closed to Europeans; across the valley are the hills which form the northern limit of the still more impenetrable Rif.

===Climate===
Tétouan features a Mediterranean climate with Köppen climate classification of &quot;Csa&quot;. Located along the Mediterranean Sea, the weather in Tétouan is mild and rainy during the winter, hot and dry in the summer months.

==Education==

===Education and the national movement===
During the 1920s, activists belonging to the national movement in northern Morocco, especially in Tétouan under Spanish protectorate, made science and education a supreme goal of their struggle to combat colonialism. In 1924, and after considerable effort and determination, they established a primary school and named it the &quot;Al Madrasa al-Ahliyah&quot; (Arabic: المدرسة الأهلية meaning National School). Among them were historian Mohammed Daoud, Abdel Salam Bennouna, and Mustafa Afilal. To this end, members of the National Movement carried out a popular campaign under the leadership of the Special Education Committee established in 1934. In the summer of 1935, a group of activists met at the house of Mustafa Afilal, and after a long debate about educational dimensions, material resources, and other things, the group concluded by approving the establishment of a special secondary educational institution. The name of the institution remained suspended until the end of the year. After additional meetings, nationalist leader and Professor Abdelkhalek Torres, being impressed with the role played by the &quot;free men&quot; in the era of the Second Spanish Republic, said to his colleagues: &quot;most of the men of science, thought and liberation in Spain, graduated from Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Instituto Libre&quot;. Therefore, I hope and suggest that you call our institute the Free Institute (Arabic: المعهد الحر)&quot;. After this was approved, the Free Institute was established on November 5, 1935.

The students of the Institute were among the first to demonstrate and protest against the Spanish administration. The year 1948, in which bloody events took place between the citizens demanding independence and the Spanish colonialism, in which a student of the institute was killed by colonial agents, was a milestone in its history. The Spanish administration began to take over the institute. All the staff were arrested and imprisoned in Ceuta. However, weeks later, historian Tuhami al-Wazzani, who was then the director of the elementary school, joined the institute and asked the college students to help teach the younger ones so that the institute would not stop teaching altogether. Since then, secondary education has ceased and has been limited to primary education up to this day. Many graduates continued their higher education in Spain, Cairo, and Baghdad.

===Other schools and institutions of higher education===
Tétouan is home to &quot;l&#x27;Institut National des Beaux-Arts&quot; (National Institute of Fine Arts), the only national arts institution of higher education in Morocco. It was founded in 1945. Its promoter and first director was the Spanish Orientalist painter . The city also hosts the &quot;Ecole Nationale d&#x27;Architecture&quot;, a public architecture school.

Tétouan&#x27;s public Abdelmalek Essaâdi University was founded in 1993. The 16th-century Moroccan sultan Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi is the university&#x27;s namesake. The university has a student body of 86,000, one of the largest in Morocco. The Faculty of Theology (Arabic : كلية أصول الدين) was established in 1963 and was an affiliate of the prestigious Al Quaraouiyine University in Fez until 2015, when it was annexed to Abdelmalek Essaâdi University.

There are also some Spanish international schools operated by that country&#x27;s Ministry of Education:
* Colegio Español Jacinto Benavente
* Instituto Español Juan de la Cierva
* Instituto Español Nuestra Señora del Pilar
* Instituto Cervantes

===Foreign cultural centers===
Several foreign cultural centers are located in Tétouan :
* Spanish Instituto Cervantes
* French Institut Français
* American Language Center

== Economy and infrastructure ==

The economy of the city is based mainly on tourism and commerce. Other sectors of income include fishing and agriculture. Tétouan&#x27;s civil airport Sania Ramel Airport, which became an international airport that operates flights to western Europe, is operated by the Moroccan Airports Authority and is located 6 km (4 mi) to the east.
The Ceuta-Tetuán railway line (es) was the first Spanish international railway line that would unite the cities of Ceuta and Tétouan. It was inaugurated on March 17, 1918, by Carlos de Borbón and Khalifa . The line is no longer in use. Tétouan is linked to Tangier, Ksar el Kebir, Larache, Chefchaouen, Bab Sebta (border with Ceuta), and Oued Laou via modern national motorways. The 28 km Tetouan–Fnideq expressway was completed in 2005.
The coastal area is a major tourist destination during the summer period. It stretches from Fnideq, a small city near Ceuta, to the beaches of the small village of El Jebha on the route to Al Hoceima. Several marinas and beach resorts are spread between different villages along the coast. The M&#x27;diq port is the main fishing port serving the city. M&#x27;diq has another port dedicated to leisure. Both have been expanded recently in order to improve tourist offerings and to increase the harbour&#x27;s capacity. Boats up to 50 metres long with a depth of nearly five metres can be moored.

Cultural tourism has also been developed during recent years. Many historical sites and monuments are found within and outside the old city (medina).

During the 20th century, Tétouan had a few flourishing industries such as paper manufacturing, which was led by the &quot;Papelera de Tetuán&quot; company. The company was later merged with its competitor &quot;Cellulose du Maroc&quot;, having its operations stopped in Tétouan and its headquarters transferred to Casablanca.

=== &quot;Skoundo&quot; water distribution system ===
The historic center is equipped with a subterranean piping system for water distribution through its streets. In fact, until the early 1970s, drinking water supply in the old medina was mainly provided through this traditional network called &quot;Skoundo&quot; (El Abdellaoui, 1986). It was developed around the 16th century in parallel with the construction of the first houses during its renewal by Andalusian refugees. It penetrates the ancient city from the far north to the far south. It starts at the top of Mount Dersa and extends underground under channels and pipes made of clay. Although it is not the only ancient water system in Morocco, others having been located in Fez and Chefchaouen, it remains the only one still operating. However, the bad state of the clay pipes combined with neglect and other technical issues makes the water undrinkable, although some restorations are underway. Skoundo had a clear impact on various socio-economic charts of the city. The system did not only serve houses but also mosques, public toilets, hammams, tanneries, and public mural fountains found in each neighborhood in the old medina.

=== Contraband controversies ===
Since a few decades, and because of the proximity of the city to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, many people have been relying on contraband activities. Residents of Tétouan do not need a visa to enter Ceuta. Before the 1990s, no passport was needed and a Moroccan ID card was sufficient. In recent years, the border has known many incidents such as stampedes. Human rights groups have often criticized the situation in which women carry heavy loads of goods - giving rise to the epithet &quot;Mule women&quot;- before cases of investigation were opened. In 2018 Morocco suspended commercial customs with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in to crack down on the smuggling of illegal products into Morocco from the two cities affecting the country’s economic growth. Moroccan customs officials previously  estimated the value of the products entering Morocco through the Ceuta border between MAD 6 billion and MAD 8 billion (between €550 million and €730 million) per year . Morocco’s government has long maintained that the situation needs  a “radical” solution to permanently put an end to contraband border crossings with Melilla and Ceuta.”
In 1917, Tetouan saw the appearance of its first football clubs, &quot;Sporting of Tetuán&quot; and &quot;el Hispano-Marroquí&quot; (&quot;The Spanish-Moroccan&quot;). One year later, these two clubs, and a third one called &quot;el Radio&quot;, merged and that gave the birth to the &quot;Athletic Club Tetuán&quot;. The new club was established in 1922 by Basque Atlético Madrid fans who lived in Tétouan. In the early days, it was known as Athletic Club Tetuan—based on the Spanish spelling of the city. After the Spanish Civil War and according to General Franco&#x27;s demands (banning non-Spanish names), it became known as Club Atlético Tetuan. This is why the team has always played in red and white stripes and blue shorts, just like their counterparts from Madrid they were supposed to emulate. Under the Spanish protectorate of Northern Morocco, Tetuán was a part of the Spanish Liga for 33 years until independence was achieved in 1956. The highlights of that era were their surprising win of the Spanish Segunda División (the southern group) in the 1950–51 season and their promotion to the Primera Division of 1951–52. The club remains, to this day, the only African team ever to play in a top division in Europe.

Today, the city has one professional football club, Moghreb Athletic Tétouan, which competes in the Botola, the top-tier of Moroccan football. The team plays their home games at the Saniat Rmel stadium, the oldest football stadium in Africa. As of the 2018–19 season, the team will play at the new Tétouan Stadium, which will have a seating capacity of more than 41,000. Moghreb Athletic Tétouan won its first league title in the 2011–12 Botola League season, becoming the first Chamali club to ever win the league title. Today, MAT is considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Morocco along with Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, FAR Rabat, and Maghreb Fès. A new football stadium in the Mediterranean city of Tétouan is currently being built across 36 hectares north of the residential areas, along the new A6 highway. It will occupy former farmlands and become the central sports arena of the agglomeration, replacing the severely dated Stade Saniat Rmel. The stadium is meant to seat 60,000 spectators; original plans called for a capacity of 40,000 but this was increased to 60,000 in order to meet latest FIFA regulations. Construction on the Grand Stade De Tétouan, which was designed by Moroccan architect Nawfal Bakhat, began in 2015 and was initially scheduled for completion in 2018. The project has stalled a number of times, been mired in controversy regarding the authorship of its design plans, and the completion date has been postponed as well. As of January 2020, it is still not finished. The Kingdom of Morocco has submitted a bid to FIFA to host the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in three different countries.

<text>7z is a compressed archive file format that supports several different data compression, encryption and pre-processing algorithms. The 7z format initially appeared as implemented by the 7-Zip archiver. The 7-Zip program is publicly available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The LZMA SDK 4.62 was placed in the public domain in December 2008. The latest stable version of 7-Zip and LZMA SDK is version 24.09.

The 7z file format specification is distributed with 7-Zip&#x27;s source code since 2015. The specification can be found in plain text format in the &#x27;doc&#x27; sub-directory of the source code distribution.

== Features and enhancements ==
The 7z format provides the following main features:
* Open, modular architecture that allows any compression, conversion, or encryption method to be stacked.
* High compression ratios (depending on the compression method used).
* AES-256 bit encryption.
* Zip 2.0 (Legacy) Encryption
* Large file support (up to approximately 16 exbibytes, or 264 bytes).
* Unicode file names.
* Support for solid compression, where multiple files of similar type are compressed within a single stream, in order to exploit the combined redundancy inherent in similar files.
* Compression and encryption of archive headers.
* Support for multi-part archives : e.g. xxx.7z.001, xxx.7z.002, ... (see the context menu items &quot;Split File...&quot; to create them and &quot;Combine Files...&quot; to re-assemble an archive from a set of multi-part component files).
* Support for custom codec plugin DLLs.

The format&#x27;s open architecture allows additional future compression methods to be added to the standard.

=== Compression methods ===
The following compression methods are currently defined:

* LZMA – A variation of the LZ77 algorithm, using a sliding dictionary up to 4 GB in length for duplicate string elimination. The LZ stage is followed by entropy coding using a Markov chain-based range coder and binary trees.
* LZMA2 – modified version of LZMA providing better multithreading support and less expansion of incompressible data.
* Bzip2 – The standard Burrows–Wheeler transform algorithm. Bzip2 uses two reversible transformations; BWT, then Move to front with Huffman coding for symbol reduction (the actual compression element).

* PPMd – Dmitry Shkarin&#x27;s 2002 PPMdH (PPMII (Prediction by Partial matching with Information Inheritance) and cPPMII (complicated PPMII)) with small changes: PPMII is an improved version of the 1984 PPM compression algorithm (prediction by partial matching).
* DEFLATE – Standard algorithm based on 32 kB LZ77 and Huffman coding. Deflate is found in several file formats including ZIP, gzip, PNG and PDF. 7-Zip contains a from-scratch DEFLATE encoder that frequently beats the &quot;de facto&quot; standard zlib version in compression size, but at the expense of CPU usage.

A suite of recompression tools called AdvanceCOMP contains a copy of the DEFLATE encoder from the 7-Zip implementation; these utilities can often be used to further compress the size of existing gzip, ZIP, PNG, or MNG files.

=== Pre-processing filters ===
The LZMA SDK comes with the BCJ and BCJ2 preprocessors included, so that later stages are able to achieve greater compression: For x86, ARM, PowerPC (PPC), IA-64 Itanium, and ARM Thumb processors, jump targets are &#x27;normalized&#x27; before compression by changing relative position into absolute values. For x86, this means that near jumps, calls and conditional jumps (but not short jumps and conditional jumps) are converted from the machine language &quot;jump 1655 bytes backwards&quot; style notation to normalized &quot;jump to address 5554&quot; style notation; all jumps to 5554, perhaps a common subroutine, are thus encoded identically, making them more compressible.

*BCJ – Converter for 32-bit x86 executables. Normalise target addresses of near jumps and calls from relative distances to absolute destinations.
*BCJ2– Pre-processor for 32-bit x86 executables. BCJ2 is an improvement on BCJ, adding additional x86 jump/call instruction processing. Near jump, near call, conditional near jump targets are split out and compressed separately in another stream.
*Delta encoding – delta filter, basic preprocessor for multimedia data.

Similar executable pre-processing technology is included in other software; the RAR compressor features displacement compression for 32-bit x86 executables and IA-64 executables, and the UPX runtime executable file compressor includes support for working with 16-bit values within DOS binary files.

=== Encryption ===
The 7z format supports encryption with the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key. The key is generated from a user-supplied passphrase using an algorithm based on the SHA-256 hash function. The SHA-256 is executed 219 (524288) times, which causes a significant delay on slow PCs before compression or extraction starts. This technique is called key stretching and is used to make a brute-force search for the passphrase more difficult. Current GPU-based, and custom hardware attacks limit the effectiveness of this particular method of key stretching, so it is still important to choose a strong password.
The 7z format provides the option to encrypt the filenames of a 7z archive.

=== Limitations ===
The 7z format does not store filesystem permissions (such as UNIX owner/group permissions or NTFS ACLs), and hence can be inappropriate for backup/archival purposes. A workaround on UNIX-like systems for this is to convert data to a tar bitstream before compressing with 7z. But GNU tar (common in many UNIX environments) can also compress with the LZMA2 algorithm (&quot;xz&quot;) natively, without the use of 7z, using the &quot;-J&quot; switch. The resulting file extension is &quot;.tar.xz&quot; or &quot;.txz&quot; and not &quot;.tar.7z&quot;. This method of compression has been adopted with many distributions for packaging, such as Arch, Debian (deb), Fedora (rpm) and Slackware. (The older &quot;lzma&quot; format is less efficient.) On the other hand, it is important to note, that tar does not save the filesystem encoding, which means that tar compressed filenames can become unreadable if decompressed on a different computer. 

The 7z format does not allow extraction of some &quot;broken files&quot;—that is (for example) if one has the first segment of a series of 7z files, 7z cannot give the start of the files within the archive—it must wait until all segments are downloaded. The 7z format also lacks recovery records, making it vulnerable to data degradation unless used in conjunction with external solutions, like parchives, or within filesystems with robust error-correction. By way of comparison, zip files also lack a recovery feature while the rar format has one.

<doc id="359398" wikidata="Q1758572" url="?curid=359398" title="Hook and Cod wars">
<text>The Hook and Cod wars (; sometimes semi-anglicised as the wars of the Hoecks and the Cabbeljaws) comprise a series of wars and battles in the County of Holland between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over who should hold the title of &quot;Count of Holland&quot;.
The Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of Holland. The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen.

The origin of the name &quot;Cod&quot; remains uncertain, but is most likely a case of reappropriation. Perhaps it derives from the Bavarian coat of arms, which resemble the scales of a fish. The &quot;Hook&quot; refers to the hooked stick that is used to catch cod.

Another possible explanation of &quot;Cod&quot; points out that as a cod grows it tends to eat more, growing even bigger and eating even more, thus encapsulating how the noblemen perhaps saw the expanding middle classes of the time.

== Aftermath of William IV&#x27;s reign (1345–1349) ==

=== The reign of William IV of Holland and the war against Utrecht===
In 1337 William IV succeeded his father as count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut (as William II). William waged many wars, traveled far and wide and participated in many tournaments. As a consequence the finances of Holland fell into utter disarray. For political advice, William continued to rely on Willem van Duvenvoorde, and therefore also on Duvenvoorde&#x27;s kin: the Wassenaar&#x27;s, Polanen&#x27;s, Brederode&#x27;s, Boechorsten etc. This was to the detriment of families like those of Arkel, Egmond, Heemskerk and Wateringen.

In 1342 John of Arkel had become Bishop of Utrecht. He set about to restore the bishopric&#x27;s power. In order to prevent this, Count William and his many allies in Utrecht, attacked and started to city on 8 July 1345. After six weeks of siege, a truce was concluded, to last until 11 November. In return the citizens of Utrecht had to beg for forgiveness.

William then attempted to restore his authority in Friesland. On 26 September 1345 he led an army that crossed the Zuiderzee and landed near Stavoren. The subsequent Battle of Warns was a disaster: William died and his army returned without him, although his uncle, John of Beaumont, managed to escape. William&#x27;s death did not end the war with Utrecht. Right after the truce ended, the bishop subdued almost all William&#x27;s allies in Utrecht, and collected major reparations from them.
=== Succession of William IV ===
William IV/II had no son. Therefore, Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian had to decide who should succeed him. The candidates were John of Beaumont (William IV&#x27;s paternal uncle) or one of William IV&#x27;s sisters, namely Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut (oldest sister and the emperor&#x27;s wife), Philippa of Hainault (married to Edward III of England), Joanna of Hainaut (married to William V, Duke of Jülich) or Isabelle of Hainaut (1323–1361; married to Robert of Namur). In January 1346 the emperor granted the three fiefs to his wife as &#x27;oldest sister and just heir&#x27; of count William IV.

In the meantime John of Beaumont had taken control in Hainaut, meaning that its succession to Margaret was quite smooth. It seems that Holland and Zeeland agreed to the succession at a kind of diet at Geertruidenberg in February 1346. In March Margaret arrived in Hainaut, and in April she visited Holland and Zeeland. She also made a new truce with Utrecht, which started on 20 July 1346.

In September 1346 Margaret made her younger son William I, Duke of Bavaria (1330–1389) her lieutenant in Holland, Zeeland and Hainault. He was also made these counties&#x27; heir and so was always officially styled as &#x27;waiting&#x27; to rule over them in his own right.

=== Trouble in Holland and Zeeland ===
In Holland and Zeeland the lieutenancy of William of Bavaria was not a success. After Emperor Louis died in October 1347, King Edward III and the Duke of Jülich again came up with their claims to William IV&#x27;s estate, and allied with the new emperor. In the interior the nobility seized the opportunity to take up their feuds, and indeed it had just cause to be dissatisfied about how the lieutenant and his government favored some families. Soon anarchy and insubordination ruled in these counties. As a result, the finances got even further out of control.

The war against Utrecht also did not go well. On 20 July 1348 the truce ended. On 28 July a battle against Utrecht was lost near Eemnes, leading to the village getting re-attached to Utrecht. William of Bavaria&#x27;s army then burned the village of Jutphaas, while that of Utrecht burned and looted several Holland villages. The campaign ended with a truce till 11 November.

== Margaret of Bavaria vs William V (1349–1357) ==

=== William&#x27;s first attempt to become Count of Holland ===
In 1349 Margaret decided that it would be better if William of Bavaria became count of Holland and Zeeland, while she would remain Count of Hainault with William as her lieutenant. In return she wanted to have 15,000 gold guilders, and 6,000 guilders each year. Neither Beaumont nor the cities of Holland were prepared to agree with these conditions, but William then started to style himself as Count of Holland and Zeeland. The Egmonds, Heemskerks and Wateringens, later known as Cods now started to appear in the county&#x27;s charters. 

Meanwhile the bishop had attacked Holland shortly after 25 March 1349. He besieged and burned the small Holland city Oudewater. The army of Holland then marched to Schoonhoven, where it was beaten. On 24 August a truce was made till 11 November 1350.

Margaret had meanwhile travelled from Bavaria to Hainaut. She summoned her unruly son to Le Quesnoy. Here William begged for forgiveness in April 1350. With William removed from Holland, Margaret seems to be in control, but none of the causes of the troubles had been solved.
The trigger that led to open hostilities was the assassination of the Cod lord Claes Dirkszoon van Zwieten van Drakenburg. This happened on 23 August 1350. The city of Delft and its allies reacted by attacking their enemies, robbing, plundering and taking prisoners. The city next held trials after which a number of prisoners were decapitated and wheeled. The trials and executions were a direct infringement on the high justice of the count of Holland. Meanwhile there was also a conspiracy between part of the nobility and the Bishop of Utrecht.

In September 1350 Margaret and William were both in Geertruidenberg, where William renounced his pretensions on 27 September 1350. John of Polanen, Dirk van Brederode and their party offered to help Margaret. In September 1350 they signed the Hook Alliance Treaty. Meanwhile the dissatisfied nobles and cities formed the Cod League. The earliest proof of the Cod Alliance dates from November 1350.

Margaret and the Hook lords then tried to restore order from Geertruidenberg. They summoned all suspected subjects to send hostages to await their judgement. However, those of Delft and their allies simply did not appear, and said that everything had been done by the orders of their true lord Count William. In the council of nobles and cities that Margaret held, William denied this. He then sent open letters to Delft and other cities, ordering them to submit to Margaret. Delft and its allies simply kept the letters, and conspired with the Bishop of Utrecht, who burned the Binnenhof in The Hague. Margaret stayed in Geertruidenberg till at least 23 October 1350.

With Delft and many cities north of the Hollandse IJssel in open rebellion, Margaret now summoned the council and commoners of the area south of the Hollandse IJssel to Dordrecht. Here a ceremony was held in which the abdication of William was repeated. Margaret then sent William to Hainaut.
Margaret next continued to Zeeland to restore order there. She went to Zierikzee to become acknowledged there, and to handle some court cases. While there, she summoned William and John of Beaumont. She wanted to make Beaumont her lieutenant in Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. Her only condition was that she would retain the high justice. This made the offer unacceptable to Beaumont, and so both returned to Hainaut. In October 1350 Margaret then started negotiations with Edward III of England. The idea was that he would use force to take control in Holland, Zeeland and Friesland, and would be compensated by getting temporary custody of the area.

=== William rebels ===
The attempt to make Beaumont lieutenant might have been reason for William to fear a complete loss of his pretensions. Gerard van Herlaer advised him to contact the Cod party again. In the night of 1-2 February 1351 Gerard van Herlaar and Gerard van Merxem succeeded in freeing William of Bavaria from Burbant Castle in Ath. William then formally allied himself with the Cod party, which acknowledged him as their count. He also allied with the Bishop of Utrecht.

Margaret reacted by making her son Louis her formal heir, and by seeking aid from England. In early 1351 Margaret, her son Duke Louis, and the Lords of Borselen and went to Dordrecht to attempt to subdue William again. While Dordrecht, Middelburg and Zierikzee allied with Margaret, William was acknowledged by Kennemerland and West-Friesland. Diplomatic action by Beaumont and the Queen of England failed. In April 1351 Margaret moved to Calais to negotiate with the English. William then seized Dordrecht. Wolfert III van Borselen joined William, causing Middelburg to flip to William&#x27;s side.

=== A short war ===
The civil war now erupted in earnest. William of Bavaria&#x27;s first moves were directed against the many castles that the Hook party held in Holland. Most of these were quickly conquered, others offered significant resistance. On 21 May 1351 Rosenburgh Castle surrendered after a violent siege. The count then moved on to take Polanen Castle in June 1351. In the same campaign, Binckhorst Castle was also taken after significant resistance. In the north Medemblik Castle offered significant resistance and was besieged in March-April 1351. 

On 15 May 1351 William succeeded in concluding a peace which ended the war with Utrecht, which had started in 1345. This was also important, because the parties would also evict each other&#x27;s enemies from their territory. Meanwhile, some of the stronger Hook castles could not be taken that quickly. Brederode Castle would only surrender on 23 October 1351. Oud Haerlem Castle, owned by John II of Polanen would hold out into 1352. This also applied to Geertruidenberg Castle. Its blockade and siege would last from December 1351 to July 1352.

On the other hand Edward III of England, husband of Margaret&#x27;s sister Philippa, sent a fleet to Margaret&#x27;s aid. This was initially successful. In May 1351 Margaret&#x27;s combined forces won the Battle of Veere. Wolfert III van Borselen died soon after, but it seems that Margaret was not able to profit from her victory. I.e. Middelburg continued to hold William&#x27;s side.

About six weeks later, the victorious Hooks and their English allies sailed up the Meuse. On 4 July 1351 they fought the Battle of Zwartewaal on the Old Meuse. It was a clear victory for William and the Cods. The English admiral and many Hooks were killed. The outcome ruined Margaret&#x27;s cause. William quickly moved south to start a Siege of Zierikzee (1351), which surrendered in October. 

In December 1351 Margaret hanged her last strongholds in Holland (Geertruidenberg Castle, the castle of Vreeland on the Vecht, and Oud Haerlem Castle near Heemskerk) over to King Edward, who changed sides soon afterwards. In February 1352 William married Edward&#x27;s cousin Maud of Lancaster. Margaret returned to Hainaut and did not succeed in rekindling the war.

=== Peace between Margaret and her son ===
In December 1354 Margaret came to an understanding with her son. William was recognized as count of Holland and Zeeland, she of Hainaut. William would pay a large amount of money and a pension to his mother. Prisoners were released, and a general amnesty was proclaimed.

In July 1356 Margaret died. It left William in possession of the entire Holland-Hainaut inheritance. William did not enjoy his victory for long. In late Summer 1357 he went to England. Shortly after his return he showed signs of insanity. It became so serious that his wife and council decided to call over his younger brother Albert. The count was then locked up, first in The Hague, and then in Le Quesnoy, where he would live imprisoned for 31 years until his death.

== Reign of Albert of Bavaria (1358–1404)==

=== Albert of Bavaria as regent ===

In February 1358 Albert I, Duke of Bavaria arrived in Holland. On 23 February 1358 he was appointed as (regent) of Holland. Soon, the acknowledgement in Zeeland followed. Albert started his regency by replacing Jan van Bloemenstein as bailiff of Kennemerland with Reinoud I van Brederode, eldest son of the Hook lord Dirk van Brederode. He also tried to change the Cod government of Delft. 

On his first trip to Kennemerland, the new bailiff Reinoud was ambushed near Castricum. Reinoud escaped, but the affair led to the Siege of Heemskerk Castle, which lasted from 4 December 1358 to 24 March 1359. During the siege of Heemskerk Castle, the city of Delft rebelled. Its militia assaulted and destroyed Polanen Castle and Binckhorst Castle. The militia also raided The Hague, and freed the prisoners there. 

On 1 April 1359 Albert started the Siege of Delft. The siege of the Cod Stronghold lasted more than 10 weeks. The city surrendered on terms. Its council had to beg for forgiveness, pay 40,000 old shields, and destroy the city walls. The nobles that supported Delft; Hendrik van der Woerd, Gijsbrecht van Nijenrode, Jan van Kervena and Gerard Wisse were not included in the treaty. Van der Woerd tried to escape, but was caught and beheaded.

Nyenrode, Kervena and some others escaped to Heusden Castle. It led to the siege of Heusden Castle, which lasted for more than a year. The castle was surrendered by treaty. The besieged would make their peace with Albert, and go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem within two years. The internal troubles in Holland then subsided for a while. In 1362 a short war was fought against Guelders. 

In 1372 violence erupted near Heusden. The Heerlijkheid Heusden had been transferred to Holland in 1357. However, the limits of the lordship had not been defined that well. Brabant laid claim to Vlijmen and Engelen. Jan van der Veen then raided and burned Onsenoort Castle, southeast of Heusden. In turn Zealand nobles attacked Brabant merchants in their province, while Reinoud van Brederode Lord of Gennep attacked the Campina and looted near Sint-Oedenrode. The army of Brabant then attacked Hainault. In 1374 this conflict ended without any result. Also in 1374, a war against Utrecht started. It ended in 1375. In 1389 the insane William V, who had been locked up since 1357 died.

== Jacqueline of Bavaria vs Philip of Burgundy (1417–1432) ==

The main battle re-emerged at the death of Albert I&#x27;s son and successor William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut in 1417. Both William&#x27;s younger brother Bishop of Liege John of Bavaria-Straubing, and his only daughter Jacqueline claimed the county. The Cods chose the side of John, and, after his death in 1425, of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, while the Hooks supported Jacqueline.

The result of these battles and especially of her defeats at the Battle of Brouwershaven (1426) and Siege of Gouda (1428), was that Jacqueline was allowed to retain the titles of countess of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland, but that Philip the Good would rule the counties. Philip was named heir to the counties, and Jacqueline, who was childless, was not allowed to remarry without Philip&#x27;s consent.

The treaty became void when Jacqueline remarried in 1432 with Frank van Borssele, and she had to hand her territories over to Burgundy.

== The Bishopric of Utrecht vs Burgundy ==

The period between 1430 and 1450 remained reasonably calm, but when Philip the Good tried to expand his influence into the Bishopric of Utrecht by appointing his natural son David of Burgundy as Bishop, Hook resistance re-emerged in Utrecht. This led to the Siege of Deventer (1456), and two civil wars, (1470–1474) and (1481–1483), concluded in favor of the Cods and Burgundy after the Battle of Westbroek and the Siege of Utrecht (1483).

== Frans van Brederode vs Maximilian of Austria ==

When the House of Burgundy had died out with the death of Mary of Burgundy in 1482, the Hooks revolted one more time against her husband and successor Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. The revolt was led by Frans van Brederode, but crushed in 1490.

<doc id="359403" wikidata="Q804628" url="?curid=359403" title="Balance of Power (video game)">
<text>Balance of Power is a strategy video game of geopolitics during the Cold War, created by Chris Crawford and published in 1985 on the Macintosh by Mindscape, followed by ports to a variety of platforms over the next two years.

In the game, the player takes the role of the President of the United States or General Secretary of the Soviet Union. The goal is to improve the player&#x27;s country&#x27;s standing in the world relative to the other superpower. During each yearly turn, random events occur that may have effects on the player&#x27;s international prestige. The player can choose to respond to these events in various ways, which may prompt a response from the other superpower. This creates brinkmanship situations between the two nations, potentially escalating to a nuclear war, which ends the game.

Crawford was already well-known, especially for &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot;. His 1984 announcement that he was moving to the Macintosh platform to work on a new concept generated considerable interest. It was widely reviewed after its release, including an extremely positive review in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. It was praised for its inventive non-action gameplay that was nevertheless exciting and distinct. It has been named by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; as one of the most innovative computer games of all time.

&quot;Balance of Power&quot; was successful on the Mac, and combined with ports it ultimately sold over a quarter million units.

==Gameplay==
The player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize &quot;prestige&quot; and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent&#x27;s responses.

This core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge&#x27;s 1983 game &quot;Geopolitique 1990&quot;, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In &quot;Geopolitique&quot;, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: &quot;You have ignited a(n accidental) nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure.&quot;

==Development==
Crawford had made a name for himself during his years at Atari, Inc. in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His smash hit &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot; made him one of the few game authors known by name, and helped ensure later releases were also successful to a degree. By early 1984, Atari was rapidly going bankrupt due to the effects of the video game crash of 1983. In March they laid off the majority of their staff, including Crawford. His ample severance was enough to allow him to write a new game as a freelancer.

After considering a sequel to &quot;Eastern Front&quot; or a political game about the Inca Empire, he eventually decided to write a cold war &quot;game about peace&quot;. Crawford cited Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; as an emotional inspiration to the game.

Considering the Atari platform a lost cause, Crawford began looking at the new 16-bit platforms that were just coming to market; he dismissed the IBM PC as too crude, the Amiga as likely to fail for business reasons, and thus chose the Macintosh as the platform to develop on. At the time this was a non-trivial decision, as there were no development tools; programmers had to buy an Apple Lisa to write code for the platform.

During an April 1984 interview at the Origins Game Fair, Crawford stated that he was &quot;working on a game for the Macintosh entitled ARMS RACE based on the philosophy that &#x27;H-bombs don&#x27;t kill people, geopolitics kills people.&#x27;&quot; By May the initial concept was fleshed out; the game would take place on top of a world map that could show various details, events would be presented as newspaper stories following an algorithmic concept he developed after considering the headlines in &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, and these events and their outcomes would be expressed in terms of &quot;prestige points&quot;.

Crawford had difficulty in finding a publisher for &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, due in no small part to the lingering effects of the 1983 crash. Random House eventually agreed to publish it, but there was considerable ill will between Crawford and the editor assigned to him, who had no prior experience with video games. Random House ultimately cancelled the contract and demanded that Crawford return its $10,000 advance payment, almost causing him to lose his home. His wife demanded he get a &quot;real job&quot;.

The work was saved by a friend at &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, who heard of his troubles and published a two-part column on the game. The article was seen by a producer at the newly formed Mindscape, who agreed to publish it. Betas were ready in February 1985 and were polished through the spring and summer. The game was released in September and was an immediate sensation given that the world was then at the height of the Cold War. The fame was in no small part helped by a review in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; written by David L. Aaron, Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, who called it &quot;about as close as one might get to the cut-and-thrust of international politics without going through confirmation by the Senate.&quot;

The game was an immediate hit on the initial Macintosh and Apple II. A release for Microsoft Windows 1.0 in 1986 made it a multiplatform best seller. These were followed by versions on the Atari ST (1987) and Amiga, among others. In total, the game sold over $10 million during its heyday, during a time when total sales for all gaming hardware and software combined was about $500 million.

In 1986, Crawford published a book, also called &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, which details the internals of the game great depth. It explains the background of the politics, the formulas used to calculate prestige and related parameters, and an account of its (lengthy) gestation.

Around 2013, Crawford released source code of several of his games into the public domain, including &quot;Balance of Power&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Balance of Power&quot; &quot;stands in a prestigious circle: that of the most innovative computer games of all time. If there were Academy Awards for computer games, BOP would get my votes for Best Picture and Best Director of 1985&quot;. A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game four stars out of five, a 1994 survey gave it three stars, and in 1996 the magazine listed the game&#x27;s Game Over scene as #11 on its list of &quot;the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming&quot;.

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;This game is HIGHLY recommended.&quot;

&quot;Dragon&quot; recommended the game and called it a &quot;superb game of global strategy that goes beyond other games, wherein thoughtful, calculated geopolitics could prevent a worldwide nuclear war!&quot; as well as &quot;a truly entertaining and thought-provoking simulation of world geopolitics which involves the player in a quest to prevent a worldwide nuclear holocaust, while promoting either the U.S.A. or Russia to world prominence. This is a marvelous program that everyone should experience at least once.&quot;

&quot;BYTE&quot; praised the game in 1986, describing the Mac version as &quot;the best game I had ever seen on any computer ... by all means, get the program&quot;. &quot;Info&quot; gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, approving of the complex gameplay with a good user interface. While complaining of the lack of sound from the &quot;obvious Macintosh influence&quot;, the magazine concluded that it was &quot;An excellent game&quot;.

Bob Ewald reviewed &quot;Balance of Power&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 81. Ewald commented that &quot;In conclusion, if this type of game appeals to you most of the problems are worth suffering through. However, if you&#x27;re a hardcore wargamer who isn&#x27;t interested in diplomacy, I suggest that you pass on this one.&quot;

&quot;Compute!&quot; presented opposing views of the game in May 1988. The magazine included &quot;Balance of Power&quot; in its list of &quot;Our Favorite Games&quot;, calling it &quot;an impressive recreation of the world&#x27;s geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you&#x27;ll see the chilling message &quot;You have ignited a nuclear war&quot;&quot;. Orson Scott Card, however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—&quot;the best designer of simulation games I&#x27;ve seen&quot;—was &quot;leaning over your shoulder and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion that as long as the United States is very nice and doesn&#x27;t do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don&#x27;t play that way, why, he&#x27;ll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war&quot;. He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not know what would cause one, and &quot;there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them than when we disarm&quot;, but that &quot;[Crawford] is so sure he&#x27;s right that &quot;Balance of Power&quot; isn&#x27;t a game, it&#x27;s propaganda&quot;.

In 1989, &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that the 1990 edition&#x27;s multipolar features were welcome additions to the game. That year Card stated that the magazine&#x27;s 1988 list caused him to reevaluate the game when playing the 1990 edition, stating that it had &quot;the most detailed, carefully extrapolated future world I&#x27;ve worked with&quot;. While still criticizing geopolitical &quot;absurdities&quot; such as forcing the United States to passively accept Soviet troops in Syria (contrary to what happened during the Yom Kippur War) and advisors in Mexico or start nuclear war, Card now concluded that such outcomes probably reflected computer limitations rather than Crawford&#x27;s political views. He advised players to pretend that &quot;Balance of Power&quot; was set on an alien planet &quot;astonishingly similar&quot; to Earth, and to play solely based on the game&#x27;s assumptions about the world. Chuck Moss disagreed with Card&#x27;s revised view, describing &quot;Balance of Power&quot; in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1992 as &quot;reflect[ing] extreme bias on the part of [its] designers&quot;. He called it a &quot;pacific treatise ... nuclear war erupted if the U.S. so much as sent five million dollars to Panama&quot;.

Crawford stated in 1987 that he was most proud of his work on the game: &quot;I feel [it] has made the world a better place ... I think it has made a small number of people much more realistic in their appraisal of world affairs&quot;. In 1996 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 78th best game of all time, calling it &quot;a wonderful game of political intrigue that felt just like the Cold War and didn&#x27;t require the detail of &quot;Shadow President&quot; or &quot;CyberJudas&quot;.&quot; That year it was ranked as the 75th top game of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot;, who commented &quot;Although the game&#x27;s premises are hopelessly outdated (U.S.S.R.? What&#x27;s that?) and some disagree with the politics, the AI in &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, combined with its unique play style, make it a classic.&quot; In 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed it first on its list of &quot;The 10 political games everyone should play&quot;.

==Legacy==
After &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, Crawford began work on an entirely new game, &quot;Trust &amp; Betrayal: The Legacy of Siboot&quot;, released in 1987 and selling only a few thousand copies. Mindscape was disappointed, and pressured Crawford to do a follow-up to &quot;Balance of Power&quot;. The company pressed him hard on it, and Crawford felt that he &quot;owed them one&quot; after publishing &quot;Siboot&quot;. This sequel was released in 1989 as &quot;Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition&quot; on the Apple IIGS, Windows, Macintosh, Amiga and Atari ST. Crawford does not consider it a proper sequel, saying he was simply &quot;tidying up, adding some bells and whistles.&quot; &quot;Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition&quot; adds more countries, advisors to help the player, a new &quot;multi-polar&quot; level that allows countries to generate events of their own (such as declaring war on other countries) and a 2-player hotseat mode.

In 1992, Crawford left the game industry to make something more interactive and artistic. After many false starts, this emerged as &quot;The Erasmatron&quot;, and later re-released under the name &quot;Storytron&quot;. Both systems were used to make complex, interactive storylines. As a demo, Crawford used Storytron to build &quot;Balance of Power: 21st Century&quot;. This version begins on 12 September 2001 and mostly involves the US&#x27;s interactions with Asia and other emerging powers. It was not a success; Crawford himself describes it as &quot;crap&quot;.

&quot;Balance of Power&quot; has been the basis for a number of play-by-mail versions, manually run and based on moves posted in internet forum systems. One long-running example is hosted on .

<doc id="359406" wikidata="Q1048744" url="?curid=359406" title="General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">
<text>The general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). From 1924 until the country&#x27;s dissolution in 1991, the officeholder was the recognized leader of the Soviet Union. Prior to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s accession, the position was not viewed as an important role in Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s government and previous occupants had been responsible for technical rather than political decisions.

Officially, the General Secretary solely controlled the Communist Party directly. However, since the party had a monopoly on political power, the General Secretary &quot;de facto&quot; had executive control of the Soviet government. Because of the office&#x27;s ability to direct both the foreign and domestic policies of the state and preeminence over the Soviet Communist Party, it was the &quot;de facto&quot; highest office of the Soviet Union.

==History==
Before the October Revolution, the job of the party secretary was largely that of a bureaucrat. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power, the Office of the Responsible Secretary was established in 1919 to perform administrative work. After the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, the Office of General Secretary was created by Vladimir Lenin in 1922 with the intention that it serve a purely administrative and disciplinary purpose. Its primary task would be to determine the composition of party membership and to assign positions within the party. The General Secretary also oversaw the recording of party events, and was entrusted with keeping party leaders and members informed about party activities.

When assembling his cabinet, Lenin appointed Joseph Stalin to be General Secretary. Over the next few years, Stalin was able to use the principles of democratic centralism to transform his office into that of party leader, and eventually leader of the Soviet Union. Trotsky attributed his appointment to the initial recommendation of Grigory Zinoviev. This view has been supported by several historians. According to Russian historian, Vadim Rogovin, Stalin&#x27;s election to the position occurred after the Eleventh Party Congress (March–April 1922), in which Lenin, due to his poor health, participated only sporadically, and only attended four of the twelve sessions of the Congress.

Some historians have regarded the premature death of prominent Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov to have been a key factor in facilitating the elevation of Joseph Stalin to the position of leadership in the Soviet Union. In part, because Sverdlov served as the original chairman of the party secretariat and was considered a natural candidate for the position of General Secretary.

Prior to Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, Stalin&#x27;s tenure as General Secretary was already being criticized. In Lenin&#x27;s final months, he authored a pamphlet that called for Stalin&#x27;s removal on the grounds that Stalin was becoming authoritarian and abusing his power. The pamphlet triggered a political crisis which endangered Stalin&#x27;s position as General Secretary, and a vote was held to remove him from office. With the help of Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, Stalin was able to survive the scandal and remained in his post. After Lenin&#x27;s death, Stalin began to consolidate his power by using the office of General Secretary. By 1928, he had unquestionably become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the USSR, while the position of General Secretary became the highest office in the nation. In 1934, the 17th Party Congress refrained from formally re-electing Stalin as General Secretary. However, Stalin was re-elected to all the other positions he held, and remained leader of the party without diminution.

In the 1950s, Stalin increasingly withdrew from Secretariat business, leaving the supervision of the body to Georgy Malenkov, possibly to test his abilities as a potential successor. In October 1952, at the 19th Party Congress, Stalin restructured the party&#x27;s leadership. His request, voiced through Malenkov, to be relieved of his duties in the party secretariat due to his age, was rejected by the party congress, as delegates were unsure about Stalin&#x27;s intentions. In the end, the congress formally abolished Stalin&#x27;s office of General Secretary, although Stalin remained the highest-ranked party secretary and maintained ultimate control of the party. When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Malenkov was considered to be the most important member of the Secretariat, which also included Nikita Khrushchev, among others. Under a short-lived troika consisting of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers, but was forced to resign from the Secretariat nine days later on 14 March. This effectively left Khrushchev in control of the government, and he was elected to the new office of First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the Central Committee plenum on 14 September that same year. Khrushchev subsequently outmanoeuvred his rivals, who sought to challenge his political reforms. He was able to comprehensively remove Malenkov, Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich (one of Stalin&#x27;s oldest and closest associates) from power in 1957, an achievement which also helped to reinforce the supremacy of the position of First Secretary.

In 1964, opposition within the Politburo and the Central Committee, which had been increasing since the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, led to Khrushchev&#x27;s removal from office. Leonid Brezhnev succeeded Khrushchev as First Secretary, but was initially obliged to govern as part of a collective leadership, forming another troika with Premier Alexei Kosygin and Chairman Nikolai Podgorny. The office was renamed to General Secretary in 1966. The collective leadership was able to limit the powers of the General Secretary during the Brezhnev Era. Brezhnev&#x27;s influence grew throughout the 1970s as he was able to retain support by avoiding any radical reforms. After Brezhnev&#x27;s death, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko were able to rule the country in the same way as Brezhnev had. Mikhail Gorbachev ruled the Soviet Union as General Secretary until 1990, when the Communist Party lost its monopoly of power over the political system. The office of President of the Soviet Union was established so that Gorbachev could still retain his role as leader of the Soviet Union. Following the failed August coup of 1991, Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary. He was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Ivashko, who only served for five days as Acting General Secretary before Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected President of Russia, suspended all activity in the Communist Party. Following the party&#x27;s ban, the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP–CPSU) was established by Oleg Shenin in 1993, and is dedicated to reviving and restoring the CPSU. The organisation has members in all the former Soviet republics.

<text>José Victoriano Huerta Márquez (; 23 December 1850 – 13 January 1916) was a general in the Mexican Federal Army and 39th President of Mexico, who came to power by coup against the democratically elected government of Francisco I. Madero with the aid of other Mexican generals and the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. His violent seizure of power set off a new wave of armed conflict in the Mexican Revolution.

After a military career under President Porfirio Díaz and Interim President Francisco León de la Barra, Huerta became a high-ranking officer during the presidency of Madero during the first phase of the Mexican Revolution (1911–13). In February 1913, Huerta joined a conspiracy against Madero, who entrusted him to control a revolt in Mexico City. The Ten Tragic Days – actually fifteen days – saw the forced resignation of Madero and his vice president and their murders. The coup was backed by the nascent German Empire as well as the United States under the Taft administration. But the succeeding Wilson administration refused to recognize the new regime which had come to power by coup. The U.S. allowed arms sales to rebel forces. Many foreign powers did recognize the regime, including Britain and Germany, but withdrew further support when revolutionary forces started to show military success against the regime; their continuing support of him threatened their own relationships with the U.S. government. 

Huerta&#x27;s government resisted the U.S. incursion into the port of Veracruz that violated Mexico&#x27;s sovereignty. Even Huerta&#x27;s opponents agreed with his stance. The Constitutionalist Army, the forces of the northern coalition opposing Huerta, defeated the Federal Army, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Zacatecas. Huerta was forced to resign in July 1914 and flee the country to Spain, only 17 months into his presidency, after the Federal Army collapsed. While attempting to intrigue with German spies in the U.S. during World War I, Huerta was arrested in 1915 and died in U.S. custody.

His supporters were known as &quot;Huertistas&quot; during the Mexican Revolution. He is still vilified as a traitor by modern-day Mexicans, who generally refer to him as &quot;El Chacal&quot; (&quot;The Jackal&quot;) or &quot;El Usurpador&quot; (&quot;The Usurper&quot;).

==Early life==
According to the records in the books of the Parish Notary of Colotlán, José Victoriano Huerta Márquez was born and baptized on Monday, December 23, 1850, in the town of Colotlán. (Other sources indicate he was born on March 23, 1845, in the Agua Gorda ranch.) His parents were Jesús Huerta Córdoba, originally from Colotlán, Jalisco and María Lázara del Refugio Márquez Villalobos, originally from El Plateado, Zacatecas. His paternal grandparents were Rafael Huerta Benítez and María Isabel de la Trinidad Córdoba, the first originally from Villanueva, Zacatecas and the second from Colotlán, Jalisco and were his maternal grandparents José María Márquez and María Soledad Villalobos. He identified himself as indigenous, and both his parents are reported to have been ethnically Huichol, although his father is said to have been Mestizo. Huerta learned to read and write at a school run by the local priest, making him one of the relatively few literate people in Colotlán. He had decided upon a military career early on as the only way of escaping the poverty of Colotlán. In 1869 he was employed by visiting General Donato Guerra to serve as his personal secretary. In that role he distinguished himself and, with General Guerra&#x27;s support, gained admission to the Mexican National Military Academy (Heroico Colegio Militar) at Chapultepec in Mexico City in 1872. As a cadet, Huerta excelled at math, leading him to specialize in artillery and topography.

==Military career==

Upon graduating from the military academy in 1877, Huerta was commissioned into the Corps of Engineers. After entering the army as a lieutenant in the engineers in 1877, he was put in charge of improving the Loreto and Guadalupe forts in Puebla and the castle of Perote in Veracruz. In January 1879 he was promoted to captain and assigned to the staff of the 4th Division in Guadalajara, in charge of engineering. The commander of the 4th Division was General Manuel González, a close associate of President Porfirio Díaz and former president of Mexico (1880–84). In the interim, Huerta&#x27;s career prospered thanks to the patronage of González. In Mexico City, he married Emilia Águila Moya, whom he met in Veracruz, on 21 November 1880. The marriage produced 11 children. The names of his children surviving him in 1916 were Jorge, María Elisa, Victor, Luz, Elena, Dagoberto, Eva and Celia. Huerta participated in the &quot;pacification campaigns&quot; in Tepic and Sinaloa, where he distinguished himself in combat. He was known for ensuring that his men always got paid, often resorting to finding the money in ruthless ways. Following a complaint from the Catholic Church that Huerta had plundered a church to sell off its gold and silver to pay his men, Huerta justified his actions on the grounds that &quot;Mexico can do without her priests, but cannot do without her soldiers&quot;. On another occasion, following a complaint from a bank that he emptied out one of its branches at gunpoint to get money to pay his men, Huerta pointed out he left a receipt and would pay back the bank what he had stolen when he received the necessary funds from Mexico City. Huerta then spent nine years of his military career undertaking topographic studies in the states of Puebla and Veracruz. He traveled extensively to all parts of Mexico in this position. French cultural influence was very strong in 19th-century Mexico, and Huerta&#x27;s hero was Napoleon. He supported General Díaz as the closest approximation to his Napoleonic ideal, believing that Mexico needed a &quot;strongman&quot; to prosper.

By 1890 Huerta had reached the rank of Colonel of Engineers. From 1890 to 1895 Huerta lived in Mexico City, becoming a regular visitor to the presidential residence at Chapultepec Castle, and was seen as part of Díaz&#x27;s &quot;court&quot;. Through Huerta was well liked at the Chapultepec Castle, acquiring the persona of a trim, efficient officer who was stern to his subordinates while displaying a courtly, polished manner towards his superiors, he began to suffer from severe insomnia and began drinking heavily during this time. In January 1895 he commanded a battalion of infantry against a rebellion in Guerrero led by General Canuto Neri. The rebellion was ended when Díaz brokered a deal with Neri, who surrendered in exchange for a promise to remove the unpopular state governor. Huerta confirmed his reputation for ruthlessness by refusing to take prisoners and continuing to attack the followers of Neri even after Díaz had signed a ceasefire. In December 1900 Huerta commanded a successful military campaign against the Yaqui in Sonora. During the near-genocidal campaign against the Yaqui, Huerta was more concerned with mapping out the terrain of Sonora, but at times he commanded forces in the field against the Yaqui. From 12 April-8 September 1901 Huerta put down a rebellion in Guerrero, completely &quot;pacifying&quot; the state. In May 1901 he was promoted to the rank of general. In 1901–02 he suppressed a Maya rising in Yucatán. He commanded about 500 men in his campaign against the Maya, starting in October 1901, and fought 79 different actions over the course of 39 days. Huerta was then promoted to Brigadier General and awarded the Medal of Military Merit In May 1902 he was promoted commander of federal army forces in Yucatán, and in October 1902 he reported to Díaz that he had &quot;pacified&quot; the Yucatán. During the campaign in Yucatán he became increasingly dependent on alcohol to continue functioning. His health began to decline, and perhaps because of his heavy drinking he complained he could not go outside in the sunshine without wearing sunglasses, and he suffered bouts of uncontrollable nervous shaking. His decaying teeth caused him much pain. In August 1903 he was appointed to head a committee tasked with reforming the uniforms of the federal army. In 1907 he retired from the army on grounds of ill health, having developed cataracts while serving in the southern jungles. He then applied his technical training by taking up the position of Head of Public Works in Monterrey and planning a new street layout for the city.

==Mexican Revolution under Madero==

On the eve of the 1910 Revolution against the long-established Díaz regime, Huerta was teaching mathematics in Mexico City. He applied successfully to rejoin the army with his former rank and was accepted. He did not play a major role in the early stages of the Revolution that led to the resignation of Díaz, although he commanded the military escort that gave Díaz safe conduct into exile in May 1911. During the interim presidency of Francisco León de la Barra following the resignation of Díaz and the election of Francisco I. Madero in November 1911, General Huerta carried out a campaign in Morelos, attempting to crush the rebellion led by Emiliano Zapata. Huerta&#x27;s forces burned villages supporting the rebellion and attacked their residents. These actions frustrated Madero&#x27;s later attempts to placate those rebels. Huerta had a record of opposing revolutionaries and intrigues with Madero&#x27;s enemies. Huerta&#x27;s actions in Morelos forced a break between Emiliano Zapata and Madero, who was later to rebel against Madero immediately after his November 1911 election.

Despite the fact that revolutionary forces supporting Madero had forced Díaz&#x27;s resignation, Madero ordered them demobilized and retained the Mexican Federal Army they had just defeated. Huerta pledged allegiance to President Madero, and carried out Madero&#x27;s orders to crush anti-Madero revolts by rebel generals such as Pascual Orozco, who had helped topple Díaz and then rebelled against his regime. In the Orozco rebellion, Huerta saw the opportunity to eliminate revolutionary general Pancho Villa, who was also attempting to suppress the revolt. Accused of stealing a horse, Villa then faced execution by Huerta without trial. Only Madero&#x27;s last minute intervention saved the life of one of his most effective generals.

Orozco&#x27;s rebellion was a major threat to the Madero government, since he had standing as a revolutionary and commanded significant forces. Madero sent Huerta to crush the rebellion. He had at his command troops of the Mexican Federal Army and these were joined by irregulars led by Pancho Villa, at Torreón in April 1912. Huerta offered Orozco&#x27;s supporters (&quot;Orozquistas&quot;) amnesty, which might have weakened their forces already suffering from lack of money and arms. Huerta&#x27;s forces defeated Orozco&#x27;s at Rellano in May 1912. With that victory Huerta &quot;had suddenly become a military hero with a national reputation.&quot;

==Huerta and Madero&#x27;s overthrow==

As Madero lost support and as internal and external groups plotted to remove him from the presidency, Huerta secretly joined the conspiracy. The coup d&#x27;état that toppled Madero in February 1913, known in Mexican history as the Ten Tragic Days, was a conspiracy of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s nephew, General Félix Díaz, General Bernardo Reyes, and General Madragón. The plotters attempted to draw in Huerta in January, but Huerta waited for a better incentive to join, since Félix Díaz expected to be the successor to Madero. The first day of the coup, February 9, General Reyes died in battle and General Lauro Villar, the commander of Madero&#x27;s forces in Mexico City, was wounded. Madero appointed Huerta in his stead. According to historian Friedrich Katz, &quot;It was a decision for which [Madero] would pay with his life.&quot; Having secured that key position, Huerta reopened negotiations with the plotters and joined them in secret. His task was to undermine Madero militarily without betraying his own complicity and began military operations that weakened Madero&#x27;s forces. 
The United States Ambassador to Mexico, Henry Lane Wilson, was an active participant in the plot to overthrow Madero. Ambassador Wilson believed that Huerta would not have staged a coup had the United States not assured them that it would recognize the new regime. Following a confused few days of fighting in Mexico City between loyalist and rebel factions of the army, Huerta had Madero and vice-president José María Pino Suárez seized and briefly imprisoned on 18 February 1913 in the National Palace. The conspirators then met at the US Embassy to sign &quot;El Pacto de la Embajada&quot; (The Embassy Pact), which provided for the exile of Madero and Pino Suárez and Huerta&#x27;s takeover of the Mexican government.

==&quot;La Mano Dura&quot;: Presidency of Mexico==

To give the coup the appearance of legitimacy, Huerta had foreign minister Pedro Lascuráin assume the presidency; under the 1857 Constitution of Mexico, the foreign minister stood third in line for the presidency behind the Vice President and Attorney General; Madero&#x27;s attorney general had also been ousted in the coup. Lascuráin then appointed Huerta as Secretary of the Interior, making him next in line for the presidency. After less than an hour in office (some sources say as little as 15 minutes), Lascuráin resigned, handing the presidency to Huerta. At a late-night special session of Congress surrounded by Huerta&#x27;s troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. Four days later Madero and Pino Suárez were taken from the National Palace to prison at night and shot by officers of the rurales (federal police), who were assumed to be acting on Huerta&#x27;s orders.

The Huerta government was promptly recognized by all the western European governments, but not the government of the United States. The outgoing US administration of William Howard Taft refused to recognize the new government, as a way of pressuring Mexico to end the Chamizal border dispute in favor of the US, with the plan being to trade recognition for settling the dispute on American terms. Newly inaugurated U.S. president Woodrow Wilson had a general bias in favor of liberal democracy and had distaste for General Huerta, who had come to power by coup and was implicated in the murder of Madero, but was initially open to recognizing Huerta provided that he could &quot;win&quot; an election that would give him a democratic veneer. Félix Díaz and the rest of the conservative leaders had seen Huerta as a transitional leader and pressed for early elections, which they expected to be won by Díaz on a Catholic conservative platform, and were rudely surprised when they discovered Huerta wanted to keep the presidency for himself. 

Huerta moved quickly to consolidate power within Mexico with the support of state governors. Huerta sought support from Pascual Orozco, whose rebellion against Madero Huerta had been in charge of suppressing. Orozco still held the leadership of significant forces in Chihuahua and potentially in Durango, so gaining his support was important to Huerta. Orozco had rebelled against Madero and Huerta had overthrown him, so there was the possibility of gaining his support. During a meeting of representatives of Huerta&#x27;s government and Orozco&#x27;s forces, Orozco laid out his terms for supporting Huerta. He sought recognition of his soldiers&#x27; service to the overthrown of Madero and pay; pensions and care of soldiers&#x27; widows and orphans, agrarian reforms, government payment of Orozquista debts that financed the campaign against Madero, and employment of Orozquistas as &quot;rurales&quot;. Huerta agreed to the terms, and Orozco threw his support to Huerta on 27 February 1913. Orozco sought to persuade Emiliano Zapata to make peace with Huerta regime. Zapata had held Orozco in high esteem as a fellow revolutionary who had rejected the Madero regime. However, for Zapata, Orozco&#x27;s support of Huerta was anathema, saying &quot;Huerta represents the defection of the army. You represent the defection of the Revolution.&quot;

Huerta attempted to build further support for his government, and the urban working class in Mexico City made important gains before being suppressed. In particular, the leftist Casa del Obrero Mundial (House of the World Worker). The Casa organized demonstrations and strikes, which the Huerta regime initially tolerated. But then the government cracked down, arresting and deporting some leaders, and destroying the Casa&#x27;s headquarters. Huerta also sought to diffuse agrarian agitation, which fueled the rebellion in Morelos led by Emiliano Zapata. The most vocal intellectual in favor of land reform was Andrés Molina Enríquez, whose 1909 publication &quot;Los grandes problemas nacionales&quot; (The Great National Problems) focused on inequality of land tenure. Molina Enríquez joined the Huerta government heading the Department of Labor. He had denounced the overthrow of Madero, but &quot;initially saw in the Huerta regime the political formula he believed Mexico required: a strong military leader capable of imposing the social reforms Mexico needed to benefit the masses.&quot; However, despite internal support in the Huerta regime for reform, Huerta increasingly embraced militarization and Molina Enríquez resigned.

Chihuahua Governor Abraham González refused and Huerta had him arrested and murdered in March 1913.
The most important challenge from a state governor was by Venustiano Carranza, governor of Coahuila, who drafted the Plan of Guadalupe, calling for the creation of a Constitutionalist Army (evoking the 1857 Liberal Constitution) to oust the usurper Huerta and restore constitutional government. Supporters of Carranza&#x27;s plan included Emiliano Zapata, who nonetheless remained loyal to his own Plan de Ayala, northern revolutionary Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, and Álvaro Obregón. However, former revolutionary General Pascual Orozco, whom Huerta fought when serving President Madero, now joined with Huerta as a counter-revolutionary. Four Deputies were executed over the summer of 1913 for criticizing the Huerta regime. One deputy was arrested by Mexico City police as he was delivering a speech denouncing Huerta at a rally and taken out to the countryside, where he was &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot;. Lacking popular legitimacy, Huerta chose to turn the refusal of the US to recognize his government as an example of American &quot;interference&quot; in Mexico&#x27;s internal affairs, organizing anti-American demonstrations in the summer of 1913 with the hope of gaining some popular support.

British historian Alan Knight wrote about Huerta: &quot;The consistent thread which ran through the Huerta regime, from start to finish, was militarisation: the growth and reliance on the Federal Army, the military takeover of public offices, the preference for military over political solutions, the militarisation of society in general&quot;. Huerta &quot;came very close to converting Mexico into the most completely militaristic state in the world.&quot; Huerta&#x27;s stated goal was a return to the &quot;order&quot; of the Porfiriato, but his methods were unlike those of Diaz, who had shown a talent for compromise and diplomacy; seeking support from and playing off regional elites, using not only army officers but also technocrats, former guerrilla leaders, &quot;caciques&quot; and provincial elites to support his regime. By contrast, Huerta relied entirely upon the army for support, giving officers all of the key jobs, regardless of their talents, as Huerta sought to rule with &quot;La Mano Dura&quot; (&quot;The Iron Hand&quot;), believing only in military solutions to all problems. For this reason, Huerta during his short time as president was the object of far more hatred than Diaz ever was; even the Zapatistas had a certain respect for Diaz as a patriarchal leader who had enough sense to finally leave with dignity in 1911, whereas Huerta was seen as a thuggish soldier who had Madero murdered and sought to terrorize the nation into submission. Huerta disliked cabinet meetings, ordered his ministers about as if they were non-commissioned officers and displayed in general a highly autocratic style. Huerta established a harsh military dictatorship. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson became hostile to the Huerta administration, recalled ambassador Henry Lane Wilson and demanded Huerta step aside for democratic elections. In August 1913 Wilson imposed an arms embargo on Mexico, forcing Huerta to turn to Europe and Japan to buy arms.

The Federal Army Huerta took over in February 1913 on paper numbered between 45,000 and 50,000 men. Huerta continued to increase the strength of the army, issuing a decree for conscripting 150,000 men in October 1913; another decree for conscripting 200,000 men in January 1914 and one for a quarter of million men in March 1914. These figures were never achieved as many men fled to fight for the Constitutionalists rather than Huerta. Together with an increase in the number of the paramilitary &quot;rurales&quot; mounted police force and the state militias, Huerta had approximately 300,000 men, or about 4% of the population, fighting for him by early 1914. Faced with Mexicans&#x27; widespread reluctance to serve, Huerta had to resort to the &quot;leva&quot;, as vagrants, criminals, captured rebels, political prisoners and sometimes just men on the streets were rounded up to serve in the Federal Army. In Veracruz workers getting off the night shift at factories were rounded up in a &quot;leva&quot; (forced conscription), while in Mexico City poor men going to hospitals were rounded up in the &quot;leva&quot;. As Indians were felt to be particularly docile and submissive to whites, the &quot;leva&quot; was applied especially heavily in southern Mexico, where the majority of the people were indigenous. Thousands of Juchiteco and Maya were rounded up to fight a war in the north of Mexico that they felt did not concern them. A visitor to Mérida, Yucatán wrote of &quot;heart-breaking&quot; scenes as hundreds of Maya said goodbye to their wives as they were forced to board a train while in chains.

The men rounded up in the &quot;leva&quot; proved to be poor soldiers, prone to desertion and mutiny, since they were serving against their will and felt hatred for their commanding officers. Officers mistreated both their enlisted men and the common people. Huerta had to follow a defensive strategy of keeping the army concentrated in large towns, since his soldiers in the field would either desert or go over to the rebels. Throughout the civil war of 1913–14 the Constitutionalists fought with a ferocity and courage that the federal army never managed. In Yucatán about 70% of the army were men conscripted from the prisons, while one &quot;volunteer&quot; battalion consisted of captured Yaqui. In October 1913, in the town of Tlalnepantla, the army&#x27;s 9th Regiment, which was said to have been &quot;crazed with alcohol and marijuana&quot;, mutinied, murdered their officers and went over to the rebels.

To secure volunteers, Huerta attempted to use Mexican nationalism and anti-Americanism. In the fall of 1913, running spurious stories in the press warning of an imminent U.S. invasion and asking for patriotic men to step up to defend Mexico. The campaign attracted some volunteers from the lower middle class, through they were usually disillusioned when they learned that they were going to fight other Mexicans, not the Americans. In rural Mexico a sense of Mexican nationalism barely existed at this time among the &quot;campesinos&quot;. Mexico was an abstract entity that meant nothing, and most peasants were primarily loyal to their own villages, the &quot;patria chicas&quot;. Huerta&#x27;s patriotic campaign was a complete failure in the countryside. The other source of volunteers was provided by allowing wealthy landlords to raise private armies under the guise of the state militias, but few &quot;peons&quot; wanted to fight, let alone die, for General Huerta, since some Constitutionalists were promising land reform, although not First Chief Venustiano Carranza.

When Huerta refused to call elections, and with the situation further exacerbated by the Tampico Affair, President Wilson landed US troops to occupy Mexico&#x27;s most important seaport, Veracruz.

After the Federal Army was repeatedly defeated in battle by Constitutionalist generals Alvaro Obregón and Pancho Villa, climaxing in the Battle of Zacatecas, Huerta bowed to internal and external pressure and resigned the presidency on 15 July 1914.

==Exile, late life and death==

Huerta went into exile, first traveling to Kingston, Jamaica, aboard the German cruiser SMS &quot;Dresden&quot;. From there he moved to the United Kingdom, then Spain, finally arriving in the United States in April 1915.

While in the US he negotiated with Captain Franz von Rintelen of German Navy Intelligence for money to purchase weapons and arrange U-boat landings to provide support, while offering (perhaps as a bargaining chip) to make war on the US, which Germany hoped would end munitions supplies to the Allies. Their meetings, held at the Manhattan Hotel (as well as another New York hotel, &quot;probably the Holland House&quot; at Fifth Avenue and 30th Street), were observed by Secret Servicemen, and von Rintelen&#x27;s telephone conversations were routinely intercepted and recorded.

Huerta traveled from New York by train to Newman, New Mexico ( from the border), where he was to be met by General Pascual Orozco and some well-armed Mexican supporters. However, a US Army colonel with 25 soldiers and two deputy US marshals intervened and arrested him as he left the train, on a charge of sedition. The German-initiated plan for Huerta to regain the Mexican presidency through a coup d&#x27;état was foiled. After some time in a US Army prison at Fort Bliss he was released on bail, but remained under house arrest due to risk of flight to Mexico. A day after, he attended a dinner at Fort Bliss. Later he was returned to jail, and while so confined died, perhaps of cirrhosis of the liver or possibly of cancer. While the main symptom was yellow jaundice, poisoning by the US was widely suspected. In &quot;The Dark Invader&quot; (published 1933), Captain von Rintelen wrote that he had heard that Huerta was poisoned by his cook; but that he had never found out the truth. 

==Legacy==
In the historiography of Mexico, Victoriano Huerta is the &quot;demon&quot; of the Mexican Revolution, against whom all others are measured. Diverse factions and interests in Mexico came together against the Huerta regime, including the Zapatistas in Morelos and the Constitutionalists in northern Mexico under Venustiano Carranza. Once Huerta was ousted, the loose coalition fell apart and Mexico was plunged into a civil war between the winners. Germany&#x27;s backing of Huerta weakened their influence in Mexico while the hostility of the United States to the regime increased it. Although U.S. business interests had hoped that President Wilson would recognize the Huerta government, they realized he would not and began aligning themselves with different revolutionary factions. One historian argues that Huerta&#x27;s regime was not as conservative or reactionary as portrayed, arguing that he did not attempt to &quot;reincarnate&quot; the Age of Díaz. &quot;Huerta and his advisors both realized the days of Díaz were gone forever. They did not attempt to stem the new energies and forces unleashed in 1910; rather they attempted to moderate them.&quot; In general, however, his regime is seen as a repudiation of democracy and Huerta himself an iron-fisted authoritarian. Despite efforts in Mexico to redress the exclusion of Andrés Molina Enríquez from the pantheon of Mexican revolutionaries—since he is considered the intellectual father of the Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico, which empowered the state to implement land reform and expropriate private owners of resources like oil—Molina Enríquez is usually considered by Mexican historiography as &quot;tainted&quot; due to his service in the Huerta government.

==In popular culture==
Huerta has been portrayed or referenced in any number of movies dealing with the Mexican Revolution, including &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; and &quot;And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself&quot;.

In the 1952 film &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, starring Marlon Brando as Emiliano Zapata, Huerta is portrayed by Frank Silvera.

In the 1968 film &quot;Villa Rides&quot;, Huerta was played by Herbert Lom.

In the novel &quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; (1996), by James Carlos Blake, Huerta is a major character.

Both Victoriano Huerta and Pancho Villa are referenced in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), when Indiana (Harrison Ford) is recalling events in his childhood to his yet-to-be revealed son (Shia LaBeouf): &quot;It was a fight against Victoriano Huerta&quot;. He then spits on the ground to show disgust at the name.

<text>A churro (, ) is a type of fried dough from Spanish and Portuguese cuisine, made with choux pastry dough piped into hot oil with a piping bag and large closed star tip or similar shape. They are also found in Latin American cuisine, Philippine cuisine and in other areas that have received immigration from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries, especially in France and the Southwestern United States.

In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are known as &quot;porras&quot;, &quot;jeringos&quot;, or &quot;tejeringos&quot; in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in coffee, or in hot chocolate for an afternoon snack. There are also two slightly different snacks in Portugal, called &quot;porra&quot; and fartura, which are filled with jelly instead of the &quot;doce de leite&quot; traditional to Brazilian churros.

==History==
The origin of churros is unclear. But according to food historian Michael Krondl, &quot;today&#x27;s churro is not that different from a recipe for a flour and water fritter that you find in &quot;Apicius&quot;, a Roman cookbook dating from the 1st century AD. And there are recipes from the Ancient Greeks, but it&#x27;s probably even older than that. In the Mediterranean basin it&#x27;s basically been around forever&quot;.

But there are also other theories: one of them is that the churro was made by Spanish shepherds to substitute for fresh baked goods. Churro paste was easy to make and fry in an open fire in the mountains, where shepherds spend most of their time, but the nomadic lifestyle of the shepherds and the large quantities of oil or fat needed to fry churros make that unlikely.

Another theory, considered a hoax by some people suggests the concept was brought to Europe from China by the Portuguese. The Portuguese sailed for the Orient; as they returned from Ming-dynasty China to Portugal, they brought along with them new culinary techniques. One included altering dough for &quot;youtiao&quot;, also known as &quot;yóuzháguǐ&quot; in southern China, which bears a resemblance to the churro. The new pastry was soon introduced to Spain, where it was modified to have the dough extruded through a star-shaped nozzle (compare a piping bag) rather than pulled.

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Diccionario de la lengua española&quot;, &quot;churro&quot; is onomatopoeic, ultimately imitative of the sound of frying.

==Preparation==

Churros are fried until they become crunchy, and may be sprinkled with sugar. The surface of a churro is ridged due to having been piped from a churrera, a syringe-like tool with a star-shaped nozzle. Churros are generally prisms in shape, and may be straight, curled or spirally twisted.

Like pretzels, churros are sold by street vendors, who may fry them freshly on the street stand and sell them hot. In Spain and much of Latin America, churros are available in cafes for breakfast, although they may be eaten throughout the day as a snack. Specialized &quot;churrerías&quot;, in the form of a shop or a trailer, can be found during the holiday period. In addition, countries like Colombia, Peru, Spain and Venezuela have churrerías throughout their streets. In Portugal, they are commonly eaten at carnivals, fairs and other celebrations, where they are made freshly at street stands.

The dough is a mixture of flour, water and salt. Some versions are made of potato dough. Depending on the recipe, it may not be vegan, as they can contain butter, milk or eggs.

==Variations==

In Seville (Andalusia), the name &quot;calientes&quot; (meaning hot) or &quot;calentitos de rueda&quot; is sometimes used instead of the word &quot;churro&quot;. These tend to refer to the thicker variant, called &quot;porra&quot;. Calientes are usually fried in the shape of a continuous spiral and cut into portions afterwards. The center of the spiral is thicker and softer, and for many a delicacy in itself. The standard &quot;churro&quot; is also sold under the name &quot;calentitos de papas&quot;, the name referring to the softer mashed potato-like texture.

In parts of eastern Andalusia, a much thinner dough is used, which does not allow for the typical ridges to be formed on the surface of the churro. The final result therefore has a smooth surface, and is more pliable and of a slightly thinner diameter than standard Spanish churros. Another difference is that sugar is never sprinkled on them, because the flavour is not considered suitable.

Filled, straight &quot;churros&quot; are found in Cuba (with fruit, such as guava), Brazil (with chocolate, &quot;doce de leite&quot;, among others), and in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Mexico (usually filled with &quot;dulce de leche&quot; or &quot;cajeta&quot; but also with chocolate and vanilla).

In Colombia and Venezuela, churros are round like doughnuts sprinkled with sugar and filled with bocadillo (membrillo or guava paste), arequipe and sweetened condensed milk. In Spain, a considerably wider diameter is used to accommodate the filling. In Uruguay, churros can also come in a savoury version, filled with melted cheese.

In the Philippines, &quot;churros&quot; are typically straight, or bent into U-shapes or circular shapes dusted with white sugar and are popular during Christmas.

In Thailand, &quot;churros&quot; are commonly known as &quot;Patonggo Spain&quot; (, &quot;Spanish deep-fried dough stick&quot;), according to the type of fried dough that Thais are familiar with, namely &quot;Youtiao&quot; or &quot;Patonggo&quot; in vernacular.

Churros in American theme parks and street fairs are most often rolled in cinnamon sugar or other flavored sugars.

==Similar dishes==
In the Middle East, a churro-like fried dough-based sweet is known as &quot;Karabeej Halab&quot;.

&quot;Youtiao&quot;, a traditional Chinese fried dough with a long history. It is well known in Thailand as &quot;Patonggo&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The Mexican sitcom El Chavo del Ocho featured a 3-episode saga in 1978 titled &quot;La Venta de Churros&quot; with churros as the main theme. The popularity of this saga has led people to frequently associate churros with the series to the point of even selling them using the characters&#x27; images to boost sales.

<text>Gioconda Belli (born December 9, 1948) is a Nicaraguan-born novelist and poet known for her contributions to Nicaraguan literature.

==Early life==
Gioconda Belli grew up in a wealthy family in Managua. Her father is Humberto Belli Zapata and her brother is Humberto Belli.

She attended boarding school in Spain, graduated from the Royal School of Santa Isabel in Madrid, and studied advertising and journalism at the Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and Journalism in Philadelphia. She married and had her first daughter at 19 when she returned to Nicaragua.

== Career ==
Belli began her career at Pepsi-Cola as liaison to the company&#x27;s advertising agency, Publisa, which then hired her as an account executive.

Through one of her colleagues at the advertising agency, Belli met Camilo Ortega, who introduced her to the Sandinistas and asked her to join the group. 

In 1970, Belli joined the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship, sworn into the movement by Leana Ortega, Camilo Ortega&#x27;s wife. Belli&#x27;s work for the movement led to her being forced into exile in Mexico in 1975. Returning in 1979 just before the Sandinista victory, she became FSLN&#x27;s international press liaison in 1982 and the director of State Communications in 1984. During that time she met Charles Castaldi, an American NPR journalist, whom she married in 1987. After 1990 she split her time between Managua and Los Angeles. She has since left the FSLN and became a major critic of the Ortega government. She lives in exile in Madrid.

===Writing===

In 1970, Belli published her first poems in the literary supplement of Nicaraguan newspaper &quot;La Prensa.&quot; In 1972, she won the Premio de Poesía Mariano Fiallos Gil award from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua.

1988, Belli&#x27;s book &quot;La Mujer Habitada&quot; (The Inhabited Woman), a semi-autobiographical novel that raised gender issues for the first time in the Nicaraguan revolutionary narratives, brought her increased attention; this book has been published in several languages and was on the reading list at four universities in the United States. The novel follows two parallel stories: the indigenous resistance to the Spanish and modern insurgency in Central America with various points in common: women&#x27;s emancipation, passion, and a commitment to liberation. In 2000, she published her autobiography, emphasizing her involvement in the revolutionary movement, &quot;El país bajo mi piel,&quot; published under the name &quot;The Country Under My Skin&quot; in the United States; it was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 2003. Belli continues publishing and maintains that poetry is her most important work. Belli was the recipient of the Premio Casa de las Américas in 1978. In 2008 Belli received the Premio Biblioteca Breve for her book &quot;El infinito en la palma de la mano&quot; (Infinity in the Palm of The Hand), an allegory about Adam and Eve in paradise.

Belli&#x27;s books have been published in numerous languages.

Her 2010 book was submitted with the title &quot;Crónicas de la Izquierda Erótica&quot;, but had to be changed to &quot;El País de las Mujeres&quot;, since the previous title was too similar to that of a 1973 book by Ana María Rodas: &quot;Poemas de la Izquierda Erótica&quot;. The book tells the story of a world governed by women. In the novel, she portrays a group of women that take power by means of a Political Party named &quot;Partido de la Izquierda Erótica&quot;. This is the same name as a movement formed by women during the 80s, to which Belli belonged, which had been named as a tribute to Rodas´ work. Her novel El intenso calor de la luna was released in August in Latin America, and in September 2014 in Spain.

=== Political activity ===
Belli opposed the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. From 1970, when she began writing her poems and like many intellectuals of her generation, she joined the ranks of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), at that time a clandestine and persecuted organization whose aim was the overthrow of the Somoza regime. She was a clandestine courier, transported weapons, travelled around Europe and Latin America obtaining resources and spreading the word about the Sandinista struggle. She became a member of the FSLN&#x27;s Political-Diplomatic Commission.

In 2018, Belli took a stand against the government of Daniel Ortega, which emerged from the 2016 elections, and became an active member of the Sandinista renewal movement.

In February 2023, the Ortega government stripped Nicaraguan citizenship from Belli. On February 23, 2023, Belli accepted Chilean citizenship after the Chilean Government offered nationality and asylum to all the Nicaraguans banished by Ortega.

<text>The ruins of Linlithgow Palace are located in the town of Linlithgow, West Lothian, Scotland, west of Edinburgh. The palace was one of the principal residences of the monarchs of Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. Although maintained after Scotland&#x27;s monarchs left for England in 1603, the palace was little used, and was burned out in 1746. It is now a visitor attraction in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.

==Origins==
A royal manor existed on the site from the 12th century. 

This was later enclosed by a timber palisade and outer fosse to create a fortification known as &#x27;the Peel&#x27;, built in 1301/2 by occupying English forces under Edward I. The site of the manor made it an ideal military base for securing the supply routes between Edinburgh Castle and Stirling Castle. The English fort was begun in March 1302 under the supervision of two priests, Richard de Wynepol and Henry de Graundeston, to the designs of Master James of St George, who was also present. In September 1302, sixty men and 140 women helped dig the ditches; the men were paid twopence and the women a penny daily. One hundred foot-soldiers were still employed as labourers on the castle in November and work continued during the Summer of 1303.

Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I, was at Linlithgow Palace in July 1304. She was pregnant and travelled to Knaresborough Castle in England to have her child. In September 1313, Linlithgow Peel was retaken for Scotland by an ordinary Scot named William Bynnie or Bunnock who was in the habit of selling hay to the garrison of the peel. When the gate was opened for him, he halted his wagon so that it could not be closed, and he and his seven sons leapt out from their hiding place under the hay, and they captured the peel for King Robert the Bruce. King Robert sent reinforcements and had the peel dismantled so that it could not be retaken by the English.

In January 1360, King David II visited Linlithgow and the peel was repaired &#x27;for the king&#x27;s coming&#x27;.

In 1424, the town of Linlithgow was partially destroyed in a great fire. King James I started the rebuilding of the palace as a grand residence for Scottish royalty, also beginning the rebuilding of the Church of St Michael immediately to the south of the palace: the earlier church had been used as a storeroom during Edward&#x27;s occupation. James I set out to build a palace rather than a heavily fortified castle, perhaps inspired by Sheen Palace which he probably visited in England. The royal apartments were decorated by Matthew the Painter in 1433. Mary of Guelders, the widow of James II and mother of James III, made improvements in 1461, for the visit of the exiled Henry VI of England. Over the following century the palace developed into a formal courtyard structure, with significant additions by James III and James IV.

==James IV and Margaret Tudor==
James IV bought crimson satin for a new doublet to wear while formally welcoming the Spanish ambassador Don Martin de Torre at Linlithgow in August 1489. Silverware and tapestries were brought from Edinburgh for the event, and the wardrobe servant David Caldwell brought cords and rings to hang the tapestry in the palace. New rushes were brought from the Haw of Lithgow for the chamber floor. Entertainment included a play performed by Patrick Johnson and his fellows. After a visit to Stirling the King returned to Linlithgow and played dice with the Laird of Halkett and his Master of Household, and on 17 September rewarded stonemasons working on the palace with two gold angel coins. In November 1497 he played cards and bought jesses and leashes to go hawking. James gave the masons working on the building a tip of 9 shillings, known as &quot;drinksilver&quot;, and ordered the master mason to go to Stirling Castle to provide a plan for his new lodgings there. Andrew Cavers, Abbot of Lindores, was made supervisor of construction at Linlithgow.

James IV spent Easter 1490 at the palace, visited the town of Culross, and returned on 18 April to play dice with Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and the Laird of Halkett, losing 20 gold unicorn coins. The King spent Christmas 1490 and Easter 1491 at Linlithgow. On 9 April he bought seeds for the palace gardener. The poet Blind Harry came to court at Linlithgow at least five times. James IV was interested in medicine and experimented taking blood from his servant Domenico and another man at Linlithgow. Perkin Warbeck was a Christmas guest in 1495. The king&#x27;s mistress Margaret Drummond stayed at Linlithgow in the autumn of 1496. The park dykes were rebuilt in 1498.

On 31 May 1503 the palace was given to Margaret Tudor the bride of James IV. It was to become the new queen&#x27;s favourite home in Scotland. A mason, Nichol Jackson, completed battlements on the west side of the palace in the summer of 1504. An African drummer known as the &quot;More taubronar&quot; performed at the palace. When the King stayed at Linlithgow in July 1506 a coat was bought for a fool, and James IV visited the building work at the quire of St Michael&#x27;s Church. He gave the master mason a tip of 9 shillings. The son of James IV and Margaret Tudor, the future James V, was born in the palace in April 1512. The captain of the palace, Alexander McCulloch of Myreton, took on the role of the Prince&#x27;s bodyguard.

The household of Margaret Tudor at Linlithgow included the African servants Margaret and Ellen More. In April 1513 the roof of the chapel was altered and renewed, and a new organ was made by a French musician and craftsman called Gilyem and fixed to the wall. Timber was shipped to Blackness Castle and carted to the Palace. The windows of the queen&#x27;s oratory, overlooking the Loch, were reglazed. An English diplomat, Nicholas West, came to the palace in April 1513 and was met by Sir John Sinclair, one of the courtiers featured in William Dunbar&#x27;s poem &quot;Ane Dance in the Quenis Chalmer&quot;. West talked to Margaret Tudor and saw the baby Prince. He wrote &quot;verily, he is a right fair child, and a large of his age&quot;.

After the death of his father at the Battle of Flodden, the infant James V was not kept at Linlithgow, but came to the palace from Stirling Castle dressed in a new black velvet suit accompanied by minstrels in April 1517, and went on to take up residence in Edinburgh Castle. Margaret Tudor rewarded the King&#x27;s nurse and governess, Marion Douglas, with a grant of the lands near Linlithgow Palace called the Queen&#x27;s Acres in July 1518. Marion&#x27;s daughter, Katherine Bellenden, made the king&#x27;s shirts.

==James V==
When the teenage James V came to Linlithgow in 1528, Thomas Hamilton supplied him with sugar candy. James V added the outer gateway and the elaborate courtyard fountain. The stonework of the south façade was renewed and unified for James V in the 1530s by the keeper, James Hamilton of Finnart. Timber imported from Denmark-Norway, including &quot;Estland boards&quot; and joists, was bought at the harbours of Dundee, South Queensferry, Montrose, and Leith, and shipped to Blackness Castle to be carted to the palace. Three oak trees were cut down in Callender Wood to provide tables for dressing food in the kitchens, and seven oak trees from the Torwood. The improvements included altering the chapel ceiling and trees were brought from Callender to make scaffolding for this. Six hogshead barrels were bought to hold the scaffold in place.

The older statues of the Pope, the Knight, and Labouring Man on the east side of the courtyard, with the inscriptions on ribbons held by angels were painted. New iron window grills, called yetts, were made by blacksmiths in Linlithgow, and these, with weather vanes, were painted with red lead and vermilion. A metal worker in Glasgow called George Clame made shutter catches for the windows and door locks in iron plated with tin. The chapel ceiling was painted with fine azurite. Thomas Peebles put stained glass in the chapel windows and the windows of the &quot;Lyon Chamber&quot;, meaning the courtyard windows of the Great Hall.

A chaplain, Thomas Johnston, kept the palace watertight and had the wallwalks and gutters cleaned. Peter Johnstoun was the palace carpenter. Robert Murray looked after the lead roofs and the plumbing of the fountain. There was a tennis court in the garden and an eel-trap in the Loch. The lodgings built for the Queen in the 1530s may have been in the old north wing on the first floor. Only one side of a doorway from this period remains, which may have led to a grand staircase for the Queen. When Mary of Guise arrived in Scotland, James Hamilton of Finnart was given 400 French gold crowns to repair the palace. In August 1539 he was paid for rebuilding the king&#x27;s kitchen, at the north end of the great hall, with a fireplace, an oven, and a room for silver vessels, and another for keeping coal.

During a visit in December 1539, Mary of Guise was provided with gold, silver, and black thread for embroidery, and her ladies&#x27; embroidery equipment was brought from Falkland Palace. Tapestry was brought from Edinburgh to decorate the palace. The goldsmiths Thomas Rynde and John Mosman provided chains, tablets or lockets, rings, precious stones, necklaces, and jewelled coifs for ladies called &quot;shaffrons&quot; for the King to give as gifts to his courtiers on New Year&#x27;s Day. On the feast of the Epiphany in January the court watched an &quot;interlude&quot; that was an early version of David Lyndsay&#x27;s play, &quot;A Satire of the Three Estates&quot;, in the Great Hall. Mary of Guise returned to Edinburgh on 3 February and was crowned soon afterwards.

==Mary, Queen of Scots==
Mary, Queen of Scots, was born at Linlithgow Palace in December 1542 and lived at the palace for a time. In January 1543, Viscount Lisle heard that she was kept with her mother, &quot;and nursed in her own chamber&quot;. In March 1543 the English ambassador Ralph Sadler rode from Edinburgh to see her for the first time. Mary of Guise showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was &quot;as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live&quot;. Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox came to see the infant queen on 5 April 1543.

The blacksmith William Hill was employed at this time to increase the security of the palace by fitting iron window grills, called yetts. Alexander Livingston, 5th Lord Livingston was paid £813 for keeping the infant queen in the palace. Regent Arran was worried his enemies, including Cardinal Beaton, would take Mary in July 1543. He came with Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus and brought his artillery. He considered putting the queen in Blackness Castle, a stronger fortress. Henry VIII hoped that Mary would be separated from her mother and taken to Tantallon Castle. Mary was teething and plans to move her were delayed.

Supporters of the Auld Alliance at Linlithgow signed the &quot;Secret Bond&quot; pledging to prevent Mary marrying Prince Edward. Following lengthy negotiations between the armed factions at Linlithgow, Mary was taken to Stirling Castle by her mother on 26 July 1543, escorted by the Earl of Lennox, and an armed force described as a &quot;great army&quot;. Arran employed a carpenter from Linlithgow, Thomas Milne, to make three wooden chandeliers to hang in the palace in January 1546.

As an adult Queen Mary often visited Linlithgow, but did not commission new building work at the palace. She returned on 14 January 1562 with her half-brother Lord James Stewart and received James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran as a guest. She returned to Edinburgh on 30 January after visiting Cumbernauld Castle. Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, her second husband, played tennis at Linlithgow. Mary came to Linlithgow in December 1565 to take the air and have a quiet time with few visitors, but her husband Lord Darnley was expected. She was pregnant and was carried to Linlithgow in a horse-litter. She had a bed at Linlithgow of crimson velvet and damask embroidered with love knots.

==James VI==
In the years after the abdication of Mary and the Marian Civil War, Captain Andrew Lambie and his lieutenant John Spreul kept an armed guard of 28 men of war at the Palace. An iron yett was brought to the Palace from Blackness Castle by Alexander Stewart in 1571. Timber was used to fortify the church steeple.

In March 1576 Regent Morton ordered some repairs to the roof and the kitchen chimney. James VI of Scotland came to Linlithgow in May 1583, and his courtiers, including Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell and George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal played football. James VI held a parliament in the great hall of the palace in December 1585, the first gathering of the whole nobility in the palace since the reign of his grandfather James V of Scotland. James VI gave lands including the palace to his bride Anne of Denmark as a &quot;morning gift&quot;. On 14 May 1590 Peder Munk, the Admiral of Denmark, rode to Linlithgow from Niddry Castle, and was welcomed at the palace by the keeper Lewis Bellenden. He took symbolic possession or (sasine) by accepting a handful of earth and stone.

The keeper of the palace in 1594 was the English courtier Roger Aston who repaired the roof using lead shipped from England. Roger Aston was of doubtful parentage and as a joke hung a copy of his family tree next to that of the king of France in the long gallery, which James VI found very amusing. There was a private stair accessing the king&#x27;s apartments, and the Laird of Dundas claimed to have encountered the Queen there in the dark without recognising her.

In January 1595 John Stewart, 5th Earl of Atholl, Simon Fraser, 6th Lord Lovat, and Kenneth Mackenzie were kept prisoners in the palace, in order to pacify &quot;Highland matters&quot;. Lord Lovat gained the king&#x27;s favour and soon after married one of Anne of Denmark&#x27;s ladies in waiting, Jean Stewart, a daughter of James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune. Roger Aston helped the queen move to Linlithgow Palace at the end of May 1595. Over several days at Linlithgow in June 1595, James VI and Anne had discussions about the keeping of their son Prince Henry by the Earl of Mar. Anne refused to talk to Mar when he came to Linlithgow.

The daughter of James VI and Anne, Princess Elizabeth, lived in the palace in the care of Helenor Hay, Countess of Linlithgow, helped by Mary Kennedy, Lady Ochiltree. Alison Hay was her nurse, helped by her sister Elizabeth Hay. John Fairny was appointed to guard her chamber door. In 1599 James VI had to write to the Linlithgow burgh council about townspeople who had built houses which obstructed a route taken by the royal horses to water, and houses and gardens built near the loch (in recent times of drought) which hindered the royal laundry.

Anne of Denmark came to visit Princess Elizabeth at Linlithgow Palace on 7 May 1603, and then rode to Stirling Castle, where she argued again with Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar over the custody of Prince Henry. She brought Prince Henry to Linlithgow on 27 May, and after a week in Edinburgh, went to London. In 1616 Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow said there was still a tapestry from the royal collection at Linlithgow, used in Prince Henry&#x27;s chamber. The tapestry had been damaged by the fool Andrew Cockburn. The Earl had decorated Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s rooms with his own tapestry.

==Decay and repair==
After the Union of the Crowns in 1603 the Royal Court became largely based in England and Linlithgow was used very little. The North Range, said to be in very poor condition in 1583, and &quot;ruinous&quot; in 1599, collapsed at 4am on 6 September 1607. The Earl of Linlithgow wrote to King James VI &amp; I with the news:Please your most Sacred Majestie; this sext of September, betuixt thre and four in the morning, the north quarter of your Majesties Palice of Linlithgw is fallin, rufe and all, within the wallis, to the ground; but the wallis ar standing yit, bot lukis everie moment when the inner wall sall fall and brek your Majesties fontane.&quot;

King James had the north range rebuilt between 1618 and 1622. The carving was designed by the mason William Wallace. In July 1620, the architect, James Murray of Kilbaberton, estimated that 3,000 stones in weight of lead would be needed to cover the roof, costing £3,600 in Pound Scots (the Scottish money of the time). Scottish lead was sent from Leadhills in Lanarkshire by John Fairlie.

After the death of the depute-treasurer Gideon Murray who was supervising the project, King James put the Earl of Mar in charge of the &quot;speedy finishing of our Palace of Linlithgow&quot;. On 5 July 1621 the Earl of Mar wrote to James to tell him he had met James Murray, the master of works, and viewed the works at &quot;grate lenthe&quot;. Mar said the Palace would be ready for the King at Michaelmas. King James planned to visit Scotland in 1622, but never returned.

The carving at the window-heads and the Royal Arms of Scotland on the new courtyard façade were painted and gilded, as were the old statues of the Pope, Knight, and Labouring Man on the east side. In 1629 John Binning, James Workman, and John Sawyers painted the interiors with decorative friezes above walls left plain for tapestries and hangings. Despite these efforts, the only reigning monarch to stay at Linlithgow after that date was King Charles I, who spent a night there in 1633. As part of the preparations, the burgh council issued a proclamation forbidding the wearing of plaids and blue bonnets, a costume deemed &quot;indecent&quot;.

In 1648, part of the new North Range was occupied by Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow. An English visitor in October 1641 recorded in a poem that the roof of the great hall was already gone, the fountain vandalised by those who objected on religious grounds to the motto &quot;God Save the King,&quot; but some woodcarving remained in the Chapel Royal.

The palace was again described as ruinous in 1668. Its swansong came in September 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie visited Linlithgow on his march south but did not stay overnight. It is said that the fountain was made to flow with wine in his honour. The Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s army destroyed most of the palace buildings by accidentally burning it through lamps left on straw bedding on the night of 31 January/1 February 1746.

==Keepers and Captains of the Palace==
The positions of official keeper and captain of the palace have been held by: Andrew Cavers, Abbot of Lindores, 1498; John Ramsay of Trarinzeane, 1503; James Hamilton of Finnart, 1534, Captain and Keeper; William Danielstoun from 19 November 1540; Robert Hamilton of Briggis, from 22 August 1543; Andrew Melville of Murdocairney, later Lord Melville of Monimail, brother of James Melville of Halhill, from 15 February 1567; George Boyd, deputy Captain, 1564; Andrew Ferrier, Captain of the Palace, 1565, Frenchman and archer of the Queen&#x27;s Guard; John Brown, June 1569; Andrew Lambie, June 1571; Ludovic Bellenden of Auchnoul 22 November 1587, and 1595 Roger Aston. The office was acquired by Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow, and remained in that family until 1715 when the rights returned to the Crown.

A Scottish heraldic manuscript known as &quot;The Deidis of Armorie&quot; dating from the late 15th-century and derived and translated from a variety of sources, outlines the duties of keepers and captains:&quot;The capitanys war ordanit be princis to keip the fortrassis and gud townys of the princis and to vittaill thaim and garnys thaim of al necessar thingis petenyng to the wer; ... and gar mak certane and sur wachis be him and his folkis, baith be nycht and day, ffor dout of ganfalling in pestilence, sua that he may rendre gud compt of the place quhen tym and place requiris&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(modernised) The Captains were ordained by princes to keep the fortresses and good towns of the princes, and to stock them with food and furnish armaments in case of war; ... and to make sure and certain watch, himself and his kinsfolk, both by night and day, For fear of succumbing to the plague, so that he may render good account of the place, when time and place requires.

==Present day==
Long-neglected, the palace passed into the care of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, together with the surrounding grounds, in 1832. It passed to the Office of Works in 1874. Major consolidation works were undertaken in the 1930s and 1940s.

Today the palace is managed and maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. The site is open to visitors all year round, usually subject to an entrance fee for non-members, but on occasion the entry fee is waived during the organisation&#x27;s &quot;Doors open days&quot;. In summer the adjacent 15th-century parish church of St Michael is open for visitors, allowing a combined visit to two of Scotland&#x27;s finest surviving medieval buildings. The site was visited by 103,312 people in 2019.

For over 40 years, tours of the palace for children have been led by &#x27;Junior Guides&#x27;, pupils at Linlithgow Primary School.

A Strathspey for bagpipes was composed in honour of Linlithgow Palace.

The palace is said to be haunted by the spectre of Mary of Guise, mother to Mary, Queen of Scots.

===Artistic and cultural uses===

On 4 December 2012, the French fashion house Chanel held its tenth &quot;Métiers d’Art&quot; show in the palace. The collection, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, was called &#x27;Paris-Édimbourg&#x27; and inspired by classic Scottish styling using tweed and tartan fabrics worn by models Stella Tennant, Cara Delevingne, and Edie Campbell.

The show renewed media interest in the possibility of restoring the roof of the palace.

In August 2014, a music festival was held on the palace&#x27;s grounds called &#x27;Party at the Palace&#x27;. This became a yearly event and again took place in 2015; from 2016 it was moved to the other side of the loch due to its popularity and need for more space. The festival still boasts views of the palace.

Some scenes in the time-travelling romance TV series &quot;Outlander&quot; are set at a fictional castle for which Linlithgow Palace stands in; this has attracted a number of international tourists.

<doc id="359440" wikidata="Q1077142" url="?curid=359440" title="Chris Crawford (game designer)">
<text>Christopher Crawford (born June 1, 1950) is an American video game designer and writer. Hired by Alan Kay to work at Atari, Inc., he wrote the computer wargame &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot; for Atari 8-bit computers which was sold through the Atari Program Exchange and later Atari&#x27;s official product line. After leaving Atari, he wrote a string of games beginning with &quot;Balance of Power&quot; for Macintosh. Writing about the process of developing games, he became known among other creators in the nascent home computer game industry for his passionate advocacy of game design as an art form. He self-published &quot;The Journal of Computer Game Design&quot; and founded the Computer Game Developers Conference (later renamed to the Game Developers Conference).

In 1992, Crawford withdrew from commercial game development and began experimenting with ideas for a next generation interactive storytelling system. In 2018, Crawford announced that he had halted his work on interactive storytelling, concluding that it will take centuries for civilization to embrace the required concepts.

==Biography==
Crawford was born in 1950 in Houston, Texas. After receiving a Bachelor&#x27;s in physics from UC Davis in 1972 and a Master&#x27;s in physics from the University of Missouri in 1975, Crawford taught at a community college and the University of California.

Crawford first encountered computer games in Missouri, when he met someone attempting to computerize Avalon Hill&#x27;s &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. While teaching, he wrote an early version of &quot;Tanktics&quot; in Fortran for the IBM 1130 in 1976 as a hobby, then wrote &quot;Tanktics&quot; and an early version of &quot;Legionnaire&quot; for personal computers such as the KIM-1 and Commodore PET. In 1978, Crawford began selling the games and by 1979 &quot;made the startling discovery,&quot; he later said, &quot;that it is far more lucrative and enjoyable to teach for fun and program for money.&quot; He joined Atari that year, founding the Games Research Group under Alan Kay in 1982.

===1980s===
At Atari, Crawford started game work with &quot;Wizard&quot; for the Atari VCS, but Atari Marketing decided not to publish this work. He then turned his attention to the new Atari Home Computer System. His first releases on this platform were &quot;Energy Czar&quot; and &quot;Scram&quot;, both of which were written in Atari BASIC and published by Atari.

He experimented with Atari 8-bit&#x27;s hardware-assisted smooth scrolling and used it to produce a scrolling map display. This work led to &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot;, which is widely considered one of the first wargames on a microcomputer to compete with traditional paper-n-pencil games in terms of depth. &quot;Eastern Front&quot; was initially published through the Atari Program Exchange, which was intended for user-written software. It was later moved to Atari&#x27;s official product line. He followed this with &quot;Legionnaire&quot;, based on the same display engine but adding real-time instead of turn-based game play.

Using the knowledge gathered while writing these games, he helped produce technical documentation covering the custom hardware of the Atari 8-bit computers, from the hardware-assisted smooth scrolling to digitized sounds, with the information presented in a friendly format for a wide audience. This included videos distributed by ACE (Atari Computer Enthusiast) Support to user groups, and a series of articles published in &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine containing most of the content of the book, &quot;De Re Atari&quot; that would be published later by the Atari Program Exchange.

By 1983, &quot;BYTE&quot; called Crawford &quot;easily the most innovative and talented person working on the Atari 400/800 computer today&quot;, and his name was well enough known that Avalon Hill&#x27;s advertising for a revised version of &quot;Legionnaire&quot; mentioned Crawford as author. Laid off in 1984, in the collapse of Atari during the video game crash of 1983, Crawford went freelance and produced &quot;Balance of Power&quot; for the Macintosh in 1985, which was a best-seller, reaching 250,000 units sold.

Crawford wrote a non-fiction book published by McGraw Hill in 1984: &quot;The Art of Computer Game Design&quot;

===Game Developers Conference===
The Game Developers Conference, which in 2013 drew over 23,000 attendees, was conceived of in 1987. The first gathering was held in 1988 as salon in Crawford&#x27;s living room with roughly 27 game design friends and associates. The gathering&#x27;s original name, the Computer Game Developers Conference, would remain into the 1990s until the word &quot;Computer&quot; was dropped. While the GDC has become a prominent event in the gaming industry, Crawford was eventually ousted from the GDC board, and made his final official appearance at the gathering in 1994. He eventually returned to the conference, giving lectures in both 2001 and 2006.

===Withdrawal from game industry===
Crawford acknowledged that his views on computer game design were unusual and controversial. In a 1986 interview with &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; he stated that he began writing software as a hobby that became a job with the goal of writing the best possible game. Crawford said that by 1982, his goal was to pursue computer games as an art form. While denouncing hack and slash games (&quot;just straight run, kill or be killed&quot;), text adventures (&quot;about as interesting as a refrigerator light&quot;), and the Commodore 64 and Apple II (&quot;so gutless. I don&#x27;t feel I can do an interesting game on them&quot;), he stated that Danielle Bunten Berry, Jon Freeman and Anne Westfall, and himself were the only designers who had proven that they could develop more than one great game.

Crawford admitted that some critics called his games inaccessible:

At the 1992 CGDC, Chris Crawford gave &quot;The Dragon Speech&quot;, which he considers &quot;the finest speech of [his] life&quot;. Throughout the speech, he used a dragon as a metaphor for video games as a medium of artistic expression. He declared that he and the video game industry were working &quot;at cross purposes&quot;, with the industry focusing heavily on &quot;depth&quot;, when Crawford wanted more &quot;breadth&quot;: to explore new horizons rather than merely furthering what has already been explored. He arrived at the conclusion that he must leave the gaming industry in order to pursue this dream. He declared that he knew that this idea was insane, but he compared this &quot;insanity&quot; to that of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;:

At the end of the speech, Crawford confronts the dragon:

Crawford then charged down the lecture hall and out the door.

===Storyworlds===
After his &quot;Dragon&quot; speech, at GDC 1993, and his apparent exit from the gaming industry, Crawford did appear at GDC the following year but had not abandoned his unconventional views on game design. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote after the 1993 conference that Crawford &quot;has opted to focus upon a narrow niche of interactive art lovers rather than continuing to reach as many gamers as possible&quot;. He served as editor of &quot;Interactive Entertainment Design&quot;, a monthly collection of essays written for game designers.

Since then, Crawford has been working on &quot;Storytron&quot; (originally known as &quot;Erasmatron&quot;), an engine for running interactive electronic storyworlds. , a beta version of the Storytronics authoring tool, Swat, has been released. The system was officially launched March 23, 2009, with Crawford&#x27;s storyworld sequel to &quot;Balance of Power&quot;. As of December 1, 2012, the project has been in a &quot;medically induced coma.&quot; In August 2013 Crawford released source code of several of his games from his career to the public, fulfilling a 2011 given promise, among them &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot; and &quot;Balance of Power&quot;.

==People games==
&quot;People games&quot;, as termed by Crawford, are games where the goals are of a social nature and focus on interactions with well-defined characters. They are described in &quot;Chris Crawford on Game Design&quot; as well as in his &quot;The Dragon Speech&quot;, as follows:

<doc id="359443" wikidata="Q810799" url="?curid=359443" title="Bathos">
<text>Bathos ( ; ,  &quot;depth&quot;) is a literary term, first used in this sense in Alexander Pope&#x27;s 1727 essay &quot;Peri Bathous&quot;, to describe an amusingly failed attempt at presenting artistic greatness. &quot;Bathos&quot; has come to refer to rhetorical anticlimax, an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one, occurring either accidentally (through artistic ineptitude) or intentionally (for comic effect). Intentional bathos appear in satirical genres such as burlesque and mock epic. &quot;Bathos&quot; or &quot;bathetic&quot; is also used for similar effects in other branches of the arts, such as musical passages marked &quot;ridicolosamente&quot;. In film, bathos may appear in a contrast cut intended for comic relief or be produced by an accidental jump cut.

== Alexander Pope&#x27;s definition ==

=== &quot;The Art of Sinking in Poetry&quot; ===

As a term for the combination of the very high with the very low, &quot;bathos&quot; was introduced by Alexander Pope in his essay &quot;Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry&quot; (1727). On the one hand, Pope&#x27;s work is a parody in prose of Longinus&#x27;s &quot;Peri Hupsous&quot; (&quot;On the Sublime&quot;), in that he imitates Longinus&#x27;s system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the &quot;dunces.&quot;

The nearest model for Pope&#x27;s essay is the &quot;Treatise of the Sublime&quot; by Boileau of 1712. Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope&#x27;s literary adversaries, Leonard Welsted, had issued a &quot;translation&quot; of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau. Because Welsted and Pope&#x27;s other foes were championing this &quot;sublime&quot;, Pope commented upon and countered their system with his &quot;Peri Bathos&quot; in the Swift-Pope-Gay-Arbuthnot &quot;Miscellanies.&quot; Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;, Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might &quot;sink&quot; in poetry, satirizing the very men who were allied with Ambrose Philips. Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Odes,&quot; and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. Edmund Burke was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope&#x27;s articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke&#x27;s essay &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; (1756).

One example of Pope&#x27;s style and satire is in his description of sinking in painting. In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial genres, still life ranked the lowest. However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word &quot;stiffen&quot;, evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this &quot;low&quot; genre:

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the tropes and figures of speech.

Although Pope&#x27;s manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to &quot;sink&quot;, the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things. First, it violates &quot;decorum&quot;, or the fittingness of the subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope&#x27;s day, the term &quot;bathos&quot;, perhaps because of confusion with &quot;pathos&quot;, has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so &quot;pathetic&quot; as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of surreal humour and the absurd. However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of kitsch (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of DaVinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot; on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters) express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naïve, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the camp sensibility, as first analyzed by Susan Sontag, in a 1964 essay &quot;Notes on camp&quot;.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one &quot;Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
Several decades before Pope coined the term, John Dryden had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his Restoration spectacular, &quot;Albion and Albanius&quot; (1684–85):
Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot;, where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover &quot;or lapdog&quot;. Søren Kierkegaard, in &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot;, did the same thing, when he suggested that the &quot;self&quot; is easy to lose and that the loss of &quot;an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife&quot; would be more grievous. When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of &quot;undercutting.&quot; When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

In 1764, William Hogarth published his last engraving, &quot;The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures&quot;, depicting Father Time lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, parodying the fashion at that time for &quot;&quot; works of art, and satirising criticisms made of Hogarth&#x27;s own works. It may also be seen as a &quot;vanitas&quot; or &quot;memento mori&quot;, foreshadowing Hogarth&#x27;s death six months later. Headed &quot;Tail Piece&quot;, was intended as the tailpiece for a bound edition of Hogarth&#x27;s engravings.

* A few clubs from outside New York (Manhattan) play their first matches in the fall. One from Brooklyn is the Atlantic Base Ball Club or simply &quot;Atlantic&quot;, soon to be the first recurring winner or &quot;dynasty&quot;.

==Boxing==
Events

* 25 February — William Poole is shot dead in New York by supporters of John Morrissey.
* 26 June — Paddock keeps up the pressure on Broome by winning a return bout with Aaron Jones in 61 rounds at Mildenhall.

==Cricket==
Events
* 30 April — Bramall Lane stadium in Sheffield opens as a cricket ground and stages a match between two local teams. It is first used by Sheffield Cricket Club (&quot;aka&quot; Yorkshire) in August for a first-class match against Sussex.
England

<text>Aurore Clément (; born 12 October 1945) is a French actress who has appeared in French and English language movies and television productions.

==Early life==
She was born Marie-Thérèse Aurore Louise Clément in Soissons. Following the death of her father while she was still a young girl, she worked to support her family. For a time, she modeled in Paris. Since her appearance in Louis Malle&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Lacombe Lucien&quot;, she has been cast in many roles in over five decades. 

==Career==
Clément has appeared in more than 80 films and is most often remembered as the character Anne in the film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984), which won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival.

Her first appearance in a U.S. movie was in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), but her scenes—a long sequence involving French former colonists—were eventually cut from the film and restored in 2001 in the &quot;Redux&quot; version.

In France, Clément made her stage debut in 1988 with &quot;The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs&quot;, adapted from George Moore&#x27;s short story, and won an acting prize from The French Association of Theatre critics. She has been in several plays, including &quot;Les Eaux et Forêts&quot; and &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Molière Awards (the equivalent of the American Tonys).

==Personal life==
Clément has been married since 1986 to Dean Tavoularis, a movie production designer.

<doc id="359464" wikidata="Q1252469" url="?curid=359464" title="Douglas Reeman">
<text>Douglas Edward Reeman (15 October 1924 – 23 January 2017), who also used the pseudonym Alexander Kent, was a British author who wrote many historical novels about the Royal Navy, mainly set during either World War II or the Napoleonic Wars. He wrote a total of 68 novels, selling 34 million copies in twenty languages.

==Biography==
Reeman was born in Thames Ditton, Surrey, son of Charles &quot;Percy&quot; and Ada Reeman.

At the beginning of the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy&#x27;s boys&#x27; training establishment HMS &quot;Ganges&quot;. In 1940 Reeman was appointed Midshipman, at the age of 16. His initial service was in destroyers on convoy duty in the North Atlantic. During this time his ship was sunk and Reeman was injured by exploding depth charges. Later he transferred to Motor Torpedo Boats and was present subsequently at D-Day in a landing craft. It was then that he was injured badly when his landing craft was hit by shellfire. He finished the war in Kiel repairing damage to make the port usable again, with the rank of Lieutenant.

After the war, Reeman joined the Metropolitan Police, serving as a beat officer and later in the Criminal investigation department. At the beginning of the Korean War he rejoined the Navy. At the end of the war he joined London County Council as a child welfare officer, but remained a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve.

==Novels==
Reeman&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;A Prayer for the Ship&quot;, was published in 1958. Reeman is most famous for his series of Napoleonic naval stories, the main character of which is Richard Bolitho, and, later, his nephew, Adam Bolitho. Reeman also wrote a series of novels about several generations of the fictional Blackwood family who served in the Royal Marines from the 1850s to the 1980s, and a non-fiction account of his own Second World War experiences, &quot;D-Day: A Personal Reminiscence&quot; (1984). He used the pseudonym Alexander Kent (the real name of a friend and naval officer who died during the Second World War) for his Bolitho novels and his real name for his other novels and non-fiction.

==Teacher and advisor==
In addition to being an author, Reeman also taught navigation for yachting and served as a technical advisor for movies.

==Personal life==
Reeman was married twice; first to Winifred Melville, and later, after he was widowed, to Canadian author Kimberley Jordan in 1985.

<doc id="359466" wikidata="Q569237" url="?curid=359466" title="Huilliche people">
<text>The Huilliche (), Huiliche or Huilliche-Mapuche are the southern partiality of the Mapuche macroethnic group in Chile and Argentina. Located in the Zona Sur, they inhabit both Futahuillimapu (&quot;great land of the south&quot;) and, as the Cunco or Veliche subgroup, the northern half of Chiloé Island. The Huilliche are the principal indigenous people of those regions. According to Ricardo E. Latcham the term Huilliche started to be used in Spanish after the second founding of Valdivia in 1645, adopting the usage of the Mapuches of Araucanía for the southern Mapuche tribes. Huilliche means &#x27;southerners&#x27; (Mapudungun &quot;willi&quot; &#x27;south&#x27; and &quot;che&quot; &#x27;people&#x27;.) A genetic study showed significant affinities between Huilliches and indigenous peoples east of the Andes, which suggests but does not prove a partial origin in present-day Argentina.

During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the mainland Huilliche were generally successful at resisting Spanish encroachment. However, after the Figueroa incursion of 1792 Huilliches were decisively defeated and their territory was gradually opened to European settlement beginning with the Parliament of Las Canoas. Today, most Huilliche speak Spanish, but some, especially older adults, speak the Huilliche language. &quot;Laurelia sempervirens&quot;, known in Huilliche &quot;triwe&quot; and in Spanish as &quot;laurel&quot;, is the ritual tree of the Huilliche of Futahuillimapu.

The main modern areas of Huilliche settlement are two; San Juan de la Costa west of Osorno and Compu-Chadmo in the southeast of Chiloé Island.

The mythological cosmologies of the Huilliche has many parallels in the indigenous religions of the Central Andes including the Inca religion.

==Colonization==
===16th century===
In the 1540s Spanish conquereros led by Pedro de Valdivia arrived in Central Chile from newly conquered Peru. Between 1549 and 1553 the Spanish founded several cities in Mapuche territory and one in Huilliche territory: Valdivia. Albeit the death of Pedro de Valdivia in 1553 halted the Spanish conquests for a while Osorno and Castro were established in Huilliche territory in 1558 and 1567 respectively. The Spanish defeat by Mapuches in the battle of Curalaba in 1598 triggered a general uprising that led to the destruction of all Spanish cities in Huilliche territory except Castro.

===17th century===

The portion of Futahuillimapu south of Maipué River became largely depopulated following a period of pillaging by the Spanish and loyalist Huilliches that had relocated from Osorno to the forts of Carelmapu and Calbuco. After Valdivia was refounded in 1645, the Spanish struggled to establish a land route to the vicinities of Chiloé Archipelago across independent Huilliche territory.

There are reports in the 17th and 18th centuries of internal conflicts among the Huilliche. This may have stunted population growth.

===18th century===

In late 18th century Basque navigator José de Moraleda wrote that Huilliches of Osorno were more stocky, agile and of general better appearance than the people of Chiloé. Their ponchos were described by Moraleds as less pleasing (&quot;vistosos&quot;) than those of Chiloé.

A new battle took place between Spanish and Huilliche forces in 1759 near the shores of río Bueno. The outcome of the battle has been subject ot different interpretations. The battle of 1759 was an exception to the overall policy of befriending indigenous communities on behalf of the Spanish authorities in Valdivia.

In 1792 the Huilliches were ravaged by a Spanish army led by Tomás de Figueroa. A peace parliament and treaty was signed in 1793. In the treaty Huilliche property was recognized by the Spanish.

===19th century===
Sociedad Stuttgart, a society established in the 19th century to bring German settlers to Chile, purchased about 15 000 km2 under fraudulent conditions from Huilliches in the Precordillera east of Osorno. This purchase was later ratified by Chilean courts and serves to illustrate how Chilean authorities ignored their own legal order that guaranteed Huilliche property.

As result of the establishment of Chilean and European settlers, including Germans, around Bueno River, Osorno Huilliches living in the Central Valley migrated to the coastal region of Osorno. In the 1920s, The economy of Osorno shifted towards cattle farming, with land ownership concentrated among the German immigrants, and many Huilliches became peasants of haciendas.

<text>Newman is a small El Paso neighborhood in far Northeast El Paso, located some 16 miles northeast of downtown El Paso around the intersection of Dyer Street and Edge of Texas Drive on the New Mexico state line, and still sometimes described as a separate community. In 1990, it had a population of approximately 60 people.

It was named for real estate developer Henry L. Newman, who earlier tried to develop Newman, New Mexico, just to the north across the New Mexico border, without much success. He fared only moderately better in Texas. In 1930, the United States Census listed Newman as having a population of 10 people.

Newman had a post office from 1922 to 1971.

<doc id="359491" wikidata="Q7886380" url="?curid=359491" title="Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier">
<text>Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier are animated cartoon characters in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. Spike is a burly, gray bulldog wearing a red sweater, a brown bowler hat, and a perpetual scowl. Chester is a Jack Russell terrier who is just the opposite, small and jumpy with yellow fur and brown, perky ears.

==History==
The characters starred in only two shorts, both directed by animator Friz Freleng. The first of these films was &quot;Tree for Two&quot; (1952). In it, Chester tells his idol Spike that he knows of a cat that they can beat up. The cat is Freleng&#x27;s own Sylvester, but every time Spike thinks he has the cat cornered, a runaway zoo black panther appears in Sylvester&#x27;s place, thrashing the dog instead. When Chester decides to have a go of it, however, Sylvester finds himself at the little dog&#x27;s mercy. By the cartoon&#x27;s end, Spike and Chester have switched roles; Spike is the fawning sycophant, and Chester the smug prizefighter.

The characters&#x27; second outing was in the short film &quot;Dr. Jerkyl&#x27;s Hide&quot; (1954). Spike (here called &quot;Alfie&quot; and with an English accent) is once again after Sylvester, only this time it is Sylvester himself who pummels the poor pooch, thanks to a potion that transforms him into a feline monster. Chester, of course, never sees this transformed Sylvester, thinking his buddy is being beaten by the tiny tomcat. The final loss of face for Alfie is his being thrashed by a fly that has also been affected by the potion, as it occurs in front of Chester&#x27;s eyes.

==Later appearances==
* They appear in &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; as part of the characters that visit the wishing well, where Spike wishes that Chester be as brave as him, after it happening the events of &quot;Tree for Two&quot;.
* Spike and Chester appear in the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996). They are seen as a pair of paramedics during the basketball game, who take Stan Podolak away after he was flattened by the Monstars.
* Spike appears in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;The Jailbird and Jailbunny&quot;. He is seen during the &quot;Blow My Stack&quot; song as a member of Yosemite Sam&#x27;s anger management group.
* A live action version of Spike and Chester appeared in a 1988 commercial for Kibbles &#x27;n Bits.
* Chester appears in the &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; episode &quot;Game Time&quot;.

<doc id="359492" wikidata="Q920131" url="?curid=359492" title="Sea Power">
<text>Sea Power, previously known as British Sea Power and initially as British Air Powers, are an English alternative rock band. The group&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Jan Scott Wilkinson, known as Yan; Martin Noble, known as Noble; and Alison Cotton. By the time the band had begun its recording career, Cotton had departed, and two new members had joined: Neil Hamilton Wilkinson, known as Hamilton, and Matthew Wood, known as Woody. Eamon Hamilton joined the band in autumn 2002. He left in 2006 and was replaced by Phil Sumner, with Abi Fry joining the band in 2008.

The wide-ranging nature of the band&#x27;s material has led critics to liken their sound to a variety of groups, from The Cure and Joy Division to Pixies and Arcade Fire. 

==History==
===Early years and &quot;The Decline of British Sea Power&quot; (1995-2003)===
British Sea Power&#x27;s Yan and (Neil) Hamilton are brothers and were school friends with Wood near Natland in Kendal, Cumbria. They were in a number of bands together while at school, but after finishing his exams Yan moved to study at the University of Reading, where he met guitarist Noble, who was originally from Bury, Greater Manchester.

In 1995, Yan and Noble were looking to start a band together; they recruited fellow student Alison Cotton via advertisements on the university&#x27;s notice board, and the trio began performing together, initially under the name British Air Powers. (Neil) Hamilton and Wood moved to Reading and joined the group shortly thereafter. Cotton was &quot;headhunted&quot; by Adam Cresswell and Mike Smoughton of local band Saloon in the late 90s, and left British Air Powers before they began their recording career.

The group played gigs and produced a four-track demo in Reading as British Air Powers, before relocating to Brighton in search of a more active music scene. &quot;British Sea Power&quot; was actually the name of one of these demo tracks, and was eventually reworked as &quot;Carrion&quot;. In Brighton, BSP amassed a strong local following, due mainly to their own club night called &quot;Club Sea Power&quot; which was hosted at the Freebutt and Lift clubs. The club nights featured many support acts, including the Copper Family, a 200-year-old Sussex folk troupe and other forms of entertainment such as a 1940s fashion show.

Their first single, &quot;Fear of Drowning&quot;, was issued in limited numbers on their own Golden Chariot label. The artwork for the B side, &quot;A Wooden Horse&quot;, borrows heavily from the dust cover of the 1950 book &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; that details the escape of Allied POWs during World War II. Geoff Travis of Rough Trade Records, impressed by seeing the band live, signed them to his label in September 2001. Originally a four-piece, Eamon Hamilton was recruited to play keyboards and bass drum in autumn 2002.

&quot;The Decline of British Sea Power&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album, was released in June 2003 to critical acclaim. A single from the album, &quot;Carrion&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 single. The album charted in the lower reaches of the UK Album Chart.

===&quot;Open Season&quot; (2004–2006)===
The follow-up, &quot;Open Season&quot;, was released in early April 2005, and also enjoyed wide critical praise. It showcased a more accessible, produced sound and charted at No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. The lead single, &quot;It Ended on an Oily Stage&quot;, charted at No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart a week earlier.

British Sea Power had won the 2004 &quot;Time Out&quot; Live Band of the Year award and by this time had built a reputation for elaborate and well-thought out live shows. Stages were often decorated with foliage and plastic birds and shows would generally finish with a semi-improvised song called &quot;Rock in A&quot;, which sometimes lasted for over 20 minutes. Various members would climb riggings and tear down the foliage, while Eamon would walk around the audience beating his marching drum. The encore would sometimes see an eight-foot bear, Ursine Ultra, join in the performance.

The stage antics have become one of the signatures of the band. Another is their choice of venues. Their tours have often included unusual locations such as the Scillonian Club on the Isles of Scilly, Grasmere Village Hall, the Czech Embassy in London and Carnglaze Caverns in Cornwall. They have also played in museums, libraries and sea forts.

The band has built up an eccentric image in interviews and press releases. This has included giving journalists grid references at which to meet them, and expressing obsessions with Field Marshal Montgomery and bird watching. Similarly, they appeared on the TV show &quot;Countryfile&quot; in which they discussed their love of the countryside and played an outdoor performance of the track &quot;Canvey Island&quot;.

At the beginning of 2006, it was announced that Eamon had left British Sea Power to concentrate on his own band Brakes.

===&quot;Do You Like Rock Music?&quot; and &quot;Man of Aran&quot; (2007–2009)===
In October 2007, the band toured east coast USA, showcasing their new 5-track EP &quot;Krankenhaus?&quot;. Their November 2007 tour included a seaside café in Saltdean (East Sussex, England) a River Mersey ferry (Liverpool, England), All Saints&#x27; Church (Newcastle upon Tyne, England) and White Mischief&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; indoor bands/vaudeville festival. Their &quot;Krankenhaus?&quot; EP was released digitally in October 2007 and on CD and vinyl on 20 November.

In 2008, violist Abi Fry toured with the band (later becoming a permanent member). On 14 January 2008, third-album &quot;Do You Like Rock Music?&quot; was released in the UK (12 February 2008 in the USA) and was a UK Top 10 success. Later that January, keyboard/cornet player Phil Sumner was admitted to hospital in Leeds (after being knocked unconscious attempting to stage dive from a 12-foot PA system), in spite of which he returned to the stage the following day. Prior to their &quot;Do You Like Rock Music?&quot; tour (of Ireland, UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and USA), Wood injured his back and was temporarily replaced by Thomas White of Electric Soft Parade and Brakes.
In February 2008, the band appeared on &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot;, playing &quot;Waving Flags&quot;, &quot;Canvey Island&quot; and &quot;No Lucifer&quot;. They were accompanied by members of the London Bulgarian Choir and a display of Cumbrian wrestling.

The band also played an intimate concert at The Monico Hotel in Canvey Island as a nod to the 5th track on their new album. Prior to the gig, the band took part in a training session at Canvey Island Football Club. They were joined on stage for their encore by Wilko Johnson, formerly of Canvey pub rock band Dr. Feelgood. The performance was featured on BBC2&#x27;s The Culture Show.

The band played &quot;No Lucifer&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on 12 March 2008 and had a concert filmed for the Canadian music series &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;. 
During Summer 2008, the band played at Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, T in the Park and Bestival, amongst other festivals.

On 22 July 2008, &quot;Do You Like Rock Music?&quot; was announced as one of the nominees for the 2008 Mercury Prize. To coincide with the nomination British Sea Power re-released their song &quot;Waving Flags&quot; on 8 September 2008, which they also performed at the award ceremony the following day.

In August 2008, the band hosted their own music festival, Sing Ye From The Hillsides!, at the Tan Hill Inn, the UK&#x27;s highest pub. A second festival was held at the same location in May 2010.

On 23 January 2009, the band announced that they were recording a soundtrack to the documentary &quot;Man of Aran&quot;. They performed it in concert at the British Film Institute in April, and a CD/DVD was released in May. On 7 February 2009, they released a new 10-minute track, &quot;The possibility of an island&quot;, on Myspace.

Their live performances in the summer of 2009 included a show at Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in London.

===&quot;Valhalla Dancehall&quot; (2010–2011)===
The band headlined the Festival Republic Stage at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals, on 29 and 28 August respectively. They supported the Manic Street Preachers on their autumn 2010 tour of Britain.
The band released a &#x27;Maxi EP&#x27; &quot;Zeus&quot;, in October 2010, featuring songs recorded during the sessions for the forthcoming album.

The album &quot;Valhalla Dancehall&quot;, recorded on the isle of Skye in Scotland and at a farmhouse in East Sussex, was released in January 2011. Initial copies of the album sold by some independent music stores in the UK were accompanied with a bonus EP, &quot;Valhalla V.I.P.&quot;. The band toured the UK in the first three months of 2011, and a tour of the United States was planned for March, including an appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on 21 March.

To mark the ten-year anniversary of their first single, &quot;Fear of Drowning&quot;, the band played three intimate shows at Berwick Village Hall in East Sussex in May 2011.

British Sea Power announced a number of forthcoming festival appearances for summer 2011, including Latitude Festival, Leefest, Get Loaded In The Park and the Port Eliot Festival. In addition, the band performed at Jodrell Bank Live at Jodrell Bank Observatory, with The Flaming Lips, in July 2011. They also performed at festivals in Australia, China and Japan.

September 2011 saw the publication on Rough Trade Books of &quot;Do It for Your Mum&quot; by Roy Wilkinson (brother of Yan and Hamilton), an account of the author&#x27;s experiences of managing the band and of how the family&#x27;s octogenarian father became the group&#x27;s most ardent fan, apart from Richard Mills.

===&quot;Machineries of Joy&quot; and film scores (2012–2013)===
In 2012 they announced that they would not be extensively touring, but would be playing at their own monthly club night, &quot;Krankenhaus&quot;, in Brighton. The band were also commissioned to make a soundtrack for the 1999 documentary &quot;Out of the Present&quot;, which follows Sergei Krikalev&#x27;s time on the space station Mir. It was screened at CERN in March 2012 as part of the Cineglobe International Film Festival. The band took a novel approach to the creation of their 2013 album &quot;Machineries of Joy&quot;. During the first half of 2012, the band wrote and recorded new songs each month, which they released as limited edition EPs, coinciding with their &quot;Krankenhaus&quot; club nights. A selection of tracks from the six EPs were re-recorded later in the year, and the final album was released on 1 April 2013.

British Sea Power recorded the soundtrack for the film &quot;From the Sea to the Land Beyond: Britain&#x27;s Coast on Film&quot;, with the main track being a version of &quot;The Land Beyond&quot; played at both the beginning and end of the film. The film is made up of archive footage taken during the 20th century and featuring aspects of British coastal life, montaged together. The film premiered at the Sheffield Doc/Fest in June 2012, with the band performing live at the screening. They also performed live at an initial screening of the film at Brighton&#x27;s Cine-City film festival. The film was shown on BBC Four television in 2012 (and has since been repeated in 2013 and 2016), as part of their &quot;Storyville&quot; series strand. A first DVD of the film was released in January 2013, but it was later re-released together with the soundtrack album in December 2013.

The group made the soundtrack for the 2014 documentary film &quot;Happiness&quot;. They released the soundtrack as an album later in the year.

===&quot;Sea of Brass&quot; and debut album anniversary (2014–2015)===
In late 2014 British Sea Power performed a series of concerts around the UK accompanied by different brass bands, going under the moniker &quot;Sea of Brass&quot;. Following the concerts, an album was released in 2015, also entitled &quot;Sea of Brass&quot;.
(The band had previous experience playing with a brass band, having performed &quot;Waving Flags&quot; with Brighton and Hove City Brass at several of their Krankenhaus club nights in 2012.)

In mid-2015, the 12th anniversary of &quot;The Decline of British Sea Power&quot; was celebrated with concerts in Brighton, Manchester and London at which the full album was played. Eamon Hamilton returned for these shows. At around the same time, the album was reissued in various formats, along with bonus discs, on the band&#x27;s Golden Chariot label.

===&quot;Let the Dancers Inherit the Party&quot; and &quot;Disco Elysium&quot; (2016–2021)===
In late 2016 the band instituted a crowd-funded project to finance the recording of their next studio album, &quot;Let The Dancers Inherit The Party&quot;, which was released on 31 March 2017. The band also played at Glastonbury Festival 2017.

In 2019, the band composed the score for the role-playing video game &quot;Disco Elysium&quot;. At the 16th BAFTA Game Awards, in early April 2020, they received the award for Best Music for their work on &quot;Disco Elysium&quot;.

The band organised the first edition of their own festival, Krankenhaus Festival, held at Muncaster Castle, Cumbria in August 2019.

===Name change and &quot;Everything Was Forever&quot; (2021–present)===

On Monday 9 August 2021, the band announced that they would henceforth be known as Sea Power due to &quot;a rise in a certain kind of nationalism in this world – an isolationist, antagonistic nationalism that [they] don&#x27;t want to run any risk of being confused with&quot;, and that their new album, &quot;Everything Was Forever&quot;, would be released in February 2022. The album peaked at number 4 in the UK Album Chart.

2022 saw the return of Krankenhaus Festival, and it has been organised annually since then. It won &quot;BBC 6 Music listeners&#x27; Best Festival of the Year&quot; following the 2023 edition.

In June 2023 it was announced that Matthew Wood had retired from the band, and that Thomas White would play drums at upcoming live shows.

<text>Alexander Alexandrovich Kotov (Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Ко́тов; ( – 8 January 1981) was a Soviet chess grandmaster and author. He was a Soviet chess champion, a two-time world title Candidate, and a prolific writer on the subject of chess. Kotov served in high posts in the Soviet Chess Federation, and wrote most of his books during the Cold War. The importance and breadth of Kotov&#x27;s work rank him among the all-time greats in this field.

==Early life==
Kotov was born in Tula, which was part of the Russian Empire, to a large working class family. He moved to Moscow in 1939 to study engineering, and during this time studied chess a great deal.

==Chess career==
While best remembered today as an author, Kotov also had a number of good results as a player. One of his best early results was his second-place finish in the 1939 USSR Championship, in which he just missed out to Mikhail Botvinnik in the final round. This result won him the Soviet Grandmaster title, the third Soviet player to hold the title after Botvinnik and Grigory Levenfish. Kotov was Moscow champion in 1941. He won the Soviet title jointly with David Bronstein in 1948, and won at Venice in 1950, ahead of Vasily Smyslov.

The first ever Candidates Tournament of 1950—which determined who would challenge the World Champion (then, Botvinnik)—was held in Budapest. Kotov scored 8½/18. He had qualified for the event by finishing fourth in the 1948 Interzonal Tournament in Stockholm, scoring 11½/19. He was granted the title of International Grandmaster in 1950 (inauguration year) by the World Chess Federation, and held posts in the Soviet Chess Federation at the time.

What was perhaps Kotov&#x27;s best result came at the 1952 Saltsjöbaden Interzonal, which he won with a score of 16½/20, three clear points ahead of Tigran Petrosian and Mark Taimanov in second place, and without losing a game. In the next Candidates Tournament in Zürich, he scored 14/28, and was the only person to win a game against the tournament&#x27;s winner, Smyslov.

Kotov played for the USSR at the Chess Olympiads of 1952 and 1954, contributing to team gold medal victories. He was the second reserve board both times; at Helsinki 1952 he scored 2/3, while at Amsterdam 1954, he made 4/6. After 1960, all the tournaments in which he competed took place outside the USSR. They included a shared first place with Svetozar Gligorić at Hastings in 1962, half a point ahead of Smyslov. Kotov played in very few tournaments in his later years.

==Writings==
Kotov frequently praised the Soviet political system in his books. For example, the 1958 book &quot;The Soviet School of Chess&quot; (co-written with Mikhail Yudovich) stated that &quot;The rise of the Soviet school to the summit of world chess is a logical result of socialist cultural development.&quot; At the time, statements such as this were so controversial that Western publishers felt compelled to include disclaimers in translations of his books for English-speaking markets. Dover Publications&#x27; 1961 paperback version of &quot;The Soviet School of Chess&quot; was distributed primarily to Western countries, and included an introduction that read, in part:Literature of this type, though helpful in our ultimate understanding of the game, is very often riddled with distortion. The publishers of this Dover edition are very much concerned that readers be aware of the propaganda techniques employed, even in the history of chess, by the Soviet Union.Kotov was even described as a KGB agent by Fedir Bohatyrchuk, in his 1978 book &quot;My Way to General Vlasov&quot;.

Notwithstanding Kotov&#x27;s forays into the political realm, his books were insightful and informative and were written in a congenial style. He often made his points by citing first-hand stories of incidents involving famous grandmasters, most of whom he knew personally. In addition, he did not hesitate to be self-deprecating if he could make a point more vividly. &quot;Think Like a Grandmaster&quot; illustrates several situations where his opponents got the better of him; in one case, his catastrophic blunder converted a certain win into an instant loss. Such entertaining and enlightening personal accounts helped to ensure that his books remained popular among chess players of widely varying nationalities and playing strengths.

Kotov was a great admirer of World Champion Alexander Alekhine, and wrote a comprehensive two-volume biographical series of books on his life and career titled &quot;Shakhmatnoe Nasledie A.A. Alekhina&quot;, which were published between 1953 and 1958 and translated into Czech, German, Serbian and Spanish. The work significantly contributed to Alekhine&#x27;s rehabilitation in the Soviet Union.

His trilogy of books &quot;Think Like a Grandmaster&quot;, &quot;Play Like a Grandmaster&quot;, and &quot;Train Like a Grandmaster&quot; are his best known, with &quot;Think Like a Grandmaster&quot;, which was translated from the Russian by Bernard Cafferty and published by Batsford in 1971, being particularly famous. The book is not concerned with advising where pieces should be placed on the board, or tactical motifs, but rather with the method of thinking that should be employed during a game. Kotov&#x27;s advice to identify candidate moves and methodically examine them to build up an &quot;analysis tree&quot; remains well known today.

Kotov contributed to the Yugoslav series &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;), which began in 1974, and to the associated games book series &quot;Chess Informant&quot; as an analyst.

===&quot;Kotov syndrome&quot;===
In Kotov&#x27;s 1971 book &quot;Think Like a Grandmaster&quot;, he described a situation when a player thinks very hard for a long time in a complicated position but does not find a clear path, then, running low on time, quickly makes a poor move, often a blunder.

==Playing style==
Kotov developed a sharp style, was definitely not afraid of complications on the chessboard, and willingly entered into them against even the greatest of opponents. He favoured the closed openings with White, and was very successful with the Sicilian Defence as Black.

==Notable games==
* Kotov vs. Alexander Tolush, Leningrad Championship 1938, Neo-Grünfeld Defence (D76), . Tolush was a dangerous attacker, but he is the one subdued here.
* Kotov vs. Tigran Petrosian, USSR Championship, Moscow 1949, Queen&#x27;s Gambit, Exchange Variation (D36), 1–0. Petrosian, later World Champion, loses a game he would never forget, falling into an opening trap and resigning in only 13 moves.
* Kotov vs. Paul Keres, Budapest Candidates Tournament 1950, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Saemisch Variation (E24), 1–0. Kotov was near the peak of his form, and dealt Keres a costly loss.
* Yuri Averbakh vs. Kotov, Zurich Candidates Tournament 1953, Old Indian Defence (A55), . Kotov&#x27;s most famous game is one of the all-time greats of sacrificial chess, as Black gives up his queen for long-term pressure which eventually leads to a mating finish. This game won the 1st Brilliancy Prize (Russian: Beauty Prize, in Bronstein&#x27;s book of the tournament) at Zurich, widely regarded as one of the very greatest chess tournaments ever held.

<text>Walsall Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Walsall, West Midlands, England. The team competes in , the fourth level of the English football league system. The club name is often abbreviated to Walsall.

The club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Saddlers&quot;, reflects Walsall&#x27;s status as a traditional centre for saddle manufacture. Walsall moved into their Bescot Stadium in 1990, having previously played at nearby Fellows Park for almost a century. The team play in a red and white kit and their club crest features a swift. They hold rivalries with nearby Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion, as well as farther away but more regularly contested rivalries with Shrewsbury Town and Port Vale.

The club was founded in 1888 as Walsall Town Swifts, an amalgamation of Walsall Town and Walsall Swifts. The club moved to the Football Alliance from the Midland Association the following year, before being invited to help found the Football League Second Division in 1892. They returned briefly to the Football League from 1896 to 1900, before spending two decades outside the Football League, primarily in the Birmingham &amp; District League.

Invited to help form the Football League Third Division North in 1921, Walsall remained in the third tier for 37 years. In 1958 they became a founder member of the Fourth Division, winning that Division in 1959–60, and securing promotion out of the Third Division the following season. At the end of the 1987-88 campaign, they won promotion into the Second Division for the first time, but were soon relegated back to the Fourth Division. Starting in 1998–99, they spent four of the next five seasons in the second tier. Two relegations in three years left them back in the fourth tier in 2006, but they secured an immediate promotion as 2006–07 League Two champions.

Their first match at Wembley Stadium came in the 2015 Football League Trophy Final, which they lost to Bristol City. In 2016 they missed out on promotion to the Championship by a single point, and lost the resulting playoff semi-final against Barnsley. The Saddlers ended an 11-year stay in League One with relegation in 2019.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1888–1939)===

Walsall were formed as Walsall Town Swifts F.C. in 1888 when Walsall Town F.C. and Walsall Swifts F.C. amalgamated. Walsall Town had been founded in 1874 as Walsall Football Club and Walsall Swifts in 1875 as Victoria Swifts.&lt;Birth of the Saddlers, Bradbury 2015&gt; Both clubs had played at the Chuckery, since April 1881 when Walsall Swifts had lost their old ground on Follyhouse Lane where they had played during 1877-1881 and the newly formed club remained at the same ground. Walsall Town Swifts&#x27; first match was a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa in the Birmingham Charity Cup final on 9 April 1888. A disagreement over the venue of the replay meant Aston Villa were awarded the trophy.

Later that year, Walsall Town Swifts played friendly matches against two founder members of the Football League; a strong Burnley side were beaten 1–0 and West Bromwich Albion were held to a 2–2 draw in front of 7,000 spectators at the Chuckery. Walsall&#x27;s first league campaign in the Midland Association started with a 2–2 draw at home to Crewe Alexandra on 22 September 1888. They went on to finish in 3rd place in the league.

The club were first admitted to the Football League in 1892, as founder members of the new Second Division. They moved to the West Bromwich Road ground in 1893 after complaints from local residents about them playing at the Chuckery. After finishing 14th out of 16 teams in 1894–95 the club failed to be re-elected to the Football League. At the start of the 1895 season the club once again moved grounds, this time to Fellows Park which remained the club&#x27;s home for over a century.

In 1896 the club changed their name back to simply Walsall F.C. and joined the Midland League. A year later, they returned to the Second Division. The team finished in 6th place in 1898–99 in a season that, to this day, proves to be their highest ever league finish. Despite this relative success, the club once again failed re-election two years later and dropped back into the Midland League. A move to the Birmingham League followed in 1903 and in 1910 the club were elected to the Southern League. With the expansion of the Football League after World War I, Walsall became a founding member of the Third Division North in 1921 and have remained a Football League side ever since.

Walsall&#x27;s highest &quot;home&quot; attendance was set in 1930, when they played in of front of 74,646 fans in a 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round. Although a home match for Walsall, the tie was played at their opponents&#x27; Villa Park ground to ensure as many people could watch the local &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; match as possible. It remains the highest attendance that Walsall have ever played in front of and was a record crowd for Villa Park at the time.

In the years from 1921 leading up to World War II Walsall&#x27;s success remained limited, with finishes of 3rd in 1922–23, 5th in 1932–33 and 4th in 1933–34 the closest the club came to achieving promotion. The decent results in the early 1930s were spearheaded by the emergence of one of Walsall&#x27;s greatest ever players, Gilbert Alsop, who scored a remarkable 169 goals between 1931 and 1935.

Alsop also inspired Walsall&#x27;s finest ever FA Cup result, scoring the opening goal in a 2–0 home win against Arsenal in 1933. Arsenal were regarded as the best team in the country at the time and went on to win the First Division that season and the two seasons following that. As such, the cup defeat to Third Division North side Walsall is still regarded as one of the greatest upsets in FA Cup history.

In the following season, 1934–35, Walsall continued their cup pedigree by reaching their first ever senior final in the Third Division North Cup. &quot;The Saddlers&quot; fell at the final hurdle, however, with a 2–0 defeat to Stockport County at Maine Road.

===Post-war era and first league title (1945–1980)===
1945–46 signalled the final season of local war-time competitions. Between January and May 1946 the Third Division South Cup was contested as a precursor for the return of full-time league football later that year. Walsall reached the final to face Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic at Stamford Bridge but, in a repeat of their previous final appearance in 1935, they lost the match 2–0.

The return of football following the war saw a spike in attendances for many clubs across the Football League and Walsall were no different. In the 1947–48 season a number of impressive turnouts at Fellows Park, including a season-best 20,383 for the visit of Notts County, saw the club record its highest average league attendance to date of 15,711. In the same season Walsall finished in 3rd place but once again missed out on promotion to the Second Division.

The early 1950s saw some of Walsall&#x27;s most troubling and dismal times in the Football League, as the club faced the re-election process four consecutive years. They finished bottom of the league in 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1953–54 and improved to only second bottom in 1954–55. The club, however, managed to retain its Football League status through this period, largely thanks to the high attendances at Fellows Park demonstrating a healthy desire for League football in Walsall.

In 1958, following a reorganisation of the Football League, Walsall became founder members of the Fourth Division — now holding the distinction of being founder members of the Second, Third and Fourth tiers. Under the management of Bill Moore, the club achieved successive promotions, scoring 102 goals on their way to winning the Fourth Division title in 1959–60 and finishing as Third Division runners-up in 1960–61. The league title in 1960 was the club&#x27;s first in their 72-year history.

In the club&#x27;s first season in the second tier of English football since the early 1900s a post-war record 14th-place finish was achieved. It was during this season that the club also recorded its record attendance, as 25,453 crammed into Fellows Park to see &quot;The Saddlers&quot; beat Newcastle United 1–0 in August 1961. However, after just two seasons in the Second Division, the club were relegated back to the Third Division in 1962–63. An unfortunate defeat to Charlton Athletic in a replayed final match of the season sealed Walsall&#x27;s relegation, as the London club leapfrogged them in the table to survive.

One of Walsall&#x27;s finest ever talents, Allan Clarke, made his breakthrough as a first team regular in the 1964–65 season. Aged just 18, he scored 23 league goals in 1964–65 and a further 23 goals in all competitions in 1965–66. He was sold to First Division Fulham for a then club record fee of £37,500 in March 1966 and went on to earn 19 caps for England and win a league title at Leeds United.

1970–71 saw the first league meeting between Walsall and their first opponents Aston Villa. The two clubs met in the Third Division with Walsall winning the home tie 3–0, thanks to two goals from Geoff Morris and a Colin Taylor penalty. The away tie at Villa Park later in the season ended goalless.

Ken Wheldon, a local businessman made good, took over the club in 1972 and brought some optimism of a brighter future. The following years were inconsistent but were buoyed by a few good cup results and the emergence of Alan Buckley, who signed for the club in 1973 and went on to become a prolific goalscorer for the club. Walsall remained in the Third Division until a further relegation to the Fourth Division in 1978–79.

It was Buckley who took on the role of player-manager for the re-build in the fourth tier. Once again &quot;The Saddlers&quot; rose from the ashes of adversity as they secured an immediate promotion. At one stage in 1979–80 Walsall recorded 21 consecutive matches without defeat, a record that still stands today. This saw the beginning of an era that became a hallmark for some of the most attractive football seen in Walsall as, under the guidance of Buckley, the side gradually established itself as promotion contenders in the Third Division.

===League Cup run, move to Bescot and the fourth tier (1980–1995)===

While consolidating in the Third Division in the early 1980s, off-the-pitch issues took prominence throughout the decade. The dilapidated state of the club&#x27;s Fellows Park home was becoming a problem and, in 1982, the intention to move in to groundshare Molineux with Wolverhampton Wanderers was announced by owner Ken Wheldon. The club&#x27;s fans&#x27; quickly protested against the idea, as the &quot;Save Walsall Action Group&quot; was formed, and it never came to pass.

The 1983–84 League Cup campaign was, arguably, Walsall&#x27;s finest hour. After victories over Blackpool, Barnsley and local rivals Shrewsbury Town, they defeated First Division club Arsenal 2–1 in the fourth round at Highbury. A 4–2 victory over Rotherham United in the quarter-final saw &quot;The Saddlers&quot; advance to the semi-final to face holders and reigning First Division champions, Liverpool. An incredible 2–2 draw at Anfield in the first leg had Walsall dreaming of an unlikely cup final and place in Europe, however, a second leg 2–0 defeat in front of 19,591 at Fellows Park saw Walsall lose the tie 4–2 on aggregate.

By 1986 further plans were announced to groundshare with one of the club&#x27;s local rivals. This time it was at Birmingham City&#x27;s St Andrew&#x27;s ground. The &quot;Save Walsall Action Group&quot; was again pressed into action and, after peaceful protests and the support of the local press, the Football League blocked the move. Walsall were subsequently bought by millionaire entrepreneur and racehorse owner Terry Ramsden and with his money came high-profile signings and the attention of the national media. In 1986–87, under new manager Tommy Coakley, Walsall narrowly missed out on the play-offs but made considerable progress in the FA Cup as they defeated First Division Charlton Athletic and Birmingham City and took Watford to two replays in the fifth round.

Walsall finally earned promotion to the Second Division for the first time since 1963 by winning the Third Division play-offs in 1988. Bristol City were beaten 4–0 in a replayed final at Fellows Park thanks to a David Kelly hattrick. However, the 1988–89 season saw the club immediately relegated from the Second Division and Ramsden&#x27;s business empire collapse. Walsall were minutes from going out of business but survived, again through the actions of the supporters and local businessmen. A second successive relegation followed at the end of 1989–90 as Walsall were consigned to the Fourth Division once again.

The club moved to the Bescot Stadium in 1990. At the time it was a state-of-the-art arena and was only the second new Football League ground since the 1950s. The arrival at Bescot Stadium saw some stability brought back to the club after two successive relegations and the club was taken over by Jeff Bonser in 1991. Kenny Hibbitt managed the club for four years, setting the groundwork for a golden era for the club that would follow soon after his dismissal in September 1994.

New manager Chris Nicholl led the club to promotion back to the third tier (now known as Division Two after the formation of the Premier League) in his first season, building the nucleus of a strong and under-rated team. A run of four straight wins at the end of April meant Walsall needed just a point from their final game, away to Bury, to secure promotion; they duly obliged with a 0–0 scoreline to send the travelling fans home celebrating.

===A series of ups and downs (1995–2022)===
Two seasons of stability followed back in Division Two before Nicholl resigned. Jan Sørensen took the helm after Nicholl&#x27;s departure and led the club to the fourth round of both the League Cup and FA Cup in 1997–98. Each run was ended away to a Premier League side as West Ham United won 4–1 in the League Cup and a glamour tie at Manchester United resulted in a 5–1 defeat in the FA Cup. Despite the club&#x27;s cup exploits, a poor finish in the league signalled the end of Sørensen&#x27;s time at Walsall after just one season.

In 1998–99, Ray Graydon took over as manager and led the club to a runners-up spot in Division Two, beating Manchester City to an automatic promotion place by five points. After the unlikely promotion to the second tier Walsall found life difficult at a higher level but battled right until the final day of the season, when relegation was finally sealed. A 2–0 defeat at Ipswich meant Walsall returned to the third tier, despite derby wins over local rivals Wolves, Birmingham and West Bromwich Albion earlier in the campaign. &quot;The Saddlers&quot; returned to the second tier of English football at the first attempt, defeating Reading 3–2, after extra time, in a thrilling play-off final at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium.

Graydon was dismissed in January 2002 following a 2–0 defeat against local rivals West Brom. Colin Lee took over and secured survival in the second tier for the first time since the early 1960s. The 2002–03 season saw Walsall avoid relegation again. However, the 2003–04 campaign ended in relegation despite a storming start which had seen the club on the brink of the play-offs going into the New Year. A slump in form saw Lee sacked in April and the appointment of star player Paul Merson as manager did not halt the slide. Walsall were ultimately relegated, agonisingly by a single goal, despite a 3–2 victory over Rotherham United on the season&#x27;s final day in front of a record Bescot Stadium crowd of 11,049.

Despite the club&#x27;s relegation and no previous managerial experience, Merson was immediately appointed as full-time manager of the club in May 2004. A poor season in League One almost ended in successive relegations and the 2005–06 season then turned into a disastrous one for Walsall and Merson. After increasing supporter pressure following a string of bad results, culminating in a 5–0 defeat at Brentford, Merson&#x27;s reign as Walsall manager came to an end in February 2006. However, it was too late and Walsall were relegated on 22 April 2006, after losing 3–1 to Huddersfield Town.

Richard Money was tasked with reviving the club&#x27;s fortunes in League Two. An impressive start to the season was maintained throughout and, despite a mini-blip in February, Walsall remained in the top three for almost the entire season and were promoted back to League One after beating Notts County 2–1 away from home. On the final day of the season Walsall drew 1–1 at Swindon Town, thanks to a last-minute goal by Dean Keates in front of 3,419 travelling fans, to secure the League Two title.
Walsall&#x27;s form continued into the new season, as the club performed strongly in 2007–08, including a run of 17 League matches without defeat and back-to-back promotions looked possible. However, a January transfer window that culminated in the sales of important first team players Danny Fox and Scott Dann to Coventry City caused a drop in form throughout 2008. The club&#x27;s promotion challenge ended after a run of poor results in March leading to Richard Money resigning as manager in April.

The following seven seasons spent in League One saw largely mid-table security apart from a few flirtations with relegation. Notably, in the 2010–11 season the club sat in the relegation places from October through to March but ultimately survived thanks to an upturn in form following the appointment of Dean Smith as manager in January 2011. Walsall had been ten points adrift of safety, however, despite accumulating only 48 points by the end of the season they escaped relegation by one point.

The 2014–15 season was a memorable one for the club as it reached a Wembley final for the first time in its 127-year history. Walsall beat Rochdale, Tranmere Rovers, Sheffield United and Preston North End on their way to the Football League Trophy final where they were beaten 2–0 by Bristol City on Sunday 22 March 2015. &quot;The Saddlers&quot; were backed by over 29,000 supporters in a crowd of 72,315 at the national stadium.

Walsall started the 2015–16 season well, leading to interest in manager Dean Smith. At the end of November, with &quot;The Saddlers&quot; fourth in the table, he left Walsall for Brentford; at the time of his departure he was the fourth longest serving manager in the Football League. Walsall turned to Sean O&#x27;Driscoll to replace Smith. However, after a six-game winless run and just 16 games in charge, O&#x27;Driscoll was sacked and replaced by John Whitney. Ultimately, Walsall missed out on promotion by just one point and lost in the play-off semi-finals to Barnsley.

Following the decimation of their promotion challenging team, Walsall struggled for the next three seasons in League One and, after a disastrous spell in charge for former playing hero Dean Keates following the sacking of Whitney, were relegated back to the fourth tier at the end of the 2018–19 season. Following relegation, a new era began with Darrell Clarke taking over as manager and Jeff Bonser ending his 28-year reign as owner and chairman by selling his 76% majority shareholding of the club to Leigh Pomlett in July 2019. Walsall failed to make a League Two promotion challenge in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 seasons, finishing in 13th and 19th place respectively, halfway through the latter Clarke left for Port Vale. Ahead of the 2021–22 season Matthew Taylor was appointed new head coach with Neil McDonald as his assistant. However, following a run of seven successive losses which left the club in 21st place and just four points outside the relegation zone, Taylor was sacked in February 2022 and replaced by Michael Flynn who saved the club from relegation as they finished 16th.

===A new era of American ownership (2022–present)===
On 6 June 2022, the club announced that American sports investment firm Trivela Group LLC had purchased a majority of shares belonging to chairman Leigh Pomlett, becoming 51% majority shareholders. A positive run of form in late 2022 saw the club within touching distance of the play-off places for the first time since relegration. However, the end of top goalscorer Danny Johnson&#x27;s loan spell with the club in January lead to an indifferent second half of the season. Ultimately, Flynn was sacked as the club again finished 16th. Interim head coach Mat Sadler was appointed full-time head coach in May 2023, with Trivela stating their confidence that &quot;Mat is the right man, given his values, his resolve, his ambition, and his abilities, to partner with us in building this future, and that he can continue to grow as a coach as we grow as a club.&quot; Sadler lead the team to a record breaking run of eight league wins in a row, securing the record with a 5–1 victory over Tranmere Rovers at Bescot Stadium on 11 January 2025.

==Rivals==

A 2013 survey revealed Walsall fans consider Black Country neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers to be the club&#x27;s main rivals. However, meetings between the teams are relatively rare, with Wolves having spent most of their existence in the top two tiers of English football. Only 16 competitive fixtures have been played between Walsall and Wolves, with the most recent occurring in 2014. Meetings with the Black Country&#x27;s other professional club, West Bromwich Albion, are similarly rare, with &quot;The Saddlers&quot; and &quot;The Baggies&quot; having clashed just 14 times. However, the Black Country rivals did meet on numerous occasions during wartime regionalised league fixtures. A match between two of those three clubs is called Black Country derby.

More regularly-contested rivalries exist with Shrewsbury Town and Port Vale, who are often &quot;The Saddlers&quot;&#x27; geographically closest league fixtures. Walsall have the upper hand in the Shrewsbury and Port Vale rivalries, having won significantly more fixtures than they have lost.

==Grounds==

===The Chuckery===

This multi-purpose sports ground was situated in a district near to the Walsall Arboretum. It comprised some 12 football pitches and four good-sized cricket squares. It was the first ever home ground for Walsall F.C. from 1875 until 1893.

===West Bromwich Road===

The new ground in West Bromwich Road, which had a capacity of just over 4,500, proved to be a lucky omen for The Saddlers between 1893 and 1896.

===Fellows Park===

Fellows Park was a former football stadium in Walsall, England. It was the home ground of Walsall F.C. from 1896 until 1990, when the team moved to the Bescot Stadium.

===Bescot Stadium===

Bescot Stadium, currently also known as the Poundland Bescot Stadium for sponsorship purposes, is the home ground of Walsall Football Club. It was built in 1989–90 at a cost of £4.5m, replacing the club&#x27;s previous ground, Fellows Park, which was located a quarter of a mile away. The ground was opened by Sir Stanley Matthews. Upon Jeff Bonser stepping down from his role at the club, Leigh Pomlett agreed an option to reunite the Saddlers with their stadium freehold &quot;in due time&quot;. On 16 December 2022 the club executed its option to acquire Poundland Bescot Stadium and is now the owner of the stadium, the Saddlers Club, and the adjoining land. On Saturday 27 January 2024 the Supporters Club, formerly known as the Saddlers Club, re-opened as a sports bar under the new name The Locker.

<text>Pania, often styled &quot;Pania of the Reef&quot;, is a figure of Māori mythology, and a symbol of the New Zealand city of Napier. There is a statue of Pania on Napier&#x27;s Marine Parade.

==The legend of Pania of the Reef==
Pania was a beautiful maiden who lived in the sea on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. By daylight she swam about with creatures of her reef world but after sunset would go to a stream that ran into the bay where the city of Napier now exists. She would travel up the stream to an area where she could rest among the flax bushes. Karitoki, the very handsome son of a Māori chief, quenched his thirst every evening at the stream where Pania rested because it had the sweetest water. He was unaware she was observing him for many weeks until one night she whispered a faint spell. It carried on the wind to Karitoki who turned around to see Pania emerge from her hiding place.

Karitoki had never seen someone so beautiful and instantly fell in love. Pania fell in love also, and they pledged their lives to each other and were secretly married. Pania and Karitoki went to his &quot;whare&quot; (house), but because it was dark no-one saw them enter. At sunrise, Pania prepared to leave but Karitoki tried to stop her. She explained that as a creature of the ocean, when the sirens of the sea called her each morning, she could not survive if she did not go to them. She promised to return every evening and their marriage continued on that basis.

Karitoki boasted to his friends about his beautiful wife, but no one believed him because they had never seen her. Frustrated by this, Karitoki consulted a &quot;kaumātua&quot; (wise elder) in the village who believed Karitoki as he knew ocean maidens did exist. The kaumātua told Karitoki that being a sea creature, Pania would not be allowed to return to the sea if she swallowed cooked food.

That night, as Pania slept, Karitoki took a morsel of cooked food and put it in Pania&#x27;s mouth. As he did so, Ruru the &quot;morepork&quot; (owl) called a loud warning and Pania was startled from her sleep. Horrified that Karitoki had put her life in jeopardy, Pania fled and ran to the sea. Her people came to the surface and drew her down into the depths as Karitoki swam frantically about the ocean looking for her. He never saw her again.

When people now look deep into the water over the reef, some say they can see Pania with arms outstretched, appealing to her former lover. It is unknown whether she is imploring him to explain his treachery, or expressing her continuing love.

The sea off Napier is now protected by Moremore, the son of Pania and Karitoki. He is the &quot;kaitiaki&quot; (guardian) of the area, a taniwha (spirit) who often disguises himself as a shark, a stingray or an octopus.
