Among other awards, he has won the Japan Academy Film Prize for Best Actor twice, in 2007 for &quot;Memories of Tomorrow&quot; and in 2010 for &quot;The Unbroken&quot;. He is also known for his roles in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s films &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot;, as well as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Detective Pikachu&quot;.

In 2014, he starred in the reboot &quot;Godzilla&quot; as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, a role he reprised in the sequel, &quot;&quot;. He lent his voice to the fourth and fifth installments of the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise respectively, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as Decepticon-turned-Autobot Drift.

He made his Broadway debut in April 2015 in Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s revival production of &quot;The King and I&quot; in the title role. In 2015, Watanabe received his first Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical at the 69th Tony Awards for his role as The King. He is the first Japanese actor to be nominated in this category. Watanabe reprised his role at the London Palladium in June 2018.

==Early life==
Watanabe was born on October 21, 1959, in the mountain village of Koide in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. His mother was a school teacher and his father taught calligraphy. Due to a number of relocations for his parents&#x27; work, he spent his childhood in the villages of Irihirose and Sumon, both now part of the city of Uonuma, and in Takada, now part of the city of Jōetsu. He attended Niigata Prefectural Koide High School, where he was a member of the concert band club, playing trumpet, which he had played since childhood.

After graduation from high school, in 1978 he aimed to enter Musashino Academia Musicae, a conservatory in Tokyo. However, he had never received a formal musical education, and his father became seriously ill when he was in junior high school and was unable to work, which meant that his family could no longer afford to pay for his music lessons. Because of these problems, Watanabe was forced to give up his intention of entering the conservatory. He said of the decision: &quot;I had to give up my musical aspirations. I realised I had no talent as a musician. But I still wanted to find a way to be creative, so I decided to try acting&quot;.

==Career==

===Japanese roles===
After graduating from high school in 1978, Watanabe moved to Tokyo to begin his acting career, by enrolling in the drama school run by the Engeki-Shudan En theatre troupe. While with the troupe, he was cast as the hero in the play &quot;Shimodani Mannencho Monogatari&quot;, directed by the acclaimed Yukio Ninagawa. The role attracted critical and popular notice.

In 1982, he made his first TV appearance in &quot;Michinaru Hanran&quot; (&quot;Unknown Rebellion&quot;), and his first appearance on TV as a samurai in &quot;Mibu no koiuta&quot;. He made his feature-film debut in 1984 with &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s Children&quot;.

Watanabe is mostly known in Japan for playing samurai, as in the 1987 &quot;Dokuganryu Masamune&quot; (&quot;One eyed dragon, Masamune&quot;) the 50-episode NHK taiga drama. He played the lead character, Matsudaira Kurō, in the television jidaigeki &quot;Gokenin Zankurō&quot;, which ran for several seasons. He has gone on to garner acclaim in such historical dramas as &quot;Oda Nobunaga&quot;, &quot;Chūshingura&quot;, and the movie &quot;Bakumatsu Junjo Den&quot;.

In 1989, while filming Haruki Kadokawa&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;, Watanabe was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. He returned to acting while simultaneously undergoing chemotherapy treatments, but in 1991 suffered a relapse.

As his health improved his career picked back up. He co-starred with Kōji Yakusho in the 1998 &quot;Kizuna&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Japan Academy Film Prize for Best Supporting Actor.

In 2002, he quit the &#x27;En&#x27; theatre group where he had his start and joined the K Dash agency. The film &quot;Sennen no Koi&quot; (&quot;Thousand-year Love&quot;, based on &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;) earned him another Japanese Academy Award nomination.

In 2006, he won Best Lead Actor at the 30th Japan Academy Film Prize for his role in &quot;Memories of Tomorrow (Ashita no Kioku)&quot;, in which he played a patient with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===International films===

Watanabe was introduced to most Western audiences in the 2003 American film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, set in 19th Century Japan. His performance as Lord Katsumoto earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Watanabe appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, playing Chairman Iwamura. That same year, he also played the decoy of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Batman film reboot, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. In 2006, he starred in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;, playing Tadamichi Kuribayashi. He has voiced Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in the &quot;Batman Begins&quot; video game. He has filmed advertisements for American Express, Yakult, Canon and NTT Docomo. In 2004, he was featured in &quot;People Magazine&quot;″s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; edition.

In 2009, he appeared in &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot;. In 2010, he co-starred in &quot;Inception&quot;, where he stars as Saito, a mark-turned-benefactor businessman of the film&#x27;s heist team.

In 2014, he starred in two Hollywood blockbusters &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 2019, he starred in two other Hollywood blockbusters &quot;Pokémon Detective Pikachu&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2023, he returned to work with director Gareth Edwards again in the science fiction action film &quot;The Creator&quot;.

===Television===
Watanabe appears in &quot;Tokyo Vice&quot;, a television series based on the non-fiction book by Jake Adelstein and written for television by J.T. Rogers. The ten-part series was produced by HBO Max and is distributed by HBO Max and in Japan by Wowow. Tokyo Vice stars Ansel Elgort as Adelstein, an American journalist who embeds himself into the Tokyo Vice police squad to expose corruption. Ken is currently starring in the NHK World Japan&#x27;s comedy &quot;You&#x27;re a Genius!&quot;.

In April 2019, it was announced that Warner Bros. International Television Production and TV Asahi were teaming up to remake &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993). Watanabe is set to star in the upcoming remake, taking place in Tokyo just before the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The broadcast date has yet to be announced.

==Personal life==
In 1983, Watanabe married his first wife, Yumiko. The couple had two children, a son, Dai Watanabe (born 1984), who is an actor, and a daughter Anne Watanabe (born 1986) who is an actress and fashion model. In September 2005, following two years of arbitration, he and Yumiko were divorced. In August 2008, Dai had his first child, a son, making Ken a grandfather at the age of 48. A daughter was born to Dai in March 2010. In May 2016, Watanabe&#x27;s daughter gave birth to twin girls. In November 2017 she gave birth to a son, giving Watanabe five grandchildren altogether.

He met his second wife, Kaho Minami, when they were both acting in a suspense drama for TV Tokyo. They married on 3 December 2005. The marriage was announced by their agencies on 7 December, just after they had attended a New York City premiere of his film &quot;Sayuri&quot; together.

Watanabe formally adopted Minami&#x27;s son from her previous marriage to director Jinsei Tsuji, and for a time the three of them lived in Los Angeles. In order to increase the amount of time the family could spend together, considering Ken&#x27;s work requiring him to travel so much, they later returned to Japan. Initially Minami and Ken did not hold a wedding ceremony, but in 2010 they announced that they had held a ceremony on August 1 in Los Angeles.

On May 17, 2018, Minami&#x27;s agency announced that she and Watanabe had divorced after he had admitted to having an extramarital affair.

In June 2023, Watanabe remarried for the third time, a woman who is 21 years his junior, after dating for 9 years.

===Philanthropy===
On March 13, 2011, he launched a YouTube page to raise awareness about the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster and invited celebrities to add their videos of the triple tragedy in Japan. In his video in English, he made a call to action to support the victims of triple disaster and to raise funds in the relief effort. In conjunction amidst the Fukushima crisis, he has also created his own website for the cause.

===Health===
In 1989, Watanabe was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. The cancer returned in 1994, but he later recovered.

In 2006, Watanabe revealed in his autobiography &quot;Dare? - Who Am I?&quot; that prior to commencing work on &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, it was discovered that he had contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion he received while undergoing treatment for his leukemia. At a press conference held on May 23, 2006, he said he was in &quot;good&quot; condition but was still undergoing treatment.

In 2016, while on a break from performing in a Broadway production of &quot;The King and I&quot;, Watanabe was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He subsequently announced on February 9, 2016, that he would postpone scheduled performances in order to undergo the necessary treatment. Due to the early diagnosis, surgery was successfully able to remove the cancer.

<text>In numerical analysis, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. 

It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.

For example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.

Hill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). 

Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search. 

To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).

The relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically. 

Hill climbing is an anytime algorithm: it can return a valid solution even if it&#x27;s interrupted at any time before it ends.

==Mathematical description==

Hill climbing attempts to maximize (or minimize) a target function formula_1, where formula_2 is a vector of continuous and/or discrete values. At each iteration, hill climbing will adjust a single element in formula_2 and determine whether the change improves the value of formula_1. (Note that this differs from gradient descent methods, which adjust all of the values in formula_2 at each iteration according to the gradient of the hill.) With hill climbing, any change that improves formula_1 is accepted, and the process continues until no change can be found to improve the value of formula_1. Then formula_2 is said to be &quot;locally optimal&quot;.

In discrete vector spaces, each possible value for formula_2 may be visualized as a vertex in a graph. Hill climbing will follow the graph from vertex to vertex, always locally increasing (or decreasing) the value of formula_1, until a local maximum (or local minimum) formula_11 is reached.

==Variants==

In simple hill climbing, the first closer node is chosen, whereas in steepest ascent hill climbing all successors are compared and the closest to the solution is chosen. Both forms fail if there is no closer node, which may happen if there are local maxima in the search space which are not solutions. Steepest ascent hill climbing is similar to best-first search, which tries all possible extensions of the current path instead of only one.

Stochastic hill climbing does not examine all neighbors before deciding how to move. Rather, it selects a neighbor at random, and decides (based on the amount of improvement in that neighbor) whether to move to that neighbor or to examine another.

Coordinate descent does a line search along one coordinate direction at the current point in each iteration. Some versions of coordinate descent randomly pick a different coordinate direction each iteration.

Random-restart hill climbing is a meta-algorithm built on top of the hill climbing algorithm. It is also known as Shotgun hill climbing. It iteratively does hill-climbing, each time with a random initial condition formula_12. The best formula_11 is kept: if a new run of hill climbing produces a better formula_11 than the stored state, it replaces the stored state.

Random-restart hill climbing is a surprisingly effective algorithm in many cases. It turns out that it is often better to spend CPU time exploring the space, than carefully optimizing from an initial condition. 

==Problems==

===Local maxima===
Hill climbing will not necessarily find the global maximum, but may instead converge on a local maximum. This problem does not occur if the heuristic is convex. However, as many functions are not convex hill climbing may often fail to reach a global maximum. Other local search algorithms try to overcome this problem such as stochastic hill climbing, random walks and simulated annealing.


===Ridges and alleys===

Ridges are a challenging problem for hill climbers that optimize in continuous spaces. Because hill climbers only adjust one element in the vector at a time, each step will move in an axis-aligned direction. If the target function creates a narrow ridge that ascends in a non-axis-aligned direction (or if the goal is to minimize, a narrow alley that descends in a non-axis-aligned direction), then the hill climber can only ascend the ridge (or descend the alley) by zig-zagging. If the sides of the ridge (or alley) are very steep, then the hill climber may be forced to take very tiny steps as it zig-zags toward a better position. Thus, it may take an unreasonable length of time for it to ascend the ridge (or descend the alley).

By contrast, gradient descent methods can move in any direction that the ridge or alley may ascend or descend. Hence, gradient descent or the conjugate gradient method is generally preferred over hill climbing when the target function is differentiable. Hill climbers, however, have the advantage of not requiring the target function to be differentiable, so hill climbers may be preferred when the target function is complex.

===Plateau===
Another problem that sometimes occurs with hill climbing is that of a plateau. A plateau is encountered when the search space is flat, or sufficiently flat that the value returned by the target function is indistinguishable from the value returned for nearby regions due to the precision used by the machine to represent its value. In such cases, the hill climber may not be able to determine in which direction it should step, and may wander in a direction that never leads to improvement.

<text>Route 181 is a state highway in Jefferson Township and Sparta Township in New Jersey. The highway begins in Jefferson Township at a cloverleaf interchange with Route 15 and Espanong Road. Route 181 serves as the local route through Woodport, serving the eastern shores of Lake Hopatcong as well as the main road through the center of Sparta. The route terminates at a jughandle with Route 15 in Sparta.

Route 181 originated as an alignment of State Highway Route 6-A through Woodport and Sparta, which became Route 15 in the 1953 state highway renumbering. In 1974, Route 181 was designated as Route 15 was moved onto a freeway bypass of Sparta.

== Route description ==

Route 181 begins at Espanong Road within a cloverleaf interchange with Route 15 in Jefferson Township. Espanong Road, which heads westward towards Lake Hopatcong, provides some of the missing movements to Route 15 not directly accessible from Route 181. Route 181 runs north past several ramps of the interchange, paralleling Route 15 through Jefferson Township. The route winds northwest and reaches the eastern shores of Lake Hopatcong, where it reaches the community of Woodport.

At Woodport, Lake Hopatcong ends as Route 181 crosses the line from Morris County to Sussex County. Now in the town of Sparta, Route 181 becomes Woodport Road, winding northward back toward Route 15. The two routes parallel northwestward and intersect with Blue Heron Drive, which connects the two roads. Once again, Route 181 turns northwest and away from Route 15, reaching downtown Sparta. The two-lane road winds northwest through the center of Sparta, reaching a junction with County Route 517 (CR 517; Sparta Avenue), which connects to Route 15 once again.

After CR 517, Route 181 runs northward out of downtown Sparta, passing the Skyview Golf Club as it approaches Route 15 once again. Becoming a two-lane residential road, the highway heads into an intersection with Route 15 with a jughandle, marking the northern terminus of Route 181.

== History ==
Route 181 originated as an alignment of State Highway Route 6-A, a spur of State Highway Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) from Dover to Ross Corner. The designation was assigned in 1938, eleven years after the then-current highway system in New Jersey was started. The state highway route designation remained intact for fifteen years, until January 1, 1953, when the routes in state of New Jersey underwent a large renumbering. Route 6-A became Route 15, running along Route 181&#x27;s alignment from Jefferson to Sparta. The Sparta Bypass was constructed in 1974, and upon completion, Route 15 was taken off of the Jefferson–Sparta alignment, which was re-designated Route 181.

<text>Route 182 is a state highway in Hackettstown, New Jersey, United States. The highway serves as a connector of Route 57 to U.S. Route 46 (US 46). The southern end of Route 182 is at a three-way intersection, where Route 57 heads westbound towards Phillipsburg. Also present at this intersection is County Route 517 (CR 517), which is signed as Route 24, but not maintained by the state. CR 517 runs concurrent with Route 182 to its north end at US 46, and turns west with US 46 before splitting in downtown Hackettstown.

Route 182 was first an alignment of pre-1927 Route 12, but was not maintained by the state. In 1927, there was a renumbering, and it became part of Route S-24, which was a spur of Route 24. Route 24 at the time went along the alignment of Route 57, but when the second renumbering occurred in 1953, there was yet another change. In 1953, Route 24 was realigned onto most of Route S24, except for a short part which was designated Route 57. The highway went through a final change on October 9, 1969. On that day, there was a small renumbering of Hackettstown, with Route 24 being truncated to the three-way intersection, and Route 57 reassigned onto the rest of Route 24. The former alignment of Route 57 was reassigned as Route 182.

==Route description==

Route 182 begins at an intersection with Route 57 and County Route 517 (CR 517). Immediately at that intersection, CR 517 becomes concurrent with Route 182, but is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The fourth road at that intersection is Riveredge–Mobile Home Court, which is a cul-de-sac. The highway progresses northward, passing some small commercial buildings and arriving at the largest free-standing shopping center in Hackettstown, across from Shelley Drive. The next significant intersection is with East Avenue and an adjacent stripmall. East Avenue heads east briefly turning northeast, crosses over the Musconetcong River, passes behind the Union Cemetery, and intersects US 46.
Route 182 continues northward, passing several small businesses and side streets, as well as the main entrance to the Union Cemetery. Route 182 ends at a three-way intersection with US 46 and CR 604. CR 604 is also signed as Willow Grove Street, and heads northwest out of the intersection. US Route 46 is also signed as Mill Street, with the eastbound side heading east-southeast from the intersection and the westbound side heading northwest from the intersection. CR 517 which had been concurrent with Route 182, continues along a concurrency with U.S. Route 46 westbound.

==History==
Route 182 was originally defined as a segment of a spur of the Washington Turnpike. The stretch of road was later signed as the head of the Lackawanna Trail, running from Hackettstown to Binghamton, NY. In 1916, the road was incorporated into pre-1927 Route 12. However, it was not maintained by the state, and instead, maintained by the county. The highway remained the same until 1927, which is when it became a part of Route S24, which was assigned as a spur off of Route 24. The parent highway, Route 24, was assigned as a highway to run from Schooley&#x27;s Mountain west to Penwell. There, Route S24 would terminate, but the direct highway was not improved by the county. Instead of the original decision, Route 24 was assigned to end at Hackettstown, where the two highways would intersect at the southern end of Route 182.

The next change to the highway, was in 1953, when the New Jersey State Highway Department renumbered the highway system around the state. This time, Route 24 was defined to run along the alignment of the now-decommissioned Route S24. Now, Route 24 ran along a new alignment, including a part which was supposed to be temporary. The entirety of current Route 57 was also assigned as Route 24. That year, the state took over the alignment that was maintained by the county. The final change in highway alignment around Hackettstown occurred on October 9, 1969. This time Route 24 was truncated off the alignment of current Route 57, and now ended in Hackettstown, at the three-way intersection. The older alignment of Route 57 did not retain its designation, as plans developed to make a bypass of Hackettstown, continuing the highway from Phillipsburg to U.S. Route 46 just east of Hackettstown. However, plans never finished, and instead, the designation of Route 182 was assigned to the original alignment of Route 57.

<text>The decade of the 1930s in film involved many significant films. The year 1939, in particular, was one of the biggest years (and is still considered one of the greatest years) in Hollywood with MGM&#x27;s release of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Events==
The 1930s was a decade of political turmoil and economic problems; the Great Depression affected the entire world, and Europe was dealing with both the fallout of World War I and the economic hardships of the time, both of which resulted in the rise of fascist political movements. The uncertainty resulted in the widespread popularity of fantastical escapist fiction. Swashbuckling adventures and the safe scares of the Universal Classic Monsters were highly successful.

Many full-length films were produced in the 1930s. Sound films (&quot;talkies&quot;) were a global phenomenon by the early 1930s. Advances in color film included Technicolor and Kodachrome.

The year 1930 is the start of &quot;the golden age of Hollywood&quot;, which through at least the 1940s. The studio system was at its height in the 1930s, studios having great control over a film&#x27;s creative decision. This included the creation of the Hays Code, which was the first large scale attempt at organized censorship of Hollywood films.

This was also a decade in which many memorable stars made their careers and saw their earliest starring roles.

===Trends===
Trends in the 1930s film industry include:

Remakes

Following the switch to talking movies c. 1926/1927, many classic films were remade in the 1930s (and later). These include &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; (1933), &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934), and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937).

Monsters

Among the numerous remakes and new films were the &#x27;monster movies&#x27;, with a wide spectrum of stereotypical monsters. Given that many of these films were produced by Universal, they are regarded as part of the &#x27;Universal Horror&#x27; genre. The first of these films debuted in 1931, and consisted of &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, plus &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, then a 1932 trio with &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;Vampyr&quot;, and &quot;White Zombie&quot;, followed by a 1933 trio of &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot;. In 1935, appeared &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot; leading to 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;.

Sequels/spin-offs

Within five years of sound films, sequel films and spin-off plots appeared. Examples include &quot;The Son of Kong&quot; (same year, 1933), &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), and &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936).

Stars

The 1930s saw the rise of some of the best known performers in acting and film history. The aforementioned Dracula and Frankenstein films both launched the careers of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, respectively; the two men would spend much of the decade starring in Universal Horror films. Actor Errol Flynn, best known for his role as Robin Hood, saw his first starring part in Captain Blood. The Marx Brothers, making their debut at the end of the silent era, rose to fame in the 1930s. The meteoric but short film career of Jean Harlow, The Blonde Bombshell, was completely contained in the 1930s. Fred Astaire, with his frequent partner Ginger Rogers, revolutionized film musicals. With charm and a &quot;distinctive kind of nonmacho masculinity&quot;, Cary Grant became the decade&#x27;s &quot;epitome of masculine glamour&quot;. Other stars of this era included Clark Gable, Katharine Hepburn, child star Shirley Temple, Spencer Tracy, and Mae West. 

A number of actors from the previous decade continued to be well regarded, such as Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo.

The Hays Code and the end of the Pre-Code era

In response to a number of scandals in the 1920s, the studios adopted a series of guidelines known as the &quot;Hays Code&quot;, after its creator Will H. Hays. Hays was the head of the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, which would later be renamed as the Motion Picture Association of America in 1945. Starting in 1927, Hays began compiling a list of topics which he thought Hollywood should avoid. The code was revealed and implemented in 1930, but it was not until 1934, with the establishment of the Production Code Administration, that it was significantly enforced. Due to this delay in enforcement capability, the Pre-Code era of Hollywood is technically considered to last until 1934, despite the code itself being unveiled in 1930.

The specific date in which the Pre-Code era ends could be considered July 1, 1934. According to an amendment made on June 13, 1934, all films released after July 1 of that year had to receive a PCA certificate of approval. After this, the code was stringently enforced, though various forbidden subjects became less taboo and thus regulations regarding them were gradually relaxed. The code would remain in effect until 1968, when it was abandoned entirely. It was then replaced by the familiar letter rating system.

<text>Spelman College is a private, historically Black, women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is a founding member of the Atlanta University Center academic consortium. Founded in 1881 as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, Spelman awarded its first college degrees in 1901 and is the oldest private historically Black liberal arts institution for women.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The &quot; Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary&quot; was established on 11 April 1881 in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta by two teachers from the Oread Institute of Worcester, Massachusetts: Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard. Giles and Packard met while Giles was a student, and Packard the preceptress of the New Salem Academy in New Salem northeast of Springfield, Massachusetts and fostered a lifelong friendship there. The two traveled to Atlanta specifically to begin a school for Black freedwomen and found support from Frank Quarles, the pastor of Friendship Baptist Church.

Giles and Packard started the school with 11 African-American women and $100 given to them by the First Baptist Church in Medford, Massachusetts in addition to a promise of further support from the Woman&#x27;s American Baptist Home Mission Society (WABHMS), a group with which they were both affiliated in Boston. Although their first students were mostly illiterate, they envisioned their school becoming a liberal arts institution–the first circular of the college said that they planned to offer &quot;algebra, physiology, essays, Latin, rhetoric, geometry, political economy, mental philosophy (psychology), chemistry, botany, Constitution of the United States, astronomy, zoology, geology, moral philosophy, and evidences of Christianity&quot;. Over time they attracted more students; when the first term ended they had enrolled 80 students in the seminary. The WABHMS made a down payment on a nine-acre (36,000 m2) site in Atlanta relatively close to the church where they began, which originally had five buildings left from a Union Civil War encampment, to support classroom and residence hall needs.

In 1882 the two women returned to Massachusetts to bid for more money and were introduced to businessman John D. Rockefeller who was an industrialist and a Northern Baptist at a church conference in Ohio. Rockefeller was impressed by Packard&#x27;s vision. In April 1884, Rockefeller visited the school. At the time the seminary had 600 students and 16 faculty members. The school&#x27;s existence was enabled by generous donations from the Black community in Atlanta, the efforts of volunteer teachers, and gifts of supplies. Many Atlanta Black churches, philanthropists, and Black community groups raised and donated money to settle the debt on the property which had been acquired. 

Rockefeller was so impressed that he settled the debt on the property. His wife, Laura Spelman Rockefeller; her sister, Lucy Spelman; and their parents, Harvey Buel and Lucy Henry Spelman also supported the school. The Spelmans were longtime activists in the abolitionist movement. In 1884 the name of the school was changed to the &quot;Spelman Seminary&quot; in honor of Laura Spelman Rockefeller and her parents. Rockefeller donated the funds for the oldest building on campus, Rockefeller Hall, which was built in 1886.

Packard was appointed Spelman&#x27;s first president in 1888, after the charter for the seminary was granted. He died in 1891 and Giles was the president until she died in 1909. A diploma granting institution in its early years, Spelman awarded its first college degrees in 1901.

=== Growth ===

From 1910 to 1953 the seminary had a substantial amount of growth and transition. After Giles&#x27; death, Lucy Hale Tapley became president. Although the college was somewhat progressive, neither the founders nor the current administration were interested in challenging the status quo of young women as being primarily responsible for the family and the home. Tapley said, &quot;Any course of study which fails to cultivate a taste and fitness for practical and efficient work in some part of the field of the world&#x27;s needs is unpopular at Spelman and finds no place in our curriculum.&quot; The nursing curriculum was strengthened, a teachers&#x27; dormitory and a home economics building were constructed; and Tapley Hall, the science building, was completed in 1925. The Granddaughters&#x27; Club, a club for students whose mothers and aunts had attended Spelman was created and the club is still in existence today.

In September 1924, Spelman Baptist Seminary officially became &quot;Spelman College&quot;. Florence Matilda Read became the president in 1927. Soon afterwards, Spelman entered into an &quot;agreement of affiliation&quot; with nearby Morehouse College and Atlanta University by chartering the Atlanta University Center in 1929. Atlanta University would provide graduate education for students; Morehouse and Spelman were responsible for undergraduate education. At a time during which Black students were often denied access to graduate studies at predominantly white southern research universities, access to Atlanta University allowed the undergraduate students at Morehouse and Spelman immediate access to graduate courses.

In 1927, one of the most important buildings on campus, Sisters Chapel, was dedicated. The chapel was named for its primary benefactors, sisters Laura Spelman Rockefeller and Lucy Maria Spelman. The college had also begun to see an improvement in extracurricular investment in the arts, with the organization of the Spelman College Glee Club in 1925, inauguration of the much-loved Atlanta tradition of the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol Concert and smaller events such as the spring orchestra and chorus concert, the Atlanta University Summer Theater, and the University Players, a drama organization for AUC students. The school also began to see more of a focus on collegiate education, as it discontinued its elementary and high school divisions. In 1930 the Spelman Nursery School was created as a training center for mothers and a practice arena for students who planned careers in education and child development. Spelman celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 1931. This milestone was accompanied by the construction of a university library that was shared amongst the Atlanta University Center institutions, and the center continues to share a library to this day.

The school continued to expand, building and acquiring more property to accommodate the growing student body. In 1947, Spelman joined the list of &quot;approved institutions&quot; of the Association of American Universities. In 1953, Florence Read retired, and Albert E. Manley became the first Black and first male president of the college. Under his presidency and the presidency of his successor, Donald Stewart, Spelman experienced significant growth. The college established its study abroad program, the Merrill Foreign Travel-Study Program. Stewart&#x27;s administration tripled the college&#x27;s endowment and was responsible for the establishment of the Comprehensive Writing Program, an across-the-curriculum writing program which required students to submit portfolios of their written work; the Ethel Waddell Githii College Honors Program, and the Women&#x27;s Research and Resource Center. In 1958, the college received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

=== Civil rights involvement ===
Going into the 1960s, the Spelman College students became involved in civil rights actions in Atlanta. In 1962, the first Spelman students were arrested for participating in sit-ins in the Atlanta community. Noted American historian Howard Zinn was a professor of history at Spelman during this era, and served as an adviser to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee chapter at the college. Zinn mentored many of Spelman&#x27;s students fighting for civil rights at the time, including Alice Walker and Marian Wright Edelman Zinn was dismissed from the college in 1963 for supporting Spelman students in their efforts to fight segregation; at the time, Spelman was focused on turning out &quot;refined young ladies.&quot; Edelman herself writes that Spelman had a reputation as &quot;a tea-pouring, very strict school designed to turn Black girls into refined ladies and teachers.&quot;

=== 1980–present ===
Stewart retired in 1986, and the following year, Johnnetta Betsch Cole became the first Black female president of Spelman College. During this time, the college became noted for its commitment to community service and its ties to the local community. Cole also led the college&#x27;s most successful capital campaign; between 1986 and 1996, the college raised $113.8 million, including a $20 million gift from Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille Hanks Cosby, whose daughter graduated from Spelman. In honor of this gift, the Cosby Academic Center was constructed. In July 2015, the remainder of the funds were returned and an endowed professorship named for the Cosby couple discontinued as allegations of sexual assault by Bill Cosby grew more prominent.

In 1997, Cole stepped down and Audrey Forbes Manley became Spelman&#x27;s first alumna president. After her retirement, in 2002, Beverly Daniel Tatum, the college&#x27;s president until 2015, took the post. The campus now comprises 26 buildings on in Atlanta. In 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama served as the keynote commencement speaker. The following year, Oprah Winfrey served as the keynote commencement speaker.

In 2015, Spelman opened the Wellness Center at Reed Hall, a state-of-the-art recreation center. It is host to a multitude of services from an indoor track and cycling room to a teaching kitchen and a multitude of fitness and wellness programs. Also in 2015, Mary Schmidt Campbell was named the tenth president of Spelman College. In 2017, Spelman&#x27;s leadership voted to allow transgender women to enroll. In 2018, Spelman received $30 million from Spelman trustee Ronda Stryker for the construction of a new state-of-the-art building on campus. Two years later, the college received another significant donation: $40 million from philanthropists Reed Hastings and his wife Patty Quillin to be used as scholarship funds for students enrolled at Spelman. In July 2020, Spelman received a notably large undisclosed donation from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott.

In April 2022, Helene Gayle was named the 11th president of Spelman College. In January 2024, Spelman received the largest single donation in its history and one of the largest ever to a HBCU with $100 million given by Spelman trustee Ronda Stryker and her husband, William Johnston. Spelman stated that $75 million of the $100 million donation will go towards endowed scholarships for future students, and the remaining $25 million will be used to &quot;develop an academic focus on public policy and democracy, improve student housing and provide flexible funding to meet critical strategic needs.&quot;

=== New student orientation ===
All new Spelman students are required to attend a six-day new student orientation (NSO) in August immediately before the fall semester begins. NSO includes events, workshops, and sessions designed to teach new Spelmanites about the mission, history, culture, traditions, and sisterhood of Spelman College; students are also given information on how to successfully matriculate to Spelman Women (graduates), such as registration, advisement, placement, and planning class schedules. NSO is led by student orientation leaders known as PALs (Peer Assistant Leaders) and Spelman alumnae. During NSO, new students are required to remain on campus at all times; any leave must be approved by PALs.

=== White attire tradition ===
One of Spelman&#x27;s oldest traditions are Spelmanites wearing &quot;respectable and conservative&quot; white attire to designated formal events on campus. The tradition began in the early 1900s when it was customary for women to wear white dresses when attending formal events. White attire is worn to the annual NSO induction ceremony, Founders Day Convocation, Alumnae March, and graduating seniors wear white attire underneath their graduation gowns for Class Day and Commencement. In 2009, My Sister&#x27;s Closet was established on campus by the Student Government Association for alumnae and current students to donate gently worn or brand new white attire for Spelman students in need at no cost.

<text>The psychology of self is the study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one&#x27;s identity, or the subject of experience. The earliest form of the Self in modern psychology saw the emergence of two elements, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me,&quot; with &quot;I&quot; referring to the Self as the subjective knower and &quot;me&quot; referring to the Self as a subject that is known.

The Self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience. The Self is not &#x27;permanently stuck into the heart of consciousness&#x27;. &quot;I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.&quot;

Current views of the Self in psychology position it as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity. It may be the case that we can now successfully attempt to create experiences of the Self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements that compose the complex selves of modern identity.

Over time, different theorists from multiple schools of thought have created ideas of what makes up the Self. Major theorists in the Clinical and Sociological branches of Psychology have emerged from these schools. 

== In Clinical Psychology ==

=== Jungian&#x27;s Self Archetype ===
In classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the culmination of several archetypes, which are predispositions of how a person responds to the world. The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the conscious and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand. It is fully realized as the product of &quot;individuation&quot;, which is defined by Jung as the rebirth of the Ego back to the original self. 

The Self, besides being the center of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an &quot;imago Dei&quot;. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive events not yet occurred or guide one in the present.

===Kohut&#x27;s Formulation===

Kohut followed Freud&#x27;s line of thinking regard the Self. However, he deviates from Freud by theorizing that the Self puts energy into the idea of narcissism (See Cathexis). The system is then broken over time into initially two systems of narcissistic perfection:&quot; 1) a system of ambitions (&quot;the grandiose self)&quot; and, 2) a system of ideals (&quot;the idealized parent imago)&quot;.&quot; According to Kohut, these two systems represent the poles within Kohut&#x27;s bipolar self. These poles work with each other to maintain a balance that is referred to as the Self 

===Winnicott&#x27;s Selves===

Donald Winnicott distinguished what he called the &quot;true self&quot; from the &quot;false self&quot; in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual&#x27;s sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body. 

Nevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it as a necessary form of defensive organization similar to that of a caretaker that protects the true self hides behind so that it may continue to exist.

Five levels of false self-organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum. 
# In the most severe instance, the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility. 
# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualized.
# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual&#x27;s search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its own identity.
# Even closer to health, we find the false self &quot;... established on the basis of identifications&quot;.
# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.

As for the true self, Winnicott linked it to playing &quot;hide and seek&quot;&#x27; designed to protect one&#x27;s real self against exploitation, without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.

===Berne&#x27;s Transactional Analysis===

In his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality&#x27;s ego states - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called &#x27;the real self, the one that can move from one ego state to another&#x27;.
* The Parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent. Both types of parents offer information to the child that can be either beneficial or detrimental to their development. 
* The Adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.
* The Child ego is identified as the state that holds all of a person&#x27;s memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all the time and can reflect on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. 
Berne considered that &#x27;the feeling of &quot;Self&quot; is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises&#x27;. 

A person&#x27;s tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. 

Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: &#x27;when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love&#x27;.

==In Social Psychology==

Social psychology acknowledges that &quot;one of the most important life tasks each a person faces is understanding who they are and how they feel about themselves&quot;. This allows us to better understand ourselves, abilities, and preferences so that a person can make choices and decisions that suit them the best. However, rather than absolute knowledge, it would seem that &#x27;a healthy sense of Self calls for both accurate self-knowledge and protective self-enhancement, in just the right amounts at just the right times.&#x27;

Other schools of thought look at the Self from a Social Psychology perspective. Some are listed below. 

The Self is an automatic part of every human being that enables them to relate to others. The self is made up of three main parts that allow for the Self to maintain its function: Self-knowledge, the interpersonal self, and the agent self.

=== Self-knowledge ===

Self-knowledge is something many seek to understand. In knowing about their selves, a person is more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. They seek out self-knowledge due to the appraisal motive, self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive.

Self-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person&#x27;s self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self. People learn about themselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.

* The looking glass self is a term used to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self-proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, how they are judged by others, and how they respond to said judgements. the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people.
* Introspection refers to the way a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. While a person might not know &quot;why&quot; they are thinking or feeling a certain way, they consciously know &quot;what&quot; they are feeling.
* Social comparison refers to the way in which people compare themselves to others. By observing others, a person can gauge their work and behaviors as good, bad, or neutral. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person depending on &quot;who&quot; they are comparing themselves to
* The self-perception theory is another theory in which a person makes inferences about themselves through their own actions and attitudes.
* Self-awareness occurs when someone acknowledges their own personality and behaviors. This can occur in both the private and public parts of a person&#x27;s life.
* Self-esteem describes how a person evaluates their self. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are; reactions from others, comparing a person to others, a person&#x27;s social roles, and a person&#x27;s identification. 

=== Interpersonal Self ===
The Interpersonal self, also known as the public self, refers to the part of the self that can be seen by other members of society. Because society has &quot;unwritten rules&quot;, a person may find themselves in a specific role that adheres to these rules and expected behaviors…

=== Agent Self (non self) ===
The agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how a person make choices and maintains control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding.

=== George-Mead &amp; Charles Clooney ===
Symbolic interactionism stresses the &#x27;social construction of an individual&#x27;s sense of self&#x27; through two main methods: &#x27;In part the self emerges through interaction with others...But the self is a product of social structure as well as of face-to-face interaction&#x27;. This aspect of social psychology emphasizes the theme of mutual constitution of the person and situation. Instead of focusing on the levels of class, race, and gender structure, this perspective seeks to understand the self in the way an individual lives their life on a moment-by-moment basis.

==== Self as an Emergent Phenomena ====
In dynamical social psychology as proposed by Nowak &quot;et al.&quot;, the self is rather an emergent property that emerges as an experiential phenomena from the interaction of psychological perceptions and experiences. This is also hinted in dynamical evolutionary social psychology where a set of decision rules generates complex behavior.

==Memory and the Self==

=== Martin A. Conway ===

Memory and the self are interconnected to the point that they can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person&#x27;s long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory and what it consists of.

=== John Locke ===

One view of the Self that follows the thinking of John Locke, sees it as a product of episodic memory. It has been suggested that transitory mental constructions within episodic memory form a self-memory system that grounds the goals of the working self, but research upon those with amnesia find they have a coherent sense of self based upon preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge, and semantic facts, and so conceptual knowledge rather than episodic memory.

Both episodic and semantic memory systems have been proposed to generate a sense of self-identity: personal episodic memory enables the phenomenological continuity of identity, while personal semantic memory generates the narrative continuity of identity. &quot;The nature of personal narratives depends on highly conceptual and ‘story-like&#x27; information about one&#x27;s life, which resides at the general event level of autobiographical memory and is thus unlikely to rely on more event-specific episodic systems.&quot;

<text>The decade of the 1920s in film involved many significant films.

==Events==
The 1920s saw a vast expansion of Hollywood film making and worldwide film attendance. Throughout the decade, film production increasingly focused on the feature film rather than the &quot;short&quot; or &quot;two-reeler.&quot; This is a change that had begun with works like the long D. W. Griffith epics of the mid-1910s and became the primary style by the 1920s. In Hollywood, numerous small studios were taken over and made a part of larger studios, creating the studio system that would run the American, Spanish, and Polish pool, open to the public film making until the 1960s. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (founded in the middle of the decade) and Paramount Pictures were the highest-grossing studios during the period, with 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, United Artists, and Warner Brothers making up a large part of the remaining market.

The 1920s was also the decade of the &quot;Picture Palaces&quot;: large urban theaters that could seat 1–2,000 guests at a time, with full orchestral accompaniment and very decorative design (often a mix of Italian, Spanish, and Baroque styles). These picture palaces were often owned by the film studios and used to premier and first-run their major films.

Key genres such as the swashbuckler, horror, and modern romantic comedy flourished during the decade. Stars such as Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Novarro, Pola Negri, Nazimova, Greta Garbo, Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Francis X. Bushman, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Lon Chaney, Rudolph Valentino, John Gilbert, Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, George O&#x27;Brien, and John Barrymore created some of their most memorable roles and films during the period.

Stylistically, the influence of German Expressionism, Soviet Montage Editing, and realism made profound aesthetic changes to film over the course of the decade. A more artistic approach to composition on the screen shifted filmmaking away from its earlier obsession with showing the world &quot;as it is.&quot; By the mid-to-late-1920s, the silent &quot;art film&quot; was on the rise with some of the greatest silent film achievements, such as Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;The Last Command&quot;, King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Crowd&quot;, and F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s ultra-realist films such as &quot;Greed&quot; also had a big influence.

The transition to sound-on-film technology occurred mid-decade with the talkies developed in 1926–1927, following experimental techniques begun in the late 1910s. Fox Studios and the Warner Brothers were crucial in the development and acceptance of the technology of sound in motion pictures.

With sound, the concept of the musical appeared immediately, as in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; of 1927, because silent films had been accompanied by music for years when projected in theaters. Sound also greatly changed the Hollywood approach to storytelling, with more dependence on dialogue and less creative use of the visual element.

Also, in 1927, the International Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was formed. Later, &quot;International&quot; was removed from the name. Today, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, is most famous for its annual presentation of the Academy Awards, also known as the &quot;Oscars&quot;.

<text>RobotWar is a programming game written by Silas Warner. This game, along with the companion program RobotWrite, was originally developed in the TUTOR programming language on the PLATO system in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the Apple II and published by Muse Software in 1981. The premise is that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat robots. As the manual states, &quot;The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!&quot;

The main activity of the game is to write a computer program that operates a (simulated) robot. The player selects multiple robots which do battle in an arena until only one is left standing. The robots do not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever programming techniques to deduce velocity. There is no way for the player to actually take part in the battle.

==Robot programming==
The robots&#x27; language is similar to BASIC. There are 34 registers that can be used as variables or for the robots&#x27; I/O functions. An example program from the game manual is:

 SCAN
 AIM + 5 TO AIM ; MOVE GUN
 AIM TO RADAR ; SEND RADAR PULSE
 LOOP
 IF RADAR &lt; 0 GOSUB FIRE ; TEST RADAR
 GOTO SCAN
 FIRE
 0 - RADAR TO SHOT ; FIRE THE GUN
 ENDSUB

The robot with this program sweeps its radar in a circle, firing off radar pulses, and when it detects another robot, fires a projectile set to explode at the correct distance as estimated by the radar pulse. This particular robot stands still throughout the entire battle, as it never assigns any number to its movement registers.

==Reception==
Harry White reviewed &quot;RobotWar&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 45. White commented that &quot;&quot;RobotWar&quot; is worth [...] the price. And if you don&#x27;t have an Apple, but do own some other brand of personal computer, just wait - there&#x27;ll be a similar game for you soon. It has to happen.&quot;

In its first issue &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;RobotWar&quot;″s language as easy to learn, and for several years hosted contests for robot programs. In 1996, the magazine named it the 85th best game ever. &quot;BYTE&quot; also praised Battle Language and its potential for teaching programming, as well as the sophisticated editor and debugger, but noted that the language&#x27;s slow performance caused robots to sometimes behave in unexpected ways.

In a 2020 interview, Stewart Cheifet, the host and producer of &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot; told ZDNET that RobotWar was one of his favorite games, telling them &quot;you didn&#x27;t fight and shoot, you programmed your robot, it was a battle between the software, the robot you designed, and the robot the other guy designed...it was brilliant.&quot;

<doc id="364022" wikidata="Q42841" url="?curid=364022" title="Incumbent">
<text>The incumbent is the current holder of an office or position. In an election, the incumbent is the person holding or acting in the position that is up for election, regardless of whether they are seeking re-election.

There may or may not be an incumbent on the ballot: the previous holder may have died, retired, resigned; they may not seek re-election, be barred from re-election due to term limits, or a new electoral division or position may have been created, at which point the office or position is regarded as vacant or open. In the United States, an election without an incumbent on the ballot is an open seat or open contest.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;incumbent&quot; is derived from the Latin verb &quot;incumbere&quot;, literally meaning &quot;to lean or lay upon&quot; with the present participle stem &quot;incumbent-&quot;, &quot;leaning a variant of &quot;encumber,&quot; while encumber is derived from the root &quot;cumber&quot;, most appropriately defined: &quot;To occupy obstructively or inconveniently; to block fill up with what hinders freedom of motion or action; to burden, load.&quot;

==Incumbency advantage==
In general, an incumbent has a political advantage over challengers at elections. Except when the timing of elections is determined by a constitution or by legislation, the incumbent in some countries may have the right to determine the date of an election.

For most political offices, the incumbent often has more name recognition due to their previous work in the office. Incumbents also have easier access to campaign finance, as well as government resources (such as the franking privilege) that can be indirectly used to boost the incumbent&#x27;s re-election campaign.

In the United States, an election (especially for a single-member constituency in a legislature) in which an incumbent is not seeking re-election is often called an &quot;open seat&quot;; because of the lack of incumbency advantage, these are often amongst the most hotly contested races in any election. Also, an open contest is created when the term of office is limited, as in the case of terms of the U.S. president being restricted to two four-year terms, and the incumbent is prohibited from recontesting. Although the expected advantage of incumbency has gone from about two percentage points in the 1950s, to ten percentage points in the 1980s and 1990s, and then back to about two percentage points in the 2010s and 2020s, the probability that an incumbent will lose his or her seat has remained approximately the same over the entire period.

When newcomers look to fill an open office, voters tend to compare and contrast the candidates&#x27; qualifications, positions on political issues, and personal characteristics in a relatively straightforward way. Elections featuring an incumbent, on the other hand, are, as Guy Molyneux puts it, &quot;fundamentally a referendum on the incumbent.&quot; Voters will first grapple with the record of the incumbent. Only if they decide to &quot;fire&quot; the incumbent do they begin to evaluate whether each of the challengers is an acceptable alternative.

A 2017 study in the &quot;British Journal of Political Science&quot; argues that the incumbency advantage stems from the fact that voters evaluate the incumbent&#x27;s ideology individually whereas they assume that any challenger shares his party&#x27;s ideology. This means that the incumbency advantage gets more significant as political polarization increases. A 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that incumbents have &quot;a far larger advantage&quot; in on-cycle elections than in off-cycle elections.

===Business usage===
In relation to business operations and competition, an incumbent supplier is usually the supplier who currently supplies the needs of a customer and therefore has an advantageous position in relation to maintaining this role or agreeing a new contract, in comparison with competing businesses.

===Sophomore surge===
Political analysts in the United States and United Kingdom have noted the existence of a sophomore surge (not known as such in the United Kingdom) in which first term representatives see an increase in votes after their first election. This phenomenon is said to bring an advantage of up to 10% for first-term representatives, which increases the incumbency advantage. However, the extent of the surge is a biased estimate of the electoral advantage of incumbency.

==Anti-incumbency==

However, there exist scenarios in which the incumbency factor itself leads to the downfall of the incumbent. Popularly known as the anti-incumbency factor, situations of this kind occur when the incumbent has proven themself not worthy of office during their tenure and the challengers demonstrate this to the voters. An anti-incumbency factor can also be responsible for bringing down incumbents who have been in office for many successive terms despite performance indicators, simply because the voters are convinced by the challengers of a need for change. It is also argued that the holders of extensively powerful offices are subject to immense pressure which leaves them politically impotent and unable to command enough public confidence for re-election; such is the case, for example, with the Presidency of France. Voters who experience the negative economic shock of a loss of income are less likely to vote for an incumbent candidate than those who have not experienced such a shock.

Nick Panagakis, a pollster, coined what he dubbed the &quot;incumbent rule&quot; in 1989—that any voter who claims to be undecided towards the end of the election will probably end up voting for a challenger.

In France, the phenomenon is known by the catchphrase &quot;Sortez les sortants&quot; (&quot;Get out the outgoing [representatives]!&quot;), which was the slogan of the Poujadist movement in the 1956 French legislative election.

<text>A Master of Public Administration (MPA) is a specialized professional graduate degree in public administration that prepares students for leadership roles, similar or equivalent to a Master of Business Administration but with an emphasis on the issues of public services.

This program covers principles of public administration, policy development, and management. Graduates can work in government, nonprofits, and private companies. The specifics of the program can vary by university or country. It typically requires two years for completion.

== Overview ==
The MPA program is a higher professional degree and a postgraduate degree for the public sector and it prepares individuals to serve as managers, executives and policy analysts in the executive arm of local, state/provincial, and federal/national government, and increasingly in non-governmental organization (NGO) and nonprofit sectors; it places a focus on the practices of executive organization and management. Instruction includes the roles, development, and principles of public administration; public policy management and implementation.

Through its history, the MPA degree has become more interdisciplinary by drawing from fields such as economics, sociology, law, anthropology, organizational development, political science, and regional planning in order to equip MPA graduates with skills and knowledge covering a broad range of topics and disciplines relevant to the public sector. A core curriculum of a typical MPA program usually includes courses on microeconomics, public finance, research methods, statistics, policy analysis, managerial accounting, ethics, public management, geographic information systems (GIS), and program evaluation. MPA students may focus their studies on public sector fields such as urban planning, emergency management, transportation, health care (especially public health), economic development, community development, non-profit management, environmental policy, cultural policy, international affairs, and criminal justice.

MPA graduates currently serve in some important positions within the public sector including the former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, three former presidents of Mexico (Felipe Calderón, Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Miguel de la Madrid), former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, former President of Bolivia Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former President of Ecuador Jamil Mahuad Witt (MPA &#x27;89), former President of Costa Rica José María Figueres Olsen, former CIA Director David Petraeus, former president of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Foreign Minister of Serbia Vuk Jeremić, former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, and former Treasurer of Australia Josh Frydenberg. Other notable MPA graduates include U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Bill O&#x27;Reilly and pilot Chesley Sullenberger.

A Master of Public Administration can be acquired at various institutions. See &quot;List of schools offering MPA degrees.&quot;

<text>The master of public policy (MPP) is one of several public policy degrees. An MPP is a master&#x27;s-level professional degree that provides training in policy analysis and program evaluation at public policy schools. The MPP program places a focus on the systematic analysis of issues related to public policy and the decision processes associated with them. This includes training in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation; microeconomic analysis of policy options and issues; resource allocation and decision modeling; cost/benefit analysis; statistical methods; and various applications to specific public policy topics. MPP graduates serve or have served in the public sector, at the international, national, subnational, and local levels and the private sector.

==MPP and MPA: differences and similarities==
Over time, the curriculum of master of public policy and the master of public administration (MPA) degrees have tended to overlap in many areas, due to the realization that policy analysts and program evaluators could benefit from an understanding of public administration, and vice versa.

Today, the core course offerings of many MPA and MPP programs are similar, with MPA programs also providing training in policy analysis, and MPP programs also providing coursework in program implementation. However, MPP programs still place more emphasis on policy analysis, research, and evaluation, while MPA programs place more emphasis on the implementation of public policies and the design of effective programs and projects to achieve public policy goals. In recognition of the overlapping coursework and subject matter, some universities have begun offering a combined MPAP or MPPA degree, master of public administration and policy or master of public policy and administration. Several institutions use &quot;public policy&quot; as an umbrella term, which may house several programs such as an MPA and degrees related to highly specific areas focusing on fields such as survey research or nonprofit studies.

Significant differences between the two degrees:

* The scope of each degree: An MPA has a broader focus, emphasizing the management and administration of public service organizations, while an MPP has a narrower focus, centering on the analysis of policy issues and the design of solutions for them.
* Coursework: An MPA typically entails a greater emphasis on management and administrative areas, including budgeting, personnel management, and public law. On the other hand, an MPP requires courses that place more emphasis on policy analysis, political theory, and research methods.
* Professional opportunities: With an MPA degree, you can explore diverse roles within the government or nonprofit sector, while an MPP degree is more likely to lead to policy-focused positions.
* Post-graduate programs: An MPA degree often serves as a stepping stone to various postgraduate programs, such as law school or public health administration. In contrast, an MPP degree does not usually offer as many opportunities for further study.
* Cost: Compared to the MPP program, an MPA program tends to be more expensive due to its additional coursework and longer duration.

==Interdisciplinary approach==
Over the years MPP programs have become more interdisciplinary drawing from economics, sociology, anthropology, politics, and regional planning. In general, a core curriculum of an MPP program includes courses on microeconomics, public finance, research methods, statistics and advanced data analysis, qualitative research, population methods, politics of policy process, policy analysis, ethics, public management, urban policy and GIS, program evaluation, and more.

All these courses are designed to equip MPP graduates with skills and knowledge in advanced economic analysis, political analysis, ethical analysis, data analysis, management and leadership. Depending on the interest, MPP students can concentrate in many policy areas including urban policy, global policy, social policy, health policy, energy and environmental policy, non-profit management, transportation, economic development, education, information technology, and population research.

<doc id="364032" wikidata="Q1380588" url="?curid=364032" title="Self-perception theory">
<text>Self-perception theory (SPT) is an account of attitude formation developed by psychologist Daryl Bem. It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude due to a lack of experience, etc.—and the emotional response is ambiguous) by observing their own behavior and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the conventional wisdom is that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states. The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others&#x27; behaviors.

==Bem&#x27;s original experiment==
In an attempt to decide if individuals induce their attitudes as observers without accessing their internal states, Bem used interpersonal simulations, in which an &quot;observer-participant&quot; is given a detailed description of one condition of a cognitive dissonance experiment. Subjects listened to a tape of a man enthusiastically describing a tedious peg-turning task.

Subjects were told that the man had been paid $20 for his testimonial and another group was told that he was paid $1. Those in the latter condition thought that the man must have enjoyed the task more than those in the $20 condition. The results obtained were similar to the original Festinger–Carlsmith experiment. Because the observers, who did not have access to the actors&#x27; internal cognition and mood states, were able to infer the true attitude of the actors, it is possible that the actors themselves also arrive at their attitudes by observing their own behavior. Specifically, Bem notes how &quot;the attitude statements which comprise the major dependent variables in dissonance experiments may be regarded as interpersonal judgments in which the observer and the observed happen to be the same individual.&quot;

==Further evidence==
There are numerous studies conducted by psychologists that support the self-perception theory, demonstrating that emotions do follow behaviors. For example, it is found that corresponding emotions (including liking, disliking, happiness, anger, etc.) were reported following from their overt behaviors, which had been manipulated by the experimenters. These behaviors included making different facial expressions, gazes, and postures. In the end of the experiment, subjects inferred and reported their affections and attitudes from their practiced behaviors despite the fact that they were told previously to act that way. These findings are consistent with the James–Lange theory of emotion.

In 1974, James Laird conducted two experiments on how changes in facial expression can trigger changes in emotion. Participants were asked to contract or relax various facial muscles, causing them to smile or frown without awareness of the nature of their expressions. Participants reported feeling more angry when frowning and happier when smiling. They also reported that cartoons viewed while they were smiling were more humorous than cartoons viewed while they were frowning. Furthermore, participants scored higher on aggression during frown trials than during smile trials, and scored higher on elation, surgency, and social affection factors during smile trials than during frown ones. Laird interpreted these results as &quot;indicating that an individual&#x27;s expressive behavior mediates the quality of his emotional experience.&quot; In other words, a person&#x27;s facial expression can act as a cause of an emotional state, rather than an effect; instead of smiling because they feel happy, a person can make themselves feel happy by smiling.

In 2006, Tiffany Ito and her colleagues conducted two studies to investigate if changes in facial expression can trigger changes in racial bias. The explicit goal of the studies was to determine &quot;whether facial feedback can modulate implicit racial bias as assessed by the Implicit Association Test (IAT).&quot; Participants were surreptitiously induced to smile through holding a pencil in their mouth while viewing photographs of unfamiliar black or white males or performed no somatic configuration while viewing the photographs (Study 1 only). All participants then completed the IAT with no facial manipulation. Results revealed a spreading attitude effect; people made to smile (unconsciously) at pictures of black males showed less implicit prejudice than those made to smile at pictures of white males. Their attitudes change as a result of their behavior.

Chaiken and Baldwin&#x27;s 1981 study on self-perception theory dealt with environmental attitudes. Each participant was identified as having well or poorly defined prior attitudes toward being an environmentalist or conservationist. Participants then completed one of two versions of a questionnaire designed to bring to mind either past pro-ecology behaviors or past anti-ecology behaviors. For example, questions such as &quot;Have you ever recycled?&quot; call to mind the times an individual has recycled, emphasizing their engagement in environmentalist behavior. On the other hand, questions like &quot;Do you always recycle?&quot; bring to mind all the times an individual did not recycle something, emphasizing a lack of environmentalist behavior. Afterward, participants&#x27; attitudes toward being an environmentalist/conservationist were re-measured. Those with strong initial/prior attitudes toward the environment were not really affected by the salient manipulation. Those with weak prior attitudes, however, were affected. At the end, those in the pro-ecology condition (&quot;Have you ever recycled?&quot;) reported themselves as being much more pro-environment than those in the anti-ecology condition (&quot;Do you always recycle?&quot;). Bringing to mind certain past behaviors affected what people believed their attitudes to be.

Evidence for the self-perception theory has also been seen in real life situations. After teenagers participated in repeated and sustained volunteering services, their attitudes were demonstrated to have shifted to be more caring and considerate towards others.

==Recent research==
Research incorporating self-perception theory has continued in recent years, appearing in conjunction with studies dealing with motivational &quot;crowding out,&quot; terrorism, mindwandering, and the inclusion of others in the self.

Guadagno and her fellow experimenters did a study in 2010 addressing the recruitment of new members by terrorist organization via the internet. In addition to looking at how such an organization might influence its targets to support more extreme ideologies (primarily through simple requests gradually increasing to larger commitments–an example of the foot-in-the-door technique), the authors looked at how &quot;the new converts may form increasingly radical attitudes to be consistent with their increasingly radical behavior.&quot; Self-perception theory, then, has strong ties to social identity and social influence in this scenario.

Also in 2010, Clayton Critcher and Thomas Gilovich performed four studies to test a connection between self-perception theory and mindwandering. Self-perception theory posits that people determine their attitudes and preferences by interpreting the meaning of their own behavior. Critcher and Gilovich looked at whether people also rely on the unobservable behavior that is their mindwandering when making inferences about their attitudes and preferences. They found that &quot;Having the mind wander to positive events, to concurrent as opposed to past activities, and to many events rather than just one tends to be attributed to boredom and therefore leads to perceived dissatisfaction with an ongoing task.&quot; Participants relied on the content of their wandering minds as a cue to their attitudes unless an alternative cause for their mindwandering was brought to their attention.

Similarly, Goldstein and Cialdini published work related to self-perception theory in 2007. In an extension of self-perception theory, the authors hypothesized that people sometimes infer their own attributes or attitudes by &quot;observing the freely chosen actions of others with whom they feel a sense of merged identity – almost as if they had observed themselves performing the acts.&quot; Participants were made to feel a sense of merged identity with an actor through a perspective-taking task or feedback indicating overlapping brainwave patterns. Participants incorporated attributes relevant to the actor&#x27;s behavior into their own self-concepts, leading participants to then change their own behaviors. The study addresses the self-expansion model: close relationships can lead to an inclusion of another person in an individual&#x27;s sense of self.

==Applications==
One useful application of the self-perception theory is in changing attitude, both therapeutically and in terms of persuasion.

===Psychological therapy===

For therapies, self-perception theory holds a different view of psychological problems from the traditional perspectives. Traditionally, psychological problems come from the inner part of the clients. However, self-perception theory perspective suggests that people derive their inner feelings or abilities from their external behaviors. If those behaviors are maladjusted ones, people will attribute those maladjustments to their poor adapting abilities and thus suffer from the corresponding psychological problems. Thus, this concept can be used to treat clients with psychological problems that resulted from maladjustments by guiding them to first change their behavior and later dealing with the &quot;problems&quot;.

One of the most famous therapies making use of this concept is therapy for &quot;heterosocial anxiety&quot;. In this case, the assumption is that an individual perceives that he or she has poor social skills because he/she has no dates. Experiments showed that males with heterosocial anxiety perceived less anxiety with females after several sessions of therapy in which they engaged in a 12-minute, purposefully biased dyadic social interactions with a separate females. From these apparently successful interactions, the males inferred that their heterosocial anxiety was reduced. This effect is shown to be quite long-lasting as the reduction in perceived heterosocial anxiety resulted in a significantly greater number of dates among subjects 6 months later.

===Marketing and persuasion===

Self-perception theory is also an underlying mechanism for the effectiveness of many marketing or persuasive techniques. One typical example is the foot-in-the-door technique, which is a widely used marketing technique for persuading target customers to buy products. The basic premise of this technique is that, once a person complies with a small request (e.g. filling in a short questionnaire), he/she will be more likely to comply with a more substantial request which is related to the original request (e.g. buying the related product). The idea is that the initial commitment on the small request will change one&#x27;s self-image, therefore giving reasons for agreeing with the subsequent, larger request. It is because people observe their own behaviors (paying attention to and complying with the initial request) and the context in which they behave (no obvious incentive to do so), and thus infer they must have a preference for those products.

==Challenges and criticisms==

Self-perception theory was initially proposed as an alternative to explain the experimental findings of the cognitive dissonance theory, and there were debates as to whether people experience attitude changes as an effort to reduce dissonance or as a result of self-perception processes. Based on the fact that the self-perception theory differs from the cognitive dissonance theory in that it does not hold that people experience a &quot;negative drive state&quot; called &quot;dissonance&quot; which they seek to relieve, the following experiment was carried out to compare the two theories under different conditions.

An early study on cognitive dissonance theory shows that people indeed experience arousal when their behavior is inconsistent with their previous attitude. Waterman designed an experiment in which 77 male college freshmen were asked to write an essay arguing against the position they actually agreed with. Then they were asked immediately to perform a simple task and a difficult task; their performance in both tasks was assessed. It was found that they performed better in the simple task and worse in the difficult task, compared to those who had just written an essay corresponding to their true attitude. As indicated by social facilitation, enhanced performance in simple tasks and worsened performance in difficult tasks shows that arousal is produced by people when their behavior is inconsistent with their attitude. Therefore, the cognitive dissonance theory is evident in this case.

==Apparent disproof==
Debate ensued over whether dissonance or self-perception was the valid mechanism behind attitude change. The chief difficulty lay in finding an experiment where the two flexible theories would make distinctly different predictions. Some prominent social psychologists such as Anthony Greenwald thought it would be impossible to distinguish between the two theories.

In 1974, Zanna and Cooper conducted an experiment in which individuals were made to write a counter-attitudinal essay. They were divided into either a low choice or a high choice condition. They were also given a placebo; they were told the placebo would induce either tension, relaxation, or exert no effect. Under low choice, all participants exhibited no attitude change, which would be predicted by both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory. Under high choice, participants who were told the placebo would produce tension exhibited no attitude change, and participants who were told the placebo would produce relaxation demonstrated larger attitude change.

These results are not explainable by self-perception theory, as arousal should have nothing to do with the mechanism underlying attitude change. Cognitive dissonance theory, however, was readily able to explain these results: if the participants could attribute their state of unpleasant arousal to the placebo, they would not have to alter their attitude.

==Truce experiment==
Fazio, Zanna, and Cooper conducted another experiment in 1977, demonstrating that both cognitive dissonance and self-perception could co-exist.

In an experimental design similar to Zanna and Cooper&#x27;s 1974 study, another variable was manipulated: whether or not the stance of the counter-attitudinal essay fell in the latitude of acceptance or the latitude of rejection (see social judgment theory). It appeared that when the stance of the essay fell into the latitude of rejection, the results favoured cognitive dissonance. However, when the essay fell in the latitude of acceptance, the results favoured self-perception theory.

Whether cognitive dissonance or self-perception is a more useful theory is a topic of considerable controversy and a large body of literature. There are some circumstances in which a certain theory is preferred, but it is traditional to use the terminology of cognitive dissonance theory by default. The cognitive dissonance theory accounts for attitude changes when people&#x27;s behaviors are inconsistent with their original attitudes which are clear and important to them; meanwhile, the self-perception theory is used when those original attitudes are relatively ambiguous and less important. Studies have shown that, in contrast to traditional belief, a large proportion of people&#x27;s attitudes are weak and vague. Thus, the self-perception theory is significant in interpreting one&#x27;s own attitudes, such as the assessment of one&#x27;s own personality traits and whether someone would cheat to achieve a goal.

According to G. Jademyr and Yojiyfus, the perception of different aspect in the interpreting theory can be due to many factors, such as circumstances regarding dissonance and controversy. This can also be because of balance theory as it applies to the attitude towards accountability and dimensions.

<text>Television in New Zealand was introduced in 1960 as a state-run service. The broadcasting sector was deregulated in 1989, when the Government allowed competition to the state-owned Television New Zealand (TVNZ). There are currently three forms of broadcast television: a terrestrial (DVB-T) service provided by Freeview; as well as satellite (DVB-S) and internet streaming (IPTV) services provided nationwide by both Freeview and Sky.

The first nationwide digital television service was launched in December 1998 by Sky, who had a monopoly on digital satellite television until the launch of Freeview&#x27;s nationwide digital satellite service in May 2007. The Freeview digital terrestrial service launched on 14 April 2008. A pay digital terrestrial service was launched in 2012 by Igloo and closed in 2017; this was a joint venture between Sky and TVNZ and provided Freeview UHF aerial channels along with eleven Sky channels. In July 2016, Sky announced that Igloo will be discontinued although Freeview channels will still be available. Up until 2023, Vodafone (now One NZ) operated an IPTV television service, with free-to-air channels and wholesale content from Sky.

The digital changeover in New Zealand began on 30 September 2012, when Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the West Coast (including parts of Tasman) switched off analogue television transmission. The rest of the South Island switched off analogue television transmission on 28 April 2013, followed by the lower North Island on 29 September 2013. The upper North Island (including the Waikato, Auckland, Bay of Plenty and Northland) was the last region to cease analogue transmissions on 1 December 2013.

The major free-to-air television operators are currently TVNZ (TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, and TVNZ Duke) and Warner Bros. Discovery (Three, Bravo, Eden, Rush and HGTV). Sky remains the dominant pay-TV operator, now operating on satellite and IPTV. 

== History ==
Full-time television broadcasting was first introduced in New Zealand in 1960 and transmitted from the NZBC&#x27;s existing 1YA radio broadcasting facility at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland, now home to the University of Auckland&#x27;s Gus Fisher Gallery. The annual television licence fee was £NZ4 ($8). Prime Minister Walter Nash had made a surprise announcement (a surprise both to the NZBS and to other members of the Labour government) in London in November 1959 that New Zealand would have television within twelve months; the system was to be state-owned but to carry commercials, and would be introduced in stages in the four main centres. The first non-experimental programme was transmitted on Wednesday 1 June 1960.

New Zealand, like Australia and most of western Europe, adopted the 625-line standard for television. In contrast, United Kingdom used the 405-line standard exclusively until 1964.

Initially, programming was done on a regional basis, with different services broadcasting from the main cities, AKTV2 in Auckland, being the first on 1 June 1960, followed in 1961 by CHTV3 in Christchurch on 1 June and WNTV1 in Wellington on 1 July, and then DNTV2 in Dunedin on 31 July 1962. There was no network between the stations at the time; tapes of shows were transferred between each station for broadcast, usually starting in Auckland and working their way south to Dunedin. Today, however, programming and scheduling is done in Auckland where all the major networks are now headquartered.

National won the 1960 election, and the new Minister of Broadcasting, Arthur Kinsella in the new National government rewrote the Broadcasting Act of 1936, and set up the state-owned New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) in 1962 to control public radio and television (although the party had been polarised between having a state-owned, private enterprise or mixed system).

The first broadcast relay stations were commissioned in 1963, extending television coverage to Hamilton, Tauranga and Palmerston North. Coverage was further expanded to Napier-Hastings and Invercargill in 1964, Timaru in 1965, and Whangārei and New Plymouth in 1966. In addition, a number of televiewers&#x27; societies were established to set up and operate their own translators.

Advertising was introduced to Aucklanders on 4 April 1961, and facilitated increasing transmission hours to twenty-eight per week. By 1962 there were 65,000 licences, by 1963 there were 80,000 licences and an estimated audience of 300,000 or one-eighth of the population, and by 1966 there were half a million licences. Television sets were added to the CPI basket in 1966. At the time, a 23-inch black-and-white &#x27;consolette&#x27; television set cost on average £131 ($262), equivalent to $5,600 in December 2021 dollars.

Initially, the hours of transmission were from 5pm until close at about 10pm, later extending, in 1966, to 2pm opening. A test pattern was transmitted from 9am to allow for adjustment of TV sets in homes by technicians.

The four stations were networked in 1969. The network was mostly complete in time for the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, with gaps filled by strategically-placed outside broadcasting vans to allow the film of the landing to be broadcast live across the country. The NZBC&#x27;s first live network news bulletin was read by Dougal Stevenson on 3 November 1969. The Warkworth satellite station opened in 1971, providing the first real-time television link between New Zealand and the rest of the world.

The NZBC had asked the Government for the approval of a second TV channel as early as 1964, but this was rejected as the Government considered increasing coverage of the existing TV service to be of greater priority. By 1971, however, two proposals for a second channel were under consideration: that of the NZBC for a non-commercial service; and a separate commercial channel to be operated by an Independent Television Corporation, headed by Gordon Dryden.

Although the Broadcasting Authority had favoured the Independent Television Corporation bid, the incoming Labour government favoured the NZBC&#x27;s application and awarded it the licence without any formal hearings beforehand. (Eventually, Independent Television was awarded NZ$50,000 in compensation.)

On Wednesday 31 October 1973, colour television using the Phase Alternating Line (PAL) system was introduced, in readiness for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, which were to be held in Christchurch in January and February 1974. In February 1975, black-and-white televisions sets cost on average $350 (equivalent to $3,900 in December 2021) while colour television sets cost on average $840 (equivalent to $9,400 in December 2021).

=== Reorganisation ===
The NZBC was dissolved on 1 April 1975, and the existing NZBC television service became Television One. The second channel, TV2 (later renamed South Pacific Television in 1976) launched on 30 June 1975. 

In 1977, the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ) was established, and in 1980, TV One and South Pacific (known once again as TV2) were merged into a single organisation, Television New Zealand (TVNZ).

=== Commercialisation ===
In 1988, following major economic reforms to the state sector, the BCNZ was dissolved. TVNZ and Radio New Zealand (RNZ) became separate &quot;State-Owned Enterprises&quot; (SOEs) which would have to compete commercially and return dividends to the Crown.

Rather than continuing to be used to directly fund TVNZ and RNZ, the licence fee, now called the broadcasting fee, was to be used for local content production and the state funding for non-commercial broadcasting in radio and television on a contestable basis. As part of wide-ranging reforms in the broadcasting sector, the Labour government of David Lange established the Broadcasting Commission, which became known as and finally called NZ On Air.

Broadcasting in New Zealand was deregulated in 1989. Restrictions on television advertising were also revised in 1989, so that the TVNZ channels could show advertisements anytime except Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day, and between 6am and noon on Sunday and Anzac Day. In November 1989, TV3, now known as Three became the first privately owned TV station in the country, finally ending the state monopoly. Restrictions on foreign ownership were also removed, and TV3 was subsequently sold to Canada&#x27;s CanWest. Sky TV, in which TVNZ originally had a small stake, began broadcasting New Zealand&#x27;s first pay TV service on three UHF channels in May 1990.

Although TVNZ had to compete with its commercial rivals through the 1990s, it maintained a dominant market position and paid a significant amount of its profits to the Crown in dividends. By 1998–1999, the National Party–led coalition was moving to privatise TVNZ and announced that the broadcasting fee would be discontinued. Since the 1970s, the licence fee had been capped at NZ$100 a year, and was not allowed to increase with inflation. In real terms, this meant that public funding of broadcasting in New Zealand was greatly reduced by the time of the broadcasting fee&#x27;s abolition.

However, the 1999 election saw a Labour-led coalition gain office. Over its next two terms, attempts were made to reintroduce public service functions to the sector. In 2003, TVNZ was restructured as a Crown-Owned Company with a public service Charter. The Charter, abolished by the Key National government in 2008, received a small amount of government subsidy, but TVNZ remains predominantly dependent on commercial revenue and is obliged to continue paying dividends to the Crown.

It can apply to NZ On Air (funded directly from the Government since 2000) for support in local content initiatives, such as drama and comedy, and funding of programming for minority groups such as gay, Christian and rural New Zealanders. The funding of Māori programming has since passed to Te Māngai Pāho, the Māori broadcasting commission.

In 2004, the Māori Television Service was established to promote Māori language and culture. MTS is funded partly through direct government funding and partly through commercial advertising, but is eligible for contestable programming funds from Te Mangai Paho.

In 2006, the Government announced the introduction of two new non-commercial digital television services operated by TVNZ, offering drama, arts, documentary and children&#x27;s programming called TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7. However, after a change of government, funding for the two channels was not renewed. In 2011, the children&#x27;s channel, TVNZ 6, was replaced by the commercial youth channel TVNZ U, leaving New Zealand with no free to air children&#x27;s television. TVNZ Kidzone 24 was subsequently established, but was only available behind a Sky TV pay wall before it ceased broadcasting in 2016. TVNZ 7 ceased broadcasting on 30 June 2012, with a number of its programs being picked up by other channels. In response, public broadcasting advocates announced plans to form a new lobby group, now known as Better Public Media.

In 2020, Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi issued proposals to re-merge TVNZ and RNZ into a unified public media organisation, Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media, amidst rapidly changing conditions in the media market. After Faafoi announced his retirement from politics, Willie Jackson was appointed as his successor to continue the merger process. In February 2023, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins scrapped plans to merge the two public broadcasters as part of a reorientation of government priorities towards living costs.

== Freeview ==

Freeview is a non-profit organisation providing free-to-air digital television and digital radio to New Zealand. The Freeview service is available via satellite throughout New Zealand. Freeview&#x27;s terrestrial service is a high definition digital terrestrial television service available to 75 percent of the country&#x27;s population, using DVB-S and DVB-T standards on government provided spectrum.

Analogue switchoff in New Zealand was completed on 1 December 2013. A major benefit of digital television is the ability to overcome the poor reception caused by New Zealand&#x27;s rugged topography. Digital TV offers more channels, better pictures and sound quality and new services such as on-screen programme guides.

It was estimated that on 31 December 2008, 198,938 Freeview certified set-top boxes and IDTVs had been sold since the platform&#x27;s launch (146,416 Satellite, 52,522 UHF). It is estimated that Freeview is in 12.6% of New Zealand homes (roughly 420,000 people). This makes it New Zealand&#x27;s third largest television platform, and New Zealand&#x27;s second largest digital platform. Freeview-certified set-top boxes and PVRs are available at most major New Zealand retailers. Cheaper, uncertified equipment can also be used.

==Regional channels==
New Zealand&#x27;s deregulated broadcasting environment has led to many regional stations (either non-commercial public service or privately owned) that broadcast only in one region or city. These stations mainly broadcast free to air on UHF frequencies, although some are carried on subscription TV. Content ranges from local news, access broadcasts, satellite sourced news, tourist information and Christian programming to music videos. Over a dozen regional television stations in New Zealand are grouped by the Regional Broadcasters Association.

==Free-to-air satellite channels==

Many digital channels are broadcast into New Zealand via satellite. These include Freeview, Sky, and many Australian and other channels. Most can be received using a standard blind-scan capable set-top box in addition to the standard 60 cm satellite dish that is fitted to many houses.

== Pay television channels ==
New Zealand has a number of television channels that are, or have been, only available on pay television networks.

* Sky: In 1990, Sky Network Television (then, and again now, unrelated to its UK namesake) launched three pay-TV channels offering movies, sport and news on UHF; these over time expanded to five. In 1998 it launched a multichannel digital satellite TV service. 

== Streaming ==
In 2007, streaming television entered the New Zealand market with the launch of TVNZ OnDemand. 

The first paid New Zealand television streaming service, Lightbox was launched in 2014. About one quarter of the population now use streaming as a form of television. Local paid service providers include:

* Neon
* Sky Sport Now

Free providers include: 
* Māori+
* ThreeNow
* TVNZ+

<text>The city of Moscow gradually grew around the Moscow Kremlin, beginning in the 14th century. It was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow (or Muscovy) and then the Tsardom of Russia until the capital was moved to Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great. Moscow was the capital of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918, which then became the Soviet Union (1922 to 1991), and since 1991 has served as capital of the Russian Federation.

Situated on either bank of the eponymous Moskva River, the city during the 16th to 17th centuries grew up in five concentric divisions, formerly separated from one another by walls: the Kremlin (&quot;fortress&quot;), Kitaigorod (&quot;walled town&quot;, but interpreted as &quot;Chinatown&quot; by folk etymology), Bielygorod (&quot;white town&quot;), Zemlianoigorod (&quot;earthworks town&quot;), and Miestchanskygorod (&quot;bourgeois town&quot;) outside the city walls.

After the fire of 1812, the city ramparts were replaced with the Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring roads, replacing the walls around Bielygorod and Zemlianoigorod, respectively. The city&#x27;s population grew from 250,000 to over a million in the 19th century, and from one to ten million in the 20th century, putting it among the top twenty of the world&#x27;s most populous cities today.

==Prehistory==
The oldest evidence of humans on the territory of Moscow dates from the Neolithic Schukinskaya site on the Moscow River. Within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered to be a burial ground of the Fatyanovskaya culture, as well as the site of an Iron Age settlement of the Dyakovo culture, on the territory of the Kremlin, Sparrow Hills, Setun River and Kuntsevskiy forest park, etc.

The name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River. There have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river. Finnic Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly &quot;Mustajoki&quot;, in English: &quot;Black river&quot;. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.

In the 9th century, the Oka River was part of the Volga trade route, and the upper Volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous Uralic peoples such as the Merya and the expanding Turkic (Volga Bulgars), Germanic (Varangians) and Slavic peoples.

The earliest East Slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper Volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the Vyatichi and Krivichi.
The Moskva River was incorporated as part of Rostov-Suzdal into the Kievan Rus in the 11th century. By CE 1100, a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the Neglinnaya River.

==Early history (1147–1283)==

The first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Sviatoslav Olgovich and Yuri Dolgorukiy. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.

In 1156, Kniaz Yury Dolgoruky fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the Mongol invasion of Rus, the Golden Horde burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.

The timber fort &quot;na Moskvě&quot; &quot;on the Moscow river&quot; was inherited by Daniel, the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father&#x27;s possessions.
Daniel was still a child at the time, and the fort was governed by (deputies), appointed by Daniel&#x27;s paternal uncle, Yaroslav of Tver.

Daniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.
Daniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord&#x27;s Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.

==Grand Duchy (1283–1547)==

Daniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city which would eventually eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.

In 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery of Moscow on the right bank of the Moskva River, the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite. It is now known as the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.

Moscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.

While the Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow&#x27;s influence, when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. Afterwards, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control and overthrew the Mongols. Moscow later became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia, and parts of many other lands.
In 1462 Ivan III, known as Ivan the Great (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. By this conquest Ivan III enlarged his territory seven-fold, expanding from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometers. He took control of the ancient &quot;Novgorod Chronicle&quot; and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.

The original Moscow Kremlin was built during the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin&#x27;s Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.
A trading settlement, or &quot;posad&quot;, grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as &quot;Zaradye&quot; (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the Red Square, originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.

In 1508–1516, the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin (Novy) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the , had a length of 541 meters, a width of 36 meters, and a depth of 9.5–13 m. It was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, 4-meter-thick cogged brick walls.


==Tsardom (1547–1721)==
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin. The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.

The Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as &quot;Bielokamennaya&quot;, the &quot;White-Walled&quot;. The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.
Three square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Savior and St. Nicholas which hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral.

The Russian famine of 1601–1603 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Lithuanians occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty.

During the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the &quot;Meshchanskaya sloboda&quot;, after Ruthenian &quot;meshchane&quot; &quot;town people&quot;. The term &quot;meshchane&quot; (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means &quot;petty bourgeois&quot; or &quot;narrow-minded philistine&quot;.

The entire city of the late 17th century, including the slobodas which grew up outside of the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow&#x27;s Central Administrative Okrug.

Numerous disasters befell the city. The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654–55. Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.

==Empire (1721–1917)==

Moscow ceased to be Russia&#x27;s capital (except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council) when Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast in 1712.

After losing the status as capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.
By 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets were lit by gas. In 1883, near the , arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 25 miles long, the Kamer-Kollezhsky rampart, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called &quot;val&quot; ().
Between 1781 and 1804 the (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813 a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-center. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time were the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury, the Moscow University, the Moscow Manege (Riding School), and the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1903 the began operations.
In the early 19th century, the arch of the &#x27;s gate was paved with bricks, but the Spasskaya Tower was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge, and stone platforms (&quot;&quot;) were built nearby for guns. The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.

The road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as &quot;Peterburskoye Schosse&quot; after it was paved in the 1780s. Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov as a railway station specifically reserved for royal journeys from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, while coaches for lesser classes arrived and departed from Vsekhsvyatskoye station.

When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected today that the Moscow fire which ensued initially started as a result of Russian sabotage. In the fire&#x27;s wake, an estimated three-quarters of the city lay in ruin.

Moscow State University was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi. The &quot;Moskovskiye Vedomosti&quot; newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.

The Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.

In the 1830s, general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day Belorussky Rail Terminal) was inaugurated in 1870. Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century the home of the tsar&#x27;s falconers well outside of Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902.

In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and became Moscow&#x27;s first official mayor.

The 645-kilometer long railway between Moscow and Saint-Petersburg began operating in 1851. While technically it was not the first railway in Russia, its construction is generally seen as the beginning of the railway era in Russia. As railways grew in subsequent decades, Moscow served as the central railway hub of Russia.

When Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city&#x27;s filth and smell of sewage was depicted by observers as a symptom of the disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine&#x27;s plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia&#x27;s failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.

==Soviet era (1917–1991)==


In November 1917, upon learning of the uprising happening in Petrograd, Moscow’s Bolsheviks also began their uprising. On November 2 (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow. 

Then Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) back to Moscow on March 12, 1918. 

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet State Committee of Defense and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people) and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. On 6 December 1941, German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944 a medal &quot;For the defense of Moscow&quot; and in 1947 another medal &quot;In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow&quot; were instituted.

During the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of high-rise apartments. Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film &quot;Irony of Fate&quot; parodies this construction method.

The city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 km from the city center to the north-west, along the Leningradskoye Shosse, and incorporated as one of Moscow&#x27;s administrative okrugs. Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953.

On May 8, 1965 due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City. In 1980 it hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

The MKAD ring road was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109 km along the city borders.
The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s, when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated.

In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservators opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.

===Metro===
The Moscow Metro opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new &quot;Homo Sovieticus.&quot; (Soviet man). The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity. Soviet workers did the labor and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock. The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city&#x27;s physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.

Until nowadays Moscow metro is one of the most important heritage of architecture of the USSR period. The most inspiring metro stations of the Stalin&#x27;s era are Revolution Square, Kievskaya, Beloruskaya, Mayakovskaya, Novoslobodskaya, Dostoevskaya, Prospekt mira, Komsomolskaya and Taganskaya.

==Recent history (1991 to present)==

When the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow became the capital of the Russian Federation. Since then a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.

Even with Russia&#x27;s population shrinking by 6 million after the fall of the USSR, Moscow has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by a heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes. In December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.

==Historical demographics==

The city&#x27;s population is rapidly increasing. The ubiquitous presence of legal and illegal permanent and temporary migrants plus merging suburbs raise the total population to about 13.5 million people.

<text>The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is the public broadcaster in South Africa, and provides 19 radio stations (AM/FM) as well as 6 television broadcasts and 3 OTT Services to the general public. It is one of the largest of South Africa&#x27;s state-owned enterprises and the biggest state broadcaster in Africa.

In November 2022, the SABC launched its streaming service called SABC+.

It owns the biggest commercial radio station in the country Metro FM 

Opposition politicians and civil society often criticise the SABC, accusing it of being a mouthpiece for whichever political party is in majority power, thus currently the ruling African National Congress; during the apartheid era it was accused of playing the same role for the National Party government.

==Company history==
===Early years===
Radio broadcasting in South Africa began in 1923, under the auspices of South African Railways, before three radio services were licensed: the Association of Scientific and Technical Societies (AS&amp;TS) in Johannesburg, the Cape Peninsular Publicity Association in Cape Town and the Durban Corporation, which began broadcasting in 1924.

These merged into the African Broadcasting Company in 1927, owned by, I. W. Schlesinger, a wealthy businessman, but on 1 August 1936, they were sold to the SABC, established that year through an Act of Parliament. The SABC took over the African Broadcasting Company&#x27;s staff and assets. It maintained a state monopoly on radio until the launch in December 1979 of Capital Radio 604, then Radio 702 in 1980. Although the subscription-funded television service M-Net launched in 1986, the SABC had a monopoly on free-to-air television until the launch of e.tv in 1998.

During National Party rule from 1948, it came under increasing accusations of being biased towards the ruling party. At one time most of its senior management were members of the Broederbond, the Afrikaner secret society and later from institutions like Stellenbosch University.

The SABC was a radio service until the introduction of television in 1976. There were three main SABC radio stations: the English Service (later known as Radio South Africa), the Afrikaans Service (later known as Radio Suid-Afrika and Afrikaans Stereo) and the commercial station, Springbok Radio.

Programmes on the English and Afrikaans services mainly consisted of news; plays such as &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, &quot;Story of an African Farm&quot;, and &quot;The Summons&quot;, written and produced in South Africa; serious talk shows; BBC radio shows; children&#x27;s programmes, such as &quot;Sound Box&quot;; and light music featuring South African orchestras, arrangers, musicians and singers. Accomplished musicians such as pianist and composer Charles Segal featured on all three stations regularly in shows like &quot;Piano Playtime&quot;. Accordionist Nico Carstens was a regular on the Afrikaans programmes.

=== Recent history ===

An IBA report on the state of the broadcasting industry in South Africa was released on 29 August 1995. Recommendations were given for the SABC to lose one of its three television channels, with the network being used for private television, demanding the creation of two or three private networks. The broadcaster would be restructured, and Sentech would be separated. Other recommendations included the sale of seven radio stations, while being granted eleven radio stations, nine of which in individual Bantu languages, provisions of an hour a day of regional programming windows on television and radio, at an estimated cost of 262 million rand/year, reintroduction of a third channel but on satellite television and the provision of an &quot;education and information driven service&quot; to the subcontinental region. 

All of the channels were set to be rebranded by March 1996, in line with a restructuring that began in the 1993 CODESA talks. Preliminary changes were set to take place in 1993, but were delayed after the elections in April 1994.

In November 1995, Africa Monitor reported that the SABC was in talks with Channel 4 to deliver its television channels by satellite, to cover the entire population. Up until then, it was believed that a quarter of the national population received at least one of the three channels. By January 1996 a fourth channel carrying Channel 4&#x27;s programmes was set to begin, and would convert to digital in July 1996, with the aim of creating an eight-channel pay-TV service.

At the end of 1995, the SABC lost its contract with Sky News. Footage on news bulletins broadcast by the corporation&#x27;s television channels was now supplied by BBC World.

On 4 February 1996, two years after the ANC came to power, the SABC reorganised its three TV channels, so as to be more representative of different language groups. The repositioning of the networks gave the SABC&#x27;s television service the chance to be &quot;the new voice and the new vision of the rainbow nation&quot;. Under the new structure, SABC TV was compared to a &quot;tower of Babel&quot; regarding SABC 1 and SABC 2&#x27;s programming structure, in the eleven official languages, while SABC 3 was all in English. The relaunch party was also heavily criticised by some, such as Angela Van Schalkwyk, who mentioned that an American face presented the new television offer. This resulted in the downgrading of Afrikaans by reducing its airtime from 50% to 15%, a move that alienated many Afrikaans speakers. Starting July 1997, the corporation was commercialised.

In late 1998, the SABC finally started broadcasting its channels on DStv, per an agreement with Sentech to convert its channels to digital. The agreement encompassed its three national terrestrial networks, Bop TV and its thirteen radio stations, with the hopes of starting two pan-continental television networks, an entertainment channel and a news channel.

The launch of e.tv prompted the SABC to restructure its three television channels in late September 1998. The strategies were due to e.tv&#x27;s promise that the service would be a &quot;full-spectrum&quot; channel as opposed to the niche programming of both the SABC and M-Net. SABC 1 repositioned itself as an entertainment channel for South African youth and young adults, SABC 2 would carry content related to educational and social issues from the rest of Africa to South African audiences, SABC 3 concentrated on a mix of news, current affairs and entertainment. Two satellite channels, available on DStv, opened on 16 November 1998, SABC Africa and Best of Africa (later renamed Africa2Africa).

In line with its ambitions to be &quot;the pulse of Africa&#x27;s creative spirit&quot; (SABC&#x27;s tagline at the turn of the millennium), the SABC opened up to protocols and co-operation agreements with partners such as URTNA, FRU and the Television Trust for the Environment, eyeing in at the rest of Africa.

The SABC has since been accused of favouring the ruling ANC party, mostly in news. It remains dominant in the broadcast media.

Criticism intensified around 2003–2005, when it was accused of a wide range of shortcomings including self-censorship, lack of objectivity and selective news coverage.

On 20 October 2020, SABC and the government were in discussion to get TV and streaming providers in South Africa to collect TV licence on their behalf.

On 27 March 2021, SABC and eMedia Investments expanded their partnership which allowed OpenView customers to receive 3 additional channels as well as their 19 radio stations.

===Establishment===
Following its establishment in 1936, the SABC established services in what were then the country&#x27;s official languages, English and Afrikaans, with the Afrikaans service being established in 1937. Broadcasts in languages such as Zulu, Xhosa, Sesotho and Tswana followed in 1940.

=== Springbok Radio ===
Springbok Radio, the SABC&#x27;s first commercial radio service, started broadcasting on 1 May 1950. Bilingual in English and Afrikaans, it broadcast from the Johannesburg Centre for hours a week. The service proved to be so popular with advertisers that at the time of its launch, commercial time had been booked well in advance.

The station featured a wide variety of programming, such as morning talk and news, game shows, soap operas like &quot;Basis Bravo&quot;, children&#x27;s programming, music request programmes, top-ten music, talent shows and other musical entertainment. One popular Saturday noontime comedy show was &quot;Telefun Time&quot;, whose hosts would phone various people and conjure up situation comedy, a similar brand of humour to the films of Leon Schuster.

By 1985, Springbok Radio was operating at a heavy loss. After losing many listeners with the handing over of its shortwave frequencies to Radio 5 and facing competition from television, it ceased broadcasting on 31 December 1985.

=== SABC News Service ===
The News Service was established in June 1950, replacing the programmes of the BBC. Although this was because the BBC broadcasts were seen as giving a British viewpoint of current affairs, there were also concerns that the SABC service would become overly pro-government, or &quot;Our Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. By 1968, it had over 100 full-time reporters in the main cities and local correspondents all over the country, with overseas news provided by Reuters, AFP, AP and UPI. There was a News Film Unit which, prior to television in 1976, produced films for news agencies and television organisations.

=== SABC Symphony Orchestra ===
The SABC Symphony Orchestra has its origins in its three studio ensembles in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town and the Municipal Orchestra of the Johannesburg City Council. When the SABC centralised its broadcasting in Johannesburg, the future of the three ensembles were in doubt but at the same time, the Municipal Orchestra of the Johannesburg City Council had been disbanded. The SABC was able to form an orchestra of 80 musicians from these groupings in 1954, and while its main base was at the Johannesburg City Hall, it would tour the country. The orchestra would be led for many years by the SABC&#x27;s head of music, Anton Hartman, but had other conductors as well, such as Francesco Mander and Edgar Cree. There were also international composers such as Igor Stravinsky. The SABC Junior Orchestra was also created and began in February 1966 under Walter Mony.

=== Regional radio ===
Regional commercial FM music stations were started in the 1960s.
=== Popular music ===
Following the establishment of a republic and withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961, the Afrikaners&#x27; goal was to promote their culture and so, at first, the SABC&#x27;s choice of popular music reflected the National Party government&#x27;s initial conservatism, especially on the Afrikaans channel, with musicians such as Nico Carstens. However Carstens was also ostracised by the SABC, as his music was influenced by the Coloured and Malay communities of Cape Town.

Eventually, musicians broke through the barrier, when the young, English-speaking Jewish musician and composer, Charles Segal collaborated with the older Afrikaans lyric-writer, Anton Dewaal, to write songs. Segal&#x27;s songs like &quot;Die Ou Kalahari&quot; became highly popular with the Afrikaans-speaking public. However, there was tight censorship over all broadcasts, particularly of pop music, with, for example, the music of the Beatles being banned by the SABC between 1966 and March 1971.

In 1966 the SABC established an external service, known as Radio RSA, which broadcast in English, Swahili, French, Portuguese, Dutch and German. In 1969 the SABC held a national contest to find theme music for the service. This contest was won by the popular South African pianist and composer, Charles Segal and co-writer, Dorothy Arenson. Their composition, &quot;Carousel&quot; remained the theme song for Radio RSA until 1992, when it was replaced by Channel Africa.

In 1986, the SABC ran a competition to promote South African music. Each of the 15 radio stations, represented by an artist, entered a song to compete for the Song for South Africa in the National Song Festival. The finals were broadcast live on television. The Radio Port Natal submission won the competition with the Don Clarke song, &quot;Sanbonani&quot;, performed by P J Powers and Hotline.

SABC compiled the album sales chart from the end of 1981 to 1995, and the singles sales chart from 1958 to 1989 when singles stopped being manufactured.

===1996 restructuring===
In 1996 the SABC carried out a significant restructuring of their services. The main English-language radio service became SAfm. The new service, after some initial faltering, soon developed a respectable listenership and was regarded as a flagship for the new democracy. However, government interference in the state broadcaster in 2003 saw further changes to SAfm which reversed the growth and put it in rapid decline once more. Today it attracts only 0.6% of the total population to its broadcasts. The main Afrikaans radio service was renamed Radio Sonder Grense (literally &#x27;Radio Without Borders&#x27;) in 1995 and has enjoyed greater success with the transition.

By contrast, SABC Radio&#x27;s competitors, like Primedia-owned Radio 702, Cape Talk and 94.7 Highveld Stereo have grown steadily in audience and revenue, while other stations such as the black-owned and focused YFM and Kaya FM have also attracted black audiences.

=== Programming policy ===
As of 12 May 2016, the SABC has implemented a policy to promote local content. 90% of all music played on the broadcaster&#x27;s 18 radio stations will be sourced from local artists with a focus on kwaito, jazz, reggae and gospel genres.

===Early history (1975–1995)===

In 1975, after years of controversy over the introduction of television, the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a colour TV service, which began experimental broadcasts in the main cities on 5 May 1975, before the service went nationwide on 6 January 1976. Initially, the TV service was funded entirely through a licence fee just like the UK, but began advertising in 1978. The SABC (both Television and Radio) is still partly funded by the licence fee (currently R250 a year).

The service initially broadcast only in English and Afrikaans, with an emphasis on religious programming on Sundays. A local soap opera, &quot;The Villagers&quot;, set on a gold mine, was well received while other local productions like &quot;The Dingleys&quot; were panned as amateurish.

The majority of acquired programming on South African television came from the United States, although owing to their opposition to apartheid, some production companies stopped selling programmes to the country.
The British actors&#x27; union Equity had already started a boycott of programme sales to South Africa, which was not lifted until 1993. However, the Thames Television police drama series &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, were briefly shown on SABC TV, as was the original version of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Many imported programmes were dubbed into Afrikaans and other indigenous languages, but in 1985, in order to accommodate English speakers, the SABC began to simulcast the original-language audio of series on an FM radio service called Radio 2000, allowing viewers to watch them in the original language; the first English-language series to be simulcast was &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

SABC TV also produced lavish musical shows featuring the most popular South African composers, solo musicians, bands and orchestras. For example, the pianist and composer, Charles Segal, was given a half-hour special show: &quot;The Music of Charles Segal&quot;, where a selection of his music was performed by various local artists, such as Zane Adams, SABC Orchestra and others. However, it also broadcast pop music series like &quot;Pop Shop&quot;, which consisted of overseas and local music, and &quot;Double Track&quot;, which consisted entirely of local acts.

With a limited budget, early programming aimed at children tended to be quite innovative, and programmes such as the Afrikaans-language puppet shows &quot;Haas Das se Nuus Kas&quot; and &quot;Oscar in Asblikfontein&quot; are still fondly remembered by many.

On 1 January 1981, two services were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, both targeted at a black urban audience. The main channel, then called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1986, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, taking over the frequencies used by TV2 and TV3, which then had to end broadcasting at 21:00.

In 1991, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or Topsport Surplus Sport, Topsport being the brand name for the SABC&#x27;s sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1993.

===Competition and restructuring===
In 1986, the SABC&#x27;s monopoly on the television industry was challenged by the launch of a subscription-based service known as M-Net, which was backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers. This service was prohibited from broadcasting its own news programmes, which were still the preserve of the SABC. Direct-to-home satellite television in South Africa began when M-Net&#x27;s parent company, Multichoice, launched its first-in-the-world digital satellite TV service, DStv, in 1995. At the time, SABC TV channels, were not broadcast on this network, but agreements were later reached that allowed DStv to carry the SABC channels as well. In 1998, the SABC&#x27;s dominance of free-to-air terrestrial television was further eroded by the launch of the first free-to-air private TV channel, e.tv.

In 1996, the SABC reorganised its three TV channels with the aim of making them more representative of the various cultural groups. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3. The SABC also absorbed the Bop TV channel of the former Bophuthatswana bantustan. Between 1996 and 1998, the SABC had a satellite television service called AstraSat, which operated two channels, AstraSport and AstraPlus. Technological problems and advertising losses led to the scrapping of the service.

SABC TV programmes in Afrikaans and other languages are now subtitled in English, but programmes in English are not usually subtitled in other languages, the perception being that all South Africans can understand English. Previously, subtitling was confined to productions like operas and operettas.
It was not used on TV1, on the assumption that most viewers understood both Afrikaans and English, nor on CCV, despite presenters using two or more different languages during a single programme.

===New services===
In 2005, the SABC announced proposed the creation of two complementary regional television channels, SABC4 and SABC5, to emphasise indigenous languages. SABC4, based in Mafikeng, was to be broadcast in Tswana, Sesotho, Pedi, Tsonga, Venda, and Afrikaans, to the northern provinces of the country, while SABC5, based in Cape Town, was to broadcast in Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, and Swazi, as well as Afrikaans, to the southern provinces. Unlike other SABC TV services, SABC4 and SABC5 were not to be available via satellite. Apart from soundbites on news or current affairs programmes, no English-language programming would be shown on either channel. However, the plans fell through and in 2015, the SABC stated that it would launch two new channels, SABC News and SABC Encore.

In 2013, the SABC announced plans to launch a new news channel, SABC News, to be available on DStv, instead of waiting for the introduction of digital terrestrial television.

In 2015, SABC partnered up with online TV platform Tuluntulu to launch two more channels which were SABC Education and SABC Children.

According to the SABC, the factors which are considered when deciding how much time a language gets on television are the following: how many home language speakers exist in the coverage area of a channel; the geographical spread of the language; the extent to which members of a language community are able to understand other languages; the extent of marginalisation of a language; the extent to which the language is understood by other South Africans; and whether there is available content that uses the language. SABC currently plans to launch five channels, the four of them being language-targeted:
*A channel targeting Tswana, Pedi and Sotho speakers
*A channel targeting Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi and Ndebele speakers
*A channel targeting Tsonga and Venda speakers
*A channel targeting Afrikaans speakers
*A SABC sports channel

SABC TV has an audience of over 30 million. SABC1 reaches 89% of the public, SABC2 reaches 91% of the public, and SABC3 reaches 77% of the public, according to the broadcaster. The SABC has 18 radio stations, which have more than 25 million weekly listeners.

In 2018, SABC scrapped part of the plans from 2015 and downsized their DTT plans from 18 TV channels to just 9 TV channels due to financial woes. The SABC have SABC 1-3 and News falling under the 9 channels with the rest being: 
*A sports channel
*A health channel
*A history channel
*A parliamentary channel
*An education channel

All these channels needed funding in order to materialize and without it the channels remain a dream. All of these channels will be craft through partnerships and a group executive at the SABC mentioned that if they are able to get the sports channel running in SD then they may be able to get a ninth channel which is history.

On 4 May 2020 amidst the coronavirus outbreak, the SABC launched its educational channel called SABC Education through DTT and YouTube with additional platforms added soon.

SABC Encore shut down from the end of May apparently MultiChoice and SABC agreement for the channel ended back in 2018 giving the channel a 2-year open window. The SABC said they were exploring other the idea of continuing the channel through another platform.

In November 2020, SABC signed a channel and radio distribution agreement with Telkom for their new streaming service. They also launched their own catch-up and video on demand streaming service called SABC Plus on 17 November 2022, similar to BBC iPlayer, following two years of announcements.

==Reception outside South Africa==
===Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini===

SABC television via satellite had also been widely available in neighbouring Lesotho and Eswatini, as well as Botswana. After complaints from rights holders in Botswana, SABC encrypted its TV channels, thereby cutting off viewers in those countries.

===Namibia===
Until 1979, the SABC operated broadcasting services in Namibia, which was then under South African rule, but in that year, these were transferred to the South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC). However, the SWABC retained technical personnel from the SABC, and a number of its programmes were prepared at the SABC&#x27;s studios in Johannesburg before being dispatched to Windhoek for transmission.

The SABC also helped the SWABC to establish a television service in 1981. This comprised a mix of programming in English, Afrikaans and German, 90 per cent of which came from or via the SABC. Programmes were shown locally a week after South Africa. The SWABC received SABC TV programming (which it recorded, edited and rebroadcast) first by using a microwave link, and later via an Intelsat satellite link. The SWABC became the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) after the country&#x27;s independence in 1990.

However, Walvis Bay, an enclave of South Africa in Namibia until 1994, received the SABC&#x27;s TV1 on a low-power repeater, which was broadcast live via Intelsat from 1986.

===Mozambique===
The cable company TV Cabo (Visabeira) offered SABC 1, SABC 3 and Bop TV in its first few years of operation. These alongside e.tv were removed due to rights issues, in a situation similar to what would happen in Botswana ten years later, being replaced by other channels from the DStv bouquet, in August 2003, causing uproar from subscribers.

==International services==

In 1998, the SABC began to broadcast two TV channels to the rest of Africa: SABC Africa, a news service, and Africa 2 Africa, entertainment programming from South Africa and other African countries, via DStv. In 2003, Africa 2 Africa was merged with SABC Africa to create a hybrid service, drawing programming from both sources. SABC Africa closed in August 2008 after the SABC&#x27;s contract with DStv was not renewed. In 2007, the SABC launched a 24-hour international news channel, SABC News International, but closed in 2010.

== Criticisms and controversies ==

=== Accusations of pro-ANC bias ===
The SABC has been accused of being a government and ruling party mouthpiece, particularly in the lead-up to the 2014 South African elections, particularly after it refused to air the campaign adverts of various opposition parties, and again in 2015 when it censored the video feeds of the 2015 State of the Nation address that portrayed the ANC and President Jacob Zuma in a negative light.
In 2015, Minister of Communications, Faith Muthambi reinforced the notion that the SABC was a state-owned company, and therefore, subject to control by the Department of Communications and the ruling party.

In August 2005, the SABC came under heavy fire from independent media and the public for failing to broadcast footage in which deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka was booed offstage by members of the ANC Youth League, who were showing support for the newly axed ex-deputy president, Jacob Zuma.

Rival broadcaster eTV publicly accused SABC of &#x27;biased reporting&#x27; for failing to show the video footage of the humiliated deputy president. Snuki Zikalala, Head of News and ex-ANC spokesperson retorted that their cameraman had not been present at the meeting. This claim was later established to be false when eTV footage was released which showed an SABC cameraman filming the incident.

The SABC&#x27;s government connections also came under scrutiny when, in April 2005, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was interviewed live by Zikalala, who is a former ANC political commissar. The interview was deemed by the public to have sidestepped &#x27;critical issues&#x27;, and to have avoided difficult questions regarding Mugabe&#x27;s radical land-reform policies and human rights violations.

=== Accusations of censorship ===

In May 2006, the SABC was accused of self-censorship when it decided not to air a documentary on South African president Thabo Mbeki, and in early June 2006, the news organisation requested that the producers (from Daylight Films) not speak about it. This was widely criticised by independent media groups. In response, the International Freedom of Expression Exchange issued an alert concerning the SABC&#x27;s apparent trend toward self-censorship.

In June 2006, the International Federation of Journalists denounced the cancelling of the Thabo Mbeki documentary, citing &quot;self-censorship&quot; and &quot;politically-influenced managers&quot;.

Also in June 2006, SAfm host John Perlman disclosed on air that the SABC had created a blacklist of commentators. A commission of inquiry was created by SABC CEO Dali Mpofu to investigate the allegations that individuals had been blacklisted at the behest of Zikalala. Perlman eventually resigned from SAfm, and the broadcaster came under heavy criticism from free media advocates.

Shortly before the ANC&#x27;s 2012 elective conference in Mangaung, the board of the SABC handed control of news, television, radio and sport to COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The board&#x27;s decision was interpreted by some at the SABC as a calculated attempt to ensure that an ANC faction close to President Jacob Zuma was given positive coverage. During a press conference held by the SABC on 6 December 2012, to explain why it had prevented three journalists from participating in a discussion on how the media would cover the ANC&#x27;s elective conference in Manguang, Hlaudi Motsoeneng said that whenever the ANC is discussed on the SABC an ANC party representative must be present.

In April 2014, journalists were warned by SABC chairperson, Ellen Zandile Tshabalala, that their phones were being wiretapped by the NIA, and reminded them to be loyal to the ANC ruling party. When challenged on the matter, Tshabalala insisted that her comments had been taken out of context. The scandal erupted at the same time that the DA official opposition accused the SABC of censorship when they stopped airing a television advert that referred to the ongoing Nkandlagate scandal.

In February 2015, the SABC was accused of censoring video and audio feeds of the State of the Nation address in Parliament, after opposition party EFF was forcefully ejected by armed plain-clothes policemen after interrupting the President&#x27;s speech. Footage of opposition party DA walking out in protest over the presence of the armed personnel was also censored. This was in addition to the presence of a signal-jamming device that prevented journalists and MP&#x27;s from being able to use their mobile devices to post news online.

The SABC was criticised for banning footage that showed protests and demonstrations in the run-up to the 2016 local elections. In July 2016, eight SABC journalists challenged the broadcaster&#x27;s decision to censor news items, and were dismissed from the organisation. A subsequent hearing at the Labour Court found the dismissals were unlawful and ordered the reinstatement of four of the full-time SABC employees. During this period the eight journalists, including Suna Venter, were subjected to a number of death threats and other forms of intimidation.

In October 2016, the South African parliament began investigating corruption allegations against SABC and its Group Executive of Corporate Affairs - Hlaudi Motsoeneng. On 12 December, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Motsoeneng be removed from office effective immediately.

=== SABC Encore&#x27;s launch party ===

At the channel&#x27;s launch event, the COO of SABC at the time used that event to rant about making pay-TV platforms like MultiChoice&#x27;s DStv pay for SABC 1-3 and how the SABC is run by a &#x27;blind person&#x27;. He also took the stage to call out those with their &#x27;lack of knowledge&#x27; over the deal the public broadcaster has for the channel alongside SABC News.

<doc id="364061" wikidata="Q7762216" url="?curid=364061" title="The Sandbaggers">
<text>The Sandbaggers is a British spy thriller television series created by Ian Mackintosh, about men and women on the front lines of the Cold War. Set contemporaneously with its original broadcast on ITV from 1978 to 1980, &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; examines the effect of espionage on the personal and professional lives of British intelligence officers and their American colleagues. All but three of the 20 episodes of the three series were written by Mackintosh, who died during the recording of series three. The series was produced in Leeds by Yorkshire Television.

==Premise==
Neil Burnside (Roy Marsden) is director of operations (D/Ops) in Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Although commonly known as MI6 among the general public, the service is only ever referred to as SIS in the series to reflect the ethos of realism and factual accuracy employed in the writing.

The series follows Burnside as he oversees a small, elite group of intelligence officers, the Special Operations Section, nicknamed &quot;Sandbaggers&quot;, composed of highly trained operatives whose missions tend to be politically sensitive or especially vital, such as escorting defectors across borders (or preventing defections from the UK), carrying out assassinations, or rescuing operatives from behind the Iron Curtain.

Several episodes revolve around Burnside&#x27;s frustration at trying to operate his directorate in the face of budget cuts and what he believes to be unwarranted bureaucratic or political interference.

One of the themes running through the series is the relationship between SIS and America&#x27;s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the UK-USA Agreement. Burnside goes to great lengths to preserve the agreement and the so-called &quot;special relationship&quot;, most notably in the episode of the same name (1-07).

==Series creator==

&quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; was created by Ian Mackintosh, a Scottish former naval officer turned television writer, who had previously achieved success with the acclaimed BBC television series &quot;Warship&quot;. He wrote all the episodes of the first two series of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot;, but in July 1979, during the shooting of the third series, he and his girlfriend—a British Airways stewardess—were declared lost at sea after their single-engine aircraft went missing over the Pacific Ocean near Alaska, following a radioed call for help. Some of the details surrounding their disappearance have caused speculation about what actually occurred, including their stop at an abandoned United States Air Force base and the fact that the plane happened to crash in the one small area that was not covered by either US or Soviet radar.

Mackintosh disappeared after he had written just four of the scripts for the third series, so other writers were called in to bring the episode count up to seven. &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; ends on an unresolved cliff hanger because the producers decided that no one else could write the series as well as Mackintosh had and chose not to continue it in his absence. Ray Lonnen, who played Sandbagger Willie Caine, indicated in correspondence with fans that there were plans for a follow-up season in which his character, using a wheelchair, had taken over Burnside&#x27;s role as Director of Special Operations.

Because of the atmosphere of authenticity that the scripts evoked and the liberal use of &quot;spook&quot; jargon, there has been speculation that Mackintosh might have been a former operative of SIS or had, at least, contact with the espionage community. This has extended to speculation that his disappearance was no accident or had to do with a secret mission he was undertaking. There is a possibility that Mackintosh may have been involved in intelligence operations during his time in the Royal Navy, but no conclusive evidence has surfaced. When asked, Mackintosh himself was always coy about whether he had been a spy.

Whether or not Mackintosh had any experience in the world of espionage, the organisational structure of SIS depicted in &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; is probably closer to that of the CIA than that of the SIS. There is no formal section of the SIS known as the Special Operations Section, as far as is publicly known, and there is no intelligence unit known as the Sandbaggers. However, the departures from accuracy in the show may have been deliberate, in order to avoid problems with the SIS under the Official Secrets Act. Ray Lonnen mentioned in an interview that one episode in the second series was vetoed because it dealt with sensitive information, which explains why the second series has only six episodes.

==Production and story style==

The series takes a realistic, unvarnished, and occasionally bleak look at espionage. &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; undercut many of the accepted conventions of the spy thriller genre, in direct contrast to the &quot;girls, guns, and gadgets&quot; of James Bond. Indeed the characters often explicitly disparage the fictitious world of James Bond and the romanticised view of espionage. As Burnside puts it in episode 1.01 &quot;First Principles&quot;:&quot;Special operations doesn&#x27;t mean going in with all guns blazing. It means special planning, special care. Fully briefed agents in possession of all possible alternatives. If you want James Bond, go to a library. But if you want a successful operation, sit at your desk and think. And then think again. Our battles aren&#x27;t fought at the end of a parachute, they&#x27;re won and lost in drab, dreary corridors in Westminster.&quot;&quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; features ordinary people doing extraordinary work. The scripts are laced with black humour, depicting the high emotional toll taken on espionage professionals who operate in a world of moral ambiguity. There are very few action sequences, and the equipment available to the operatives is standard and often outdated. Burnside is a harried spymaster who doesn&#x27;t drink; Willie Caine is an intelligence officer not a &quot;super spy&quot;, who abhors guns and violence, and is paid a basic civil servant&#x27;s salary.

The plots are complex, multi-layered, and unpredictable: regular characters are killed off abruptly, and surprise twists abound. Episodes consist of a series of conversations, but the dialogue is intelligent and frequently witty. In a typical episode, Burnside moves from office to office speaking (and arguing) with his colleagues across Whitehall and in the intelligence community. These are interspersed with scenes of the Sandbaggers operating in the field, or of the &quot;Ops Room&quot;, where missions are coordinated and controlled.

==Theme music==
The title theme music, composed by jazz pianist Roy Budd, establishes its rhythmic undertone with the cimbalom, an instrument often associated with spy thrillers (John Barry, for example, used the cimbalom in his scores for &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; and &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot;). From series 2 onwards, the theme contains an additional organ playing the same melody line. This version (or &#x27;mix&#x27;) was also used in the opening titles of episode 2 and episode 7 of series 1).

Unusually for an episodic drama, &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; is almost entirely devoid of incidental music. One notable exception is the last episode of series 1 (episode 7) where Burnside&#x27;s feelings get the better of him for reasons the audience (by then) fully understand.

== Locations ==
Most exterior filming was done in Leeds and the surrounding Yorkshire countryside. The producers successfully used the modernist and brutalist architecture available in Leeds and Yorkshire to create convincing vignettes of eastern bloc locations, but much of this has been redeveloped, reclad or demolished in recent years. Additional exteriors were filmed on location in London and Malta, otherwise the series uses stock footage and set-up shots of foreign locations. With the exception of a very few interior locations, most of the interiors were standing sets, shot on videotape, at Yorkshire Television&#x27;s studios on Kirkstall Road, Leeds. The contrast between the studio work and the location work on 16mm film is clear to see on screen.

The series uses several regular London locations to set the scene, most notably in and around Westminster. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office on Whitehall and the adjacent King Charles Street appear regularly, and this is where the statue of Robert Clive is sited, looking out into St James&#x27;s Park. The Boyle Street entrance to 25 Savile Row in Mayfair was used as SIS headquarters and despite some superficial changes it is still recognisable today. The former US Embassy on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair is the location of Jeff Ross&#x27;s office (and is now a hotel).

Episode-specific locations

1-01 &quot;First Principles&quot;. The Norwegian Embassy is at 25 Belgrave Square, London. Torvik and Burnside meet at Park Square, Leeds. Ross and Burnside meet by the Roosevelt memorial on Grosvenor Square, London. The crash site and tundra of the Kola Peninsula were filmed up on Ilkley Moor. The Oslo airport interior was filmed in Leeds Bradford Airport (now completely remodelled).

1-02 &quot;A Proper Function of Government&quot;. Burnside&#x27;s apartment block is at Frobisher House off Dolphin Square in Pimlico. Burnside leaves his flat, walks south onto Grosvenor Road, turns right onto St George’s Square and walks north to Lupus Street, and waits to catch the number 24 bus to Westminster at the stop opposite 15 St George’s Square. In Vienna, Caine intercepts Hopkins in a park in Yorkshire (location tbc). Wellingham and Burnside walk north along Victoria Embankment next to Westminster Pier.

1-03 &quot;Is Your Journey Really Necessary?&quot;. Burnside confronts Sally Graham by the orangery in Holland Park gardens in London.

1-04 &quot;The Most Suitable Person&quot;. Colin Grove is seen walking along Devonshire Place in London, close to Harley Street. The SIS field school was filmed at Creskeld Hall in Arthington, north Leeds. Ross and Burnside meet for a &quot;late lunch&quot; at the Italian Garden, Kensington Gardens. Later, Ross and Burnside walk through the rose garden and past a sculpture of Pan at the Sheffield Botanical Gardens, before emerging at Waterloo lake in Roundhay Park, Leeds. In Gibraltar, Caine is pursued by a white Mercedes down Waterside in Knaresborough, from the junction with Water Bag Bank, past the Old Manor House painted like a chessboard, and down towards the viaduct.

1-05 &quot;Always Glad to Help&quot;. The episode opens with set-up shots of the north entrance to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) main building on Horse Guards Avenue, Westminster. Hamad takes Dickens bowling at Humber Bowl in the Merrion Centre, on Merrion Way, Leeds (now called Tenpin Leeds).

1-06 &quot;A Feasible Solution&quot;. In Cyprus, Caine and Ferris are ambushed on a dirt road, filmed at Caley Crags on the Otley Chevin, north of Leeds. Ross and Burnside meet on Trafalgar Square, London.

1-07 &quot;Special Relationship&quot;. Mittag&#x27;s apartment in East Berlin was filmed at the old Quarry Hill housing complex in Leeds (demolished, 1978). After lunch Burnside and Dickens take a walk through the Hyde Park area of Woodhouse Moor, Leeds. Ross tells Burnside the mission is &quot;go&quot; on Cavendish Street at the south entrance to the Parkinson Building on the Leeds University campus. Burnside is brought to tears on the south west steps of Lambeth Bridge, Westminster, in front of Thames House.

2-01 &quot;At All Costs&quot;. Burnside smokes a cigarette on the south west steps of Lambeth Bridge, Westminster, in front of Thames House. Burnside and Ross have their &quot;10:20 meeting&quot; in the McDonalds at 155 Victoria Street, London, which is still there. The entrance has moved and the interior redecorated, but you can still sit at their usual table. In Sofia, Burnside and Caine swap TWA bags with Ross on a bench outside the biology department in zone 1, campus west of York University. The bench is directly opposite the biology greenhouses with the &quot;Eric Milner-White A block&quot; of student accommodation across the lake.

2-02, &quot;Enough of Ghosts.&quot; The episode features set-up shots and stock footage of Brussels, including the Brussels Hilton. The scene where Wellingham gets into the limo was shot in Yorkshire (location tbc). Ross and Burnside discuss Wellingham&#x27;s safe outside the old War Office building at 57 Whitehall (now a hotel). The interiors and exteriors of the farm house where Wellingham does his paperwork, and Caine and Wallace do some driving, were most likely filmed in flat lands of the Vale of York or Humberhead Levels (location tbc). Burnside has tea with Lady Wellingham at the &quot;Parkway Tower&quot; (location tbc). Caine and Lincke wait for the Brussels police on York Place, Leeds (the Hotel Metropole is clearly visible in the background). The police car pulls up outside Devonshire House at 37-38 York Place, and Boulin&#x27;s base is on the first floor of the then semi-derelict 5 York Place (the interior windows match the exterior). After the raid, the police can be seen exiting the building through the right hand doorway which accesses the upper floors. The left door accesses the ground floor, which appears to be a construction site (it is currently a lap dancing club).

2-03 &quot;Decision by Committee&quot;. In Sri Lanka, Caine and Milner&#x27;s hotel is the carefully dressed Trust House Forte Hotel, in Bramhope, north Leeds (now a Britannia hotel). Burnside and Ross meet for a drink in the lounge on the top floor of the London Hilton on Park Lane. The runway exteriors (including the model &#x27;Malaysian World&#x27; Boeing 707) were filmed at Leeds Bradford Airport (the control tower and Cookridge Tower can be seen in wide shots). The aeroplane interiors were shot on film so appear to have been filmed on location inside a real aircraft or in a cabin training fuselage. Burnside drives with C, in a Daimler, from Lambeth, across Westminster Bridge, to see Wellingham at the Foreign Office.

2-04 &quot;A Question of Loyalty&quot;. In Warsaw, Wallace waits for Motika outside Leeds Polytechnic&#x27;s Brunswick Building (demolished in 2009 to make way for the Leeds Arena); the top of Wade House at the Merrion Centre can be seen when he returns to his car. Motika&#x27;s apartment was in the Hunslet Grange Flats, Leeds (demolished, 1983). In Sweden, Caine and Wallace walk beside the River Ouse just north of the Lendal Bridge in York, along what is now the &#x27;Dame Judi Dench Walk&#x27;. Milner meets Burnside in the fog on the south west steps of Lambeth Bridge, Westminster, in front of Thames House. Litman waits for his meeting on the Blue Bridge in York, where the River Foss meets the Ouse.

2-05 &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. In West Virginia, Herron&#x27;s house was filmed at Newton Kyme Hall, Tadcaster, north east of Leeds. Ross and Burnside have a McDonald&#x27;s lunch in St James&#x27;s Park opposite HM Treasury. In West Virginia, O&#x27;Shea and Caine drive past University House, the Refectory, and the Clothworkers&#x27; Building on Leeds University campus. Herron&#x27;s funeral is held at the Saltaire United Reformed Church in Shipley, north Bradford. Burnside confronts Stratford-Baker in St James&#x27;s Park (the Duke of York column is visible above the trees).

2-06 &quot;Operation Kingmaker&quot;. Peele buys a suit from a Dunn &amp; Co. store at 373 Strand, London (now closed). Burnside emerges from St James&#x27;s Park and runs into Gibbs on the Clive steps outside the Foreign Office. Later Peele and Burnside, in a Daimler, are driven (from the Foreign Office) north along Horse Guards Road, left onto The Mall, right onto Marlborough Road, past St James&#x27;s Palace, to meet Wellingham for lunch. Later, Burnside and Milner drive south down Bolton Street, turn right onto Piccadilly and head towards Knightsbridge via the Hyde Park Corner road underpass.

3-01 &quot;All In a Good Cause&quot;. D&#x27;Arcy and Burnside stroll along Carlton House Terrace in London, past the Royal Society, turn right down the steps at the Duke of York column, cross The Mall and walk into St James&#x27;s Park.

3-02 &quot;To Hell with Justice&quot;. This episode features extensive exterior and interior location filming in Malta. Tyler stays at the Excelsior Hotel (now the Grand Excelsior) in Floriana. Tyler and Burnside talk at the Upper Barrakka Gardens.

3-03 &quot;Unusual Approach&quot;. In Rhodes, Burnside, Peel, and Wellingham stay at the Villa Messina in Rabat, Malta (now a care home). In Russia, Wallace&#x27;s arrival at Krasnodar airport was filmed on the Leeds University campus in the section of the &quot;red route&quot; corridor linking the EC Stoner Building to the Mathematics and Earth Sciences Building. The Roger Stevens Building is visible through the window behind. A few shots of the control tower at Leeds Bradford airport cement the illusion.

3-04 &quot;My Name is Anna Wiseman&quot;. In Brussels, Anna&#x27;s apartment was filmed at the Granby Hotel, Harrogate (now a care home). Caine climbs the stairs of the Merrion Centre multi-storey car park on Merrion Way, Leeds (refurbished, 2013), to collect a letter from a VW Beetle parked on the top floor. Merrion House (refurbished, 2018), Leeds College of Technology (demolished, 2021) and Leeds Civic Hall (still extant) are all clearly visible against the sky. Burnside meets Anna at a First World War cemetery near Ypres which was filmed at the Harrogate (Stonefall) Cemetery. The gatehouse to the Harewood Estate in north Leeds was used as the entrance to the cemetery. Wallace takes the cello to 15 Park Place, Leeds, where he watches Anna walk down the steps of &quot;Hotel Rogiet&quot; at 28 Park Place (now demolished). The large brutalist building seen at the end of the street is the Leeds International Pool (demolished, 2009). The airport scenes were shot on the Leeds University campus, using the ground floor of the Roger Stevens Building and the section of the &quot;red route&quot; corridor linking the Roger Stevens to the Mathematics and Earth Sciences Building. Burnside leaves the office on Boyle Street, then he walks south along Victoria Embankment, turns right onto Bridge Street and past Westminster tube station, crosses Canon Row, buys an Evening Standard and stops outside St Stephen&#x27;s Tavern, before continuing on towards Parliament Square, bearing right onto Parliament Street.

3-05 &quot;Sometimes We Play Dirty Too&quot;. Burnside walks east on Northumberland Avenue, Westminster, and enters the old Ministry of Defence (MoD) offices in the Metropole Hotel (now a hotel again). After arriving in Prague, Caine is driven to the &quot;ACI &quot;offices in Leeds (location tbc). The ACI interiors were filmed at 49 St Paul&#x27;s Street, Leeds (the distinctive brickwork of St Pauls House can be seen through the windows). Ross and Burnside meet at the Imperial Camel Corps Memorial in Victoria Embankment Gardens, London.

3-06 &quot;Who Needs Enemies&quot;. Ross and Burnside walk from Horse Guards and across Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall. Later, Ross and Burnside have a coffee in the McDonalds at 155 Victoria Street, London, and walk out into Cathedral Piazza, and then along Boyle Street. That night, Burnside takes a stroll along Charing Cross Road, before running into some skinheads in Leicester Square and ending up in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Lambeth. Judging by the brickwork, and the building seen through the windows, the interiors were probably filmed at Leeds General Infirmary. Burnside rides in a black cab along Grosvenor Street to see Ross at the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square, Mayfair.

3-07 &quot;Opposite Numbers&quot;. This episode features extensive interior and exterior location filming in Malta. The SALT conference takes place at the Grand Hotel Verdala in Rabat (demolished, 2021) and the Malta Hilton in St. Julian&#x27;s. Burnside hides Filatov at 4 Vjal Santu Wistin, also in Rabat. Ross and Burnside walk north along Victoria Embankment, from Westminster Pier to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Art

In series one and two, the large painting that hangs in Greenley&#x27;s office is &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; by Robert Alexander Hillingford. When Gibbs becomes &quot;C&quot; in series three, it is replaced by an unidentified naval painting. The painting in Wellingham&#x27;s office is &quot;Northumberland House, Charing Cross,&quot; by John Paul.

==Cast==

Neil Burnside (Roy Marsden)

Burnside is the Director of Operations (D/Ops) of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, also known as MI6). Himself a former Sandbagger and a former Royal Marine officer, Burnside has been D/Ops for only six months at the start of the series. He is arrogant and obsessively dedicated to his job, and regularly finds himself at odds with his superiors, politicians, the Foreign Office, and the Security Service (MI5). The opening titles reveal that Burnside&#x27;s middle initial is D., as shown on a letter addressed to &quot;N.D. Burnside, Esq.&quot; on his desk.

Willie Caine (Ray Lonnen), &quot;Sandbagger One&quot;

Caine, a former paratrooper, is head of the Special Operations Section. He shares a bond of friendship and trust with Burnside, and is not afraid to speak his mind; Burnside describes Caine as &quot;probably the best operative currently operating anywhere in the world&quot;. He is the only character besides Burnside to appear in every episode of the series.

Sir James Greenley (Richard Vernon), &quot;C&quot; (series 1 and 2)

Greenley is the recently-appointed chief of SIS, code-named &quot;C&quot;. Burnside is initially wary of Greenley, who was a diplomat before becoming C, but over time they develop a close relationship; Burnside describes Greenley as &quot;the best C SIS has ever had&quot;. He retires at the end of the second series due to angina and is replaced by John Tower Gibbs.

Matthew Peele (Jerome Willis), Deputy Chief

As Deputy Chief, Peele is usually the first person to whom Burnside reports. They share an antagonistic relationship, as Burnside views Peele as a nuisance with no opinions of his own, while Peele considers Burnside reckless, arrogant, and untrustworthy. Peele is generally disliked by most characters, but displays considerable tact and intelligence throughout the series, as he is often more aware of/concerned with the bigger picture than Burnside.

Sir Geoffrey Wellingham (Alan MacNaughtan)

Burnside&#x27;s personal and professional life come together in Wellingham, Burnside&#x27;s former father-in-law and the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office which oversees SIS. They share an informal but sometimes antagonistic relationship which on occasion is tested to its limit, but also maintain an unspoken fondness and respect for each other.

Jeff Ross (Bob Sherman), head of London station, CIA

Ross is Burnside&#x27;s only friend, and the two maintain a close personal and professional relationship; he tends to share Burnside&#x27;s disdain of bureaucratic and political interference. They occasionally work at odds with one another, but are most often allies fighting their common enemies (the Soviets, and bureaucracy within their own agencies). Ross shows himself to be considerably more ruthless and cold-blooded than Burnside on several occasions.

John Tower Gibbs (Dennis Burgess), &quot;C&quot; (series 3 only)

Gibbs replaces Greenley as C in the last episode of the second series. A former head of station with whom Burnside has an antagonistic relationship, Gibbs disapproves of Burnside and his method of operating. His appointment (along with a continued lack of funding) leads to increased tension within SIS. Gibbs and Burnside regularly clash throughout the third series.

Other Sandbaggers

The posts of Sandbaggers Two and Three are filled throughout the series by Jake Landy (David Glyder), Alan Denson (Steven Grives), Laura Dickens (Diane Keen), Tom Elliott (David Beames) and Mike Wallace (Michael Cashman).

Other characters

Diane Lawler (Elizabeth Bennett) is Burnside&#x27;s fiercely loyal personal assistant; she leaves SIS when she marries at the end of the second series, handpicking her replacement, Marianne Straker (Sue Holderness), who stays with Burnside for the remainder of the series.

Edward Tyler (Peter Laird) is introduced as SIS Director of Intelligence (D/Int) in the first episode of the second series. Tyler, described as &quot;brilliant&quot; by Wellingham and considered the best D/Int SIS has ever had, shares a friendly relationship with Burnside. In the third series he is replaced as D/Int by Paul Dalgetty (David Robb). Dalgetty, who appears in only two episodes, is openly antagonistic towards Burnside and manoeuvres to replace him as D/Ops in &quot;Who Needs Enemies&quot; (3-06).

Sam Lawes (Brian Osborne), Brian Milton (Barkley Johnson) and Bruce (Paul Haley) are often on duty in the Ops Room, coordinating missions.

==Episodes==
Each of the 20 episodes of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; runs just over fifty minutes without commercials, originally airing with commercial breaks that divided the episode into three acts. Animated bumpers similar to the end credits lead into and out of the commercial breaks.

==Reception==

===Critical review===
Television critics&#x27; reviews of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; have been almost uniformly positive. In 1989, Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; &quot;the real stuff&quot; for fans of the spy genre. He goes on to note, concerning the seventh episode (&quot;Special Relationship&quot;): &quot;Although the issue of love versus duty is overdrawn and the tale, like others, is a bit forced in places, the Burnside character and the urgency of the story-telling make it work. Most of the &quot;Sandbagger&quot; episodes work.&quot; Similarly, critic Terrence Rafferty called &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; &quot;the best spy series in television history&quot;.

&quot;The Sandbaggers&quot;, television critic Rick Vanderknyff also wrote, &quot;is many things American network television is not: talky and relatively action-free, low in fancy production values but high in plot complexity, and starring characters who aren&#x27;t likable in the traditional TV way&quot;.

When reviewing the 2013 Network DVD release of &quot;The Sanbaggers: The Complete Series,&quot; Toby Manning wrote: &quot;this 70s spy drama about a cold war dirty tricks department is cynical, tough – and has a compelling star in Roy Marsden&#x27;s brute in a well-cut suit.&quot;

==Broadcast history==
* In the UK, series one was broadcast nationwide on ITV in September and October 1978; Series two, January to March 1980; Series three, June and July 1980.

* All 20 episodes are available in the UK and European market in Region 2 PAL-format DVD sets, the first two series being released by Network DVD in August 2005 and May 2006 respectively. (Unlike the BFS DVDs, the Network DVDs include in each episode the &quot;bumpers&quot; which led into and out of advertisement breaks during transmission on commercial television. These bumpers display &quot;End of Part One&quot;, &quot;Part Two&quot;, &quot;End of Part Two&quot; and &quot;Part 3&quot; accompanied by a snippet of the theme music.)
* All 20 episodes of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; are available in the North American market in Region 0 NTSC-format DVD sets which were released by BFS Entertainment in August 2001 (Series 1 and 2) and September 2003 (Series 3).

===Video===
* The complete series is also available on NTSC videotapes, in three sets. (Episode 7, &quot;Special Relationship&quot;, was omitted from the Series One set and thus appears out of order on the Series Three set.)
* Four episodes were released on two PAL videocassettes in the mid-1980s, but these PAL tapes are out of print.

===Books===
* &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; by Ian Mackintosh (Corgi Books, 1978) novelises &quot;Always Glad to Help&quot; and &quot;A Feasible Solution&quot;. Out of print.
* &quot;The Sandbaggers: Think of a Number&quot; (Corgi Books, 1980) is an original novel by &quot;Donald Lancaster&quot;, a pseudonym for mystery writer William Marshall, who was commissioned to write it after Ian Mackintosh&#x27;s disappearance. Out of print.

== Events ==

===Sandbagger One===

&quot;Sandbagger One&quot; was held in Bellmawr, New Jersey, on 8 and 9 August 1992 and organised by Michael Macomber and Caryn Dunkel. The guest of honour was Ray Lonnen. It was a small event but Ray Lonnen expressed amazement that there was still interest in the series so long after it ended. For many years it remained the one and only organised fan event dedicated to the series. 

===Sandbagger Two===
&quot;Sandbagger Two&quot; was a live virtual webinar held on 7 October 2023 as a global celebration to mark the 45th anniversary of the first UK broadcast. It was organised by The Sandbaggers Yorkshire Television 1978-1980 Facebook group. The keynote speakers were Roy Marsden and Greg Rucka. The event also included discussion of Ian Mackintosh&#x27;s life, his novels, and other television work influenced by The Sandbaggers.

== Legacy ==

===&quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; in America===
&quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; generated a cult following when broadcast in the USA. PBS outlet KTEH in San Jose, California aired at least five runs of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; after it became &quot;a local phenomenon&quot;. American &quot;Sandbaggers&quot; fandom produced fanzines, websites, and even the first ever dedicated convention: &quot;Sandbagger One&quot; in 1992.

===&quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;===
Greg Rucka, novelist and creator of the comic book espionage series &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;, has said that the comic book is consciously inspired by &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; and is in a sense a &quot;quasi-sequel&quot;. In the comic book, the structure of SIS mirrors that seen in the television series, down to the division of responsibilities between Directors of Operations and Intelligence and the existence of a Special Operations Section known as the &quot;Minders&quot;. The comic book also features a more modern and sophisticated Ops Room, and bureaucratic wrangling reminiscent of the television series.

Several characters and situations in &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot; parallel &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot;, including a fatherly &quot;C&quot; who is eventually replaced by a more political and less sympathetic appointee; a Director of Operations who is fiercely protective of the Special Section; a Deputy Chief antagonistic to the independent nature of the Minders; a rivalry with MI5; and a cooperative relationship with the CIA. In addition, several scenes and lines of dialogue are similar or allude to the television series. However, as the comic book takes place in the present day, the geopolitical situation is very different. In addition, the stories are more action-oriented and focus on the exploits of Minder Tara Chace rather than on Paul Crocker, the Director of Operations.

<text>Cotopaxi () is an active stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains, located near Latacunga city of Cotopaxi Province, about south of Quito, and northeast of the city of Latacunga, Ecuador. It is the second highest summit in Ecuador (after Chimborazo), reaching a height of . Cotopaxi is among the highest active volcanoes in the world.

Cotopaxi is known to have erupted 87 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by lahars (mudflows) around the volcano. An ongoing eruption began on 21 October 2022. 

At the end of February 2023, the Geophysical Institute of Ecuador reported that Cotopaxi had produced around 8,000 earthquakes since October 21, 2022, amounting to 1,600 events per month.

==Description==

On a clear day, Cotopaxi is clearly visible on the skyline from Latacunga and Quito. It is part of the chain of volcanoes around the Pacific Plate known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has an almost symmetrical cone that rises from a highland plain of about , with a width at its base of about . It has one of the few equatorial glaciers in the world, which starts at the height of . At its summit, Cotopaxi has an wide crater which is deep. The crater consists of two concentric crater rims, the outer one being partly free of snow and irregular in shape. The crater interior is covered with ice cornices and rather flat. The highest point is on the outer rim of the crater on the north side.

==History==
===Name===
According to locals who speak Quechua, &quot;coto&quot; means &#x27;neck&#x27; and &quot;paxi&quot; means &#x27;moon&#x27; (Quechua &quot;q&#x27;oto&quot; &#x27;throat&#x27; + Aymara &quot;phakhsi&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27;). This refers to the crater of Cotopaxi that looks like a crescent moon. The mountain was honored as a sacred mountain by local Andean people, even before the Inca invasion in the 15th century. It was worshiped as rain sender, which served as the guarantor of the land&#x27;s fertility, and at the same time its summit was revered as a place where gods lived.

===Historic eruptions===
With 87 known eruptions, Cotopaxi is one of Ecuador&#x27;s most active volcanoes. Its first recorded eruption was in 1534. This eruption appears to have deposited an ash layer in the lakes of El Cajas National Park that has been dated to 450±70 cal BP.

Cotopaxi&#x27;s most violent eruptions in historical times occurred in the years 1742, 1744, 1768, and 1877. The 1744 and 1768 events destroyed the colonial town of Latacunga. During the June 26, 1877 eruption, pyroclastic flows descended on all sides of the mountain melting the entire ice cap, with lahars traveling more than into the Pacific Ocean and western Amazon basin draining the valley. The city of Latacunga was again leveled completely due to the mudslide deposits.

The eruption on 19 June 1742 was witnessed by the scientists Pierre Bouguer and Charles-Marie de La Condamine, members of the French Geodesic Mission, as they descended from nearby Guagua Pichincha.
There was a major eruption from 1903 to 1904, and minor activity persisted until at least 1940 and possibly 1942. (Note that direct observations of minor eruptions can be difficult because of bad weather, hence the uncertainty about the 1942 &quot;eruption.&quot;) The same source also reported increased thermal/seismic, non-eruptive activity in 1975 and 2002. In the increased activity of 2002, fumarolic activity and sulfuric emissions increased and ice around the inside and on the southeastern side of the cone started to melt. However, no actual eruption was observed.

In 2015, two large phreatic (steam) eruptions on the morning of August 14 marked a new phase of volcanic activity. The volcano &quot;remains in a very abnormal situation. In August, 2,100 earthquakes were recorded and emission rates of sulfur dioxide reach approximately . The government estimates some 300,000 people are at risk from the volcano in the provinces of Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Napo and Pichincha.

===Climbing===
The first non-Spanish European who tried to climb the mountain was Alexander von Humboldt in 1802; however, he only reached a height of about . In 1858 Moritz Wagner investigated the mountain, but he could not reach the summit either.

On November 28, 1872, German geologist Wilhelm Reiss and his Colombian partner, Angel Escobar, finally reached the summit of Cotopaxi.

In 1873 it was summitted by German Geologist Moritz Alphons Stübel and four Ecuadorians, Rafael Jantui, Melchor Páez, Vicente Ramón and Eusebio Rodriguez.

In 1880 British mountaineer Edward Whymper and the Italian guides Jean-Antoine Carrel and Louis Carrel made the third recorded ascent of Cotopaxi and spent a night on the summit.

Painters and Hans Meyer reached the summit in 1903, and many of Reschreiter&#x27;s paintings feature a view of Cotopaxi.

In the late 20th century, summiting Cotopaxi became a major tourist draw. The José F. Ribas Refuge (&quot;Refugio José Félix Ribas&quot;) was built in 1971 at an elevation of and enlarged in 2005.

A tragedy occurred on Easter Sunday 1996 when an avalanche partially buried the Refuge and dozens of tourists. The glacier above the Refuge was probably weakened by an earthquake that had shaken the entire Province of Cotopaxi for several days prior to the avalanche. In the warm midday sun a huge portion of the ice wall broke loose. Being Easter, there were many day visitors on the mountain who were buried in the ice and snow. Those trapped in the Refuge broke windows on the downhill side to climb to safety, but 13 people died on the slope above. The Refuge itself is located in a valley and consequently vulnerable to future avalanches.

==Recent activity==
===Recreation===
Climbing Cotopaxi to the summit is quite popular, with up to 100 climbers attempting it on weekends. When the summit is quiet, mountain guide companies offer regular guided climbs of the mountain. Climbers grade the conventional route alpine PD (Peu Difficile) or WS (Wenig Schwierig) — or PD/WS+ (indicating &quot;Mildly Difficult PLUS&quot;). Use of crampons and ice axes is mandatory as snow and ice slopes of up to 50 degrees (1 in 2) are encountered, and climbers should be on belay and use aluminum ladders to cross one or two of the crevasses. A 4WD track goes up from the national park entrance to a carpark at altitude on north side, just below the José F. Ribas Refuge. This stone mountain hut — owned and operated by Grupo Ascensionismo del Colegio San Gabriel — is situated higher at (a 40-80 minute uphill hike). Here climbers can spend the night and begin their summit bid in the early morning without any intermediate camps. (Typically no more than about half of those attempting to summit Cotopaxi make it to the top after a daunting — though non-technical — six-hour scramble.) Summiting normally starts around 12:30 am, to reach the summit at latest 7:30 am and then return to the hut before the snow melts and glacier crevasses move/evolve. As of July 28, 2014, the Ribas Refuge is under construction. Tour operators shuttle their clients up to the top of the 4WD track once in the afternoon for a glacier skills class, and then again to start the climb around midnight, spending the intervening hours eating dinner and resting at a hostel lower down by the lakes. Adventure tourism operators in Quito also offer mountain biking tours from the Refuge downhill along the dirt track.

===Eruptions===
In April 2015, the volcano began to show signs of unrest, and came back to life. There was a large increase in earthquakes (including harmonic tremors) and SO2 emissions. IGEPN reported slight deformation of the edifice, suggesting an intrusion of magma under the volcano. As of 25 July, the unrest continued, and a significant eruption of phreatic ash and steam occurred on August 14 and 15, 2015. Ash was deposited heavily in areas close to the volcano, including damaging farmlands on the flanks of neighbouring volcanoes such as El Corazon, and thinly as far as Quito, affecting southern and central areas of the city. 

A new eruption began on 21 October 2022 and is ongoing as of June 2023.

Future Cotopaxi eruptions pose a high risk to the local population, their settlements and fields. The main danger of a significant eruption of Cotopaxi would be the flash-melting of its summit glacier, resulting in devastating lahars which would travel down the flanks of the volcano, guided by river valleys whose origins lie at the volcano. Danger from normal, explosive eruptive activity is limited to within Cotopaxi National Park. However, the great distances that lahars of the significant size that Cotopaxi&#x27;s glacier produces could travel greatly increase the hazard areas to include all river valleys leading from the volcano. If there were to be a very large explosion, it would destroy many northerly settlements within the valley in the suburban area of Quito (pop. more than 2,000,000). Another city which would be in great danger is the regional capital Latacunga, which is located in the south valley, and has been destroyed at least twice (in 1768, 1877) by lahars caused by volcanic activity.

* In the poem &quot;Romance&quot; (&quot;Chimborazo, Cotopaxi...Popocatapetl&quot;) by Walter J. Turner (1916), Cotopaxi is one of the romantic locations that has stolen the poet&#x27;s heart.
* In &quot;Shadrach in the Furnace&quot; (1976), a science fiction novel by Robert Silverberg, an eruption by Cotopaxi becomes known as &quot;the night of Cotopaxi&quot;. It starts a series of disasters and uprisings that establish in the early 21st century a world dictatorship by the Mongolian Genghis Mao.
* In the American film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), the SS &quot;Cotopaxi&quot;, a ship named Cotopaxi that disappeared in 1925, appears in the Gobi Desert. 
* American rock band The Mars Volta have a 2009 song named after the mountain.

<text>Telefilm Canada is a Canadian Crown corporation that supports Canada&#x27;s audiovisual industry. Headquartered in Montreal, Telefilm Canada provides services to the Canadian audiovisual industry with four regional offices in Vancouver, British Columbia; Toronto, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The primary mandate of the corporation is to finance and promote Canadian productions through its various funds and programs.

==Purpose==
As one of the principal instruments for supporting Canada&#x27;s audiovisual industry, Telefilm Canada&#x27;s primary mandate is to provide support and promote all stages of screen-based content through its various funds and programs. It also fosters the commercial, cultural, and industrial success of Canadian productions and to stimulate demand for those productions both at home and abroad. It also administers the programs of the Canada Media Fund.

The organization is also responsible for choosing Canada&#x27;s annual submission to the Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film award.

==Coproductions==
Telefilm Canada administers the Canadian government&#x27;s coproductions, while supporting Canadian filmmakers and their international counterparts to coproduce films and television programs that enjoy the status of national productions in each of the respective countries.

==Operations==
Headquartered in Montreal, Telefilm Canada provides bilingual services to its clients through four offices located in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax.

The Atlantic Regional office, in operation since 1984 from Halifax, services New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

The Quebec Regional office is located in the Montreal head office and serves the province of Quebec.

The Ontario Regional office, in operation since 1968 from Toronto, serves both Ontario and Nunavut.

The Western Regional office, in operation since 1984 from Vancouver, serves the Western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.

==History==
===Creation===
In 1967, the Canadian government founded the Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC), allocating $10 million in support of the country&#x27;s feature film industry. Michael Spencer was named the first executive director of the CFDC, which by then included offices in Montreal and Toronto.

===1970s===
By 1976, the Canadian government had increased the CFDC&#x27;s budget to $25 million annually, at which point it decided to finance the corporation with an annual parliamentary appropriation. Spencer was replaced by Michael McCabe in May 1978. Notable films produced with the agency&#x27;s support included &quot;Goin&#x27; Down the Road&quot; (1970), &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974), &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975), &quot;Why Shoot the Teacher&quot; (1977), &quot;In Praise of Older Women&quot; (1978).

===1980s===
The early 1980s sees the CFDC&#x27;s budget increased yet again and the creation of the Canadian Broadcast Program Development Fund to revitalize Canadian television programming. At the time, approximately 85% of all prime time programming on Canadian television is imported from other countries—namely the US.
Under the direction of André Lamy, in 1984 the CFDC is renamed &quot;Telefilm Canada&quot; to better reflect the organization&#x27;s full range of activities in both the film and television industries.

With the creation of the Feature Film Fund aimed at supporting feature films by Canadian filmmakers and the Feature Film Distribution Fund that makes credit lines available to Canadian distributors, Telefilm Canada takes a central role in the development and growth of Canadian cinema around the world.

===1990s===
Now under the executive direction of François Macerola, the Canada Television and Cable Production Fund is created. The Fund is a private-public partnership between the federal government of Canada and the cable and satellite television industry, with Telefilm administering the Equity Investment component of the Fund.
By the end of the 1990s, in 1998, Telefilm Canada creates a five-year, $30-million multimedia fund, aptly-named The Multimedia Fund, with which to support Canadian work in the digital age. The Fund helps Canadians in multimedia to compete effectively in the new technologies arena.

===2000s===
With the new millennium, the Canadian government implemented a new Canadian Feature Film Policy, From Script to Screen, that effectively created the Canada Feature Film Fund (CFFF) to be managed by Telefilm Canada.

Beginning April 1, 2001, with an annual budget of $100-million, the CFF&#x27;s primary objective is to build larger audiences in Canada and abroad for Canadian feature films with improved distribution and marketing.
Also that year, Telefilm Canada announces guidelines for the Canada New Media Fund, replacing the Multimedia Fund. Budgets grow from $6 million, to $9 million, and now sit at $14 million annually. 
The latter half of the decade brings about other changes for Telefilm.

In 2005, the minister of Canadian Heritage announced a new collaboration between the organization and the Canadian Television Fund and, with it, renewed funding of 100 million for Canadian television programming. While the Board of the Canadian Television is responsible for the governance of all programs, Telefilm heads up the administration and delivery of the CTF programs.

===2010s and 2020s===
The 2012 Canadian federal budget cut funding for the National Film Board of Canada and Telefilm Canada by 10%. Today, following a new four-year plan, Telefilm has made stimulating demand for Canadian screen-based content one of its top priorities.

In April 2022, Christa Dickenson announced that she would step down as executive director and CEO effective September 9, 2022.

<doc id="364075" wikidata="Q5314423" url="?curid=364075" title="Duncan Kyle">
<text>John Franklin Broxholme (11 June 1930 Bradford – 24 June 2000 Bury St Edmunds) was an English thriller writer who published fifteen novels in a little over twenty years (1971–1993) using the pen name of Duncan Kyle.

Reminiscent of the work of Desmond Bagley, Kyle&#x27;s books typically involve a tough, resourceful individual who unexpectedly becomes involved in danger and intrigue in an exotic setting. &quot;A Cage of Ice&quot;, for example, involves a London physician who accompanies a hand-picked team of adventurers on a snowmobile journey across the Arctic to rescue a defecting Soviet scientist. &quot;Green River High&quot; follows another group of adventurers into the jungles of Borneo in search of a plane that crashed there during World War II. Kyle&#x27;s novels are, like those of Bagley and Alistair MacLean, stronger on plot and setting than on characterization. They are invariably well-crafted, however, and two—&quot;The King&#x27;s Commissar&quot; and &quot;The Dancing Men&quot;—are classics of the historical fiction and historical detective story genres, respectively.

==Notable works==

A Cage of Ice

In &quot;A Cage of Ice&quot;, a British doctor living in New York, receives a mystery package addressed to Professor Ed Ward. His name is Doctor Edwards. Upon receiving the parcel, there are attempts on his life. He escapes the murderers and begins to look for Mr. Ed Ward. Soon, he is &quot;kidnapped&quot; by an agent of the US government. He is informed of who Professor Ed Ward is, and is sent on a mission to the Arctic along with an international cast of highly professional personages.

The following is from &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; by Patricia T. O&#x27;Conner; 15 February 1987, &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Flight into Fear

John Shaw is a freelance pilot working for the company Airflo. He is told by his boss, John Lennox, to deliver a parcel in San Francisco, and pick up a customer. This passenger is supposed to be kept secret from everybody. Shaw arrives in San Francisco, is kidnapped, and taken to a Chinese restaurant. He meets up with an anti-narcotics agent. Later, Shaw and his passenger evade their pursuers through the San Francisco bay. Eventually, they reach the plane and head to England. Along the way, the aeroplane is hijacked and has numerous malfunctions. Shaw discovers, upon arriving in England, his passenger is not who he thought, and climaxes with a dizzying cat and mouse chase.

<doc id="364084" wikidata="Q411041" url="?curid=364084" title="Substance P">
<text>Substance P (SP) is an undecapeptide (a peptide composed of a chain of 11 amino acid residues) and a type of neuropeptide, belonging to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides. It acts as a neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator. Substance P and the closely related neurokinin A (NKA) are produced from a polyprotein precursor after alternative splicing of the preprotachykinin A gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of substance P is as follows:
* Arg Pro Lys Pro Gln Gln Phe Phe Gly Leu Met (RPKPQQFFGLM)
with an amide group at the C-terminus.
Substance P is released from the terminals of specific sensory nerves. It is found in the brain and spinal cord and is associated with inflammatory processes and pain.

==Discovery==
The original discovery of Substance P (SP) was in 1931 by Ulf von Euler and John H. Gaddum as a tissue extract that caused intestinal contraction &quot;in vitro&quot;. Its tissue distribution and biologic actions were further investigated over the following decades. The eleven-amino-acid structure of the peptide was determined by Chang, et. al in 1971.

In 1983, Neurokinin A (previously known as substance K or neuromedin L) was isolated from porcine spinal cord and was also found to stimulate intestinal contraction.

==Receptor==
The endogenous receptor for substance P is neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1-receptor, NK1R). It belongs to the tachykinin receptor sub-family of GPCRs. Other neurokinin subtypes and neurokinin receptors that interact with SP have been reported as well. Amino acid residues that are responsible for the binding of SP and its antagonists are present in the extracellular loops and transmembrane regions of NK-1. Binding of SP to NK-1R results in internalization by the clathrin-dependent mechanism to the acidified endosomes where the complex disassociates. Subsequently, SP is degraded and NK-1R is re-expressed on the cell surface.

Substance P and the NK1-receptor are widely distributed in the brain and are found in brain regions that are specific to regulating emotion (hypothalamus, amygdala, and the periaqueductal gray). They are found in close association with serotonin (5-HT) and neurons containing norepinephrine that are targeted by the currently used antidepressant drugs. The SP receptor promoter contains regions that are sensitive to cAMP, AP-1, AP-4, CEBPB, and epidermal growth factor. Because these regions are related to complexed signal transduction pathways mediated by cytokines, it has been proposed that cytokines and neurotropic factors can induce NK-1. Also, SP can induce the cytokines that are capable of inducing NK-1 transcription factors.

== Function ==

=== Overview ===
Substance P (&quot;P&quot; standing for &quot;Preparation&quot; or &quot;Powder&quot;) is a neuropeptide – but only nominally so, as it is ubiquitous. Its receptor – the neurokinin type 1 – is distributed over cytoplasmic membranes of many cell types (neurons, glia, endothelia of capillaries and lymphatics, fibroblasts, stem cells, white blood cells) in many tissues and organs. SP amplifies or excites most cellular processes.

Substance P is a key first responder to most noxious/extreme stimuli (stressors), i.e., those with a potential to compromise an organism&#x27;s biological integrity. SP is thus regarded as an immediate defense, stress, repair, survival system. The molecule, which is rapidly inactivated (or at times further activated by peptidases) is rapidly released – repetitively and chronically, as warranted, in the presence of a stressor. Unique among biological processes, SP release (and expression of its NK1 Receptor (through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine-like processes)) may not naturally subside in diseases marked by chronic inflammation (including cancer). The SP or its NK1R, as well as similar neuropeptides, appear to be vital targets capable of satisfying many unmet medical needs. The failure of clinical proof of concept studies, designed to confirm various preclinical predictions of efficacy, is currently a source of frustration and confusion among biomedical researchers.

=== Vasodilation ===
Substance P is a potent vasodilator. Substance P-induced vasodilation is dependent on nitric oxide release. Substance P is involved in the axon reflex-mediated vasodilation to local heating and and flare reaction. It has been shown that vasodilation to substance P is dependent on the NK1 receptor located on the endothelium. In contrast to other neuropeptides studied in human skin, substance P-induced vasodilation has been found to decline during continuous infusion. This possibly suggests an internalization of neurokinin-1 (NK1). As is typical with many vasodilators, it also has bronchoconstrictive properties, administered through the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nervous system (branch of the vagal system).

=== Inflammation ===
SP initiates expression of almost all known immunological chemical messengers (cytokines). Also, most of the cytokines, in turn, induce SP and the NK1 receptor. SP is particularly excitatory to cell growth and multiplication, via usual, as well as oncogenic drivers. SP is a trigger for nausea and emesis. Substance P and other sensory neuropeptides can be released from the peripheral terminals of sensory nerve fibers in the skin, muscle, and joints. It is proposed that this release is involved in neurogenic inflammation, which is a local inflammatory response to certain types of infection or injury.

=== Pain ===
Preclinical data support the notion that Substance P is an important element in pain perception. The sensory function of substance P is thought to be related to the transmission of pain information into the central nervous system. Substance P coexists with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in primary afferents that respond to painful stimulation. Substance P and other sensory neuropeptides can be released from the peripheral terminals of sensory nerve fibers in the skin, muscle, and joints. It is proposed that this release is involved in neurogenic inflammation, which is a local inflammatory response to certain types of infection or injury. Unfortunately, the reasons why NK1 receptor antagonists have failed as efficacious analgesics in well-conducted clinical proof of concept studies have not yet been persuasively elucidated.

=== Mood, anxiety, learning ===
Substance P has been associated with the regulation of mood disorders, anxiety, stress, reinforcement, neurogenesis, synaptic growth and dendritic arborisation, respiratory rhythm, neurotoxicity, pain, and nociception. In 2014, it was found that substance P played a role in male fruit fly aggression. Recently, it has been shown that substance P may play a critical role in long-term potentiation of aversive stimuli.

=== Vomiting ===
The vomiting center in the medulla, called the area postrema, contains high concentrations of substance P and its receptor, in addition to other neurotransmitters such as choline, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and endogenous opioids. Their activation stimulates the vomiting reflex. Different emetic pathways exist, and substance P/NK1R appears to be within the final common pathway to regulate vomiting.

=== Cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration ===
The above processes are part and parcel to tissue integrity and repair. Substance P has been known to stimulate cell growth in normal and cancer cell line cultures, and it was shown that substance P could promote wound healing of non-healing ulcers in humans. SP and its induced cytokines promote multiplication of cells required for repair or replacement, growth of new blood vessels, and &quot;leg-like pods&quot; on cells (including cancer cells) bestowing upon them mobility, and metastasis. It has been suggested that cancer exploits the SP-NK1R to progress and metastasize, and that NK1RAs may be useful in the treatment of several cancer types.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Quantification in disease ===
Elevation of serum, plasma, or tissue SP and/or its receptor (NK1R) has been associated with many diseases: sickle cell crisis; inflammatory bowel disease; major depression and related disorders; fibromyalgia; rheumatological; and infections such as HIV/AIDS and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as in cancer.
When assayed in the human, the observed variability of the SP concentrations are large, and in some cases the assay methodology is questionable. SP concentrations cannot yet be used to diagnose disease clinically or gauge disease severity. It is not yet known whether changes in concentration of SP or density of its receptors is the cause of any given disease, or an effect.

=== Blockade for diseases with a chronic immunological component ===
As increasingly documented, the SP-NK1R system induces or modulates many aspects of the immune response, including WBC production and activation, and cytokine expression, Reciprocally, cytokines may induce expression of SP and its NK1R. In this sense, for diseases in which a pro-inflammatory component has been identified or strongly suspected, and for which current treatments are absent or in need of improvement, abrogation of the SP-NK1 system continues to receive focus as a treatment strategy. Currently, the only completely developed method available in that regard is antagonism (blockade, inhibition) of the SP preferring receptor, i.e., by drugs known as neurokinin type 1 antagonists (also termed: SP antagonists, or tachykinin antagonists.) One such drug is aprepitant to prevent the nausea and vomiting that accompanies chemotherapy, typically for cancer. 
With the exception of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the patho-physiological basis of many of the disease groups listed below, for which NK1RAs have been studied as a therapeutic intervention, are to varying extents hypothesized to be initiated or advanced by a chronic non-homeostatic inflammatory response.

==== Dermatological disorders: eczema/psoriasis, chronic pruritus ====

High levels of BDNF and substance P have been found associated with increased itching in eczema.

==== Infections: HIV-AIDS, measles, RSV, others ====

The role of SP in HIV-AIDS has been well-documented. Doses of aprepitant greater than those tested to date are required for demonstration of full efficacy. Respiratory syncytial and related viruses appear to upregulate SP receptors, and rat studies suggest that NK1RAs may be useful in treating or limiting long term sequelae from such infections.

&quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; is a unicellular parasitic protozoan that infects the lower gastrointestinal tract of humans. The symptoms of infection are diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. This protozoan was found to secrete serotonin as well as substance P and neurotensin.

==== Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)/cystitis ====

Despite strong preclinical rationale, efforts to demonstrate efficacy of SP antagonists in inflammatory disease have been unproductive. A study in women with IBS confirmed that an NK1RAs antagonist was anxiolytic.

=== Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting===
In line with its role as a first line defense system, SP is released when toxicants or poisons come into contact with a range of receptors on cellular elements in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located in the floor of the fourth ventricle of the brain (area postrema). Presumably, SP is released in or around the nucleus of the solitary tract upon integrated activity of dopamine, serotonin, opioid, and/or acetylcholine receptor signaling. NK1Rs are stimulated. In turn, a fairly complex reflex is triggered involving cranial nerves responsible for respiration, retroperistalsis, and general autonomic discharge. The actions of aprepitant are said to be entirely central, thus requiring passage of the drug into the central nervous system. However, given that NK1Rs are unprotected by a blood brain barrier in the area postrema just adjacent to neuronal structures in the medulla, and the activity of sendide (the peptide based NK1RA) against cisplatin-induced emesis in the ferret, it is likely that some peripheral exposure contributes to antiemetic effects, even if through vagal terminals in the clinical setting.

=== Radiotherapy ===
A recent study has highlighted the potential of radiolabeled substance P as a radiopharmaceutical in targeting Glioma. The scientists were able to radiolabel Substance P with radioactive isotopes Technetium-99m (99mTc) and Lutetium-177 (177Lu). These radiolabeled compounds are designed to bind specifically to NK-1 receptors on glioma cells, allowing for both imaging (via 99mTc) and therapeutic (via 177Lu) applications. The study highlights the promising role of NK-1 receptor-targeted strategies in improving glioma diagnosis and treatment through receptor-specific delivery of radioisotopes. 

===Other findings===

====Denervation supersensitivity====
When the innervation to substance P nerve terminals is lost, post-synaptic cells compensate for the loss of adequate neurotransmitter by increasing the expression of post-synaptic receptors. This, ultimately, leads to a condition known as denervation supersensitivity as the post-synaptic nerves will become hypersensitive to any release of substance P into the synaptic cleft.

====Aggression====
Tachykinin / Substance P plays an evolutionarily conserved role in inducing aggressive behaviors. In rodents and cats, activation of hypothalamic neurons which release Substance P induces aggressive behaviors (defensive biting and predatory attack). Similarly, in fruit flies, tachykinin-releasing neurons have been implicated in aggressive behaviors (lunging). In this context, male-specific tachykinin neurons control lunging behaviors that can be modulated by the amount of tachykinin release.

<text>Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (11 May 1752 – 22 January 1840) was a German physician, naturalist, physiologist and anthropologist. He is considered to be a main founder of zoology and anthropology as comparative, scientific disciplines. He has been called the &quot;founder of racial classifications&quot;.

He was one of the first to explore the study of the human being as an aspect of natural history. His teachings in comparative anatomy were applied to his classification of human races, of which he claimed there were five, Caucasian, Mongolian, Malayan, Ethiopian, and American. He was a member of what modern historians call the Göttingen school of history.

He is considered a pivotal figure in the development of physical anthropology. Blumenbach&#x27;s peers considered him one of the great theorists of his day, and he was a mentor or influence on many of the next generation of German biologists, including Alexander von Humboldt.

==Early life and education==
Blumenbach was born at his family house in Gotha. His father was Heinrich Blumenbach, a local school headmaster; his mother was Charlotte Eleonore Hedwig Buddeus. He was born into a well-connected family of academics.

Blumenbach was educated at the Illustrious Gymnasium in Gotha before studying medicine, first at Jena and then at Göttingen. He was recognized as a prodigy by the age sixteen in 1768. He graduated from the latter in 1775 with his M.D. thesis &quot;De generis humani varietate nativa&quot; (&quot;On the Natural Variety of Mankind&quot;, University of Göttingen, which was first published in 1775, then re-issued with changes to the titlepage in 1776). It is considered one of the most influential works in the development of subsequent human race concepts. It contained the germ of the craniological research to which so many of his subsequent inquiries were directed.

==Career==
Blumenbach was appointed extraordinary professor of medicine and inspector of the museum of natural history in Göttingen in 1776 and ordinary professor in 1778. His contributions soon began to enrich the pages of the &quot;Medicinische Bibliothek&quot;, of which he was editor from 1780 to 1794, with various contributions on medicine, physiology, and anatomy. In physiology, he was of the school of Albrecht von Haller, and was in the habit of illustrating his theory by a careful comparison of the animal functions of man with those of other animals. Following Georges Cuvier&#x27;s identification, Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its first scientific name, &quot;Elephas primigenius&quot; (first-born elephant), in 1799.

His reputation was much extended by the publication of his &quot;Institutiones Physiologicae&quot; (1787), a condensed, well-arranged view of the animal functions, expounded without discussion of minute anatomical details. Between its first publication and 1821, it went through many editions in Germany, where it was the general textbook of the science of physiology. It was translated into English in America by Charles Caldwell (Philadelphia 1798), and in London by John Elliotson (1807).

He was perhaps still more extensively known by his &quot;Handbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie&quot; (&quot;Handbook of comparative anatomy&quot;), which passed through numerous German editions from its appearance in 1805 to 1824. It was translated into English in 1809 by the surgeon William Lawrence, and again, with improvements and additions, by William Coulson in 1827. This manual, though slighter than the subsequent works of Cuvier, Carus, and others, and not to be compared with such later expositions as that of Gegenbaur, was long esteemed for the accuracy of the author&#x27;s own observations, and his just appreciation of the labors of his predecessors.
Although the greatest part of Blumenbach&#x27;s life was passed at Göttingen, in 1789 he visited Switzerland, and gave a curious medical topography of that country in the &quot;Bibliothek&quot;. He was in England in 1788 and 1792. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1793 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1794. In 1798, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. He became a correspondent, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1808. This was changed to associated member in 1827. He was then appointed secretary to the Royal Society of Sciences in 1812, elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1813, appointed physician to the royal family in Hanover () by the prince regent in 1816, made a knight-commander of the Guelphic Order in 1821, and elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1831. In celebration of his doctoral jubilee (1825), traveling scholarships were founded to assist talented young physicians and naturalists. He retired in 1835. Blumenbach died in 1840 in Göttingen, where he is buried in the Albani cemetery.

===Racial anthropology===

Blumenbach explored the biodiversity of humans mainly by comparing skull anatomy and skin color. His work included a description of sixty human crania (skulls) published originally in fascicules as &quot;Decas craniorum&quot; (Göttingen, 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists in the field of craniometry. He established a five-part naming system in 1795 to describe what he called &quot;generis humani varietates quinae principes, species vero unica&quot; (five principal varieties of humankind, but one species). In his view, humans could be divided into varieties (only in his later work he adopted the term &quot;races&quot;, which had been introduced by others) but he was aware that a clear separation was difficult:

Blumenbach&#x27;s classification of the single human species into five varieties (later called &quot;races&quot;) (1793/1795):
* the Caucasian or white race. Blumenbach was the first to use this term for Europeans, and he also included Middle Easterners and South Asians in the same category.
* the Mongolian or yellow race, including all East Asians.
* the Malayan or brown race, including Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders.
* the Ethiopian or black race, including all sub-Saharan Africans.
* the American or red race, including all Native Americans.

Blumenbach assumed that all morphological differences between the varieties were induced by the climate and the way of living and he emphasized that the differences in morphology were so small, gradual and transiently connected that it was not possible to separate these varieties clearly. He also noted that skin color was unsuitable for distinguishing varieties. Although Blumenbach did not propose any hierarchy among the five varieties, he placed the Caucasian form in the center of his description as being the most &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;primeval&quot; one from which the other forms &quot;degenerated&quot;. In the 18th century, however, these terms did not have the negative connotations they possess today. At the time, &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;primeval&quot; described the ancestral form, while &quot;degeneration&quot; was understood to be the process of change leading to a variety adapted to a new environment by being exposed to a different climate and diet. Hence, he argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., depended on geography, diet, and mannerism. Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that &quot;individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other Africans as from Europeans&quot;.

Like other monogenists such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Blumenbach held to the &quot;degenerative hypothesis&quot; of racial origins. Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia, and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. Thus, he claimed, Negroid pigmentation arose because of the result of the heat of the tropical sun, while the cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos, and the Chinese were fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns protected from environmental factors. He believed that the degeneration could be reversed in a proper environmental control and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.

Moreover, he concluded that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind &quot;concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities&quot;:

He did not consider his &quot;degenerative hypothesis&quot; as racist and sharply criticized Christoph Meiners, an early practitioner of scientific racialism, as well as Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, who concluded from autopsies that Africans were an inferior race. Blumenbach wrote three other essays stating non-white peoples were capable of excelling in arts and sciences in reaction against racialists of his time. At his time, Blumenbach was perceived as anti-racist and he strongly opposed the practice of slavery and the belief of the inherent savagery of the coloured races. Alexander von Humboldt wrote on his and Blumenbach&#x27;s views: 

 However, selected parts of his views were later used by others to encourage scientific racism.

===Other natural studies===
In his dissertation, Blumenbach mentioned the name &quot;Simia troglodytes&quot; in connection with a short description for the chimpanzee. This dissertation was printed and appeared in September 1775, but only for internal use in the University of Göttingen and not for providing a public record. The public print of his dissertation appeared in 1776. Blumenbach knew that Carl Linnaeus had already established a name &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; for a badly known primate. In 1779, he discussed this Linnean name and concluded correctly that Linnaeus had been dealing with two species, a human and an orangutan, neither of which was a chimpanzee, and that by consequence the name &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; could not be used. Blumenbach was one of the first scientists to understand the identities of the different species of primates, which were (excluding humans) orangutans and chimpanzees. (Gorillas were not known to Europeans at this time). In Opinion 1368, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) decided in 1985 that Blumenbach&#x27;s view should be followed, and that his &quot;Simia troglodytes&quot; as published by Blumenbach in 1779 shall be the type species of the genus &quot;Pan&quot; and, since it was the oldest available name for the chimpanzee, be used for this species. However, the commission did not know that Blumenbach had already mentioned this name in his dissertation. Following the rules of the ICZN Code the scientific name of one of the most well-known African animals, currently known as &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;, must carry Blumenbach&#x27;s name combined with the date 1776.

Blumenbach shortly afterward wrote a manual of natural history entitled &quot;Handbuch der Naturgeschichte&quot;; 12 editions and some translations. It was published first in Göttingen by J. C. Dieterich in 1779/1780. He was also one of the first scientists to study the anatomy of the platypus, assigning the scientific name &quot;Ornithorhynchus paradoxus&quot; to the animal, being unaware George Shaw had already given it the name &quot;Platypus anatinus&quot;. However, &quot;Platypus&quot; had already been shown to be used for the scientific name for a genus of Ambrosia beetles so Blumenbach&#x27;s scientific name for the genus was used.

===&quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;===
Blumenbach made many contributions to the scientific debates of the last half of the 18th century regarding evolution and creation. His central contribution was in the conception of a &quot;vis formativa&quot; or &quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;, an inborn force within an organism that led it to create, maintain, and repair its shape.

====Background====
Enlightenment science and philosophy essentially held a static view of nature and man, but vital nature continued to interrupt this view, and the issue of life, the creation of life and its varieties, increasingly occupied attention and &quot;starting in the 1740s the concept of vital power reentered the scene of generation ... there must be some &#x27;productive power&#x27; in nature that enabled unorganized material to generate new living forms.&quot;

Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon wrote an influential work in 1749, &quot;Natural History&quot;, that revived interest in vital nature. Buffon held that there were certain penetrating powers which organised the organic particles that made up the living organism. Erasmus Darwin translated Buffon&#x27;s idea of organic particles into &quot;molecules with formative propensities&quot; and in Germany Buffon&#x27;s idea of an internal order, &quot;moule interieur&quot; arising out of the action of the penetrating powers was translated into German as &quot;Kraft&quot; (power).

The German term for vital power or living power, &quot;Lebenskraft&quot;, as distinct from chemical or physical forces, first appeared with Medicus&#x27;s on the Lebenskraft (1774). Scientists were now forced to consider hidden and mysterious powers of and in living matter that resisted physical laws – warm-blooded animals maintaining a consistent temperature despite changing outside temperatures, for example.

In 1759, Caspar Friedrich Wolff, a German embryologist provided evidence for the ancient idea of epigenesis, that is preformed life, that is a chick out of unformed substance and his dispute with Albrecht von Haller brought the issue of life to the forefront of natural science and philosophy. Wolff identified an &quot;essential power&quot; (&quot;essentliche Kraft&quot;, or &quot;vis essentialis&quot;) that allowed structure to be a result of power, &quot;the very power through which, in the vegetable body, all those things which we describe as life are effected.&quot;

====Blumenbach&#x27;s &quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;====
While Wolff was not concerned to name this vital organising, reproducing power, in 1780 Blumenbach posited a formative drive (&quot;nisus formativus&quot; or &quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;) responsible for biological &quot;procreation, nourishment, and reproduction&quot;, as well as self-development and self-perfection on a cultural level.

Blumenbach held that all living organisms &quot;from man down to maggots, and from the cedar to common mould or mucor&quot;, possess an inherent &quot;effort or tendency which, while life continues, is active and operative; in the first instance to attain the definite form of the species, then to preserve it entire, and, when it is infringed upon, so far as this is possible, to restore it.&quot; This power of vitality is &quot;not referable to any qualities merely physical, chemical, or mechanical.&quot;

Blumenbach compared the uncertainty about the origin and ultimate nature of the formative drive to similar uncertainties about gravitational attraction: &quot;just in the same way as we use the name of attraction or gravity to denote certain forces, the causes of which however still remain hid, as they say, in Cimmerian darkness, the formative force (nisus formativus) can explain the generation of animals.&quot;

At the same time, befitting the central idea of the science and medicine of dynamic polarity, it was also the physiological functional identity of what theorists of society or mind called &quot;aspiration&quot;. Blumenbach&#x27;s Bildungstrieb found quick passage into evolutionary theorizing of the decade following its formulation and in the thinking of the German natural philosophers.

One of Blumenbach&#x27;s contemporaries, Samuel Hahnemann, undertook to study in detail how this generative, reproductive and creative power, which he termed the &quot;Erzeugungskraft&quot; of the &quot;Lebenskraft&quot; of living power of the organism, could be negatively affected by inimical agents to engender disease.

====Blumenbach and Kant on &quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;====
Kant is said by several modern authors to have relied on Blumenbach&#x27;s biological concept of formative power in developing his idea of organic purpose. Kant wrote to Blumenbach in 1790 to praise his concept of the formative force (&quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;). However, whereas Kant had a heuristic concept in mind, to explain mechanical causes, Blumenbach conceived of a cause fully resident in nature. From this he would argue that the &quot;Bildungstrieb&quot; was central to the creation of new species. Though Blumenbach left no overt indications of sources for his theory of biological revolution, his ideas harmonize with those of Charles Bonnet and especially with those of his contemporary Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), and it was Herder whose ideas were influenced by Blumenbach. Blumenbach continued to refine the concept in his &quot;De nisu formativo et generationis negotio&quot; (&#x27;On the Formative Drive and the Operation of Generation&#x27;, 1787) and in the second edition (1788) of the &quot;Handbuch der Naturgeschichte&quot;: &#x27;it is a proper force (&quot;eigentliche Kraft&quot;), whose undeniable existence and extensive effects are apparent throughout the whole of nature and revealed by experience&#x27;. He consolidated these in the second edition of &quot;Über den Bildungstrieb&quot;.

Blumenbach had initially been an advocate of Haller&#x27;s view, in contrast to those of Wolff, that the essential elements of the embryo were already in the egg, he later sided with Wolff. Blumenbach provided evidence for the actual existence of this formative force, to distinguish it from other, merely nominal terms.

The way in which the Bildungstrieb differed, perhaps, from other such forces was in its comprehensive architectonic character: it directed the formation of anatomical structures and the operations of physiological processes of the organism so that various parts would come into existence and function interactively to achieve the ends of the species.

==Influence on German biology==
Blumenbach was regarded as a leading light of German science by his contemporaries. Kant and Friedrich Schelling both called him &quot;one of the most profound biological theorists of the modern era.&quot; In the words of science historian Peter Watson, &quot;roughly half the German biologists during the early nineteenth century studied under him or were inspired by him: Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer, Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, Heinrich Friedrich Link, Johann Friedrich Meckel, Johannes Illiger, and Rudolph Wagner.&quot;

<text>Aerides, known commonly as cat&#x27;s-tail orchids and fox brush orchids, is a genus belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae, subfamily Epidendroideae, tribe Vandeae, subtribe Aeridinae). It is a group of tropical epiphyte orchids that grow mainly in the warm lowlands of tropical Asia from India to southern China to New Guinea. They are valued in horticulture for their racemes of showy, fragrant, colorful flowers.

The name of the genus refers to the epiphytic growth habit of the species, and literally means &quot;air-plant&quot;. The type species, &quot;Aerides odorata&quot;, was described by João de Loureiro in 1790. This genus is abbreviated Aer in the horticultural trade.

==Description==
The species in this genus range from small to large monopodial epiphytes, except for &quot;Aerides krabiensis&quot;, which is a lithophyte. They form pendulous racemes with many long-lasting, fragrant, waxy flowers, which are often white with purple or pink edges. Some species have purple or pink flowers, and a few have yellow. Each flower has a forward-facing spur and grows on a sharp, stout, leafy stem. The leaves are distichous, growing in two vertical rows. The leaf margins are bilobed, and the apex is emarginate. There are ligules. Morphologically, they are very similar to species in the genus &quot;Vanda&quot;.

==Habitat==
The genus grows in the tropics of Asia, in India, Nepal, southern China, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. They flower from June to July. Temperature requirements vary from cool to warm growing depending on the species.

==Cultivation==
Most &quot;Aerides&quot; species are considered easy to grow. Their flowers are fragrant and long-lived, which make them popular in horticulture as cut flowers and potted plants. &quot;Aerides&quot; can be kept in hanging baskets, teak containers or net pots, which allow the roots to extend into the air. They grow best in well-drained media, such as tree fern fibers, fir bark, and sphagnum moss. They require full sunlight, warm temperatures, and water applied to the roots. The plants do not tolerate disturbance or damage of their root systems in cultivation.

The plants do not have pseudobulbs. The leaves are leathery and drought-resistant. Many of these species have a monopodial vine-like growth habit, and the plants can quickly grow large.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as of June 2014, all monopodial epiphytic plants except the lithophyte &quot;A. krabiense&quot;.

==Hybrids==
Natural hybrids include &quot;Aerides&quot; × &quot;jansonii&quot;, a cross between &quot;Aerides falcata&quot; and &quot;Aerides odorata&quot;.

Many hybrids have been made between &quot;Aerides&quot; and other orchids. The horticultural specimen × &quot;Christieara&quot; is a three-way hybrid between &quot;Aerides&quot;, &quot;Vanda&quot;, and &quot;Ascocentrum&quot;. Hybrids come in a wide range of colors due to the high degree of genetic diversity.

<doc id="364093" wikidata="Q566838" url="?curid=364093" title="Robot Wars (TV series)">
<text>Robot Wars is a British robot combat television series created by Tom Gutteridge and Stephen Carsey which aired from 1998 to 2004 and from 2016 to 2018. The series involves teams of amateur and professional roboteers operating remote controlled robots to fight against each other in an arena, which features hazards and the heavier &quot;House Robots&quot; which are hostile to all combatants. The first two series also included assault and trial courses.

The original run of the show consisted of six series broadcast on BBC Two from 20 February 1998 to 4 October 2002 (though the fifth and sixth series originally aired on BBC Choice), followed by a seventh series broadcast on Channel 5 from 2 November 2003 to 7 March 2004. A celebrity special aired on BBC One in 2000, and the spin-off &quot;Robot Wars Extreme&quot; originally aired on BBC Choice for two series in 2001 and 2003, before also airing on BBC Two.

Jeremy Clarkson presented the first series, before being replaced by Craig Charles for the rest of the original run, with co-hosting duties taken by Philippa Forrester (1998–2000, 2002–2003), Julia Reed (2000–2001) and Jayne Middlemiss (2003–2004). The revival aired three series and five specials on BBC Two from 11 July 2016 to 7 January 2018, presented by Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon. The announcer for the entirety of the series&#x27; run was Jonathan Pearce.

The series received six million viewers in the UK during its peak in the late 1990s, and the format went on to become a worldwide success which has aired in 45 countries. Its merchandising was commercially successful, being one of the best-selling toy ranges of 2002.

In 2003, roboteers from the series formed &quot;The Fighting Robot Association&quot; in order to organize live events. In 2013, Roaming Robots purchased the rights to the &quot;Robot Wars&quot; brand from Robot Wars LLC and operated their travelling robotic combat show under that name. The use of the name &quot;Robot Wars&quot; for live shows ceased in early 2017, being renamed &quot;Extreme Robots&quot;.

==History==
===US Robot Wars events===
&quot;Robot Wars&quot; was the brainchild of Marc Thorpe, a designer working for the LucasToys division of Lucasfilm. In 1992, Thorpe had the initial idea for robot combat sport after unsuccessfully attempting to create a radio-controlled vacuum cleaner. In 1994, Marc Thorpe created &quot;Robot Wars&quot; and held the first competition at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco. Approximately one month prior to the event, Thorpe formed a partnership with New York-based record company Sm:)e Communications, later Profile Records, who provided additional funding.

Between 1995 and 1997, three further &quot;Robot Wars&quot; events took place in America and in 1995, Profile Records partnered with production company Mentorn to produce and televise a &quot;Robot Wars&quot; event in the UK. Mentorn acquired the worldwide television rights from Profile in 1995 after Tom Gutteridge (the head of Mentorn) had seen an amateur tape of a San Francisco event.

===Original television series===
Gutteridge and one of his producers Steve Carsey created a television format based on the &quot;Robot Wars&quot; concept. They produced a live event opposite BBC Television Centre in Wood Lane, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London and hired Derek Foxwell to build 3 combat robots, 2 of which were named The Mouse and Grunt who would eventually take part in the first UK series of &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, to take on three American robots, Thor, La Machine and The Master, all of which were veterans of the original American competition. The Controller of BBC Two, Michael Jackson, attended the event, which was not filmed and he promised to commission a series. However, it was not until 1998 that a subsequent Controller of BBC Two, Mark Thompson, fulfilled Jackson&#x27;s promise and actually commissioned 6 episodes. Gutteridge and Carsey were producers and Foxwell was the technical supervisor and senior technical consultant. He drafted the rules and regulations and was in charge of the pit area and the technical team, which scrutinised the robots, got them on and off stage and helped the contestants prepare and repair their robots. Mat Irvine, initially a member of the technical team, served as a member of the judging panel in 2002 and 2003.

The three person judging panel consisted of Noel Sharkey (head judge on every series: 1998–2003, 2016–), Eric Dickinson (1998), Adam Harper (1998–99), Martin Smith (1999–2003), Myra Wilson (2000–01), Mat Irvine (2001–03), Sethu Vijayakumar (2016–) and Lucy Rogers (2016–).

Profile sought no input or consent from Thorpe before doing this, which aggravated the already troubled relationship between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding the ownership of the &quot;Robot Wars&quot; concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however and the initial series of &quot;Robot Wars&quot; in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than two million viewers and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for The National Network (now Paramount Network) and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. TechTV (and later G4techTV/G4) in the US aired the UK series proper. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit into any of the conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an aircraft hangar at RAF Newton.

Viewing figures dropped significantly in the early 2000s, reaching only 1.2 million in the sixth series - the final to be broadcast on BBC Two. It was cancelled by the BBC in March 2003, and Mentorn announced it was making 22 episodes for Channel 5, concluding with The Third World Championships broadcast in March 2004. Following its move to Channel 5 in November 2003, the show first began airing in a new Sunday night slot and launched with one million viewers; however ratings fell quickly to 800,000 resulting in the show moving to Saturday nights after just three episodes. Channel 5 later axed the show after one series due to low ratings. After Robot Wars ended, an edited half-hour version of this series aired on Fox Kids (later Jetix) from 2004, on Bravo from after 2004, on Dave from 2010 and on Challenge &amp; Sky History from before 2016.

===Revival===

On 13 January 2016, the BBC confirmed that it would be rebooting the show for a six-part series. The revived series was hosted by Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator. The first episode was broadcast on 24 July at 8pm, the same slot as &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Some robots from the original series returned, including Behemoth and Storm II, as well as four of the original House Robots, which were upgraded to be heavier, faster, better armed and with new looks. The 2016 series was filmed in a warehouse at Westway Park in Renfrew, Scotland.

The first episode received about two million viewers and was the top trending topic on Twitter with over 20,000 tweets.

A second rebooted series was commissioned with a first celebrity special in 16 years, in which celebrities, such as Olympians Kadeena Cox and Alistair Brownlee and Jonny Brownlee, TV presenters Suzi Perry, Neil Oliver and Maggie Aderin-Pocock, singer Jordan Stevens and radio presenters Scott Mills and Robbie Savage had bespoke robots designed for them by eight major roboteers, who mentored them during the specials.

During its original airing, the first rebooted series was sometimes referred to as &#x27;Series 1&#x27;, presenting itself as a completely new show. Starting in 2017, however, the BBC began referring to it as Series 8, with the following second series appropriately dubbed Series 9, acknowledging itself as a continuation of the original show. Following the 10th series, it was revealed that the BBC had decided not to renew the show for an 11th, and Robot Wars has been axed for the second time, the complete cancellation was met with backlash from fans.

==Battle rules==
A robot could lose a match in several ways during the knockout format of the show:
*Immobilisation: A robot that is unable to move is counted out. In the original series 30 seconds of immobility were necessary, in later series this was reduced to 10 seconds.
*Pit: One of the arena hazards is the &quot;pit of oblivion&quot;, a large square hole in the arena. A robot that falls or is pushed into this is eliminated.
*Removal from arena: If a robot is ejected from the arena – typically by the flipper or vertical flywheel of an opponent, it is eliminated. In the original series the perimeter of the arena was a short barrier, in later series the wall was higher, making this type of elimination harder. In the rebooted series, only certain areas of the arena were not fully walled off. This meant that removal from the arena was only practical in certain areas.
* If none of the above conditions were satisfied, a panel of three judges (listed below) scored the competitors on style, control, damage and aggression.
:The judges&#x27; decisions are based on the following categories: 
:*Aggression: The extent to which the robot was on the &#x27;front foot&#x27; against the opposing robot as opposed to staying out of trouble.
:*Damage: The amount of damage inflicted on the opposing robot.
:*Control: The ability of the driver to push opposing robots, avoiding the arena hazards and if they&#x27;re attacking how they&#x27;re meant to. 
:*Style (original series only): The extent to which the robot demonstrated its abilities such as self-righting. For the revived series, the style category was omitted.
:In the original series, the Aggression, Damage, Control and Style points were weighted 3:4:2:1 respectively. In the 2016 series the weightings for Aggression, Damage and Control were 3:2:1, with &quot;Style&quot; no longer a judged criterion.

Although the format changed several times over the years, these rules remained the same across all series and competitions.

==Format==
===Domestic===
===Extreme===
There were also two series made for the UK, &quot;Robot Wars Extreme&quot;, which did not focus on a single championship.

==Presenters==
The first series of &quot;Robot Wars&quot; was presented by Jeremy Clarkson and co-hosted by Philippa Forrester. In keeping with his edgy persona established on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Clarkson frequently made tongue-in-cheek jokes about competitors and their robots, such as remarking that a contestant robot called &quot;Skarab&quot; looked like &quot;cheese on toast&quot;.

Clarkson left &quot;Robot Wars&quot; after the first series and was replaced with Craig Charles. Charles, well known as playing the character Dave Lister in the science fiction-themed sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, was seen as taking the programme and its contestants more seriously than Clarkson and was more enthusiastic while presenting it. He was also often known as the &quot;Master of Mayhem&quot; when introduced at the start of episodes from Extreme 1 onwards. Charles would close each episode with a four line poem ending with the words &quot;Robot Wars&quot;. Charles presented &quot;Robot Wars&quot; until it ceased production in 2004.

In comparison to Charles&#x27; background in science fiction, Philippa Forrester was best known as co-host of the science and technology programme &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. Her role on &quot;Robot Wars&quot; was as the pit reporter who would speak to contestants about their robots before and after battles. Forrester was pit reporter for six of the show&#x27;s nine series; Julia Reed took the role for Series 4 and Extreme 1 since Forrester was unable to participate in the programme due to pregnancy, but Forrester returned for Series 5, Series 6 and Extreme 2. When the programme moved to Channel 5 for the seventh series, Forrester did not return for unknown reasons, so Jayne Middlemiss took over the pit reporter duties.

Jonathan Pearce was the show&#x27;s commentator throughout its entire run, becoming one of only two people (the other being judge Noel Sharkey) to appear in every episode of the programme; he commentated in the same loud and enthusiastic manner as his football commentaries. The programme was well known for phrases such as &quot;Roboteers, stand by&quot;, &quot;3. 2. 1. Activate&quot; and &quot;Cease!&quot;. These phrases were announced by the director, Stuart McDonald and became a recognisable part of the series for the entire duration of its run.

In 2016, Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon were announced as the hosts of the eighth series, with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator. They reprised their roles in the ninth and tenth series.

==House robots==
Throughout the series, house robots acted as obstacles to competing robots in battles and challenges. House robots were permitted to attack robots that were in the Corner Patrol Zones at the corners of the arena or upon the submission of a competing robot. The house robots were an intrinsic part of the programme&#x27;s success and merchandising of these robots was highly successful. Furthermore, the house robots were not subject to the weight limit or weapon rules that contestant robots had to adhere to, the most notable example of this was Sergeant Bash&#x27;s flamethrower.

From the Fourth Wars, a non-competitive &quot;Refbot&quot; was present during fights. This robot conveyed officiating signals (such as counting out immobile competitors) on the arena, gave occasional nudges to help battles along and could deploy a fire extinguisher where necessary.

For Series 8, new versions of Matilda, Shunt, Dead Metal and Sir Killalot were constructed. They are considerably heavier with improved weaponry. All the house robots are over in weight and Sir Killalot now weighs . Visually, all four look similar to their predecessors, but with significant differences: Dead Metal&#x27;s head has been enlarged with glowing eyes, Matilda&#x27;s back-mounted fins have been replaced with smaller crocodilian scales, spikes appear on her frill, her eyes are now red and her whole head section now flips up; Shunt has enlarged wheel protectors and metal chimneys replacing the smokestack; and Sir Killalot&#x27;s armour and helmet has been entirely redesigned. This was said to be to show the actual shape of Sir Killalot&#x27;s head, rather than the helmet he is wearing. The other house robots did not return for this series.

Bold text indicates house robots that returned for the new series.

==Arena and hazards==
===Arenas===

There were numerous arena incarnations used during the original run of &quot;Robot Wars&quot; on the BBC. These arenas were also used by international versions such as &quot;Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors&quot; in the United States. The arena was approximately . For Series 1 to 3 the arena was not enclosed as such, as the audience were raised above the arena. The increasing sophistication of weaponry from contestant robots – most notably demonstrated by Hypno-Disc in Series 3 – as well as arena hazards prompted producers to enclose the arena entirely in a perspex box high from Series 4 onwards, to protect the audience and production team from debris.

In early 2004, the Robot Wars arena was purchased from the television production firm Mentorn by a company called Robot Arenas Ltd., based in the UK, an organization set up by a past competitor in Robot Wars to continue the sport of robot combat in the UK. The arena – valued originally at £11,000 – was sold for scrap in 2005 for £250 by the new owners of the former RAF Newton air base, where the arena was housed. A suit filed against RAF Newton by Robot Arenas Ltd. found that RAF Newton had acted reasonably in the matter and owed no compensation to Robot Arenas Ltd.

In 2016, a new arena was constructed in a warehouse in Renfrew, on the outskirts of Glasgow, for use in the rebooted series. This arena is square, with a steel floor and higher bulletproof walls, making it harder for robots to be thrown out of the arena.

===Hazards===

Throughout Robot Wars&#x27; run, arena booby-traps were introduced and amended. Generally, traps which proved ineffective were omitted in later series, however some traps proved to be a success (such as the Pit of Oblivion, Floor Flipper and the Drop Zone) and were retained. The assorted traps in the arena that changed from one series the next included:

*Arena Sidebars - The First Wars Only - These were parts of the arena side fence that were on the floor. These trapped robots and potentially immobilised them if they could not drive off.
*The Patrol Zone (commonly known as PZs) - The First Wars only - Four large squares in the corners of the arena marked with striped tape, each occupied by one House Robot and a booby-trap. Once a competitor robot entered one of these zones, it was open to attack by the House Robot within. The Patrol Zones were much like the CPZ&#x27;s that appeared in later series but were much larger.
*Floor grilles - The First Wars Only - Grille floor panels that, like the arena sidebars mentioned above, were designed to trap robots and not allow them to drive off. Proved much more effective than the sidebars. (similar to the flame pit introduced in the second wars)
*Floor spikes - The First Wars to The Third Wars and Series 8 onwards - These were pneumatic spikes located in several positions on the arena floor that came up whenever a robot drove over them. They trapped robots and on occasion flipped them. They were removed for Series 4 after causing many upsets during The Third Wars, where robots currently winning battles would be overturned and then lose. This most notably happened during Heat B when Behemoth was flipped, could not self-right and its opponent Pitbull won by default. For Series 8, a group of five large spikes form one of the four main traps of the arena. They are powerful and large enough to lift and trap robots for a brief moment (as happened to Bonk in the opening episode), but are not as fast as their predecessors. In theory, this will avoid the sort of upsets seen in Series 3. One spike &#x27;hole&#x27; is capable of emitting sparks.
*The Perimeter Patrol Zones (commonly known as PPZs) - The Second Wars only – A narrow band around the perimeter of the arena that replaced the Patrol Zones. A competitor robot that entered this area was open to attack by any or all of the House Robots stationed there.
*The Side Patrol Zones (commonly known as SPZs (Pinball Only)) - The Second Wars to The Fourth Wars - the House Robots guard three tyre targets in the sides of the arena during the Pinball Warrior Tournament (Two of the side tyre targets score 50 points and one scores 75 points if any tyre target is pressed).
*The Pit of Oblivion - The Second Wars onwards - Arguably the arena&#x27;s most iconic feature, this was a square hole in the arena floor, painted black on the inside and partially filled with old tyres. If a robot drove, fell, or was pushed into the Pit, it would be instantly eliminated. In The Second Wars, pits were added to both lanes of The Gauntlet. For The Third Wars the Pit was open during the first two rounds of each heat, then covered during the heat final and following matches. In The Fourth Wars, the Pit was redesigned, with a yellow-and-black chevron-tape outline and was covered until halfway into a battle, whereupon it would &quot;descend&quot;. From its very first appearance in The Second Wars, the Pit included a small pyrotechnic &quot;explosion&quot; that formed a large ball of white smoke. This would activate when a robot fell into the Pit, primarily used to show that a competitor had fallen in. This was changed to a small firework explosion for The Third Wars but the smoke returned for The Fourth Wars and remained until the end. From Extreme 1 onwards there was a device on the arena wall that competitor or house robots could use to activate the pit opening. In Extreme and The Fifth Wars that device was a tyre. For The Sixth Wars the tyre was replaced by a metal bumper. The tyre returned in Extreme 2 and remained for the remainder of the shows&#x27; run. The pit was enlarged and given an LED decoration on the inside for the eighth series, with the pyrotechnic no longer used. Since Series 9, the pyrotechnics have returned to the Pit.
*Flame Pit - The Second Wars onwards - A large square grill located close to the right bottom corner of the arena resembling a kitchen stove. Used to set fire to flammable robots and damage electronics. For the eighth series, this was moved to the upper left corner of the arena. (similar to the floor grills which only appeared in the first wars)
*The Corner Patrol Zones (commonly known as CPZs) - The Third Wars onwards - the House Robots were now confined to the four corners of the arena much like in The First Wars. Which house robot was used in which battle was defined by a rota system but would also sometimes depend on if a house robot was being repaired. In The Fourth Wars, the house robots switched to a rota system of Shunt, Matilda, Sgt. Bash and Dead Metal. Sir Killalot consistently appeared every round excepting battles 3 &amp; 4 of the War of Independence when the original 4 house robots occupy all the CPZs. From The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 onwards only two house robots were allowed in the arena at a time and this moved in a rota through all of the machines. However some House Robots did not appear in a show or on some occasions missed several shows before making an appearance. For Series 8, the CPZs are larger and L-shaped. The house robots no longer attack competitors who enter any CPZ, but stick to guarding their own and can still attack robots that have been immobilised.
*The Floor Flipper - The Third Wars onwards - A powerful pneumatic flipper set into the floor resembling an aircraft carrier catapult, capable of throwing a robot across the arena. It was generally only used on robots that had already been defeated, but was occasionally fired during events such as the House Robot Rebellion. When originally introduced, it just looked like a part of the arena floor. For The Fourth Wars the flipper was given a yellow/black paint scheme similar to the redesigned Pit of Oblivion. For Extreme 1/Series 5 the power of the flipper increased, allowing it to hurl even the heaviest robots into the air and flip featherweight robots out of the arena. For Series 8, this is no longer used as a coup de grace for defeated robots, but fires independently during a fight. It is positioned diagonally on the floor and is capable not only of launching robots into the air but also trapping robots as it closes.
*Red &amp; Blue Perimeters (Sumo &amp; Tag Team Terror only) - The Fourth Wars only - The Red Perimeter zone is for two robots in the red tag team and the Blue Perimeter zone is for two robots in the blue tag team.
*Angle Grinders - The Third Wars and Extreme 1 to The Seventh Wars - Abrasive grinding wheels built into the arena railings. The grinders were replaced with small pneumatic spikes in The Fourth Wars but brought back from Extreme 1 onwards.
*Pneumatic Spikes - The Fourth Wars only - As mentioned above, they replaced the Angle Grinders but proved ineffective so were omitted after one series.
*CO2 geysers - The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 onwards - High pressure CO2 outlets designed to cause internal damage to robots, but were more useful for extinguishing fires.
*The Drop Zone - The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 to The Seventh Wars - A square on the arena floor where heavy objects (television sets, ocean buoys, refrigerators, washing machines, etc.) fell from the top of the arena. Like the Floor Flipper, it was only used on robots that were already immobile. It was actually first used in Series 6 and Extreme 2, although the spot where the object would fall, a black square with a yellow &#x27;X&#x27; shape across it, although it first appeared in The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1. Viewers did not know the purpose of this at the time. It is believed it was due to be used in Extreme 1 and The Fifth Wars Semi-Finals and Grand Final but technical difficulties meant it was abandoned.
*The Disc of Doom - The Sixth Wars and Extreme 2 only - A circular spinning panel set into the arena floor activated by a buffer similar to the pit release. This trap was used to disrupt a robot&#x27;s driving and worked well on lighter competitors, but proved ineffective against Heavyweight robots. It first appeared in both The Sixth Wars and Extreme 2 but was removed for The Seventh Wars to be replaced by The Dial of Doom in the near future.
*The Dial of Doom/Doom Dial - Series 9 to Series 10. A dial that will activate when the arena tyre is pressed. If the dial swings left, it will open up the pit and if the dial swings right, it will activate &quot;Rogue House Robot&quot; which allows a house robot to leave the CPZ and attack a competitor robot for up to 10 seconds. Additionally, from the Tenth Wars, swinging right may trigger &quot;The Fog of War&quot; in which the arena is filled with CO2 for 10 seconds, obscuring the robots from view.

==Competitors and results==

*Note: After THE BASH was found to be irreparable in the World Series after its first and only battle, it was directly replaced by Tough As Nails.

==Merchandise==
===Toys (from Logistix Kids &amp; Hexbug)===

Pullback and Friction toys were made of all the House Robots, with the exception of Cassius Chrome as the toys from Logistix Kids had stopped production when it was introduced for The Seventh Wars and the toys would have resumed production by Series 8, 9 or 10, but this did not happen until Hexbug took over and did so rather late in 2018 after Series 10 ended. There were also pullback and ripcord toys of the Series 3, 4, 5, 6, Extreme 1 and Extreme 2 Competitor Robots, with the exception of Apollo, Behemoth, Carbide, Eruption, Kronic the Wedgehog, Mute, Road Block, Storm 2 and Typhoon 2 as Hexbug took over from Logistix Kids which are Chaos 2, Dantomkia, Firestorm, Hypno-Disc, Panic Attack, Pussycat, Razer, Stinger, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese and X-Terminator 2. Each came with an accessory.

There were remote controlled versions of Shunt, Matilda, Sir Killalot and Growler. There were also smaller remote control battlers, which had &quot;immobilisation spots&quot; on the rear of the toy. Sgt. Bash and the competitor robot Tornado were the only two made. These were smaller than the other remote control robots mentioned above.

There were customisable kit toys of the House Robot Matilda and competitors Hypno-Disc and Panic Attack. A Sergeant Bash pitstop kit was prototyped but never released.

Minibots were a series of small die-cast replica robots. The range included all of the Series 3, 4, 5 and Extreme 1 House Robots along with competitor robots Chaos 2, Dominator 2, Firestorm, Gemini, Hypno-Disc, Mega Morg, Panic Attack, Plunderbird 5, Pussycat, Razer, Suicidal Tendencies, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese, Wild Thing and X-Terminator 2. They had an interactive replica arena and two additional playsets.

===Home media===
Several VHS videos were released of the show. These included &quot;The First Great War&quot; a look at the making of Series 1, &quot;The First World Championship&quot; which was released exclusively on video and the &quot;Ultimate Warrior Collection&quot; featuring exclusive access to the teams of Chaos 2, Hypno-Disc and Razer, along with footage of their battles. Along the same lines an &quot;Ultimate Archive Collection&quot; was released showing exclusive footage of the House Robots and their operators along with some of their greatest battles and most embarrassing moments.

The Ultimate Warrior Collection and Ultimate Archive Collection were also released on DVD. The footage and content remained the same as the VHS releases. Series 8 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 29 August 2016, making it the first full series of &quot;Robot Wars&quot; to be released on home media. It was later released digitally. The Complete Compendium 2017 contained Series 9 and 10, along with the &quot;Battle of the Stars&quot; specials, were released on 11 December 2017 as a 5-disc DVD box set.

===Video games===
&quot;Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem&quot; is the first game based on the show, released on Game Boy Color in 2000. It was followed in 2001 by &quot;Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction&quot; on PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows and &quot;Robot Wars: Advanced Destruction&quot; on Game Boy Advance. After the first three titles sold over 250,000 copies, a fourth and final game, released on Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows and Xbox in 2002 was called &quot;Robot Wars: Extreme Destruction&quot;.

===Other===
A large array of other merchandise was produced due to the success of the show. Items available included mugs, glasses, mobile phone covers, toiletries, stationery, clocks, watches, bedding, curtains and clothing. The show even produced an unsuccessful single, which peaked at number 51 in the UK singles charts in December 2000, called &quot;Sir Killalot Vs. Robo Babe - Robot Wars (Android Love)&quot;. A custom made game officially licensed under Robot Wars LLC was started on in October 2013, using the Robot Arena 2 video game as the base engine. It featured many robots from the TV series as well as robots competing in the newer live events. It also included the original Robot Wars arena and various live arenas. It was released to the public in September 2015 and an updated version which included more robots was released in February 2016. A smaller update was released in January 2017, adding two new robots. Another update came in August 2017 which added the new Robot Wars arena from the current series and another new arena as well as some unreleased robots from the beta and robots that were due to be released in a cancelled expansion. It is only available for Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="364094" wikidata="Q331485" url="?curid=364094" title="Jean-Marie Messier">
<text>Jean-Marie Messier (born 13 December 1956) is a French businessman who was chairman and chief executive of the multinational media conglomerate Vivendi (formerly Vivendi Universal) until 2002. He is also frequently referred to by nicknames such as &quot;J2M&quot; and &quot;J6M&quot;, but most notably as “ The Man who Tried to Buy the World” which was coined by Jo Johnson in his biography of Messier reflecting on corporate greed and monopolizing the industry.

==Early life and education==
Jean-Marie Messier was born in Grenoble, France, the son of an accountant. 

He studied at the École Polytechnique from 1976 to 1980, and then at the École nationale d&#x27;administration between 1980 and 1982. He was refused sponsorship by Total to study at Harvard Business School.

==Business career==
Messier held several posts at the French Economy Ministry, including a post as technical counselor for privatization under Édouard Balladur, during the 1980s, before moving to investment bank Lazard Frères in 1989. He established the boutique bank Messier Partners. 

After taking up the chairmanship of the utility company Compagnie Générale des Eaux in 1994, he oversaw its diversification into the media sector and its 2000 merger with Groupe Canal+ and Seagram (owners of Universal Studios) to form Vivendi Universal.

===Forced resignation===
Messier was forced to resign from his position with Vivendi in July 2002, after the company posted a non-cash loss of 13.6 billion euro ($US 11.8 billion) during 2001. During his time as CEO of Vivendi, Messier used corporate funds to buy a $17.5 million apartment for his personal use at 515 Park Avenue at 60th Street in New York City, the swank Arthur Zeckendorf development that was home to Senator Jon Corzine for a time. After he was fired, Messier tried to claim the apartment as part of his severance package, but was rebuffed. However, he did receive 23.4 million dollars in severance from his former employer, Vivendi. Messier then relocated to New York City to work as a business consultant.

==Prosecution and conviction==
Messier was put on trial in France in 2011 and was found guilty of misappropriation of company funds and divulging misleading information when he headed Vivendi. He appealed the decision, and in 2014 the court overturned Messier&#x27;s conviction on charges of misleading investors but upheld the conviction on charges of misuse of corporate funds.

==Personal life==
Messier married Antoinette Fleisch in 1982, with whom he has five children; they separated in 2005. In 2012, he remarried Christel Delaval.

Messier published an autobiography titled &quot;j6m.com&quot; in 2020, and another two years later called &quot;My True Diary&quot;, which is about his time at Vivendi.

<text>Gemini 6A (officially Gemini VI-A) was a 1965 crewed United States spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. 
The mission, flown by Wally Schirra and Thomas P. Stafford, achieved the first crewed rendezvous with another spacecraft, its sister Gemini 7. Although the Soviet Union had twice previously launched simultaneous pairs of Vostok spacecraft, these established radio contact with each other, but they had no ability to adjust their orbits in order to rendezvous and came no closer than several kilometers of each other, while the Gemini 6 and 7 spacecraft came as close as one foot (30 cm) and could have docked had they been so equipped.

Gemini 6A was the fifth crewed Gemini flight, the 13th crewed American flight, and the 21st crewed spaceflight of all time (including two X-15 flights over ).

* Inclination: 28.97°
* Period: 88.7 min

===Stationkeeping with GT-7===
* Start: December 15, 1965 19:33 UTC
* End: December 16, 1965 00:52 UTC
* Duration: 5 hours, 19 minutes

==Objective==
The original Gemini 6 mission, scheduled for launch on October 25, 1965, at 11:41 am EDT, had a planned mission duration of 46 hours 47 minutes, completing a total of 29 orbits. It was to land in the western Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda.

The mission was to include four dockings with the Agena Target Vehicle. The first docking was scheduled for five hours and forty minutes into the mission. The second was scheduled for seven hours and forty-five minutes, the third at nine hours and forty minutes, and the fourth and final docking at ten hours and five minutes into the mission. The final undocking would take place at 18 hours and 20 minutes into the mission. At 23 hours and 55 minutes into the mission, while the spacecraft passed over White Sands, New Mexico, the crew was to attempt to observe a laser beam originating from the ground. The retrorockets were scheduled to be fired at 46 hours and 10 minutes into the mission over the Pacific Ocean on the 29th orbit.

Original mission plans also included the first live television coverage of the recovery of a U.S. spacecraft at sea from the recovery ship, the U.S. aircraft carrier &quot;Wasp&quot;. The &quot;Wasp&quot; was fitted with ground station equipment by ITT to relay live television, via the Intelsat I (nicknamed the &quot;Early Bird&quot;) satellite.

===Original mission canceled===
On October 25, 1965, Schirra and Stafford boarded their Gemini 6 craft to prepare for launch. Fifteen minutes later, the uncrewed Atlas-Agena target vehicle was launched. After a successful burn of the Atlas booster, the Agena&#x27;s engine fired to separate it from the Atlas. But immediately after the Agena&#x27;s engine fired at the six-minute mark in the flight, telemetry was lost. A catastrophic failure apparently caused the vehicle to explode, as Range Safety was tracking multiple pieces of debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean. After 50 minutes, the Gemini launch was canceled.

===Revised mission===
After reviewing the situation, NASA decided to launch an alternate &quot;Gemini 6A&quot; mission, eight days after the launch of Gemini 7, which was scheduled as a 14-day long-duration mission in December. Gemini 6A would perform the first rendezvous of two spacecraft in orbit, using Gemini 7 as the target, though they would not dock. The crews also discussed the possibility of Stafford performing an EVA from 6A to 7, swapping places with Gemini 7 pilot Jim Lovell, but the commander of Gemini 7, Frank Borman, objected, pointing out that it would require Lovell to wear an uncomfortable EVA suit on a long-duration mission.

==Flight==

===First launch attempt===
The first attempt to launch the 6A mission (second attempt for Gemini spacecraft No. 6) was on December 12, 1965, at 9:54 a.m. EST. All went well right up to ignition; the engines ignited, but after about 1.5 seconds they abruptly shut down. Since the lift-off clock had started in the spacecraft, mission rules dictated that Wally Schirra, as the commander, had to immediately pull the D-ring between his knees and activate the ejection seats, carrying the astronauts away from the disaster that would be the result of a fully fueled Titan II falling back onto LC-19. However, Schirra did not feel any movement and knew that the booster had not lifted, so he decided not to abort. His quick thinking probably saved the mission as the reliability of the Gemini ejector seats was questionable; the astronauts could have been badly injured from high g-forces as the seats had to launch them at least 800 feet, which was deemed a safe distance from an exploding Titan II.

In addition, the cabin interior had been soaking in pure oxygen for hours. Tom Stafford, in a NASA oral history in 1997, later recalled:

Even if the astronauts had not been injured or killed, ejection would ruin the spacecraft and delay the mission for months.

After the Stage I engines ignited and shut down, fuel (UDMH) was leaking out of the PSV drain valve. The fuel had been ignited by the engine start, and the resulting fire was discovered when the Pad Crew inspected the engine compartment. Water spray was initiated and a cap was installed on the drain line. About 60 minutes after the aborted launch, the booster and spacecraft had been made safe and the service tower raised up to it. After removing the propellants from the Titan II, the booster was checked out and they quickly uncovered one culprit, which was an umbilical plug that dropped out of the base of the booster prematurely. This plug sent a lift-off signal to the spacecraft. Testing revealed that some plugs came out more easily than others, so they were replaced by different ones that would stay in place properly.

However, the electrical plug turned out to not be the only problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan actually began experiencing thrust decay before the plug dropped out. Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.

Had the inadvertent electrical disconnect not occurred, the abort sensing system would have sent a shutoff command to the Titan at T+2.2 seconds due to the loss of Engine No. 2 chamber pressure. Since launcher release and liftoff would take place at T+3.2 seconds, a pad fallback still would not have occurred in this scenario and the astronauts would have been safe.

===Second attempt and rendezvous===

The Titan&#x27;s batteries were replaced and the fuel prevalves, which had opened, were removed and it was decided to launch without them. The second attempt to launch the 6A mission (third attempt for Gemini spacecraft No. 6) was successful on December 15 at 8:37:26 a.m. EST. All went well through launch and ascent; first stage cutoff occurred at T+160 seconds and second stage cutoff at T+341 seconds. Spacecraft separation occurred at T+361 seconds and the crew entered a orbit.

The plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of Gemini 6. Their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their speed by 5 meters (16 feet) per second. Due to their lower orbit they were gaining on Gemini 7 and were only 730 miles, (or 1,175 kilometers), behind. The next burn was at two hours and eighteen minutes when Gemini 6A made a phase adjustment to put them on the same orbital inclination as Gemini 7. They now only trailed by .

The radar on Gemini 6A first made contact with Gemini 7 at three hours and fifteen minutes when they were away. A third burn put them into a orbit. As they slowly gained, Schirra put Gemini 6A&#x27;s computer in charge of the rendezvous. At five hours and four minutes, he saw a bright star that he thought was Sirius, but this was in fact Gemini 7.
After several more burns, the two spacecraft were only 130 feet (40 meters) apart. The burns had only used 112 lbs. (51 kilograms) of propellant on Gemini 6A, leaving plenty for some fly-arounds. During the next 270 minutes, the crews moved as close as one foot (30 centimeters), talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were stationkeeping so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.

Schirra said that because there is no turbulence in space, &quot;I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of Gemini 7, literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence&quot;. As the crew sleep periods approached, Gemini 6A made a separation burn and slowly drifted more than from Gemini 7. This ensured that there would not be any accidental collisions while the astronauts slept.

===A Christmas surprise===

The next day, before reentry, the crew of Gemini 6A had a surprise:

At that point, the sound of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was heard played on an eight-note Hohner &quot;Little Lady&quot; harmonica and a handful of small bells. The Smithsonian Institution claims these were the first musical instruments played in space and keeps the instruments on display.

===Reentry===

Gemini 6A fired its retro-rockets and landed within of the planned site in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Turks and Caicos. It was the first recovery to be televised live, through a transportable satellite earth station developed by ITT on the deck of the recovery aircraft carrier USS &quot;Wasp&quot;.

The Gemini 7 and 6A missions were supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources: 10,125 personnel, 125 aircraft and 16 ships.

==Insignia==
Walter Schirra explained the patch in the book &quot;All We Did Was Fly to the Moon&quot;:
The original patch had called the flight GTA-6 (for Gemini-Titan-Agena) and showed the Gemini craft chasing an Agena. It was changed when the mission was altered to depict two Gemini spacecraft.
==Spacecraft location==

The spacecraft is currently on display at the Stafford Air &amp; Space Museum in Weatherford, Oklahoma, having previously been displayed at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City. The spacecraft had previously been on display at the Omniplex Science Museum elsewhere in the city. It is on a long-term loan from the Smithsonian Institution.

Before being moved to Oklahoma, the spacecraft was displayed at the St. Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Kahlan () was one of the main tribal confederations of Saba&#x27; in Ancient Yemen. They are descended from Kahlan bin Saba bin Yishjab bin Yarub bin Qahtan.

==Conflict with Himyar==
By the 2nd century BC Saba&#x27; was declining gradually and its southern neighbor Himyar was able to settle many nomadic tribes that were allied to Himyar and create a stronger Himyarite nation in the lowlands. Eventually Saba&#x27; was incorporated into Himyar and resistance was reduced to the Kahlan tribes who were overpowered by Himyar and forced out of Highlands in Yemen. Most of Kahlan remained in the Yemeni desert region around Marib until the destruction of the Dam in the 3rd century AD. this forced the Kahlani tribes to emigrate northwards through Arabia. They reaching as far as Mesopotamia and Syria prior to the 7th century Arab conquests under Islam. After the Arab conquests, the Kahlani Arabs, among other Qahtani and Adnani tribes, reached all the way to the far edges of the Umayyad Empire.

==The Kahlan Septs==
The Kahlan branched into 5 main branches; Azd, Hamdan, Lakhm, Tayy, Kinda.

Another branch headed west back to Yemen and a group went further West all the way to Tihama on the Red Sea. This branch will become known as Azd Uman after Islam.

=== Jafnah ibn &#x27;Amr ===

<doc id="364114" wikidata="Q2565941" url="?curid=364114" title="Royal Military College of Canada">
<text>The Royal Military College of Canada (), abbreviated in English as RMC and in French as CMR, is a military academy and, since 1959, a degree-granting university of the Canadian Armed Forces. It was established in 1874 and conducted its first classes on June 1, 1876. Programs are offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels, both on campus as well as through the college&#x27;s distance learning program via the Division of Continuing Studies. 

Located on Point Frederick, a peninsula in Kingston, Ontario, the college is a mix of historic buildings and more modern academic, athletic, and dormitory facilities. RMC officer cadets are trained in what are known as the &quot;four pillars&quot;: academics, officership, athletics, and bilingualism.

==Corporate==
The Royal Military College of Canada prepares officer cadets for a long career in the profession of arms and continues the development of other Canadian Armed Forces members and civilians with an interest in defence issues. RMC provides programs and courses of higher education and professional development to meet the needs of the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence.

RMC is responsible to:
*Provide a university education in both official languages in appropriate disciplines designed on a broad base to meet the unique needs of the Canadian Armed Forces
*Develop qualities of leadership in officer cadets
*Develop the ability to communicate in both official languages for officer cadets
*Develop a high standard of physical fitness
*Stimulate an awareness of the ethic of the military profession
*Conduct research activities in support of RMC and to meet the needs of Defence Research Agencies
The RMC priorities are:
*To build high quality, world-class programs in areas of importance to the Canadian Armed Forces and to Canada
*To promote national and international collaborations and partnerships
*To promote interdisciplinary co-operation.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Long before the Royal Military College was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. As early as 1815, the Assembly of Lower Canada decided to establish a military college, but agreement upon its organization was blocked by religious and linguistic conflicts. Subsequent attempts also proved to be abortive, although some military schools were established.

Following the withdrawal of British forces from Canada in 1870–71, the federal government recognized the need for an officer training college in Canada. In 1874, during the administration of Alexander Mackenzie, &quot;the real founder of the college&quot;, &quot;An Act to Establish a Military College&quot;, was passed by the Parliament of Canada. The legislation provided for the establishment of a college &quot;providing a complete education in all branches of military tactics, fortification, engineering, and general scientific knowledge in subjects connected with and necessary to thorough knowledge of the military profession&quot; in one of the Garrison Towns of Canada&quot;.

The new college, named Military College of Canada, opened on June 1, 1876, with 18 cadets under Lt.-Col. Edward Osborne Hewett, R.E. The names of these &quot;Old Eighteen&quot; are memorized by all cadets today. Entrance was by examination, and the high standards for admissions initially depressed the number of applicants. In 1878, Queen Victoria granted the college permission to use the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;; the college became the Royal Military College of Canada. It was the first military college to be established in a colonial dependency.

The college offered, like West Point but unlike the British service academies, a four-year course, heavily geared towards science and engineering. Uniquely among its peers, there was no expectation that its graduates would automatically become career army officers. As Canada had very limited permanent armed forces at the time, most of the cadets had to seek careers in the private sector, and many families sent their sons to the college to prepare them for civilian careers. Some received commissioned in the Permanent Force or in the British Army, which agreed to offer the college&#x27;s graduates four commissions every year. Many graduates who did not accept permanent military commissions continued to serve in the part-time Militia.

As a House of Commons report from 1881 put it:The Government of the Dominion have also established, at Kingston, an institution where young men may receive a training to fit them for the military profession—an institution something on the model of West Point—the practical benefits of which, however, are not as yet appreciable in a country like this, which has no regular army, and cannot afford employment suitable for the peculiar studies necessarily followed in the Academy.&quot;Another issue was the lack of French-speaking cadets: in the college&#x27;s first 23 years of existence, there were 20 French Canadians cadets out of 500. In the next 14 years, there were 19 out of 500. The entrance examinations were in English, which impeded recruitment.

The college experienced a period of decline in the early 1890s, until Gerald Kitson&#x27;s successful term as superintendent, during which he purged ineffective staff members and reduced the length of the course to three years. His successors maintained the dual civil-military model, but put greater emphasis on the military aspect of the college&#x27;s education. After 1910, all cadets were required to attend one militia camp to graduate, and to take up either a permanent or militia commission.

=== World wars ===
During the First World War, the RMC continued to operate, although the course was shortened to two years and more military instruction was added. 982 ex-cadets served in the war: they represented 86% of those who had attended the college before November 1919 who were healthy and under the age of 55. Despite being a minority of Canadian Expeditionary Force officers, RMC graduates occupied a large share of senior and staff appointments.

After the war, the RMC returned to its pre-war footing, and the course was restored to four years. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, a military-run and -styled relief camp on Barriefield lower common was set up under the command of the RMC Commandant. Extensive public works projects at the college relied on the labour of single unemployed men, the &#x27;Royal Twenty Centres&#x27; supplied by the Unemployment Relief Commission. From 1937, academic specialization was progressively introduced in the cadet course.

In 1942, the last cadet class at RMC for the duration of hostilities graduated, a final parade was held and the college colours were laid up in St. George&#x27;s Cathedral. For the remainder of the war the college served as a wartime training facility, offering courses such as the Company Commanders Course, Military Intelligence Course, and the War Staff Course. Once again, most eligible cadets fought in the war, and they were disproportionately represented in the Canadian Army&#x27;s senior ranks, including all four wartime Chiefs of the General Staff.

=== 1945 to the present day ===
There were doubts as to whether the RMC would reopen after the war, and alumni mobilized to save it. In 1946, the Chesley committee, headed by Brigadier Leonard McEwan Chelsey (RMC 1917), made recommendations about the provision of officers for the active force, about the educational requirements of candidates, and about the way they should be trained. It recommended the elimination of the RMC as a cadet-training college, in favour of university-based training, followed by a period of military training at RMC. A second committee, chaired by Brigadier Sherwood Lett, recommended re-opening the RMC as a cadet college, alongside an university intake route.

Ultimately, the college was re-opened as a tri-service institution in 1948, with the &quot;New One Hundred&quot; cadets reporting on 20 September 1948. In 1959, it became the first military college in the British Commonwealth to achieve degree-granting status.&quot; The Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh visit RMC on 12 October 1951.

In 1959, the province of Ontario granted a university charter to RMC by passing &quot;The Royal Military College of Canada Degrees Act, 1959&quot; enabling RMC to offer degrees in arts, science, and engineering at the undergraduate and graduate levels. &quot;The Royal Military College of Canada Degrees Act, 1959&quot; was passed by the Ontario legislature and given Royal Assent on 26 March 1959. That year, the Canadian historian, Desmond Morton O.C., was the first graduate of the Royal Military College of Canada to receive a degree from the military college. Previously, cadets transferred for their final year to a civilian university, where they earned a degree.

His Excellency the Governor General presented the RMC colours in June 1961 and took the salute on the marchpast. On 26 May 1967, over 500 cadets trooped the colours on Parliament Hill in honour of the centennial of the Confederation of Canada, with the troops being reviewed by the Governor General.

In 1969, RMC became bilingual. In 1979, military colleges open their doors to women with the admission of UTPNCM female officer cadets and post graduate students.

In 1976, RMC celebrated the centennial of its opening. The Cadet Wing parades on Parliament Hill on 1 July in honour of that milestone. 

In September 1980, the first 32 female cadets are accepted into first year at RMC.

==Organization==

The RMC mission is to educate, train and develop Officer Cadets for leadership careers of effective service in the Canadian Armed Forces – the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army.

For most students under the ROTP (Regular Officer Training Plan), education is free and a monthly salary is paid which meets incidentals. The courses are offered both on site and by distance learning in both official languages: English and French. After graduation, Officers are to serve two months of obligatory service for each subsidized month of education.

RMC offers 19 undergraduate programs in Social Sciences and Humanities, Science and Engineering.
RMC offers 34 graduate studies opportunities, including 14 doctorates. In addition to the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Engineering, and Science, the Division of Continuing Studies offers undergraduate and graduate level programs including the &quot;Officer Professional Military Education&quot; program (OPME). The Department of Applied Military Science (AMS) offers a graduate level program – the Land Force Technical Staff Program (LFTSP) and an undergraduate/community college level program – the Army Technical Warrant Officer&#x27;s Program.

All undergraduate students are required to complete the core curriculum, which is designed to provide a balanced liberal arts, science, and military education. The Core Curriculum consists of Economics, Psychology, Mathematics, English, Calculus, Military history of Canada, Chemistry, Canadian History, Physics and Civics.

=== Centres and institutes ===
The research at RMC focusses on areas of direct and indirect benefit to the Department of National Defence; More than 90 percent of the research at RMC is defence-related. RMC conducts both academic and contracted research on electrical and computer engineering, physics, chemistry, chemical engineering and environmental engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, international security, governance and the economics of defence; some research involves the Institute for the Environment as well as nuclear research. Both members of the Canadian Forces and civilian students are eligible for admission to the master&#x27;s and doctoral programs; Funding has been put in place to support both military and civilian students.

=== Law ===
The Military Law Centre on the grounds of RMC, staffed with 12 military lawyers, oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters ranging from the Forces&#x27; own code of conduct to the laws of war. It trains military lawyers and advises Ottawa on matters of policy and doctrine. The centre integrates legal education into the regular training that Forces members undergo and establishes its growing importance within the military hierarchy.
Selected RMC Canada cadets participate in Law of Armed Conflict international Competitions each fall with cadets from USAFA, USMA, USNA, and USCGA. Each year, RMC cadets are selected to participate in a competition on the Law of Armed Conflict at the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in Sanremo, Italy.

=== Research and partnerships ===
In the Engineering and Science divisions, RMC pursues the following principal areas of research:
*information technology, communications, microelectronics,
*environment,
*energy and energy development,
*Advanced materials engineering,
*geotechnical engineering, and
*fluid mechanics and engineering.

In the Social Sciences and Humanities divisions, RMC pursues research and activities in:
*military history,
*political science and international security,
*peacekeeping and peacemaking,
*comparative government, international relations and ethical code of conduct in conflict,
*leadership, and
*economics.
*The RMC Centre for Security, Armed Forces and Society (CSAS-CESFAS) provides a focus for research conducted within the Faculty of Arts and facilitates communication between the Department of National Defence, other research institutions, scholars and Canadian civil society.

In the Department of Applied Military Science (AMS), RMC pursues:
*the Land Force Technical Staff Programme (captains &amp; majors);
*the Technical Warrant Officer Programme (warrant officers &amp; master warrant officers).

The Diploma in Military Arts and Sciences (DMASc) provides non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Forces an online program made possible by a partnership between OntarioLearn, the RMC, and the Canadian Defence Academy. Under RMC and community college articulation agreements, all graduates of this diploma program who apply to the RMC will be admitted into the Bachelor of Military Arts and Sciences degree program with advanced standing.

== Admissions ==

=== Training plans ===
There are several full-time admission options for an education at RMCC.

==== Regular Officer Training Plan ====
The Regular Officer Training Plan (ROTP) is a conditional scholarship offered to selected applicants. In addition to a university education, officer cadets receive military training, occupation training and second language training and a career after graduation. The full-time salary includes full dental care, as well as vacation with full pay. Upon successful completion of ROTP, officer cadets are awarded a university degree and granted commissions as officers in the Canadian Forces. Normally, graduates serve at least five years with the Canadian Forces. The application deadline to ROTP is in January for Basic Officer Training in July and admission the following September.

Typically, successful applicants enter the Canadian Military College (CMC) System as an officer cadet, where they receive an education that balances academics, leadership, bilingualism and athletics. If the choice of program is not offered, such as Nursing, Physiotherapy and Pharmacy, or the candidate wishes to attend another university, successful applicants are eligible to apply to any Canadian university where books, lab fees and student fees are covered, and students receive a monthly salary under the Civilian University ROTP.

==== Reserve Entry Training Plan ====
The Reserve Entry Training Plan, discontinued in 2017, was an education that was the same as the ROTP but was paid for by the student (not a scholarship). The students also did not draw a salary; however, they were not obligated to five years of service after completion. Reserve Entry cadets were, however, paid considerably more than the regular ROTP officer cadet salary during their summer training months. They were also entitled to this pay if they attend &quot;duty/varsity&quot; away trips (For example, an away game of women&#x27;s soccer).

==== Others ====
*UTPNCM: University Training Plan – Non Commissioned Members for non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces to earn a degree and then serve as officers.
*IBDP: Initial Baccalaureate Degree Program, a baccalaureate program.
*DCS: Division of Continuing Studies, also available part-time

==== Selection process ====
Since an application to ROTP is also an application to the Canadian Military College System, all candidates are assessed against an aptitude test, a medical examination, and an interview.

Military potential is an assessment of aptitudes, personality traits, and the choice of occupation. Academic performance is rated based on a student&#x27;s transcript. Unlike many universities, since a complete transcript is submitted to the selection board, grade 9-11 marks are heavily weighted in a student&#x27;s application with consideration given to grade 12 (or the final year&#x27;s) marks. Officer cadets are obliged to maintain satisfactory academic and military performance throughout the programme.

==== Continuing studies ====
RMC started a graduate studies program in 1965. The Division of Continuing Studies was established in 1997.

The mandate of the RMC Division of Continuing Studies is to make university education available to all members of the Canadian Forces, spouses and DND civilian employees. Canadian Forces and other professional training is recognized for credit towards undergraduate or advanced degrees.

Unique degree programs, specially tailored for CF members, include:
*Bachelor of Military Arts &amp; Sciences,
*Master of Business Administration,
*Master of Defence Management and Policy, and
*Master of Arts and PhD in War Studies.

==== Tuition ====
Tuition fees (2022–23) at the undergraduate level vary from $3,020 – $4,140 per term for Canadian undergraduate students and $2,670 – $2,980 per term for Canadian Graduate students. The tuition fees for international students vary from $7,410 – $7,690 per term for graduate students. The lower tuition amounts are for the arts and sciences programs, while the higher amounts are for the engineering programs.

Because of commitments of military service following graduation, education is free for most on-campus undergraduates; these Officer Cadets also receive an additional monthly salary. Funding has been put in place to support civilian students, who are eligible for admission to the master&#x27;s and doctoral programs to work alongside graduate students who are members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

== Cadet life ==

=== Uniforms ===
Cadets wear a variety of uniforms depending on the occasion and their environment: ceremonial dress (semi ceremonial); full dress (formal occasions); outside sports dress; service dress Air Force; service dress Navy; service dress Navy without jacket; Service dress Air Force without jacket; service dress Army without jacket; and combat dress. In winter 2009, Royal Military College officer cadets returned to wearing a distinctive Dress of the Day (DOD) uniform which consists of a white shirt, black sweater/light jacket, as well as black trousers/skirt with a red stripe down the side. The headdress is a black wedge with red piping. Mess dress is worn in the Senior Staff Mess for formal occasions such as mess dinners.

=== Student life ===

*The RMC Cadet Mess in Yeo Hall has facilities for social and recreational activities. Staff and faculty have access to the Senior Staff Mess.
*The Baronial Hall or Currie Hall, which was designed in 1922 by Percy Erskine Nobbs to honour the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I play a prominent role in the life of the university. During special events, invited speakers and dignitaries may address the university population or the general public from the Great Hall. Many conferences held in Kingston, Ontario may book the halls for lectures or presentations.
*The CANEX is a small retail store in Yeo Hall for personal articles, souvenirs, snacks and dry cleaning.

*Bill &amp; Alphie&#x27;s, the on-campus cadet mess in Yeo Hall, is named after Bruce Bairnsfather&#x27;s Great War cartoon characters. Old Bill &amp; little Alphie, stone carvings based on two World War I cartoon characters by Bruce Bairnsfather, appear at the entrance to RMC&#x27;s Yeo Hall.
*The campus is on the shore of Lake Ontario and has easy access to two lake-front parks, favourite locations for students to relax. The campus is also located approximately 10 minutes&#x27; walk from the city&#x27;s downtown.
*Cadets are obligated to perform community service. Every year there is a mandatory class project. The first year class project has cadets conduct an event for the &quot;underprivileged&quot; youth of the city. The second year class project has cadets conduct a food drive for the city&#x27;s food bank. The third year class project has cadets perform upkeep on the city&#x27;s many parks. The fourth year class project has the class project leader raise money for a charity through the conduct of a fundraiser which usually takes the form of a baseball tournament.
*The student clubs and organizations associated with the RMC include: Arts, Astronomy, Broomball, Cheerleading, Chess, Climbing, Cycling, Debating, drama, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, Expedition, Fish &amp; Game, Flying, golf, Judo, Juggling, Taekwondo, Outdoors, Paintball, Photo, rowing, Social Dance, Stage Band, Triathlon/Running, Video Editing, War Games, Water Polo, Windsurfing, Women&#x27;s Rugby and Yachting. In recent years, an Automotive Club has been added.

=== Squadrons of the Cadet Wing ===

The undergraduate student body, known as the Cadet &quot;Wing&quot;, is sub-divided into 13 (12 ROTP and 1 UTPNCM) &quot;squadrons&quot; of approximately 80 cadets each. Each squadron is subdivided into three &quot;flights&quot;, with each flight further subdivided into three &quot;sections&quot;. The squadrons are led by senior cadets under the guidance of the squadron commander.


In 2007, a former squadron of the Royal Military College Saint-Jean, Jolliet Squadron, was stood up at RMC as 13 Squadron. The squadron was named in honour of Louis Jolliet, with its first-year flight, Good Flight, named after Herman James Good, a Victoria Cross recipient from the 13th Battalion, CEF.

=== Royal Military College of Canada Bands ===
The &quot;Massed Band&quot;, consisting of the Brass and Reed, Pipes and Drums, and Highland Dancers, perform at parades, public relation trips and recruit shows. The &quot;Brass and Reed Band&quot; is a multi-purpose section, used primarily as a parade march and concert band. The &quot;Pipe Section&quot; and the &quot;Drum Section&quot; perform at mess dinners; parades; sporting events; ceremonies (official or squadron); weddings; funerals; public relations; wing events; Christmas Ball (RMC) &amp; Graduation Balls; private events; and holidays. The &quot;Highland Dance&quot; Section perform at many of the same functions with the exception of parades and funerals. The &quot;Choir&quot; performs the Canadian national anthem; sings at mess dinners; and accompanies the Stage Band on selected pieces including: folk, jazz, traditional music, French music, show tunes, African music and Christmas songs. The &quot;Stage Band&quot; is versatile, performing dinner music followed by marches at college mess dinners. The &quot;Cheer Band&quot;, a subsidiary of the Brass and Reed, performs music for RMC sporting events, such as the Carr-Harris Cup and the Westpoint Weekend.

=== Athletics ===


One of the four components of the Royal Military College of Canada, the Athletic component provides opportunities for officer cadets to participate in physical activities and sports that are mentally demanding to develop their physical capabilities, confidence and leadership. Physical education is meant &quot;to establish a strong foundation of skills and knowledge in physical fitness, sports, and military-related activities through a progressive and diverse physical education program for RMC Officer Cadets&quot; The Vision is &quot;foster a passion for active living and leadership in physical activity.&quot; To enhance their physical fitness and develop military and athletic skills necessary to lead their troops, Cadets must take physical education classes and play intramural sports every year – for a minimum of four hours per week.

==Military training==
As an RMC cadet, military training begins with Basic Military Officer Qualification (BMOQ) in the summer prior to first year and prior to second year at the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School Saint-Jean. After the completion of BMOQ, those cadets who are not yet bilingual are usually enrolled in a seven-week period of Second Language Training (SLT) at Canadian Forces Language School Detachment Saint-Jean, or may remain in Kingston to study a second official language. The remaining summers are spent doing various other training depending on the specific elements or occupations of each cadet.

=== First Year Orientation Period ===
First Year Orientation Period, (FYOP) is the most demanding challenge many cadets will face during their time at the college. FYOP takes place during the first month of the academic year following the completion of the first mod of BMOQ. Prior to the 2015–16 academic year, cadets would attend 2 week program called recruit camp in which cadets would undergo some basic military training before entering the college. With newly hired cadets completing half of their BMOQ before attending RMC, recruit camp is no longer necessary. FYOP is like Frosh week at civilian universities, except it lasts four weeks and cadets are placed under extreme stress for nearly the entire duration. FYOP begins with the Arch parade where the entire First Year class is marched onto College grounds by their FYOP staff consisting of Third and Fourth Years.

During the course of FYOP, First Year cadets are required to keep an exceptionally high standard of dress and deportment. They are required to march at all times. Physical Training is conducted, with long runs up neighbouring Fort Henry, Ontario hill a frequent occurrence. Inspections of room standards and dress are conducted daily. For the duration of FYOP, First Years are not permitted to leave RMC or receive visitors. Mail and phone calls are allowed but are limited.

The culmination of the FYOP is the obstacle course. The obstacle course lasts over 2 hours and consists of twelve obstacles built by each squadron located around the college grounds. Obstacles such as a 12-foot wall and rope bridge are designed to test teamwork and physical fitness of First Years. The First Year flights are judged on the time it takes to complete each obstacle. The completion of the obstacle course signals the end of FYOP. Afterwards, First Years are given a parade where they are officially welcomed into RMC and join the Cadet Wing. Cadets are then allowed to see their friends and relatives, and are allowed the freedom to leave college grounds. In previous years, cadets were required to wear their College uniform when leaving the college grounds, but as of 2017 this rule has been modified; cadets can now wear civilian business casual clothes. When attending formal events, the college uniform worn is the number 4s. This form of dress consists of dark blue pants with a red stripe down the side and a dark blue tunic. Badges can be put on both arms once earned. The year is also represented on the lower arms by red ribbon; however, second year is the first to have any red ribbon.

Second year cadets, in RMC&#x27;s academic mentorship program, are paired with first year cadets as &quot;academic parents&quot; to mentor, guide, and influence them during their study at the college. This program, however, relies entirely on the second year cadet&#x27;s following through on their due diligence to mentor their &quot;academic children&quot;, as there is almost no staff (commissioned officer / non-commissioned member) oversight over the ongoings of either the FYOP or academic mentorship program, outside of general rule-making.

Many of the aspects of the FYOP, including the obstacle course and mentorship program, were developed by the post-war Chesley committee, led by Brigadier Leonard McEwan Chelsey, O.B.E., E.D. The committee made recommendations about the education and training of officer candidates for the postwar active force. In addition, the committee made recommendations about the provision of French-speaking officers and arrangements for promotion from the ranks.

==Campus and facilities==

RMC is located on Point Frederick (Kingston, Ontario), a small peninsula at the point where the St. Lawrence River leaves Lake Ontario and where the Rideau Canal system starts. The location has been an active military base since 1789 and the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard, located on the site, was an important dockyard during the War of 1812.

Point Frederick includes two sites with National Historic Site of Canada designations: the Royal Navy Dockyard and the Point Frederick Buildings

The Stone Frigate, a large stone building completed in 1820 by Sir Robert Barrie, was designed to hold gear and rigging from British warships dismantled in compliance with the Rush–Bagot Treaty. It served as a barracks briefly in 1837–38, and was refitted as a dormitory and classrooms to house RMC by 1876.

During the Great Depression in Canada of the 1930s, an unemployment relief camp on Barriefield lower common was set up under the command of the RMC Commandant. Public works projects relied on the labour of the &#x27;Royal Twenty Centres&#x27; supplied by the under the Unemployment Relief Commission. The public works projects included rebuilding the dry stone wall and moat of Fort Frederick; the physics building extension, the connection from the Fort Frederick dormitory to the new Yeo mess building, the new wing of the hospital, a new garage, road work, levelling the grounds at RMC for new football fields and a new running track. The cornerstone of Yeo Hall was laid in 1934 by the Earl of Bessborough, HE The Gov Gen. Yeo Hall was opened in 1936.

The Officers&#x27; Mess was moved in 1960 to the Senior Staff Mess at which point &#x27;Bill &amp; Alfie&#x27;s&#x27; became a recreational space for Senior Cadets. There were renovations to Fort LaSalle dormitory and Yeo Hall between 1993–1995 to accommodate the closure of the other two colleges. In 1997, there were additions to the Dining Room, and an extension for the kitchen and servery above which is the Cadet Mess at Yeo Hall.

Both Royal Military College of Canada chapels serving Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim communities are located in Yeo Hall.

=== Buildings ===
The property includes elements of several National Historic Sites of Canada Point Frederick Buildings NHSC, Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard NHSC, the Fort Frederick (Kingston, Ontario) component of Kingston Fortifications NHSC; Rideau Canal; and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings lists five Classified Federal Heritage Buildings and twenty-three Recognized Federal Heritage Buildings on the Royal Military College of Canada grounds:

The Chief Dominion Architect(s) designed a number of public buildings at the college: Thomas Seaton Scott (1872–1881); Thomas Fuller (architect) (1881–1896); David Ewart (1896–1914); Edgar Lewis Horwood (1914–1917); Richard Cotsman Wright (1918–1927); Thomas W. Fuller (1927–1936), Charles D. Sutherland (1936–1947) and Joseph Charles Gustave Brault (1947–1952). Thomas Seaton Scott and Thomas Fuller adopted the Neo-Gothic style. David Ewart embraced the Baronial style. Richard Cotsman Wright (1918–1927) adopted the Collegiate Gothic style.









===Other campus buildings===
=== Libraries ===
The Royal Military College of Canada Libraries is a member of the Ontario Council of University Libraries and is a contributor to Open Content Alliance.

The Massey Library collection consists of approximately 250,000 books, 1,800 audio-visual items and 1,200 periodicals in English and French. The library possesses RMC historical material including cadet photographs, scrapbooks, collections, diaries, and letters. The major collections follow:

=== Dormitories ===
RMC has six dormitories, which are similar to most universities and provide the basic necessities. Organized by squadron, dormitories are co-educational with separate washrooms for men and women. Officer Cadets share a room in first year, and sometimes in succeeding years depending on availability of space, if possible with someone who is proficient in the other official language.

The oldest, the Stone Frigate was built in 1819–20 and is a Canadian Heritage Site. The Stone Frigate, known within the college as &quot;The Boat&quot; houses 1 Squadron who in turn call themselves the Stone Frigate Military Academy. The next building built Fort Lasalle holds 7, 8, and 9 squadron while the third building, Fort Haldimand hosts 11 and 12 Squadron. Fort Champlain (1965) accommodates the Cadet Wing Headquarters and 2 and 3 Squadron. Fort Sauve (2001) houses 4, 5, and 6 Squadron and the newest dormitory, Fort Brant (2011) aka &quot;The Greenhouse&quot; houses ALOY and 10 squadron. Fort Brant was called such due to the overheating problems experienced by the massive glass façade which by facing south traps a large amount of solar heat which is then circulated throughout the building.

==Honorary degrees==
The nominations for honorary degrees by the Royal Military Colleges can be initiated by different organizations or individuals, including the Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada through any member of the college senate. As with most of Canadian universities, the senate, which in the case of RMC is composed of the Chancellor (Minister of National Defence), the Vice Chancellor (The RMCC Commandant), Principal, Deans, DCadet, Registrar and the Directeur des Etudes du Royal Military College Saint-Jean, makes the final decision. The Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada (RMCCC) has no responsibility or authority in the process of granting honorary degrees.

==Alumni==
The RMC alumni association (RMC Club) was inaugurated in 1885. The RMC Club was incorporated under the Statutes of Ontario in 1898.

The Royal Military Colleges of Canada Foundation is a registered Canadian charity which was incorporated in 1966. As an element of the Canadian Forces, the college is unable to fund a conventional full-time fundraising team in a development office. The foundation, consequently, works at arm&#x27;s length to assist the college financially. Capital campaigns have included the 2364 Leonard Birchall Pavilion (2007), the Memorial Arch Restoration (2001) and the New Library Campaign (2013).

==Artist-in-Residence==
The Royal Military College of Canada launched its Artist-in-Residence program in January 2010 with Steven Heighton, a novelist and poet as the first to hold the post. The third person to hold the position, playwright Dr. Julie Salverson, presented &quot;Drama, Imagination, and RMC&quot; on 3 April 2012 in Currie Hall. Dr. Salverson, who has conducted drama workshops with cadets since the early 1990s, helped facilitate a play about RMC, &quot;Shakespeare in Scarlets&quot; in 2012. In 2014, the Artist-in-Residence was Gord Sinclair of The Tragically Hip, who put together a concert on the parade square where cadets, staff, and faculty performed for their peers at an event dubbed Bruciepalooza. Both The Trews and guitarist Rob Baker of The Tragically Hip made unexpected guest appearances to perform for the college. Kingston photographer Chris Miner held the position throughout the 2014–15 academic year, culminating in a gallery exhibition of his work along with winning photographs by students, staff, and faculty submitted as part of the Photo Op 2015 photography contest. In the winter term of the 2015–2016 academic year, Canadian novelist and poet Helen Humphreys was the Artist-in-Residence, and held weekly workshops on novel writing and poetry.

==Media==
*RMC cadets once produced the campus newspaper, the Precision, however this does not exist anymore. The alumni association produces Veritas and e-Veritas.
*Currently, a campus newspaper called &quot;The Slasher Standard&quot; circulates around RMC producing satirical material.

==Symbols, memorials and traditions==

 e.g. Triumphal arch; Trophies, Commemorative and Memorial Trees, Monuments, Plaques, and Others. This includes a list of RMC Traditions and RMC Militaria &amp; Collectibles
In honour of Remembrance Day, 2012 students in Dr Erika Behrisch Elce&#x27;s first-year English for science and engineering students wrote a sonnet on behalf of one of those connected with Royal Military College of Canada who died doing his or her duty. A printed collection will also soon be available through the College Library for general distribution.

The RMC&#x27;s official cheer is the following:

: Call: &quot;Gimme a beer!&quot;
: Response: &quot;Beer! Esses! Emma! T-D-V!Who can stop old RMC!Shrapnel, Cordite, NCT!R-M-C Hooah!&quot;

=== Heraldry ===

King George V granted and assigned the Armorial Ensigns for the Royal Military College of Canada in 1920. The description is:&quot;Per pale Azure and Gules on the Dexter side a Scaling Ladder Argent ensigned by a Mural Crown Or and on the Sinister side two Swords in saltire of the third points upward, on a Chief of the fourth three grenades of the first fired proper, an Inescutcheon charged with the Union Badge and for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours An Arm in armour embowed gauntletted and holding a Sprig of three Maple Leaves and ensigned by the Imperial Crown all proper, as the same are in the painting hereunto annexed more plainly depicted to be borne by our said Royal Military College of Canada on Seals, Shields, Banners, Flags or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms.&quot;

=== Motto ===
The first college Commandant, Lieut. Colonel Hewett, made the first public announcement of the college motto and ‘device’ (badge) during a prize presentation held at the Kingston Military College on 11 February 1878. &quot;I now have to tell you Gentlemen Cadets, that a device and motto has been selected for the Military College. The device, a mailed arm bearing a maple leaf; symbolical of the position you, as the future officers of Canada, should hold towards your country as represented by the maple leaf. The motto, &quot;Truth, Duty, and Valour,&quot;- three simple words in plain English -that all who run may read.&quot;

These words by Professor Robert Carr Harris, RMC&#x27;s first Professor of Engineering, were recalled when his son No. 1118 Major G. G. M. Carr-Harris unveiled a plaque in the entrance to the Currie Building in 1964 to the memory of his father &quot;Engineering, leads a man among actions, thoughts, and associations which are useful and honourable, and a life so spent will leave its mark upon anyone&#x27;s character.&quot; The Harris memorial plaque is alongside one commemorating the first Commandant Major Edward Osborne Hewett who chose the college motto, &quot;Truth, Duty, Valour&quot;. The Hewett plaque is alongside one commemorating the first Staff Adjutant Major Raymond N.R. Reade, a British officer sent to the RMC from London in 1901, who authorized construction of a gymnasium, a hospital, an electrical plant, and a permanent accommodation for the staff-adjutant and his family.

=== Music ===
The RMC march, &quot;Precision&quot; was composed by Madame Denise Chabot, the wife of an RMC staff member, Major C.A. Chabot. She was inspired by the sound of the cadets marching past married quarters. The march starts, &quot;We are the gentlemen cadets of RMC. We have sworn to love and serve Her Majesty…&quot;

The College March for bagpipe is Alexander Mackenzie

==In fiction and popular culture==
The Royal Military College&#x27;s central place in Canadian military circles has made it the setting for novels, plays, films and other cultural works:

After serving in South Africa and entering the family lumber business Graham Trent travels with his sister Mary from Minnebiac, a fictional small town in Ontario to England. There, Graham Trent becomes engaged to Barbara Pavisay, a member of a proud old English family whose line extends back to the Tudors. When Barbara Pavisay breaks off the engagement to Graham, his sister Mary becomes engaged to Barbara&#x27;s brother Lord Pavisay. It is assumed that Graham Trent will return to Canada, continue in the family business and be elected to Parliament.

*Dr. David Clark&#x27;s Canadian Army Trilogy–&quot;The Ridge&quot; (1994), &quot;Lamone&quot; (2001), and &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Gate&quot; (2002)–outlines the stories of two generations of the Warwick family and the Canadian Army in World War I. In &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Captain James Niles, a Royal Military College graduate, is posted temporarily to a recruit training battalion. He is a professional officer, all spit and polish, everything by the King&#x27;s Regulations. After ordering a crowd to disperse, Niles accepts thanks from German proprietors of a tailor shop, Hans and Analise Holzhauer, and falls for their daughter, Rosamund. The lovely Rosamund is unfortunately an unsuitable match since they are worlds apart in social position. Niles, who is practically engaged to the Colonel&#x27;s daughter, Roselyn, comes to realize, while serving under General Arthur Currie in France, that Roselyn never has a serious thought, caring only about tennis and garden parties.

<text>Speculative and science fiction writers have often addressed the social, political, technological, and biological consequences of pregnancy and reproduction through the exploration of possible futures or alternative realities.

==Themes==

As real-world reproductive technology has advanced, SF works have become increasingly interested in representing alternative modes of reproduction. Among the uses of pregnancy and reproduction themes regularly encountered in science fiction are:

* other modes of sexual reproduction;
* parthenogenetic reproduction;
* the use of technology in reproduction;

The phenomenon of pregnancy itself has been the subject of numerous works, both directly and metaphorically. These works may relate pregnancy to parasitism or slavery, or simply use pregnancy as a strong contrast with horror. For example, in the film, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968) (based on the 1967 novel by Ira Levin) a woman is tricked into a satanic pregnancy by her husband.

===Alien–human hybrids===

Inter-species reproduction and alien-human hybrids frequently occur in science fiction, and women being impregnated by aliens is a common theme in SF horror films, including &quot;I Married a Monster from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;, &quot;Inseminoid&quot;, and &quot;Xtro&quot;. The theme has even been parodied, such as in the soft porn &quot;Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman&quot;. 

In the film &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), Ellen Ripley has been cloned to facilitate study of the alien queen embryo with which she was implanted In Octavia E. Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lilith&#x27;s Brood&quot; trilogy (1987, 1988, 1989) alien and human females impregnated with the DNA of males by alien intermediary-sex individuals, in &quot;fivesomes&quot;.

==Reproduction and technology==
Speculative fiction in technology of reproduction may involve cloning and ectogenesis, i.e., artificial reproduction).

The latter part of the 2000s decade has also seen an upswing of films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology in contemporary reality rather than being speculation.
==Large-scale infertility or population growth==
Fertility and reproduction have been frequent sites for examination of concerns about the impact of the environment and reproduction on the future of humanity or civilization. For example, &quot;The Children of Men&quot; by P. D. James is just one of many works which have considered the implications of global infertility; &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; by Harry Harrison is one of many works which have examined the converse, the implications of massive human population surges. Numerous other works, such as &quot;Implosion&quot;, &quot;The First Century after Beatrice&quot;, &quot;Venus Plus X&quot; and &quot;More Than Human&quot; by Theodore Sturgeon examine the future of humanity as it evolves, or particular breeding programs.

==Politics and gender politics==
Pregnancy and control of human reproduction have often been used as proxies for treating gender issues or broader themes of social control; works dealing with pregnancy and human reproduction have also been used to closely explore gender politics. For instance, &quot;male pregnancy&quot; has been used to comedic effect in mainstream literature and films such as &quot;Junior&quot; (1994 film, dir. Ivan Reitman), and has developed a following in fan fiction—the mpreg genre.

The genre of feminist science fiction has explored single-sex reproduction in depth, particularly parthenogenesis, as well as gendered control over the ability and right to reproduce. See also numerous dystopian stories about state-controlled reproduction, abortion, and birth control, such as Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, or her short story, &quot;Freeforall&quot;. These works have often been analyzed as explorations of contemporary political debates about reproduction and pregnancy.

<text>Daryl J. Bem (born June 10, 1938) is a social psychologist and professor emeritus at Cornell University. He is the originator of the self-perception theory of attitude formation and change. He has also researched psi phenomena, group decision making, handwriting analysis, sexual orientation, and personality theory and assessment.

== Early life and education ==

Bem received a BA in physics from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1960 and began graduate work in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The civil rights movement had just begun, and he became so intrigued with the changing attitudes toward desegregation in the American South that he decided to switch fields and pursue a career as a social psychologist specializing in attitudes and public opinion. He obtained his PhD in social psychology from the University of Michigan in 1964.

== Career ==

Bem taught at Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford, Harvard, and Cornell University. He started at Cornell in 1978 and retired in 2007, becoming a professor emeritus.

Bem testified before a subcommittee of the United States Senate on the psychological effects of police interrogation and served as an expert witness in court cases involving sex discrimination.

=== Self-perception theory ===
In 1972, Bem proposed the self-perception theory of attitude change, which proposes a different mechanism of change than that of Leon Festinger&#x27;s cognitive dissonance theory. The two theories appear contradictory. Dissonance theory explains how people change their attitudes when they find themselves acting in opposition to the attitudes they already hold, while self-perception theory explains how people create their attitudes in the first place.

According to self-perception theory, people infer their attitudes from their own behavior much as an outside observer might. For example, just as a person might watch someone else giving a pro-Fidel Castro speech and infer that the person is in favor of Castro, a person who is asked to give such a speech would consequently come to view themself as more in favor of Castro.

In 1970, Bem and Keith McConnell demonstrated that people are often unaware of attitude changes caused by their behavior. Instead, people believe that the views they currently hold are the views that they have always held. Bem and McConnell demonstrated this by measuring the change in Carnegie Mellon students&#x27; attitudes toward having control of their university curriculum. After an initial measurement of student attitudes, which were favorable toward student control, Bem and McConnel assigned students to write an essay opposing student control. By writing an essay proclaiming views different from the ones they held, students&#x27; views changed to become less favorable toward student control. When Bem and McConnell asked the students how they had felt at the beginning of the study, students insisted that they had always felt less favorable toward student control. The students believed that the experiment had not changed their opinions, even though it had changed their opinions significantly.

=== Exotic becomes erotic theory ===
Bem&#x27;s exotic becomes erotic theory (EBE) presents one possible explanation as to what differentiates the etiology of homosexuality from heterosexuality. Bem theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood, that the child&#x27;s temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Bem noted that because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender, while others will prefer activities that are typical of the other gender. Bem theorized that this makes a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. He believes that this feeling of difference evokes physiological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which the child considers as being &quot;different&quot;. Bem theorizes that this physiological arousal is later transformed into sexual arousal: that is, as adults, people become sexually attracted to the gender which they came to see as different, or &quot;exotic&quot;, while they were children.

Bem based this theory in part on the finding that a majority of gay men and lesbians report being gender-nonconforming during their childhood years. A meta-analysis of 48 studies showed childhood gender nonconformity to be the strongest predictor of a homosexual orientation for both men and women. Bem also noted that in a study by the Kinsey Institute of approximately 1000 gay men and lesbians (and a control group of 500 heterosexual men and women), 63% of both gay men and lesbians reported that they did not like activities typical of their sex in childhood, compared with only 10–15% of heterosexual men and women. Bem also drew from six prospective studies, longitudinal studies that began with gender-nonconforming boys around age 7 and followed them into adolescence and adulthood; a majority (63%) of the gender nonconforming boys become gay or bisexual as adults.

Two criticisms of Bem&#x27;s theory in the journal &quot;Psychological Review&quot; concluded that &quot;studies cited by Bem and additional research show that Exotic Becomes Erotic theory is not supported by scientific evidence.&quot; Bem was criticized for relying on a non-random sample of gay men from the 1970s (rather than collecting new data) and for drawing conclusions that appear to contradict the original data. An &quot;examination of the original data showed virtually all respondents were familiar with children of both sexes&quot;, and that only 9% of gay men said that &quot;none or only a few&quot; of their friends were male, and most gay men (74%) reported having &quot;an especially close friend of the same sex&quot; during grade school. Further, &quot;71% of gay men reported feeling different from other boys, but so did 38% of heterosexual men. The difference for gay men is larger, but still indicates that feeling different from same-sex peers was common for heterosexual men.&quot; Bem also acknowledged that gay men were more likely to have older brothers (the fraternal birth order effect), which appeared to contradict an unfamiliarity with males. Bem cited cross-cultural studies which also &quot;appear to contradict the EBE theory assertion&quot;, such as the Sambia tribe in Papua New Guinea, which ritually enforced homosexual acts among teenagers, yet once these boys reached adulthood, only a small proportion of men continued to engage in homosexual behaviour - similar to levels observed in the United States. Additionally, Bem&#x27;s model could be interpreted as implying that if one could change a child&#x27;s behavior, one could change their sexual orientation, but most psychologists doubt this would be possible.

Neuroscientist Simon LeVay has said that while the theory was arranged in a &quot;believable temporal order&quot;, that it ultimately &quot;lacks empirical support&quot;. Social psychologist Justin LehMiller stated that &quot;Bem&#x27;s theory has received a lot of praise for the way it seamlessly links biological and environmental influences&quot; and that there &quot;is also some support for the model in the sense that childhood gender nonconformity is indeed one of the strongest predicators of adult homosexuality&quot;, but that the validity of the model &quot;has been questioned on numerous grounds and scientists have largely rejected it.&quot;

===Ganzfeld experiment===
In parapsychology, Bem is known for his defense of the ganzfeld experiment as evidence of psi, more commonly known as extrasensory perception or psychic phenomena.

Bem and Charles Honorton (1994) reviewed the experimental arrangements of the autoganzfeld experiments, and concluded they provided excellent security against deception by subjects and sensory cues. However, Ray Hyman disagreed with Bem and Honorton as he claims to have discovered some interesting patterns in the data that implied visual cues may have taken place in the experiments. Hyman wrote that the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage. Bem and Honorton&#x27;s review was criticized by the scientific community as it contained errors. Julie Milton and Richard Wiseman (1999) who discovered errors in Bem&#x27;s research carried out a meta-analysis of ganzfeld experiments in other laboratories. They found no psi effect, the results showed no effect greater than chance from a database of 30 experiments and a non-significant Stouffer Z of 0.70.

Psychologist Susan Blackmore also criticized Bem&#x27;s review of the Ganzfeld literature, noting that of the nine studies that were used for the review, five came from one laboratory (Chuck Honorton&#x27;s). Blackmore also noted that Bem included experiments from Carl Sargent in the review, and Blackmore had previously found that Sargent had &quot;deliberately violated his own protocols and in one trial had almost certainly cheated.&quot; According to Blackmore, psychologists reading Bem&#x27;s review in &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; would &quot;not have a clue that serious doubt had been cast on more than a quarter of the studies involved&quot;. Blackmore recounts having a discussion with Bem at a consciousness conference where she challenged him on his support of Sargent and Honorton&#x27;s research; he replied &quot;it did not matter&quot;. Writing for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; Blackmore states &quot;But it does matter. ... It matters because Bem&#x27;s continued claims mislead a willing public into believing that there is reputable scientific evidence for ESP in the Ganzfeld when there is not&quot;.

=== &quot;Feeling the Future&quot; controversy ===
In 2011, Bem published the article &quot;Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; that offered statistical evidence for psi. The article&#x27;s findings challenged modern scientific conceptions about the unidirectional nature of time. Its presentation by a respected researcher, and its publication by an upper-tier journal, engendered much controversy. In addition to criticism of the paper itself, the paper&#x27;s publication prompted a wider debate on the validity of peer review process for allowing such a paper to be published. Bem appeared on MSNBC and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to discuss the experiment. American author and researcher Mitch Horowitz has noted that Bem&#x27;s experiments in precognition and retrocausality, which have been validated in a meta-analysis of 90 trials in 33 labs in 14 nations, comport not only with relativity but also with interpretations of quantum physics.

Wagenmakers &quot;et al.&quot; criticized Bem&#x27;s statistical methodology, saying that he incorrectly provides one-sided &quot;p&quot;-value when he should have used a two-sided &quot;p&quot;-value. This could account for the marginally-significant results of his experiment. Bem and two statisticians subsequently published a rebuttal to this critique in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&quot;

Jeffrey Rouder and Richard Morey, who applied a meta-analytical Bayes factor to Bem&#x27;s data, concluded, &quot;We remain unconvinced of the viability of ESP. There is no plausible mechanism for it, and it seems contradicted by well-substantiated theories in both physics and biology. Against this background, a change in odds of 40 is negligible.

After evaluating Bem&#x27;s nine experiments, psychologist James Alcock said that he found metaphorical &quot;dirty test tubes,&quot; or serious methodological flaws, such as changing the procedures partway through the experiments and combining results of tests with different chances of significance. It is unknown how many tests were actually performed, nor is there an explanation of how it was determined that participants had &quot;settled down&quot; after seeing erotic images. Alcock concludes that &quot;Just about everything that could be done wrong in an experiment occurred here&quot;. Bem&#x27;s response to Alcock&#x27;s critique appeared online at the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; website, and Alcock replied to these comments in a third article at the same website.

One of the nine experiments in Bem&#x27;s study (&quot;Retroactive Facilitation of Recall&quot;) was repeated by scientists Stuart J. Ritchie, Chris French, and Richard Wiseman. Their attempt to replicate was published in &quot;PLoS ONE&quot; and found no evidence of precognition. Several failed attempts by the authors to publish their replication attempt highlighted difficulties in publishing replications, attracting media attention over concerns of publication bias. The &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot;, &quot;Science Brevia&quot; and &quot;Psychological Science&quot; each rejected the paper on the grounds that it was a replication. A fourth journal, the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;, refused the paper after reservations from one referee, later confirmed to be Bem himself, who &quot;might possibly have a conflict of interest with respect to [the] ... submission.&quot; Wiseman set up a register to keep track of other replicating efforts to avoid problems with publication bias, and planned to conduct a meta-analysis on registered replication efforts.

In 2012, two independent articles found that the number of rejections of the null hypothesis reported by Bem (nine out of ten tested) is abnormally high, given the properties of the experiments and reported effect sizes (Francis, 2012; Schimmack, 2012). Schimmack (2015) used a more powerful test to reveal selection for significance, the Test of Insufficient Variance, and found even stronger evidence that the reported studies are biased in favor of supporting ESP. These findings imply that studies with non-significant results are missing and the reported evidence overstates the strength of the effect and evidence. According to Francis, this suggests that Bem&#x27;s experiments cannot be taken as a proper scientific study, as critical data is likely unavailable.

The publication of Bem&#x27;s article and the resulting controversy prompted a wide-ranging commentary by Etienne LeBel and Kurt Peters. Using Bem&#x27;s article as a case study, they discussed deficiencies in the accepted methodology most commonly used in experimental psychology. LeBel and Peters suggest that experimental psychology is systemically biased toward interpretations of data that favor the researcher&#x27;s theory.

In 2012, the same journal that published Bem&#x27;s original experiments, &quot;The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; (Vol. 103, No. 6), published &quot;Correcting the Past: Failures to Replicate Psi&quot; by Jeff Galak of Carnegie Mellon University, Robyn A. LeBoeuf of the University of Florida, Leif D. Nelson of the University of California at Berkeley, and Joseph P. Simmons of the University of Pennsylvania. The paper reported seven experiments testing for precognition that &quot;found no evidence supporting its existence.&quot;

In a 2017 follow-up article in &quot;Slate&quot; magazine on the &quot;Feeling the Future&quot; experiments, Bem is quoted as saying, “I’m all for rigor, but I prefer other people do it. I see its importance—it’s fun for some people—but I don’t have the patience for it.” The article continues: &quot;It’s been hard for him, he said, to move into a field where the data count for so much. “If you looked at all my past experiments, they were always rhetorical devices. I gathered data to show how my point would be made. I used data as a point of persuasion, and I never really worried about, ‘Will this replicate or will this not?’”&quot; While fellow psychologist Stuart Vyse sees this statement as coming &quot;remarkably close to an outright admission of p-hacking&quot;, he also notes that Bem &quot;has been given substantial credit for stimulating the movement to tighten the standards for research&quot; such as that taking place in open science.

A large-scale pre-registered replication in 2023, which included Bem and other ESP proponents in its design, found no evidence for precognition.

== Family life ==

Bem married Sandra Bem (née Lipsitz), also a psychology professor, in 1965. Though still legally married, they were &quot;amicably separated&quot; from 1994 until her death in 2014. In 2015, he married his partner of twenty years, Ithaca College professor of communication studies, performance studies, and queer studies Bruce Henderson. They live in Ithaca, NY.

<doc id="364118" wikidata="Q541394" url="?curid=364118" title="Mixed-sex education">
<text>Mixed-sex education, also known as mixed-gender education, co-education, or coeducation (abbreviated to co-ed or coed), is a system of education where males and females are educated together. Whereas single-sex education was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in western countries. Single-sex education remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.

The world&#x27;s oldest co-educational school is thought to be Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s Church of England High School, Croydon, established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards. This has always been a day school only.

The world&#x27;s oldest co-educational both day and boarding school is Dollar Academy, a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom. From its opening in 1818, the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of Dollar and the surrounding area. The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils.

The first co-educational college to be founded was Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin, Ohio. It opened on 3 December 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor&#x27;s degrees did so in 1840. By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for men or women had become coeducational.

==History==
In early civilizations, people were typically educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period. The early periods of this century included many religious schools and the first major public schools in the country had been established for males and females.

In the 16th century, at the Council of Trent, the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created. After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in Western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended dame schools. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The Society of Friends in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or common schools, which after the American Revolution supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coeducation grew much more widely accepted. In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.

==Australia==
In Australia, there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single-sex schools opening and existing single-sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.

==China==
The first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in China was the Nanjing Higher Normal Institute, which was renamed National Central University and Nanjing University. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally, only schools established by zōng zú (宗族, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools, such as Li Zhi&#x27;s school during the Ming dynasty and Yuan Mei&#x27;s school during the Qing Dynasty, enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s, women&#x27;s universities were established, such as Ginling Women&#x27;s University and Peking Girls&#x27; Higher Normal School, but there was no coeducation in higher learning schools.

Tao Xingzhi, the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed &quot;The Audit Law for Women Students&quot; (規定女子旁聽法案, Guī Dìng Nǚ Zi Páng Tīng Fǎ Àn) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president Kuo Ping-Wen, academic director Liu Boming, and such famous professors as Lu Zhiwei and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year Peking University also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was Chien-Shiung Wu.

In 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded. The Chinese government pursued a policy of moving towards co-education and nearly all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. In recent years, some female or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs, but equal rights for education still applies to all citizens.

Indigenous Muslim populations in China, the Hui and Salars, find coeducation to be controversial, owing to Islamic ideas on gender roles. On the other hand, the Muslim Uyghurs have not historically objected to coeducation.

==France==
Admission to the Sorbonne was opened to girls in 1860. The baccalauréat became gender-blind in 1924, giving equal chances to all girls in applying to any universities. Mixed-sex education became mandatory for primary schools in 1957 and for all universities in 1975.

==Hong Kong==
St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College was the first mixed-sex secondary school in Hong Kong. It was founded in 1915 as St. Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College. At the end of World War II, it was temporarily merged with St. Paul&#x27;s College, which is a boys&#x27; school. When classes at the campus of St. Paul&#x27;s College were resumed, it continued to be mixed and changed to its present name. Some other renowned mixed-sex secondary schools in town include Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School, Queen Elizabeth School, and Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School. Most Hong Kong primary and secondary schools are mixed-sex, including government public schools, charter schools, and private schools.

==Mongolia==
Mongolia&#x27;s first co-educational school, named Third School, opened in Ulaanbaatar on November 2, 1921. Subsequent schools have been co-educational and there are no longer any single-sex schools in Mongolia.

==Pakistan==

Pakistan is one of the many Muslim countries where most schools and colleges are single-gender although some schools and colleges, and most universities are coeducational. In schools that offer O levels and A levels, co-education is quite prevalent. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, most universities were coeducational but the proportion of women was less than 5%. After the Islamization policies in the early 1980s, the government established Women&#x27;s colleges and Women&#x27;s universities to promote education among women who were hesitant to study in mixed-sex environment. Today, however, most universities and a large number of schools in urban areas are co-educational.

==United Kingdom==

===Schools===

In the United Kingdom the official term is &quot;mixed&quot;, and today most schools are mixed. A number of Quaker co-educational boarding schools were established before the 19th century.

The world&#x27;s oldest co-educational school is thought to be Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s Church of England High School, Croydon, established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted 10 boys and 10 girls from its opening, and remained co-educational thereafter. This is a day school only and still in existence.

The Scottish Dollar Academy was the first mixed-sex both day and boarding school in the UK. Founded in 1818, it is the oldest both boarding and day mixed-sex educational institution in the world still in existence. In England, the first non-Quaker mixed-sex public boarding school was Bedales School, founded in 1893 by John Haden Badley and becoming mixed in 1898. Ruckleigh School in Solihull was founded by Cathleen Cartland in 1909 as a non-denominational co-educational preparatory school many decades before others followed. Many previously single-sex schools have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades: for example, Clifton College began to accept girls in 1987.

===Higher-education institutions===
In 1869, the Edinburgh Seven became the first women to be admitted as undergraduates to a British university. However, they were not allowed to attend the same lectures as men and were eventually barred from receiving degrees.

The first higher-education institution in the United Kingdom to enrol women and men on equal terms was the University of Bristol (then University College, Bristol) in 1876. The University of London was the first British university to admit women to degrees alongside men, in 1878, but was an examining board rather than a teaching institution at that time. The federal Victoria University was established in 1880 and was authorised to grant degrees to men and women, and from 1883 Owens College (then the only college of the university; now the University of Manchester) admitted women. Durham University College of Science (now Newcastle University) had allowed women to study alongside men from its foundation in 1871, but the first women did not enrol until 1880. Women at Durham could take the Associate in Science at this time, but were not permitted to take full degrees until 1895 and could not become members of convocation until 1913. The Scottish universities were opened to women by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, with the first women being admitted in 1892, although women remained barred from studying medicine until 1916. At Oxford, women were admitted to membership of the university and to degrees from 1920, while at Cambridge this did not occur until 1948. Women at Cambridge continued to have to take examinations in different rooms from the men until 1956.

Accommodation at universities became mixed much later than education, starting in the 1960s with the plate glass universities. At Sussex (1961), the halls of residence were single sex, while the halls at Essex (1965) were mixed but with floors segregated by sex. At the first Lancaster colleges, Bowland and Lonsdale (1964), floors were mixed but segregated by area, while in Lancaster&#x27;s third college, Cartmel (1968), segregation was only by corridor.

Given their dual role as both residential and educational establishments, and that most undergraduate students were not legally adults until the 1970s, individual colleges at Oxford, Cambridge and Durham remained segregated for longer than their parent universities. The first to become mixed were post-graduate colleges and societies, whose students were legally adults, starting with Oxford&#x27;s Nuffield College from its establishment in 1937. The first mixed Cambridge college was the post-graduate Darwin from its foundation in 1964; similarly, Durham&#x27;s Graduate Society (now Ustinov College) was mixed from its opening in 1965. Until 1970, students under 21 were not legally adults and universities and colleges acted &quot;in loco parentis&quot;. After the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1970, restrictions on mixed student residences began to be lifted. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King&#x27;s colleges became the first previously all-male Cambridge colleges to admit female undergraduates, while the first mixed undergraduate colleges at Durham, also in 1972, were Collingwood College, which was founded that year and was also the first British university residence to have mixed-sex corridors, and the originally all-male Van Mildert College. The first five undergraduate colleges at Oxford (Brasenose, Hertford, Jesus, St Catherine&#x27;s, and Wadham) became mixed in 1974. The last all-male colleges became mixed in 1988, including Magdalene College, Cambridge, Hatfield College, Durham and St Chad&#x27;s College, Durham; the last all-male colleges at Oxford having become mixed in 1986. St Benet&#x27;s Hall (now closed), a permanent private hall rather than a college, was the last institution at Oxford to become mixed, admitting postgraduate women from 2014 and undergraduates from 2016.

The last women&#x27;s college in Durham, St Mary&#x27;s, became mixed in 2005. At Oxford, the last women&#x27;s college, St Hilda&#x27;s, became mixed in 2008. two colleges remain single-sex (women-only) at Cambridge: Murray Edwards (New Hall) and Newnham. Single-sex women&#x27;s accommodation continues the be available at some other universities, including Aberdare Hall at Cardiff, and the Boughton Wing of St Mary&#x27;s College, Durham.

==United States==

The oldest extant mixed-sex institute of higher education in the United States is Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, which was established in 1833. Mixed-sex classes were admitted to the preparatory department at Oberlin in 1833 and the college department in 1837. The first four women to receive bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the United States earned them at Oberlin in 1841. Later, in 1862, the first black woman to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree (Mary Jane Patterson) also earned it from Oberlin College. Beginning in 1844, Hillsdale College became the next college to admit mixed-sex classes to four-year degree programs.

The University of Iowa became the first coeducational public or state university in the United States in 1855, and for much of the next century, public universities, and land grant universities in particular, would lead the way in mixed-sex higher education. There were also many private coeducational universities founded in the 19th century, especially west of the Mississippi River. East of the Mississippi, Wheaton College (Illinois) graduated its first female student in 1862. Bates College in Maine was open to women from its founding in 1855, and graduated its first female student in 1869. Cornell University and the University of Michigan each admitted their first female students in 1870.

Around the same time, single-sex women&#x27;s colleges were also appearing. According to Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra: &quot;women&#x27;s colleges were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education.&quot; Notable examples include the Seven Sisters colleges, of which Vassar College is now coeducational and Radcliffe College has merged with Harvard University. Other notable women&#x27;s colleges that have become coeducational include Wheaton College in Massachusetts, Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Ohio, Skidmore College, Wells College, and Sarah Lawrence College in New York state, Pitzer College in California, Goucher College in Maryland and Connecticut College.

By 1900 the Briton Frederic Harrison said after visiting the United States that &quot;The whole educational machinery of America ... open to women must be at least twentyfold greater than with us, and it is rapidly advancing to meet that of men both in numbers and quality&quot;. Where most of the history of coeducation in this period is a list of those moving toward the accommodation of both men and women at one campus, the state of Florida was an exception. In 1905, the Buckman Act was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with Florida State College for Women (since 1947, Florida State University) established to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the University of Florida serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now Florida A&amp;M University. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Several early primary and secondary schools in the United States were single-sex. Examples include Collegiate School, a boys&#x27; school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and Boston Latin School, founded in 1635 (which did not become coeducational until 1972).

Nonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges. For example, in 1787, the predecessor to Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, opened as a mixed-sex secondary school. Its first enrollment class consisted of 78 male and 36 female students. Among the latter was Rebecca Gratz who would become an educator and philanthropist. However, the school soon began having financial problems and it reopened as an all-male institution. Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts has operated as mixed-sex secondary school since its founding in 1792, making it the oldest continuously operating coed school in America. The oldest continuously operating coed boarding school in the United States is Westtown School, founded in 1799.

===Colleges===

A minister and a missionary founded Oberlin in 1833. Rev. John Jay Shipherd (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary) became friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria. They discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, &quot;where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the boundless most desolate fields in the West&quot;.

Oberlin College and the surrounding community were dedicated to progressive causes and social justice. Though it did reluctantly what every other college refused to do at all, it was the first college to admit both women and African Americans as students. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor&#x27;s degrees, until 1837; prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies&#x27; Course. The initial 1837 students were Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.

The early success and achievement of women at Oberlin College persuaded many early women&#x27;s rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes were treated rudely by their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that claimed that women were mentally unsuited for higher education, and because most would &quot;just get married&quot;, they were using resources that, they believed, male students would use better. Some professors simply ignored the women students.

By the end of the 19th century 70% of American colleges were coeducational, although the state of Florida was a notable exception; the Buckman Act of 1905 imposed gender-separated white higher education at the University of Florida (men) and Florida State College for Women. (As there was only one state college for blacks, the future Florida A&amp;M University, it admitted both men and women.) The white Florida campuses returned to coeducation in 1947, when the women&#x27;s college became Florida State University and the University of Florida became coeducational. In the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex became coeducational.

===Co-education fraternities===

A number of Greek-letter student societies have either been established (locally or nationally) or expanded as co-ed fraternities.

===&quot;Coed&quot; as slang===
In American colloquial language, &quot;coed&quot; or &quot;co-ed&quot; is used to refer to a mixed school.
The word is also often used to describe a situation in which both sexes are integrated in any form (e.g., &quot;The team is coed&quot;). Less common in the 21st century is the noun use of word &quot;coed&quot;, which traditionally referred to a female student in a mixed gender school. The noun use is considered by many to be sexist and unprofessional, the argument being that applying the term solely to women implies that &quot;normal&quot; education is exclusively male: technically both male and female students at a coeducational institution should be considered &quot;coeds&quot;. Writing for the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development in 2017, author and educator Barbara Boroson described the noun use as &quot;unfortunate&quot;, observing that &quot;Although coeducation means &#x27;the education of both sexes together at the same time women were considered to be the physical manifestations of the coeducation movement. While men were called students, women were called coeds. The message was that women . . . were not really students.&quot; Numerous professional organizations require that the gender-neutral term &quot;student&quot; be used instead of &quot;coed&quot; or, when gender is relevant to the context, that the term &quot;female student&quot; be substituted.

==Effects==

For years, a question many educators, parents, and researchers have been asking is whether it is academically beneficial to teach boys and girls together or separately at school. Some argue that coeducation has primarily social benefits by allowing males and females of all ages to become more prepared for real-world situations and that students familiar with a single-sex setting could be less prepared, nervous, or uneasy.

However, some argue that at certain ages, students may be more distracted by the opposite sex in a coeducational setting, but others point to this being based on an assumption that all students are heterosexual. There is evidence that girls may perform less well in traditionally male-dominated subjects such as the sciences when in a class with boys, but other research suggests that when the previous attainment is taken into account, that difference falls away. According to advocates of coeducation, without classmates of the opposite sex, students have social issues that may impact adolescent development. They argue that the absence of the opposite sex creates an unrealistic environment not duplicated in the real world. Some studies show that in classes that are separated by gender, male and female students work and learn on the same level as their peers, the stereotypical mentality of the teacher is removed, and girls are likely to have more confidence in the classroom than they would in a coeducational class. In a 2022 study published in the British Educational Research Journal which examined the Irish educational system, the authors stated that the existing &quot;empirical evidence is somewhat ambiguous, with some studies finding a positive impact of single-sex schooling on education achievement [...] but others finding average null effects&quot;; they concluded that after controlling for &quot;individual, parental and school-level factors [...] on average, there is no significant difference in performance for girls or boys who attend single-sex schools compared to their mixed-school peers in science, mathematics or reading.&quot;

<doc id="364128" wikidata="Q1064754" url="?curid=364128" title="Streaking">
<text>Streaking is the act of running naked through a public area for publicity, for fun, as a prank, a dare, a form of protest, or to participate in a fad. Streaking is often associated with sporting events, but can occur in more secluded areas. Streakers are often pursued by sporting officials or the police.

==Definitions and etymology==
The word has been used in its modern sense only since the 1960s. Before that, &quot;to streak&quot; in English since 1768 meant &quot;to go quickly, to rush, to run at full speed&quot;, and was a re-spelling of &quot;streek&quot;: &quot;to go quickly&quot; (); this in turn was originally a northern Middle English variant of &quot;stretch&quot; ().

In December 1973, a graduate of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota wrote to &quot;Time&quot; magazine that the term &quot;streaking&quot; was coined because the nude students ran primarily during the winter months of January and February, and &quot;unless one appeared as a streak against the landscape, the Minnesota winter was triumphant and streaker became statue.&quot; The school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Carletonian&quot;, used the term &quot;streaking&quot; as early as 1967, but initially in negative terms: &quot;Examples of [Carleton&#x27;s social problems] are the large number of departing female students, the rise of class spirit, low grades, streaking, destruction, drinking, and the popularity of rock dances.&quot;

==History==

Historical forerunners of modern-day streakers include the neo-Adamites who travelled naked through towns and villages in medieval Europe, and the 17th-century Quaker Solomon Eccles, who went nude through the City of London with a burning brazier on his head. At 7:00 PM on 5 July 1799, a man was arrested at the Mansion House, London, and sent to the Poultry Compter. He confirmed that he had accepted a wager of 10 guineas (equal to £ today) to run naked from Cornhill to Cheapside.

Fines of between £10 and £50 were imposed on streakers by British and Irish magistrates in the early 1970s. The offences used for prosecution were typically minor, such as the violation of park regulations. Nevertheless, the chief law in force against streaking in England and Wales at that time remained the 16th-century vagrancy law, for which the punishment in 1550 had been whipping.

===In the United States===
Not to be confused with the fad known as streaking, the first recorded incident of running naked in public by a college student in the United States occurred in 1804 at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) when senior George William Crump was arrested for running naked through Lexington, Virginia, where the university is located. Crump was suspended for the academic session, but later went on to become a U.S. Congressman.

In June 1973, the press reported on a &quot;streaking&quot; trend at Michigan State University. In December 1973, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called streaking &quot;a growing Los Angeles-area fad&quot; that was &quot;catching on among college students and other groups&quot;. A letter writer responded, &quot;Let it be known that streakers have plagued the campus police at Notre Dame for the past decade&quot;, pointing out that a group of University of Notre Dame students sponsored a &quot;Streakers&#x27; Olympics&quot; in 1972.

In February 1974, the press began calling it a &quot;streaking epidemic.&quot; By the first week of March, college campuses across the country were competing to set streaking records. On March 11, 1974, several Americans imported streaking to Japan, where a series of copycat incidents occurred over the next month.

The prominence of streaking in 1974 has been linked both to the sexual revolution and a conservative backlash against feminism and the campus protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==On college campuses==
===United States===
Colleges and universities with documented traditions of campus streaking include the University of Chicago (Polar Bear run), Denison University (Naked Week), Oberlin College, Pennsylvania State University, Wellesley College, the University of Virginia (Streaking the Lawn), Wheaton College (the &quot;Kingdom Run&quot;), and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Davis Library Streaking). Students streak in various stages of undress. Some are completely naked. Most prefer wearing socks and/or shoes. Female streakers often wear a thong or a g-string, and streak topless, and a few choose to wear a bra as well. Male streakers are mostly wearing nothing but a pair of shoes. Many streakers wear a mask nowadays since filming the event has gotten easier compared to the days these traditions started. 

Carleton College is home to the streaking traditions Week of Streak (founded spring 2020) and Nudegressive. The week before finals, students streak each night at dusk to sundown at various locations around campus. These streaking locations become increasingly ambitious, or public, as the week goes on. Week of Streak culminates with Nudegressive, an event that takes place at midnight on the eve of Rotblatt with around 200 participants who streak a 1 mile loop through Carleton&#x27;s arboretum followed by a nude dance party at the Hill of Three Oaks bonfire. Many students choose to also take a dip in the Boliou fountain. 

Dartmouth College has two streaking-related challenges: The Ledyard Challenge, in which students swim naked across the Connecticut River and run nude back across the bridge, and the Blue Light Challenge, in which streaking students attempt to press the alarm on every one of the campus&#x27;s blue light emergency phones. As of 2005, a Thursday Night Streaking Club regularly streaked at various events and public places.

In 1986, the University of Michigan&#x27;s Naked Mile celebrated the last day of class with a group streak across campus along an approximate one-mile path. At the height of its popularity in the late 1990s, between 500 and 800 students participated, including several hundred females. Over 1,400 students participated one year and well over one thousand during another year. However, due to enforcement of public indecency laws and pressure from administration officials concerned about increasing spectator crowds and videotaping, participation declined. By 2001, a mere 24 students participated, signaling the effective end of the Naked Mile. Students were warned by college administrators that streakers would be arrested and required to register as sex offenders for life under Megan&#x27;s Law.

The students at Union College held midnight &quot;Pajama Parade&quot; events in 1862, 1914 and several times in the 1950s. The real streaking tradition, which was nationally popular since 1973, arrived at the campus in the 1990s in the form of a nocturnal lap around the Nott Memorial known as the &quot;Naked Nott Run.&quot;

To celebrate the school year&#x27;s first night of heavy rainfall, a well-known tradition called &quot;First Rain&quot; is enacted at the University of California, Santa Cruz by students who for the entirety of the day to midnight, run around campus nearly or completely nude. Beginning at Porter, the run proceeds throughout the other colleges.

At the University of Vermont, a Naked Bike Ride is traditionally held at midnight at the end of each semester. Participants run, bike, unicycle, carry kayaks, push shopping carts, or pull sleds. The topic of the Naked Bike Ride has been a touchy one among UVM police, who have tried several times to do away with it. In 2011, Interim President John Bramley ended school funding for the event. This resulted in the student body creating the UVM Green Caps, a group of student volunteers stationed around campus throughout the evening for the safety of students.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, students gather on the 8th floor of Davis Library the night before finals. At 12:00 AM, all students gathered on the 8th floor strip naked and run down the main stairwell and outside to Wilson Library. After reaching Wilson Library, the streakers sing the University&#x27;s Alma Mater(Hark the Sound) and run back to the 8th floor of Davis Library.

===The Philippines===
At the University of the Philippines, members of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity streak around the campus in an annual event known as the Oblation Run. The run started in 1977 to protest the banning of the movie, &quot;Hubad na Bayani&quot;, which depicted human rights abuses in the martial law era. The event continued to occur as a protest action.

===Spain===
In 2011, the first nudist race took place at the University of Alicante (Spain).

In the sport of cricket, it is not uncommon for a male streaker to run out to the field purely for shock and entertainment value or political purposes. The first known instance of streaking in cricket took place on 22 March 1974, the first day of the third test between Australia and New Zealand at Auckland. Half an hour before the end of the day&#x27;s play, while New Zealand was batting, &quot;a dark-haired young man&quot; ran from near the sightscreen, through mid-wicket and disappeared between the stands near the square-leg boundary. The incident occurred quickly and police did not have time to react. Reports differ on whether the man was completely naked, with some accounts stating that he may have been wearing a flesh-coloured T-shirt. On the evening of the second day, while Australian batsman Ian Redpath was on strike, an &quot;athletic young man&quot; was caught on television cameras running across the ground on the leg side. The streaker ran to the men&#x27;s restroom and was chased by police. When police entered the restroom, they found 20 people inside—all of whom were clothed—and authorities were unable to identify the streaker.

Another example was in the First Test of the Australia versus the I.C.C. World XI, when a rather drunken man darted out toward the field naked, shocking the Australian and World XI players, halting play until he was spear tackled to the ground by field personnel. In one notable incident in 1977, Australian test cricketer Greg Chappell spanked an invading streaker named Bruce McCauley with his cricket bat; McCauley then fell to the ground and was arrested by police.
Streaking became popular at Australian rules football matches in the 1980s, particularly Victorian Football League Grand Finals. The trend was a trend started by Adelaide stripper Helen D&#x27;Amico at the 1982 VFL Grand Final between Carlton and Richmond, in which D&#x27;Amico streaked while wearing only a Carlton scarf. At the 1988 VFL Grand Final, a fully naked woman streaked during the final quarter and was promptly arrested. In another Melbourne Demons grand final, the 2021 Grand final, held in Perth, a male streaker ran on to the ground wearing only his underwear. He was only on the ground for a few seconds before he was removed and arrested.

In a game against the Melbourne Storm at Olympic Park Stadium in 2007, a Brisbane Broncos fan streaked across the field waving his supporter jersey over his head. He was apprehended at the other side of the field to large applause.

During an NRL finals match between the Wests Tigers and the New Zealand Warriors at the Sydney Football Stadium on 16 September 2011, a streaker ran onto the playing field forcing the game to come to a halt as security guards attempted to apprehend the man.

During the final minutes of the third and deciding game of the 2013 State of Origin series, a streaker, Wati Holmwood, intruded naked upon the field, interrupting the play and possibly costing the Queensland team a try. He was tackled by security guards, escorted from the field and fined $5,500.

===United Kingdom===
The first instance of streaking in English football took place on 23 March 1974. Prior to the start of the league match between Arsenal and Manchester City at Arsenal Stadium, a middle-aged man named John Taylor ran around the field. He was eventually caught by three policemen, forcibly made to wear trousers, and removed from the stadium. Taylor was fined £10 by the North London Court the next day.

Michael O&#x27;Brien was the first-known streaker at a major sporting event when, on 20 April 1974, he ran out naked onto the ground of an England–France rugby union match at Twickenham. The 25-year-old Australian was captured by a policeman, PC Bruce Perry, who covered O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s genitals with his police helmet. The photograph of O&#x27;Brien under arrest became one of the most reproduced photographs of a streaker.

One of the best-known instances of streaking occurred on 5 August 1975, when former Royal Navy cook Michael Angelow ran naked across Lord&#x27;s during an Ashes Test. This was the first instance of streaking during a cricket match in England, and commonly mistakenly believed to be the first-ever instance of streaking in cricket.

In 1982, a woman named Erika Roe ran across the pitch of Twickenham Stadium in London, England, during an England–Australia rugby union match, exposing her bust. It has been described by the BBC as &quot;perhaps the most famous of all streaks.&quot;

Linsey Dawn McKenzie, an English glamour model, performed a topless streak at a televised England v. West Indies cricket match at Old Trafford in 1995. Wearing only a thong and a pair of trainers, she ran onto the field with the words &quot;Only Teasing&quot; written across her breasts.

In 1999, a female streaker named Yvonne Robb was arrested for kissing Tiger Woods on the 18th hole at Carnoustie.

On 22 March 2009, a female streaker ran onto the pitch brandishing a green flag during the televised match between London Irish and Northampton Saints. It was in front of the season&#x27;s largest crowd away from Twickenham, with 21,000 fans bearing witness.

===United States===
In the 1970s, at the height of streaking&#x27;s popularity, a male streaker who broke into the Augusta National golf course in Augusta, Georgia (albeit not while the Masters was in play), was shot with buckshot and slightly wounded. In 1999, a female streaker named Yvonne Robb was arrested for kissing Tiger Woods on the 18th hole at Carnoustie.

In Super Bowl XXXVIII, streaker Mark Roberts disrupted the game by running onto the field. He was eventually leveled by New England Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham, and was subsequently apprehended. Despite the worldwide audience, this event was largely overshadowed due to that game&#x27;s infamous halftime show in which Janet Jackson&#x27;s nude breast was revealed due to what was called a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. Roberts would return in 2007 during the first NFL regular season game held in England between the Miami Dolphins and New York Giants, streaking during the game at Wembley Stadium.

In the 2006 Winter Olympics, in Turin, Italy, Mark Roberts streaked again, this time interrupting the men&#x27;s bronze medal curling match between the U.S. team and the UK team, wearing nothing but a strategically placed rubber chicken. For the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, officials warned visitors against streaking, among other forms of &quot;bad behaviour&quot;.

During the 3rd quarter of Super Bowl LVIII, a fan ran onto the field and was apprehended by security. The streaker was not shown on CBS.

==In popular culture==
The high point of streaking&#x27;s pop culture significance was in 1974, when thousands of streaks took place around the world. A wide range of novelty products were produced to cash in on the fad, from buttons and patches to a wristwatch featuring a streaking Richard Nixon, in pink underwear that said &quot;Too shy to streak.&quot; This is explored in an episode of the first season of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

Perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in April 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?&quot; Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel&#x27;s appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show&#x27;s producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show&#x27;s business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler&#x27;s wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.

Ray Stevens wrote and performed &quot;The Streak&quot;, a novelty song about a man who is &quot;always making the news / wearing just his tennis shoes&quot;. The song reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1974.

Parodied in a 6 May 1974 &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, the character Snoopy, in his college big man on campus alter-ego Joe Cool; engages in the &quot;latest campus fad&quot; by removing his customary sunglasses and collar, then proceeds to go streaking by the fourth panel by appearing to be &quot;naked&quot; in doing so.

In 1981, Japanese coin-op manufacturer Shoei produced an arcade game called &quot;Streaking&quot;, a maze game in which a nude woman is being chased by police. It was distributed in the U.S. by Computer Games, Inc. as &quot;Streaker&quot;, and by Computer Kinetics Corp. as &quot;Stripper&quot;.

In 2014, Russian project ChaveZZZ Reality released a single &quot;Naked Runner&quot; and a same-titled video clip specifically dedicated to all streakers worldwide.

In Bruce Weber&#x27;s 2014 account of a bike ride across America &quot;Life Is a Wheel&quot; he recounts a memory of his friend Billy streaking across the campus of Clark University at the age of 18.

==Records==
As of 2004, the record for the largest group streak was established at the University of Georgia with 1,543 simultaneous streakers on 7 March 1974.

<text>The Douglas C-47 Skytrain or Dakota (RAF designation) is a military transport aircraft developed from the civilian Douglas DC-3 airliner. It was used extensively by the Allies during World War II. During the war the C-47 was used for troop transport, cargo, paratrooper, for towing gliders and military cargo parachute drops. The C-47 remained in front-line service with various military operators for many years. It was produced in approximately triple the numbers as the larger, much heavier payload Curtiss C-46 Commando, which filled a similar role for the U.S. military.

Approximately 100 countries&#x27; armed forces have operated the C-47 with over 60 variants of the aircraft produced. As with the civilian DC-3, the C-47 remains in service in the present day, over 80 years after the type&#x27;s introduction.

==Design and development==
The C-47 differed from the civilian DC-3 by way of numerous modifications, including being fitted with a cargo door, hoist attachment and strengthened floor - along with a shortened tail cone for glider-towing shackles, and an astrodome in the cabin roof.

During World War II, the armed forces of many countries used the C-47 and modified DC-3s for the transport of troops, cargo, and wounded. The U.S. naval designation was R4D. More than 10,000 aircraft were produced in Long Beach and Santa Monica, California, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Between March 1943 and August 1945, the Oklahoma City plant produced 5,354 C-47s.

The specialized C-53 &quot;Skytrooper&quot; troop transport started production in October 1941 at Douglas Aircraft&#x27;s Santa Monica plant. It lacked the cargo door, hoist attachment, and reinforced floor of the C-47. Only 380 aircraft were produced in all because the C-47 was found to be more versatile.

===Super DC-3 (R4D-8)===

Large numbers of DC-3s and surplus C-47s were in commercial use in the United States in the 1940s. In response to proposed changes to the Civil Air Regulations airworthiness requirements that would limit the continuing use of these aircraft, Douglas offered a late-1940s DC-3 conversion to improve takeoff and single-engine performance. This new model, the DC-3S or &quot;Super DC-3&quot;, was 39 in (0.99 m) longer. It allowed 30 passengers to be carried, with increased speed to compete with newer airliners. The rearward shift in the center of gravity led to larger tail surfaces and new outer, swept-back wings. More powerful engines were installed along with shorter, jet ejection-type exhaust stacks. These were either 1,475 hp (1,100 kW) Wright R-1820 Cyclones or 1,450 hp (1,081 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 Twin Wasps in larger engine nacelles. Minor changes included wheel-well doors, a partially retractable tailwheel, flush rivets, and low-drag antenna. These all contributed to an increased top speed of . With over 75% of the original DC-3/C-47 configuration changed, the modified design was virtually a new aircraft. The first DC-3S made its maiden flight on 23 June 1949.

The changes fully met the new FAR 4B airworthiness requirements, with significantly improved performance. However, little interest was expressed by commercial operators in the DC-3S. It was too expensive for the smaller operators that were its main target; only three were sold to Capital Airlines. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps had 100 of their R4D aircraft modified to Super DC-3 standards as the R4D-8, later redesignated the C-117D.

==Operational history==
===World War II===

The C-47 was vital to the success of many Allied campaigns, in particular, those at Guadalcanal and in the jungles of New Guinea and Burma, where the C-47 and its naval version, the R4D, made it possible for Allied troops to counter the mobility of the light-traveling Japanese Army. C-47s were used to airlift supplies to the encircled American forces during the Battle of Bastogne in Belgium. Possibly its most influential role in military aviation, however, was flying &quot;The Hump&quot; from India into China. The expertise gained flying &quot;The Hump&quot; was later used in the Berlin Airlift, in which the C-47 played a major role until the aircraft were replaced by Douglas C-54 Skymasters.

In Europe, the C-47 and a specialized paratroop variant, the C-53 Skytrooper, were used in vast numbers in the later stages of the war, particularly to tow gliders and drop paratroops. During the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, C-47s dropped 4,381 Allied paratroops. More than 50,000 paratroops were dropped by C-47s during the first few days of the D-Day campaign also known as the invasion of Normandy, France, in June 1944. In the Pacific War, with careful use of the island landing strips of the Pacific Ocean, C-47s were used for ferrying soldiers serving in the Pacific theater back to the United States.

About 2,000 C-47s (received under Lend-Lease) in British and Commonwealth service took the name &quot;Dakota&quot;, possibly inspired by the acronym &quot;DACoTA&quot; for Douglas Aircraft Company Transport Aircraft.

The C-47 also earned the informal nickname &quot;gooney bird&quot; in the European theatre of operations. Other sources attribute this name to the first aircraft, a USMC R2D—the military version of the DC-2—being the first aircraft to land on Midway Island, previously home to the long-winged albatross known as the gooney bird which was native to Midway.

===Postwar era===

The United States Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command had Skytrains in service from 1946 to 1967. The US Air Force&#x27;s 6th Special Operations Squadron was flying the C-47 until 2008.
With all of their aircraft and pilots having been part of the Indian Air Force prior to independence, both the Indian Air Force and Pakistan Air Force used C-47s to transport supplies to their soldiers fighting in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1947.

After World War II, thousands of surplus C-47s were converted to civilian airline use, some remaining in operation in 2012, as well as being used as private aircraft.

In October 1956, a U.S. Navy R4D-5L named &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; landed at the South Pole in Antarctica. This was the first time humans had been at the pole since 1912 (see Robert F. Scott&#x27;s British Antarctic Expedition). 

===Vietnam War===
Several C-47 variants were used in the Vietnam War by the United States Air Force, including three advanced electronic-warfare variations, which sometimes were called &quot;electric gooneys&quot; designated EC-47N, EC-47P, or EC-47Q depending on the engine used. In addition, HC-47s were used by the 9th Special Operations Squadron to conduct psychological warfare operations over South Vietnam and Laos. Miami Air International, Miami International Airport was a USAF military depot used to convert the commercial DC-3s/C-47s into military use. They came in as commercial aircraft purchased from third-world airlines and were completely stripped, rebuilt, and reconditioned. Long-range fuel tanks were installed, along with upgraded avionics and gun mounts. They left as first-rate military aircraft headed for combat in Vietnam in a variety of missions. EC-47s were also operated by the Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian Air Forces. A gunship variation, using three 7.62 mm miniguns, designated AC-47 &quot;Spooky&quot;, often nicknamed &quot;Puff the magic dragon&quot;, also was deployed.

=== USAF retirement ===
In June 1975 the USAF retired the last C-47 in service. In the US Navy and Marine Corps, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliner in U.S. Navy service was named the C-9B Skytrain II in honor of the C-47 Skytrain.

<text>In economics, a time-based currency is an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account is the person-hour or some other time unit. Some time-based currencies value everyone&#x27;s contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an hour of service from another volunteer. Others use time units that might be fractions of an hour (e.g. minutes, ten minutes – 6 units/hour, or 15 minutes – 4 units/hour). While most time-based exchange systems are service exchanges in that most exchange involves the provision of services that can be measured in a time unit, it is also possible to exchange goods by &#x27;pricing&#x27; them in terms of the average national hourly wage rate (e.g. if the average hourly rate is $20/hour, then a commodity valued at $20 in the national currency would be equivalent to 1 hour).

==History==
===19th century===

Time-based currency exchanges date back to the early 19th century.

The Cincinnati Time Store (1827-1830) was the first in a series of retail stores created by American individualist anarchist Josiah Warren to test his economic labor theory of value. The experimental store operated from May 18, 1827, until May 1830. The Cincinnati Time Store experiment in use of labor as a medium of exchange antedated similar European efforts by two decades.

The National Equitable Labour Exchange was founded by Robert Owen, a Welsh socialist and labor reformer in London, England, in 1832. It was established in Birmingham, England, before folding in 1834. It issued &quot;Labour Notes&quot; similar to banknotes, denominated in units of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 hours. John Gray, a socialist economist, worked with Owen and later with Ricardian Socialists and postulated a &quot;National Chamber of Commerce&quot; as a central bank issuing a &quot;labour currency&quot;.

In 1848, the socialist and first self-designated anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon postulated a system of &quot;time chits&quot;.

Josiah Warren published a book describing labor notes in 1852.

In 1875, Karl Marx wrote of &quot;Labor Certificates&quot; (&quot;Arbeitszertifikaten&quot;) in his Critique of the Gotha Program of a &quot;certificate from society that [the labourer] has furnished such and such an amount of labour&quot;, which can be used to draw &quot;from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour.&quot;

===20th century===

Teruko Mizushima (1920-1996) was a Japanese housewife, author, inventor, social commentator, and activist credited with creating the world&#x27;s first time bank in 1973.

Mizushima was born in 1920 in Osaka to a merchant household. She performed well in school and was given the opportunity to study overseas in the United States in 1939. Her stay was shortened from three years to one due to rising tensions between the US, Japan, and China. Mizushima opted to pursue a short-term diploma course in sewing.

After returning home, she married. Her first daughter was born at the outbreak of the Pacific War, and her husband was soon conscripted into the army.

Mizushima&#x27;s sewing skills proved invaluable to her family during and after the war. While the Japanese population was suffering immense material shortages, Mizushima offered her sewing skills in exchange for fresh vegetables. It was during this time that she began to develop her ideas about economics and the relative value of labor.

In 1950, Mizushima submitted an essay to a newspaper contest as part of a national event titled “Women&#x27;s Ideas for the Creation of a New Life.” Her essay received the Newspaper Companies’ Prize&quot;.&quot; While it has since been lost, the ideas in the essay attracted widespread press attention.

Mizushima soon became a social commentator, with her views being aired on the radio, in the newspapers, and on television. She frequently appeared on the NHK, the country&#x27;s national broadcaster, and toured the country giving talks about her ideas.

In 1973 she started her group the Volunteer Labour Bank (later renamed the Volunteer Labour Network). By 1978, the bank had grown to include approximately 2,600 members. The membership included people of all ages, from teenagers to women in their seventies. The majority of members were housewives in their thirties and forties. Members were organized into over 160 local branches throughout the country, coordinated by the headquarters located on Mizushima’s estate.

By 1983, the network had over 3,800 members organized in 262 branches, including a branch in California.

The political activist and philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis, after criticizing the incoherency of capitalist, Leninist, and Trotskyist justifications of wage differentials in his 1949 Socialisme ou Barbarie text translated as “The Relations of Production in Russia” in the first volume of his &quot;Political and Social Writings&quot;, responding to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, advocated that workers “proclaim the abolition of work norms and instaurate full equality of wages and salaries” in his 1957 &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; text translated as &quot;On the Content of Socialism, II&quot;. He elaborated further on this advocacy of an “absolute equality of wages and incomes” in his 1974 text, &quot;Hierarchy of Salaries and Incomes&quot;, and in the “Today” section of “Done and To Be Done” (1989).

Edgar S. Cahn coined the term &quot;Time Dollars&quot; in &quot;Time Dollars: The New Currency That Enables Americans to Turn Their Hidden Resource-Time-Into Personal Security &amp; Community Renewal&quot;, a book co-authored with Jonathan Rowe in 1992. He also went on to trademark the terms &quot;TimeBank&quot; and &quot;Time Credit&quot;.

Timebanking is a community development tool and works by facilitating the exchange of skills and experience within a community. It aims to build the &#x27;core economy&#x27; of family and community by valuing and rewarding the work done in it. The world&#x27;s first timebank was started in Japan by Teruko Mizushima in 1973 with the idea that participants could earn time credits which they could spend any time during their lives. She based her bank on the simple concept that each hour of time given as services to others could earn reciprocal hours of services for the giver at some stage in the future, particularly in old age when they might need it most. In the 1940s, Mizushima had already foreseen the emerging problems of an ageing society such as seen today. In the 1990s the movement took off in the US, with Dr Edgar Cahn pioneering it there, and in the United Kingdom, with Martin Simon from Timebanking UK and David Boyle, who brought in the London-based New Economics Foundation (Nef).

Paul Glover created Ithaca Hours in 1991. Each HOUR was valued at one hour of basic labor or $10.00. Professionals were entitled to charge multiple HOURS per hour, but often reduced their rate in the spirit of equity. Millions of dollars&#x27; worth of HOURS were traded among thousands of residents and 500 businesses. Interest-free HOUR loans were made, and HOUR grants given to over 100 community organizations.

The first British time bank opened in 1998 in Stroud, and a national charity and membership organisation, Timebanking UK, started in 2002.

===21st century===
According to Edgar S. Cahn, timebanking had its roots in a time when &quot;money for social programs [had] dried up&quot; and no dominant approach to social service in the U.S. was coming up with creative ways to solve the problem. He would later write that &quot;Americans face at least three interlocking sets of problems: growing inequality in access by those at the bottom to the most basic goods and services; increasing social problems stemming from the need to rebuild family, neighborhood and community; and a growing disillusion with public programs designed to address these problems&quot; and that &quot;the crisis in support for efforts to address social problems stems directly from the failure of ... piecemeal efforts to rebuild genuine community.&quot; In particular Cahn focused on the top-down attitude prevalent in social services. He believed that one of the major failings of many social service organizations was their unwillingness to enroll the help of those people they were trying to help. He called this a deficit based approach to social service, where organizations view the people they were trying to help only in terms of their needs, as opposed to an asset based approach, which focuses on the contributions towards their communities that everyone can make. He theorized that a system like timebanking could &quot;[rebuild] the infrastructure of trust and caring that can strengthen families and communities.&quot; He hoped that the system &quot;would enable individuals and communities to become more self-sufficient, to insulate themselves from the vagaries of politics and to tap the capacity of individuals who were in effect being relegated to the scrap heap and dismissed as freeloaders.&quot;

As a philosophy, timebanking, also known as Time Trade is founded upon five principles, known as TimeBanking&#x27;s Core Values:
* Everyone is an asset
* Some work is beyond a monetary price
* Reciprocity in helping
* Community (via social networks) is necessary
* A respect for all human beings

Ideally, timebanking builds community. TimeBank members sometimes refer to this as a return to simpler times when the community was there for its individuals. An interview at a timebank in the Gorbals neighbourhood of Glasgow revealed the following sentiment:

[the time bank] involves everybody coming together as a community ... the Gorbals has never—not for a long time—had a lot of community spirit. Way back, years ago, it had a lot of community spirit, but now you see that in some areas, people won&#x27;t even go to the chap next door for some sugar ... that&#x27;s what I think the project&#x27;s doing, trying to bring that back, that community sense ...

In 2017 Nimses offered a concept of a time-based currency Nim. 1 nim = 1 minute of life. The concept was first adopted in Eastern Europe.
The concept is based on the idea of universal basic income. Every person is an issuer of nims. For every minute of one&#x27;s life, 1 nim is created, which can be spent or sent to another person, like money.

== Time dollars ==

Time dollars are a tax-exempt complementary currency used as a means of providing mutual credit in TimeBanking. They are typically called &quot;time credits&quot; or &quot;service credits&quot; outside the United States. TimeBank members exchange services for Time Dollars. Each exchange is recorded as a corresponding credit and debit in the accounts of the participants. One hour of time is worth one Time Dollar, regardless of the service provided in one hour or how much skill is required to perform the task during that hour. This &quot;one-for-one&quot; system that relies on an abundant resource is designed to both recognize and encourage reciprocal community service, resist inflation, avoid hoarding, enable trade, and encourage cooperation among participants.

===Timebanks===
Timebanks have been established in 34 countries, with at least 500 timebanks established in 40 US states and 300 throughout the United Kingdom. TimeBanks also have a significant presence in Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Senegal, Argentina, Israel, Greece, and Spain. TimeBanks have been used to reduce recidivism rates with diversionary programs for first-time juvenile offenders; facilitate re-entry of for ex-convicts; deliver health care, job training and social services in public housing complexes; facilitate substance abuse recovery; prevent institutionalization of severely disabled children through parental support networks; provide transportation for homebound seniors in rural areas; deliver elder care, community health services and hospice care; and foster women&#x27;s rights initiatives in Senegal.

=== Timebanking ===
Timebanking is a pattern of reciprocal service exchange that uses units of time as currency. It is an example of a complementary monetary system. A timebank, also known as a service exchange, is a community that practices time banking. The unit of currency, always valued at an hour&#x27;s worth of any person&#x27;s labor, used by these groups has various names but is generally known as a time credit in the US and the UK (formerly a time dollar in the US). Timebanking is primarily used to provide incentives and rewards for work such as mentoring children, caring for the elderly, being neighborly—work usually done on a volunteer basis—which a pure market system devalues. Essentially, the &quot;time&quot; one spends providing these types of community services earns &quot;time&quot; that one can spend to receive services. As well as gaining credits, participating individuals, particularly those more used to being recipients in other parts of their lives, can potentially gain confidence, social contact and skills through giving to others. Communities, therefore, use time banking as a tool to forge stronger intra-community connections, a process known as &quot;building social capital&quot;. Timebanking had its intellectual genesis in the US in the early 1980s. By 1990, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation had invested US$1.2 million to pilot time banking in the context of senior care. Today, 26 countries have active TimeBanks. There are 250 TimeBanks active in the UK and over 276 TimeBanks in the U.S.

==Timebanking and the timebank==
Timebank members earn credit in Time Dollars for each hour they spend helping other members of the community. Services offered by members in timebanks include: Child Care, Legal Assistance, Language Lessons, Home Repair, and Respite Care for caregivers, among other things. Time Dollars AKA time credits earned are then recorded at the timebank to be accessed when desired. A Timebank can theoretically be as simple as a pad of paper, but the system was originally intended to take advantage of computer databases for record keeping. Some Timebanks employ a paid coordinator to keep track of transactions and to match requests for services with those who can provide them. Other Timebanks select a member or a group of members to handle these tasks. Various organizations provide specialized software to help local Timebanks manage exchanges. The same organizations also often offer consulting services, training, and other materials for individuals or organizations looking to start timebanks of their own.

Example services offered by timebank members

The mission of an individual timebank influences exactly which services are offered. In some places, timebanking is adopted as a means to strengthen the community as a whole. Other timebanks are more oriented towards social service, systems change, and helping underprivileged groups. In some timebanks, both are acknowledged goals.

===Time credit===

The time credit is the fundamental unit of exchange in a timebank, equal to one hour of a person&#x27;s labor. In traditional timebanks, one hour of one person&#x27;s time is equal to one hour of another&#x27;s. Time credits are earned for providing services and spent receiving services. Upon earning a time credit, a person does not need to spend it right away: they can save it indefinitely. However, since the value of a time credit is fixed at one hour, it resists inflation and does not earn interest. In these ways it is intentionally designed to differ from the traditional fiat currency used in most countries. Consequently, it does little good to hoard time credits and, in practice, many timebanks also encourage the donation of excess time credits to a community pool which is then spent for those in need or on community events.

==Criticisms==

Some criticisms of timebanking have focused on the time credit&#x27;s inadequacies as a form of currency and as a market information mechanism. Frank Fisher of MIT predicted in the 1980s that such a currency &quot;would lead to the kind of distortion of market forces which had crippled Russia&#x27;s economy.&quot;

Dr. Gill Seyfang&#x27;s study of the Gorbals TimeBank—one of the few studies of timebanking done by the academic community—listed several other non-theoretical problems with timebanking. The first is the difficulty of communicating to potential members exactly what makes timebanking different, or &quot;getting people to understand the difference between timebanking and traditional volunteering.&quot; She also notes that there is no guarantee that every person&#x27;s needs will be provided for by a timebank by dint of the fact that the supply of certain skills may be lacking in a community.

One of the most stringent criticisms of timebanking is its organizational sustainability. While some member-run TimeBanks with relatively low overhead costs do exist, others pay a staff to keep the organization running. This can be quite expensive for smaller organizations and without a long-term source of funding, they may fold.

==Timebanking around the world==

===Global timebanking===

In 2013 TimeRepublik launched the first global Timebank. Its aim is to eliminate geographical limitations of previous timebanks.
Since 2015 TimeRepublik has been promoting Time Banking within local governments, municipalities, universities, and large companies. 
In 2017 TimeRepublik won the first prize at the BAI Global Innovation Awards in the Innovation and Human Capital category 

The Community Exchange System (CES) is a global network of communities using alternative exchange systems, many of which use timebanks. Timebanks can trade with each other wherever they are, as well as with mutual credit exchanges. The system uses a base &#x27;currency&#x27; of one hour, and the conversion rates between the different exchange groups are based on national average hourly wage rates. This allows timebanks to trade with mutual credit exchanges in the same or different countries.

==Studies and examples==

===Elderplan===

Elderplan was a social HMO which incorporated timebanking as a way to promote active, engaged lifestyles for its older members. Funding for the &quot;social&quot; part of social HMOs has since dried up and much of the program has been cut, but at its height, members were able to pay portions of their premiums in time credits (back then called Time Dollars) instead of hard currency. The idea was to encourage older people to become more engaged in their communities while also to ask for help more often and &quot;[foster] dignity by allowing people to contribute services as well as receive them.&quot;

===Gorbals timebank study===

In 2004, Dr. Gill Seyfang published a study in the &quot;Community Development Journal&quot; about the effects of a timebank located in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland, &quot;an inner-city estate characterized by high levels of deprivation, poverty, unemployment, poor health and low educational attainment.&quot; The Gorbals Timebank is run by a local charity with the intent to combat the social ills that face the region. Seyfang concluded that the timebank was effective at &quot;building community capacity&quot; and &quot;promoting social inclusion.&quot; She highlights the timebank&#x27;s success at &quot;[re-stitching] the social fabric of the Gorbals.&quot; by &quot;[boosting] engagement in existing projects and activities&quot; in a variety of projects including a community safety network, a library, a healthy living project, and a theatre. She writes that &quot;the timebank had enabled people to access help they otherwise would have had to do without,&quot; help which included home repair, gardening, a funeral, and tuition paid in time credits to a continuing education course.

===Timebank Florianópolis===

The Time Bank of the City of Florianópolis (BTF) is one of the first and best known Time Banks in Brazil. The initiative was conceived in September 2015 at a local Zeitgeist meeting, part of the international sustainability movement. BTF works from a Facebook group that has more than 20,000 members, and exchanges are counted in a spreadsheet shared with users. Scientific research on BTF indicates that the time bank is a means for creating social capital in local society and that BTF members have different socioeconomic characteristics compared to residents of the city of Florianópolis. Younger, non-white, employed, female individuals, working in the informal sector, with a higher education level and with a higher monthly income are more likely to be BTF members.

===Spice Timebank===
Spice is a social enterprise that has developed a time-based currency called Time Credits. Spice works across health and social care, housing, community development and education, supporting organisations and services to use Time Credits to achieve their outcomes. Spice grew out of the work of the Wales Institute for Community Currencies in the former mining districts of South Wales, UK.
Several Studies are done based on Spice Timebank or referenced this timebank. In a 2016 survey, based on a 1000 members of Spice timebank, 77% of respondents said Time Credits have had a positive impact on their quality of life, 42% reported that they learned a new skill and 30% reported that they have less need to go to doctor.

<text>The Covenanted Baptist Church of Canada is a small body of Predestinarian Baptists in Canada with Scottish roots.

==History==
In 1818 Dugald Campbell, of North Knapdale, Scotland emigrated to Canada and settled in Aldborough, Elgin County, Ontario. Campbell was a deacon in Scotland, but upon his arrival soon began preaching.

In 1820, Elder Dugald Campbell and his followers, believing the Regular Baptists of the area had departed from gospel faith and order, withdrew from them and constituted a church in Aldborough, now known as the &quot;Particular Covenanted Baptist Church in Canada&quot;. Still a small group, they had grown to five churches in the 1850s - Aldborough, Dunwich, Ekfird, Lobo, and Orford. The Covenanted Baptist Church did not fellowship with any other churches in North America, until an elder, Thomas McColl, received some issues of the &quot;Signs of the Times&quot;, a Primitive Baptist periodical published by Gilbert Beebe of New York City. In 1857 and 1858, McColl invited Primitive Baptists to visit and preach among their churches. The two groups saw they were established on the same faith and order, and began a relationship of fellowship one with another, which continued to the 20th century. The Covenanted Baptists held the doctrine of absolute predestination, and, after Primitive Baptists in the United States suffered division, remained in correspondence with the &quot;Absolute Predestinarian Primitive Baptists&quot;.

<text>Nervous Gender is an American punk rock electronic band formed in Los Angeles in 1978 by Gerardo Velazquez, Edward Stapleton, Phranc and Michael Ochoa.

Their use of heavily distorted keyboards and synthesizers made them, along with The Screamers, one of the original innovators of what is today called &quot;electropunk&quot;, although they could equally be considered an early industrial group. The group was confrontational and experimental.

Phranc&#x27;s androgynous appearance was the embodiment of the group&#x27;s name, garnered the band much press in zines such as &quot;Slash&quot; and, later, proving inspirational to founders of the queercore movement. Despite their somewhat high profile, the groups&#x27; habit of provoking the audience, obscene material and harsh erotics guaranteed they would never gain commercial acceptance. At their first show in 1979, a benefit for the Women&#x27;s Video Center, Phranc called the audience &quot;pussies&quot; and &quot;dykes&quot; when the band was requested to stop playing.

== History ==
The band were formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1978 by Gerardo Velazquez, Edward Stapleton, Phranc and Michael Ochoa. In 1979, Don Bolles of the Germs joined as drummer. The following year, Phranc left the band and Paul Roessler of the Screamers joined. At this time they recorded the tracks for the compilation &quot;Live at Target&quot;, released as an LP and a video, both seminal not only in the punk scene but also as early industrial recordings; fellow contributors Factrix and Z&#x27;EV (listed on this recording as &quot;UNS&quot;) were early industrial acts, and Nervous Gender found more acceptance among that scene initially. All the artists involved in &quot;Live at Target&quot; were experimenting with atonality, noise and concepts not common until post-punk groups emerged later. Nervous Gender played with bands such as SPK, Factrix, NON, Einstürzende Neubauten, and Psychic TV during the early 1980s.

In 1981 they released their LP &quot;Music from Hell&quot;, which included guest vocalist Alice Bag from Bags singing on &quot;Alice&#x27;s Song&quot;. Nervous Gender did not record in the studio again. After the LP came out, Paul Roessler moved to New York City to play with the Nina Hagen Band and was replaced by Bill Cline, and Don Bolles left the band to play with 45 Grave. He was replaced by an eight-year-old boy, Sven Pfeiffer. In 1982, Sven was deported alongside his mother and both returned to live in Germany. During their career Nervous Gender was called by one critic, &quot;...the thorn in the side of the L.A. music scene...&quot;

During the mid-1980s, the band was on the verge of breaking up when members of Wall of Voodoo Bruce Moreland, Marc Moreland and Chas Grey, who were fans, stepped in and offered to collaborate with them. It was at this point that a guitar-driven version of Nervous Gender emerged. During this time Dinah Cancer of 45 Grave was a frequent guest performer with them, and they played shows with bands such as Christian Death, Super Heroines, Kommunity FK and Gobsheit (a side project of Stapleton&#x27;s with Patrice Repose) at venues such as the Anti Club. In 1988, Edward Stapleton played his last show with the band.

In early 1990, original members Gerardo Velasquez and Michael Ochoa along with Joe Zinnato (a long time Ochoa collaborator) revived Nervous Gender as a trio. This formation did a series of 8 performances, and were working on what would have been the final Nervous Gender album (working title &quot;American Regime&quot;) with producer Paul B. Cutler (of 45 Grave). The final performance of Nervous Gender was on August 26, 1991, at Club A.S.S. in Silverlake, CA. Gerardo Velasquez died on March 28, 1992, at age 33.

After Gerardo&#x27;s death, members Ochoa and Zinnato, with the addition of singer Claire Lawrence – Slater (of Honeymoon Killers, Huge Killer Ships), formed &quot;HighHeelTitWig&quot; a punk-industrial-pop-grunge hybrid, which played a series of shows. In 1995 Joe Zinnato suffered a serious stroke which put an end to musical activities.

As of 2005, Edward Stapleton, Michael Ochoa and Joe Zinnato were reviewing all of the Nervous Gender material (studio, live and rehearsal recordings and performance videos) with an eye towards releasing a NG retrospective. At this time, Edward Stapleton (with Karene Stapleton) also recorded under the name Kali&#x27;s Thugs. In 2007 the band reformed with Stapleton, Ochoa, Zinnato and Tammy Fraser.

As of 2017, Edward Stapleton, and Matt Comeione, San Diego Mod and Cal Arts trained composer started Nervous Gender Reloaded. The duo released the album Milking the Borg in 2021.

2023 saw the release of an expanded reissue of the Music from Hell debut album on 2LP and CD.

<doc id="364147" wikidata="Q430259" url="?curid=364147" title="Gloster E.28/39">
<text>The Gloster E.28/39, (also referred to as the Gloster Whittle, Gloster Pioneer, or Gloster G.40) was the first British turbojet-engined aircraft first flying in 1941. It was the third turbojet aircraft to fly after the German Heinkel He 178 (1939) and Heinkel He 280 (1941), the Italian Caproni Campini N.1 of 1940 being a motor jet and not a true turbojet.

The E.28/39 was the product of a specification which had been issued by the Air Ministry for a suitable aircraft to test the novel jet propulsion designs that Frank Whittle had been developing during the 1930s. Gloster and the company&#x27;s chief designer, George Carter, worked with Whittle to develop an otherwise conventional aircraft fitted with a Power Jets W.1 turbojet engine. Flying for the first time on 15 May 1941, two E.28/39 aircraft were produced for the flight test programme. Following initial satisfactory reports, these aircraft continued to be flown to test increasingly refined engine designs and new aerodynamic features. Despite the loss of the second prototype, due to improper maintenance causing a critical aileron failure, the E.28/39 was considered to be a success.

The E.28/39 contributed valuable initial experience with the new type of propulsion and led to the development of the Gloster Meteor, the first operational jet fighter to enter service with the Allies. The first prototype continued test flying until 1944, after which it was withdrawn from service; in 1946, it was transferred to the Science Museum in London, where it has been on static display ever since; full-scale replicas have been created.

==Development==
===Background===

The development of the turbojet-powered E.28/39 was the product of a collaboration between the Gloster Aircraft Company and Sir Frank Whittle&#x27;s firm, Power Jets Ltd. Whittle formed Power Jets Ltd in March 1936 to develop his ideas of jet propulsion, Whittle himself serving as the company&#x27;s chief engineer. For several years, attracting financial backers and aviation firms prepared to take on Whittle&#x27;s radical ideas was difficult; in 1931, Armstrong-Siddeley had evaluated and rejected Whittle&#x27;s proposal, finding it to be technically sound but at the limits of engineering capability. Securing funding was a persistently worrying issue throughout the early development of the engine. The first Whittle prototype jet engine, the Power Jets WU, began running trials in early 1937; shortly afterwards, both Sir Henry Tizard, chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee, and the Air Ministry gave the project their support.

On 28 April 1939, Whittle made a visit to the premises of the Gloster Aircraft Company, where he met several key figures, such as George Carter, Gloster&#x27;s chief designer. Carter took a keen interest in Whittle&#x27;s project, particularly when he saw the operational Power Jets W.1 engine; Carter quickly made several rough proposals of various aircraft designs powered by the engine. Independently, Whittle had also been producing several proposals for a high-altitude jet-powered bomber; following the start of the Second World War and the Battle for France, a greater national emphasis on fighter aircraft arose. Power Jets and Gloster quickly formed a mutual understanding around mid-1939.

In September 1939, the Air Ministry issued a specification to Gloster for an aircraft to test one of Frank Whittle&#x27;s turbojet designs in flight. The E.28/39 designation originates from the aircraft having been developed in conformance with the 28th &quot;Experimental&quot; specification issued by the Air Ministry in 1939. The E.28/39 specification required the aircraft to carry two 0.303 in (7.62 mm) Browning machine guns in each wing, along with 2,000 rounds of ammunition, but these were never fitted. The second paragraph of the contract for the first aeroplane stated: &quot;The primary object of this aeroplane will be to flight test the engine installation, but the design shall be based on requirements for a fixed gun interceptor fighter as far as the limitations of size and weight imposed by the power unit permit. The armament equipment called for in this specification will not be required for initial trials but the contractor will be required to make provision in the design for the weight and space occupied by these items...&quot;

===Design effort===
Early on, Gloster&#x27;s chief designer, George Carter, worked closely with Whittle, and laid out a small low-wing aircraft of conventional configuration. The jet intake was located in the nose, while the single tail-fin and elevators were mounted above the jet-pipe, although due to uncertainty about the spinning characteristics of a jet aircraft, at an earlier design stage an alternative arrangement using twin fins and rudders was considered. Two jet pipe/rear fuselage arrangements were also originally considered, a normal fuselage with long jet-pipe and exhaust nozzle behind the tail, and a short fuselage and jet-pipe with the tail-plane supported on an extension boom. Flanagan highlights the advantage of a short jet-pipe as incurring a lower thrust loss. Buttler reports Gloster engineer Richard Walker considered a short fuselage would overcome structural, accessibility and maintenance difficulties and increase the maximum speed of the aircraft. Due to the unknown effects of the jet efflux on the boom-mounted tailplane, the long fuselage was selected. On 3 February 1940, a contract for two prototypes was signed by the Air Ministry.

Manufacture of the E.28/39 commenced at Brockworth near Gloucester and then moved to Regent Motors in Regent Street, Cheltenham (now the site of Regent Arcade), which was considered safer from bombing. Whittle was dissatisfied with the slowness of production, probably caused by the Battle of Britain as the area around nearby Coventry was subject to high levels of German bomber activity. In April 1941, the first of the E.28/39 prototypes was completed but a flight-worthy W.1A engine was not available and a ground-use only W.1X unit was assembled and installed for taxiing tests only.

While only two prototypes had been ordered, the operational philosophy was that, once the prototypes had proved the capabilities of the design, a more substantial programme would begin: even before the first flight of the E.28/39, this aircraft had been envisaged as being a considerably more elaborate twin-engined design, with all of the equipment required in a fighter aircraft. This aircraft, also produced by Gloster, became the Meteor, the first production jet-propelled aircraft to enter service with the Allies.

==Design==
The E.28/39 was a low-wing monoplane designed around the new jet engine. It was described as possessing a slightly tubby appearance as a result of a round fuselage. Due to the elimination of any risk that would have been posed by propeller tips striking the ground, the E.28/39 had an unusually short undercarriage for the era. It had a retractable undercarriage which was actuated by a hydraulic accumulator, with a manually-operated hand-pump to serve as a backup. Emergency actuation used compressed air. The flaps were also hydraulically actuated, using the hand-pump. Unusually, the nose wheel was steerable, using the rudder control, which aided in ground manoeuvring.

The E.28/39 was powered by a Power Jets W.1 turbojet engine behind the pilot and the fuel tank. The engine exhaust was directed through the centre of the fuselage, the jetpipe terminating about two feet behind the rudder. A nose air-intake led the air through bifurcated ducts around the cockpit. A fuel tank, containing up to 82 Imp gal (372.8 litres), was behind the cockpit, supposed to have been adopted as a countermeasure against the impact of negative g, which posed the risk of causing the engine to flame out, which was hard to re-light during flight.

The E.28/39 lacked features that would be expected for a fighter, such as a radio. The original engine was started using an Austin Seven car engine, connected by a flexible drive; it was replaced on the flight engine with an electric starter that used a ground-cart battery. The cockpit, which had a sliding canopy, had no pressurisation or any form of climate control, such as heating. Pilots were intended to wear electrically-heated flight suits but the lack of a generator and limited battery capacity, the latter being devoted to the automated sensors and recording devices that captured the results of each flight, meant this was not possible; pilots had to endure the cold cockpit.

==Testing==

Although the initial flight tests were relatively early in the Second World War, the German Heinkel He 178 had been first test-flown on 27 August 1939, at Rostock-Marienehe on the Baltic Coast, days before the outbreak of the war.

The E.28/39 was delivered to Brockworth for ground tests beginning on 7 April 1941, using a non-flightworthy version of the Power Jets W.1 engine. Frank Whittle, who had been an RAF flying instructor and test pilot before specializing in engineering, did taxi runs on the grass airfield up to and Gloster&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot, Flight Lieutenant Gerry Sayer did further taxi tests before becoming airborne for , which he repeated two more times.

Following the completion of these ground tests, the aircraft was fitted with a flightworthy engine rated for 10 hours use, and then partially dismantled and transported to RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire which had a long runway and no high ground in the vicinity. On 15 May 1941, Gerry Sayer flew the aircraft under jet power for the first time, in a flight lasting 17 minutes. In this first series of test flights, a maximum true speed of was attained, in level flight at and 17,000 turbine revolutions per minute. Tests continued with increasingly refined versions of the engine. Small, auxiliary fins were added near the tips of the tailplanes to provide additional stability in high-speed flight. John Grierson, in 1971, called these &quot;end-plates&quot; and wrote that their purpose was to increase the fin area due to the problem of rudder blanking in a side-slip. On 21 October 1942, Sayer disappeared during a flight in a Hawker Typhoon, presumed killed in a collision and his assistant, Michael Daunt, took over testing of the E.28/39. The oil system had been changed before he flew: after it was proven, the aircraft then being handed over to the RAE for testing by service pilots.

The second prototype E.28/39 (&quot;W4046&quot;) – initially powered by a Power Jets W.2 engine – joined the test programme on 1 March 1943. Flying of &quot;W4046&quot; was by Gloster test pilots John Grierson and John Crosby Warren, because Michael Daunt was then involved with the F.9/40 (which would enter service as the Gloster Meteor). Testing revealed problems with engine oil and lubricants. In April 1943, &quot;W4046&quot; flew to Hatfield for a demonstration in front of the Prime Minister and members of the Air Staff. It was taken to Farnborough and fitted with a W2.B and achieved 466 mph. On 30 July 1943, while on a high-altitude test flight, the second prototype was destroyed in a crash resulting from an aileron failure. The accident was attributed to the use of the wrong type of grease in the aileron controls; one aileron was &quot;stuck in position, sending the aircraft out of control&quot;. The test pilot, Squadron Leader Douglas Davie, bailed out from , suffering frostbite on the way down.

The first prototype was fitted with the thrust W2/500 and was flown to , but level speed at altitude was not attempted, due to fuel shortage. The pilot commented in his report on a need for cockpit heating and a larger fuel tank. The aircraft continued flight tests until 1944. By that time, more advanced turbojet-powered aircraft were available. The Gloster E.28/39 was later able to achieve high speeds, the highest being at with a W.2/700 engine and it proved to be a useful experimental aircraft with a &quot;good climb rate and ceiling&quot;. Experience with the E.28/39 paved the way for Britain&#x27;s first operational jet fighter aircraft, the Gloster Meteor. The Meteor was powered by two Rolls-Royce Welland engines, which was the next stage in development from the Power Jets W.1.

==Surviving aircraft==
In 1946, the first prototype (&quot;W4041&quot;) was placed in the Science Museum in Central London, where it is exhibited today in the Flight Gallery. A full-size replica has been placed on an obelisk on a roundabout near the northern perimeter of Farnborough Airfield in Hampshire, as a memorial to Sir Frank Whittle. A similar full-size model is on display in the middle of a roundabout at Lutterworth in Leicestershire, where the aircraft&#x27;s engine was produced.

A full-scale model taken from the same moulds, with authentic paint scheme and detailing, has been built by members of the Jet Age Museum in Gloucestershire. It has been on display in Brockworth, Gloucester, Kemble (at both the Kemble Air Day and the MVT Show), and formed part of the display for the Sir Frank Whittle Centenary commemorations at RAF Cranwell in June 2007.
