<text>The &quot;National Anthem of the Isle of Man&quot; (, ) was written and composed by William Henry Gill (1839–1923), with the Manx translation by John J. Kneen (1873–1939). It is often referred to by its incipit, &quot;O Land of Our Birth&quot; (, ).

==History==
It is sung to an adaptation of the traditional Manx melody of &quot;Mylecharaine’s March&quot;, which had been described as the &quot;Manx national melody&quot; long before Gill&#x27;s composition. The words that originally accompanied the melody date to around 1800 and concern the impoverishment of a father to pay a dowry. However, those curious words have been identified as disparate pieces of older songs amalgamated together incompletely. The first verse of the song is: &quot;&quot; (O Mylecharaine, where did you get your store? / Did I not get it in the Curragh, deep, deep enough? / Alone you left me&quot;).

First performed at the Manx Music Festival on 21 March 1907, there are eight verses in total in the modern anthem, but only the first verse is usually sung. The anthem was given official status by the Isle of Man&#x27;s legislature, Tynwald, on 22 January 2003, with &quot;God Save the King&quot; being designated as the royal anthem. The National Anthem is used on official and ceremonial occasions and in schools; the Royal Anthem is normally reserved for use additionally on those occasions when the Sovereign, members of the Royal Family, or the Lieutenant Governor are present.

The traditional song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Isle of Man&quot;) had up to that point vied to be an equal unofficial national anthem, and had been re-popularized by a 1997 Bee Gees recording of it released as a single.

<text>D.N.Angel (stylized as D•N•ANGEL) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yukiru Sugisaki. The manga premiered in Japan in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; in November 1997. After two extended hiatuses the series concluded in 2021. Kadokawa Shoten has collected the individual chapters and published them in 15 and 5 e-books. The manga series is licensed for English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop, which has released 13 volumes of the series as of 2011.

The story follows an average middle schooler named Daisuke Niwa, who, upon being rejected by his crush, unexpectedly awakens his phantom thief alter ego Dark Mousy. He then realizes that the transformation he undergoes is an inherited trait shared by all the males in his family, and that his mission is to collect and purify the stolen pieces of art of which Dark seeks to maintain from evil.

Xebec adapted the manga into a 26-episode anime series which aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3, 2003, until September 25, 2003. The anime was later adapted into second two volume manga series, a PlayStation 2 video game, and a series of drama CDs.

==Plot==

&quot;D.N.Angel&quot; follows the adventures of Daisuke Niwa, an average teenage boy. At the story&#x27;s opening, Daisuke declares love for his crush, a girl named Risa Harada, on his fourteenth birthday. She rejects him, and later that day, the heart-broken Daisuke undergoes a strange mutation that changes him into another person. He is told calmly by his mother Emiko that, because of a strange genetic condition, all the males in Daisuke&#x27;s family gain the countenance of Dark Mousy, a famous phantom thief. The transformation occurs every time Daisuke has romantic feelings for his crush or whenever he thinks too long about her. Dark changes back into Daisuke the same way. Daisuke is forced to keep his family&#x27;s secret and control his alter ego, Dark (whom Risa, Daisuke&#x27;s crush, has fallen for), while dashing his way out of being caught by the commander of the police. Daisuke learns that in order to return to normality, he must have his unrequited love returned.

The aforementioned commander of the police is a classmate of Daisuke&#x27;s named Satoshi Hiwatari. Hiwatari suffers from his own version of the phantom-thief curse, and a bond forms between Hiwatari and Daisuke because of their similar afflictions. Hiwatari carries the alter-ego named Krad. However, though Dark and Krad hate one another, Hiwatari and Daisuke maintain a strained but genuine friendship, despite Dark&#x27;s constant moaning. Dark steals certain artistic objects of value, works made by Satoshi&#x27;s ancestors, because they contain dangerous magical properties. Some of them, such as &quot;The Second Hand of Time&quot; and &quot;Argentine&quot; also have personalities of their own. Some of the objects that he steals are quite dangerous. Dark&#x27;s method of stealing is based on garnering attention; before stealing, Emiko will send out a warning of what will be stolen.

==Media==

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Yukiru Sugisaki, &quot;D.N.Angel&quot; premiered in Japan in the November 1997 issue of the Kadokawa Shoten magazine &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;. New chapters were serialized monthly until Sugisaki put the series on an extended hiatus after the August 2005 issue. The series eventually returned to serialization, starting in the April 2008 issue of &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;. In 2011 the series went on another extended hiatus and resumed on May 24, 2018. The final chapter was published on the March 2021 issue of &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;, released on January 22, 2021. The individual chapters are collected and published in &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kadokawa Shoten. The first volume was released on November 13, 1997; a total of 20 volumes have been released.

Tokyopop licensed the series for an English-language release in North America and the United Kingdom, with the first volume of the series released there on April 6, 2004. On November 8, 2005, Tokyopop released a box set containing the first two volumes of the series. A total of 13 volumes have been translated and released as of December 8, 2009. However, Tokyopop announced that its North American division would close on May 31, 2011, leaving the fate of the manga&#x27;s localization in question. In 2014, Viz Media picked up the digital publication rights to the manga for Kindle.

In August 2003, while the primary series was on hiatus, a second manga series, &quot;D.N.Angel TV Animation Series&quot; began serialization in &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;. Also written by Sugisaki, the short series was based on the anime adaptation, which had diverged from the storyline of the manga series. &quot;D.N.Angel TV Animation Series&quot; finished its serialization in the October 2003 issue. It was published in two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kadokawa Shoten.

On March 24, 2018, &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; announced that the series would return in their May issue, with details to come after the June issue.

===Anime===

&quot;D.N.Angel&quot; was adapted into a 26-episode anime series produced by TV Tokyo, Dentsu and Xebec which aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3 to September 25, 2003. The series was directed by Koji Yoshikawa and Nobuyoshi Habara.

The series was originally licensed for release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films. While in the UK the series is no longer licensed, in North America Discotek Media have announced the rescue-licensing of the series. The series is licensed in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment.

Five pieces of theme music are used in the anime adaptation. The song , by Shunichi Miyamoto, is used for the opening for twenty four episodes. Vic Mignogna, the English voice actor for Dark Mousy, covered the opening for the English dub. For the ending theme, is used for the first twelve episodes, and is used for episodes 13-23 and episode 25. Both songs are performed by Minawo. Episode 24 uses the song &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, by Shunichi Miyamoto, for its ending, while the final episode of the series uses Miyamoto&#x27;s song .

===Video game===
A PlayStation 2 video game, , was published by Takara. The game was released in Japan on September 25, 2003, to coincide with the conclusion of the anime adaptation. However, the game storyline is closer to the manga, and even mentions past events from the manga that would make it inconsistent with the anime.

===Drama CDs===
A trilogy of drama CDs called &quot;D.N.Angel Wink&quot; was released in 1999 between March and December. Some of the scenes follow the manga word-for-word, while others have either minor differences or do not appear in the manga at all. The first CD is called &quot;Target: Sleeping Beauty&quot; and was released on March 5, 1999. The second is &quot;2nd Target: Love Sick&quot; and was released on November 17, 1999. The third is &quot;3rd Target: Love Pleasure&quot; and was released on December 15, 1999. There is another CD, &quot;A Legend of a Vampire&quot; that uses the same voice cast as the &quot;Wink&quot; dramas, though it doesn&#x27;t relate to the manga. This CD was released in 2001. The plot centers around Daisuke&#x27;s alter ego, Dark, being a vampire. Krad, who wasn&#x27;t in the &quot;Wink&quot; dramas, also made an appearance in this CD.

There were also two drama CDs released after the anime titled &quot;Sweet&quot; and &quot;Cute&quot;. These CDs use the anime voice actors and are based on the anime with events taking place just before its ending. They also include parodies of scenes in the anime.

===Novels===
Three novels were released in Japan between March and October 2000 and were re-released in September 2001. The titles are , , and . Although there was an ad for them left in Tokyopop&#x27;s translation of the fourth manga volume, they have not been licensed, so little is known about them.

===Radio program===
A series of seven broadcasts aired Japan in 2005 called &quot;Decade on Net: Radio D.N.Angel&quot;. It was hosted by Miyu Irino and Akira Ishida, who voiced Daisuke Niwa and Satoshi Hiwatari, respectively.

<doc id="358175" wikidata="Q806832" url="?curid=358175" title="Bankside Power Station">
<text>Bankside Power Station is a decommissioned electricity generating station located on the south bank of the River Thames, in the Bankside area of the Borough of Southwark, London. It generated electricity from 1891 to 1981. It was also used as a training base for electrical and mechanical student apprenticeships from all over the country. Since 2000 the building has housed the Tate Modern art museum and gallery.

== Pioneer station ==
The pioneer Bankside power station was built at Meredith Wharf Bankside in 1891. It was owned and operated by the City of London Electric Lighting Company (CLELCo) and supplied electricity to the City and to part of north Southwark. The generating equipment was installed by the Brush Electrical Engineering Company and comprised two pairs of 25 kW Brush arc-lighters and two 100 kW single phase alternators generating at 2 kV and 100 Hz. This equipment first supplied direct current (DC) electricity to arc lamp street lights in Queen Victoria Street on 25 June 1891. Alternating current (AC) for domestic and commercial consumers was first supplied on 14 December 1891, this was a single-phase, 100 Hz, three-wire, 204/102 volt system. Electricity cables were carried over Southwark bridge and Blackfriars bridge.

== Bankside A, 1893–1959 ==
The power station, later known as Bankside A, was extended several times as the demand for electricity grew.

An engine room, 230 ft (70 m) long and 50 ft (15 m) wide, was built in 1893 with two 200 kW, two 350 kW and two 400 kW alternators driven by Willans engines. The associated boiler house was the same length and had nine Babcock and Wilcox boilers. In 1895 the engine room was extended to 424 ft (129 m) and the boiler house to 300 ft (91 m) containing 22 boilers.

In 1899 there were 30 sets of plant, the largest being capable of giving an output of 1,500 kilowatts, or about 2,500 indicated horse - power.

A DC supply for the printing presses of Fleet Street was provided from a DC power house at Bankside built in 1900. The DC plant consisted of 3 x Allis-Westinghouse 1,000kW and 2 x Musgrave-Westinghouse 2,000kW dynamos.

In 1901 the boiler house was doubled in width and contained 46 boilers. In the engine room there were ten British Thomson-Houston alternators directly coupled to three-crank Willans engines, eight Brush alternators with a capacity of 3,600 kW driven by two-cylinder compound Brush engines, and two Ferranti compound engines driving 1,500 kW alternators at 150 RPM, making an aggregate capacity of 10,500 kW. By 1907 the capacity of the station was 25,500 kW with 15,000 kW being DC machinery.

The first 2,500 kW turbo-alternator was installed in December 1910 and a second in January 1911, others followed at nearly yearly intervals. By 1920 there were seven turbo-alternators with an aggregate capacity of 19,500 kW. Until 1919 the system of generation was 2 kV, single-phase AC, and 450 V DC, this was changed that year to 11 kV, three-phase AC. The steam conditions were also increased from 150 psi to 250 psi with superheat to .

Over the period 1921–1928 a new boiler house was built alongside the east face of the power house. This had 18 boilers. The coal strike of 1921 led to six of the boilers being specified for oil firing, although two of these were later returned to coal firing. The old boiler house and its three 150 ft (46 m) chimneys were demolished.

In 1934 Bankside was connected to London ring of the National Grid and became a &#x27;selected&#x27; station under the operational control of the Central Electricity Board.

=== Equipment at Bankside A ===
Following construction of new boiler house in 1921–1928, the steam plant at Bankside A throughout the remainder of its operational life comprised: twelve Babcock 50,000 lb/hr boilers (four oil-fired, eight coal-fired chain grate); four coal-fired Yarrow 65,000 lb/hr boilers; and two coal-fired Yarrow 70,000 lb/hr boilers. The operating pressure was 260 psi at 600-700 °F. The total evaporative capacity was 850,000 lb/hr. Condenser cooling water was drawn from the river Thames through a pump house located on the river bank at 7,800,000 gallons per hour.

At its peak in the 1930s the generating equipment comprised: one 5 MW, five 10 MW, two 15 MW Oerlikon and British Thomson-Houston turbo-alternators, and one Parsons 4 MW house service set (450-500 V), total capacity 89 MW. Some of the older plant was decommissioned. By 1952 the plant comprised one 5 MW and two 10 MW Oerlikon turbo-alternators, two 10 MW and two 15 MW B.T.H. turbo-alternators and one Parsons 4 MW set.

=== Complaints ===
There were numerous complaints against the power station throughout its operational life. In October 1901 the CLELCo paid the Corporation of Southwark £250 () in settlement of the costs of the corporation taking a smoke nuisance action against the company. In January 1903 the company was fined £20 () plus costs for &quot;creating smoke&quot;. The CLELCo challenged some of these nuisance actions. In May 1910 an officer of the Public Control Department of the London County Council stated that he had observed black smoke issuing from the centre chimney and &quot;in such volumes as to constitute a nuisance&quot;. This was contested by the company which said the information was inaccurate, since this was after sunset &quot;any vapour or gas would assume a dark appearance […] and the absence of light would not ensure accuracy&quot;.

The London County Council undertook tests to measure the deposition of grit in the area during the summer of 1950. They estimated that up to 235 tons per square mile of grit was deposited in the area from Bankside ‘A’ power station during the month of September 1950.

=== Renewal and nationalisation ===
By the late 1930s Bankside was considered inefficient (in 1946 the thermal efficiency was 15.82%), old and polluting. Preliminary plans were drawn up by the CEB for a new power station, Bankside B, but World War II delayed any further redevelopment.

On 1 April 1948 the British electricity industry was nationalised, Bankside was vested in the British Electricity Authority and the electricity distribution system radiating from the power station was vested in the London Electricity Board. Bankside A was decommissioned in March 1959 and was demolished to allow the eastern end of Bankside B to be built.

== Bankside B, 1947–1981 ==
The redevelopment of Bankside power station, suspended during the war, was started again by the City of London Electric Lighting Company in 1944. It developed plans for a new power station with an ultimate capacity of 300 MW and submitted these to the planning authority the London County Council in 1944. It was a highly controversial proposal as it continued industrialisation of the South Bank which the 1943 County of London Plan had sought to redevelop with offices, flats and educational and cultural institutions. The new Bankside B power station was approved by the British Cabinet in April 1947. The designation Bankside A and Bankside B was only used when both stations co-existed during the period 1947–1959.

The building was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the designer of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, many of the K-series red telephone boxes, and an important consultant credited with designing the Art-deco exterior of Battersea Power Station. Bankside is a long, 73 m (240 ft) wide, steel framed, brick-clad building with a central chimney high. The chimney&#x27;s height was less than that of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which is directly opposite, but set back from, the north bank of the Thames. The plan of the building was divided into three sections—the 85 ft (26 m) high main turbine hall in the centre, with the boiler house to the north and the electricity transformers and switch house to the south. Bankside B was set-back from the riverfront to allow the boulevard proposed in the County of London Plan to be developed at a later date.

Bankside B was designed to be coal-fired but, following a coal and power shortage in early 1947, was redesigned to be oil-fired (the first such power station in Britain). Bunker &#x27;C&#x27; oil was delivered by barge from the Shell Haven refinery on the Thames estuary to three large underground tanks to the south of the building. Each tank was 28 m in diameter, 7.3 m high and held 4,000 tons of oil. The oil consumption of the station at full load was 67 tons per hour.

Construction work was undertaken in two phases: 1947–1952 and 1958–1963. This allowed the old Bankside A to continue in operation while the new power station was built. The western half of the building, plus the chimney, was completed first and started generating power in 1952 from four boilers and two 60 MW turbo-alternators. Bankside A was decommissioned in March 1959 and construction started on the eastern portion. This was completed December 1963 and generated electricity from one further boiler, and one 120 MW and one 60 MW turbo-alternator. The maximum total generating capacity of Bankside B was 300 MW.

=== Equipment at Bankside B ===
The specification of the boiler plant at Bankside B was as follows.

Condenser cooling water was taken from the River Thames at 10 million gallons per hour (1.07 million m3/day). The temperature rise of the cooling water across the condensers was 15 °F (8.5 °C).

The specification of generating equipment at Bankside B was as follows.

The 120 MW turbo-alternator was in the top 20 of the most efficient of UK electricity generators between 1963–73.

The alternators were connected to 66 kV 3-phase delta-star transformers. The main 66 kV switchgear, rated at 2,500 MVA, was on the three upper floors of the switch-house: the circuit breakers on the upper floor, the selector switches below and the bus-bars on the lower floor. Two 66 kV cables ran to Battersea power station, and two to Deptford power station. Ten 22 kV cables and twelve 11 kV cables distributed to various sub-stations of the London Electricity Board.

==== Flue-gas washing ====
Bankside B had a flue-gas washing plant to mitigate air pollution at its central London location. Only two British power stations had previously been fitted with such equipment: Battersea power station and Fulham power station. At Bankside flue-gases from the boilers were washed with a three-pass counter-current/co-current flow of river water from the Thames (to which chalk was added) in cedar wood scrubber towers. This process produced a characteristic white plume from the chimney. The plant was effective at removing sulphur compounds from the flue-gases (over its operational life it achieved an overall average sulphur removal efficiency of 97.2%). However, the process cooled the gases which caused ‘plume-droop’ under certain atmospheric conditions, causing a fume nuisance at ground level. Contaminated water from the flue-gas washing plant was treated in tanks through which air was bubbled; this oxidised the sulphite to sulphate, the water was diluted with water from the condensers before being returned to the river. This pollution was insignificant in the 1950s but was detrimental to the recovery of the Thames after concerted efforts were made to clean up the river from the late 1960s.

==== District heating ====
In 1971 the London Electricity Board gained legal powers to develop a district heating scheme at Bankside. A boiler house was constructed on the north face of the building at the base of the chimney together with underground pipes in Tooley Street. The scheme was abandoned following the fuel crisis of 1973–1974.

=== Generating capacity and output ===
The total output of Bankside B for selected years over its operational life was as follows.

On 8 October 1970 the station produced 6,004,364 kWh in a 24-hour period.

Rising oil prices from 1973 made the station uneconomic compared to coal-fired power stations, resulting in it being used less often – principally during the winter and at peak times. One of the 60 MW units was decommissioned in 1976 and the two other 60 MW units in 1978. The 120 MW unit was derated to 100 MW. Bankside B was closed on 31 October 1981.

==Redevelopment==
Following its closure there were several proposals to redevelop the redundant power station or its site. These included an industrial museum, an entertainment hall, a hotel, an opera house, and a conference and exhibition centre, but none were financially viable. There were also campaigns for the building to be saved. The group Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage visited Bankside in May 1980 and produced a report on possible uses. Applications to list the building in 1987 and 1992 were refused. The government wished to sell the site and listing would have constrained how developers could intervene in the fabric of the building. Bankside was given a &#x27;Certificate of immunity from listing&#x27; on 3 February 1993.

At the privatisation of the British electricity industry in 1990 the power station was transferred to Nuclear Electric. The company prepared the building for sale by removing asbestos and the redundant machinery at a cost of £2.5 million. An application was made to demolish the west wall of the building to enable this to be done, but contractors were able to remove the plant through a hole in the west wall. The BBC television programme &quot;One Foot in the Past&quot; focused on the impending threat to the building; the reporter, Gavin Stamp, made an impassioned plea for the building to be saved.

In April 1994 the Tate Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. The £134 million conversion started in June 1995 with the removal of the remaining redundant plant. The conversion work was carried out by Carillion and completed in January 2000. Some of the internal structure remains, including the turbine hall. An electrical substation, taking up the southern part of the building, remained on-site and was owned by the French power company EDF Energy. In 2006, EDF announced that they would be releasing half this holding to the museum. The oil tanks were redeveloped into a performance art space opened in July 2012. A tower extension to the museum over the tanks was opened on 17 June 2016.

==Film and television==
Several episodes of British television, particularly science fiction series that have required industrial backdrops, such as &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, were filmed at the station. The building featured in Danny Cannon&#x27;s film &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. It served as the Tower of London in Richard Loncraine&#x27;s 1995 film version of &quot;Richard III&quot;. In its modern incarnation as the Tate Modern, the building&#x27;s exterior is featured at the beginning of the first episode of &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. It also appeared in &quot;Children of Men&quot; by Alfonso Cuarón. In 2018, Tate Modern was featured prominently in the Tom Cruise blockbuster, &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="358176" wikidata="Q127676" url="?curid=358176" title="Trøndelag">
<text>Trøndelag (; or is a county and coextensive with the Trøndelag region (also known as &quot;Midt-Norge&quot; or &quot;Midt-Noreg,&quot; &quot;Mid-Norway&quot;) in the central part of Norway. It was created in 1687, then named Trondhjem County (); in 1804 the county was split into Nord-Trøndelag and Sør-Trøndelag by the King of Denmark-Norway, and the counties were reunited in 2018 after a vote of the two counties in 2016.

The largest city in Trøndelag is the city of Trondheim. The administrative centre is Steinkjer, while Trondheim functions as the office of the county mayor. Both cities serve the office of the county governor; however, Steinkjer houses the main functions.

Trøndelag county and the neighbouring Møre og Romsdal county together form what is known as Central Norway. A person from Trøndelag is called a &quot;trønder&quot;. The dialect spoken in the area, trøndersk, is characterized by dropping out most vowel endings; see apocope.

Trøndelag is one of the most fertile regions of Norway, with large agricultural output. The majority of the production ends up in the Norwegian cooperative system for meat and milk, but farm produce is a steadily growing business.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was &#x27;. The first element is the genitive plural of &#x27; which means &quot;person from Trøndelag&quot;, while the second is &#x27; (plural of &#x27; which means &quot;law; district/people with a common law&quot; (compare Danelaw, Gulaþingslǫg and Njarðarlǫg). A parallel name for the same district was &#x27; which means &quot;the homeland (heim) of the &#x27;&quot;. &quot;Þróndheimr&quot; may be older since the first element has a stem form without umlaut.

The county and national governments have also approved a Southern Sami name for the county: . When it is used with the word for county, it is .

==History==
People have lived in this region for thousands of years. In the early iron-age Trøndelag was divided into several petty kingdoms called &quot;fylki&quot;. The different &quot;fylki&quot; had a common law, and an early parliament or thing. It was called Frostating and was held at the Frosta peninsula. By some, this is regarded as the first real democracy.

In the time after Håkon Grjotgardsson (838-900), Trøndelag was ruled by the Jarl of Lade. Lade is located in the eastern part of Trondheim, bordering the Trondheimsfjord. The powerful Jarls of Lade continued to play a very significant political role in Norway up to 1030.

Jarls of Lade (&quot;Ladejarl&quot;) were:
* Håkon Grjotgardsson, the first jarl of Lade.
* Sigurd Håkonsson, son of Håkon. Killed by Harald Greyhide.
* Håkon Sigurdsson, son of Sigurd. Conspired with Harald Bluetooth against Harald Greyhide, and subsequently became vassal of Harald Bluetooth, and in reality independent ruler of Norway. After the arrival of Olaf Trygvason, Håkon quickly lost all support and was killed by his own slave, Tormod Kark, in 995.
* Eirik Håkonsson, son of Håkon. Together with his brother, Svein, governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1000 to 1012.
* Håkon Eiriksson, son of Eirik. Governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1012 to 1015.
Trøndelag (together with parts of Møre og Romsdal) was briefly ceded in 1658 to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde and was ruled by king Charles X until it was returned to Denmark-Norway after the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660. During that time, the Swedes conscripted 2,000 men in Trøndelag, forcing young boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting against Poland and Brandenburg. Charles X feared the Trønders would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away. Only about one-third of the men ever returned to their homes; some of them were forced to settle in the then Swedish Duchy of Estonia, as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Trønders there, utilising the ancient maxim of divide and rule.

In the fall of 1718, during the Great Northern War, General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt was ordered by king Charles XII of Sweden to lead a Swedish army of 10,000 men into Trøndelag to take Trondheim. Because of his poor supply lines back to Sweden, Armfeldt&#x27;s army had to live off the land, causing great suffering to the people of the region. Armfeldt&#x27;s campaign failed: the defenders of Trondheim succeeded in repelling his siege. After Charles XII was killed in the siege of Fredriksten in Norway&#x27;s southeast, Armfeldt was ordered back into Sweden. During the ensuing retreat, his 6,000 surviving threadbare and starving Caroleans were caught in a fierce blizzard. Thousands of Caroleans froze to death in the Norwegian mountains, and hundreds more were crippled for life.
==Government==

The county is governed by the Trøndelag County Municipality. The town of Steinkjer is the seat of the county governor and county administration. However, both the county governor and Trøndelag County Municipality also have offices in Trondheim.

The county oversees the 41 upper secondary schools, including nine private schools. Six of the schools have more than 1000 students: four in Trondheim plus the Steinkjer Upper Secondary School and the Ole Vig Upper Secondary School in Stjørdalshalsen. The county has ten Folk high schools, with an eleventh folk high school being possibly being opened in Røros, with a possible start in 2019.

===Districts===
The county is often sub-divided into several geographical regions:
* Namdal, the greater Namsen river valley
* Fosen, the Fosen peninsula and surrounding areas
* Innherred, the areas surrounding the inner Trondheimsfjorden
* Stjørdalen, the Stjørdalen valley
* Trondheim Region, the areas surrounding the large city of Trondheim
* Gauldalen, the Gaula river valley
* Orkdalen, the Orkla river valley

===Towns and cities===
There are ten towns/cities in Trøndelag, plus the &quot;mining town&quot; of Røros.
*Trondheim (in Trondheim Municipality)
*Steinkjer (in Steinkjer Municipality)
*Stjørdalshalsen (in Stjørdal Municipality)
*Levanger (in Levanger Municipality)
*Namsos (in Namsos Municipality)
*Rørvik (in Nærøysund Municipality)
*Verdalsøra (in Verdal Municipality)
*Orkanger (in Orkdal Municipality)
*Brekstad (in Ørland Municipality)
*Kolvereid (in Nærøy Municipality)
*Bergstaden Røros (in Røros Municipality)

== Geography ==
Along the coast in the southwest are the largest islands in Norway south of the Arctic Circle, including Hitra and Frøya. The broad and long Trondheimsfjord is a main feature, and the lowland surrounding the fjord are among the most important agricultural areas in Norway. In the far south is the mountain ranges Dovrefjell and Trollheimen, and in the southeast is highlands and mountain plateaus, and this is where Røros is situated. The highest mountain is the tall Storskrymten, which is located in the county border between Møre og Romsdal, Innlandet, and Trøndelag. North of the Trondheimsfjord is the large Fosen peninsula, where Ørland Municipality is at its southwestern tip. Several valleys runs north or west to meet the fjord, with a river at its centre, such as Meldal, Gauldal, Stjørdal, Verdal. Further north is the long Namdalen with the largest river, Namsen, and Namsos is situated where the river meets the Namsen fjord. The rivers are among the best salmon rivers in Europe, especially Namsen, Gaula, and Orkla. On the northwestern part of the region is the Vikna archipelago with almost 6,000 islands and islets.

There are many national parks in the region, including Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park, Forollhogna National Park, Skarvan and Roltdalen National Park, Femundsmarka National Park and Børgefjell National Park.

== Climate ==
Trøndelag is one of the regions in Norway with the largest climatic variation - from the oceanic climate with mild and wetter winters along the coast to the very cold winters in the southeast inland highlands, where Røros is the only place in southern and central Norway to have recorded . The first overnight freeze (temperature below in autumn on average is August 24th in Røros, October 9th at Trondheim Airport Værnes, and as late as November 20th at Sula in Frøya. Most of the lowland areas near the fjords have a humid continental climate (or oceanic if -3C is used as winter threshold), while the most oceanic areas along the coast have a temperate oceanic climate with all monthly means above . The inland valleys, hills, and highlands below the treeline have a boreal climate with cold winters and shorter summers, but still with potential for warm summer temperatures. Above the treeline is alpine tundra.
&lt;br&gt;
=== Trøndelag ===
There are 38 municipalities in Trøndelag.

===Other municipalities===
Kristiansund Municipality in Møre og Romsdal held a referendum on 17 January 2022 on whether to move from Møre og Romsdal to Trøndelag, which was rejected; 36.77% voted to move, while 63.23% voted to stay. Similar referendums were hosted and rejected the preceding autumn in Aure Municipality on 13 September 2021 (45% to move, 51% to stay), and in Smøla Municipality on 26 September 2021 (27.24% to move, 70.23% to stay).

Bindal Municipality in Nordland was originally decreed by Stortinget on 8 June 2017 to become part of Nærøysund (and thus become part of Trøndelag), but the decision was reversed after another hearing on 21 November 2017, well in advance of Nærøysund becoming a municipality on 1 January 2020.

==Culture==
===Arts===
The region&#x27;s official theatre is the Trøndelag Teater in Trondheim. At Stiklestad in Verdal Municipality, the historical play called The Saint Olav Drama has been played each year since 1954. It depicts the last days of Saint Olaf.

Jazz on a very high level is frequently heard in Trondheim, due to the high-level jazz education in Trondheim at Institutt for musikk (NTNU). Trondheim is also the national centre of rock music; the popular music museum Rockheim opened there in 2010. Trøndelag is known for its local variety of rock music, often performed in local dialect, called &quot;trønderrock&quot;.

Several institutions are nationally funded, including the internationally acclaimed Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, Trondheim Soloists, Olavsfestdagene and Trondheim Chamber Music Festival.

===Food and drink===
The region is popularly known for its moonshine homebrew, called heimbrent or heimert. Although officially prohibited, the art of producing as pure homemade spirits as possible still has a strong following in parts of Trøndelag. Traditionally the spirit is served mixed with coffee to create a drink called karsk. The strength of the coffee varies, often on a regional basis. The mixing proportions also depend on the strength of the spirit with more coffee being used for spirit with higher alcohol content. In southern regions, people tend to use strong filter coffee, while in the north they typically serve karsk with as weak coffee as possible.

The &quot;official dish&quot; of the region is sodd which is made from diced sheep or beef meat and meatballs in boiled stock.

===Sports===
Association football and handball are widely played and watched throughout the county. As of 26 January 2024, teams in tier 1 through 3 in men&#x27;s football include Rosenborg BK, Ranheim Fotball, Levanger FK, IL Stjørdals-Blink, and Strindheim IL. Tier 1 through 3 in women&#x27;s football include Rosenborg BK Kvinner, KIL/Hemne, and Tiller IL.

In men&#x27;s handball, tier 1 and 2 include Kolstad Håndball, Melhus IL, and Charlottenlund SK, while in women&#x27;s handball, tier 1 and 2 include Byåsen HE and &quot;Levanger Håndballklubb&quot;.

Fosenhallen outside Botngård in southwestern Fosen, is Norway&#x27;s only full-size speed skating hall north of Hamar. While the hall has never hosted a top level senior ISU Speed Skating World Cup event, it has frequently hosted Norwegian championships and junior world tour events.

The final two stages of the 2022 Arctic Race of Norway were held within the county, as were the Norwegian road racing championships in 2010, 2017, and 2022. Trondheim is also the starting point of the Styrkeprøven ≥500km endurance road race held most years since 1967, which heads down European route E6 through Trøndelag until Hjerkinn, after which point the race heads down to Oslo or just north of Oslo.

Hitra Municipality and Frøya Municipality compete in the Island Games, though Norwegian press coverage outside the islands about their participations are virtually non-existent.

==Agriculture==

Trøndelag is covered with fertile lands, especially the lowlands surrounding the Korsfjord, Trondheimsfjord, Borgenfjord, and Beitstadfjord. Trøndelag is the third largest county in Norway by agricultural land with its , and has the second highest meat-output with a total of almost in 2022. The county also houses the most milking-cows, and thereby has the highest milk output, with Steinkjer Municipality producing the most.

In 2018, Trøndelag was the largest provider of beef, chicken, milk and eggs in Norway. Trøndelag provided 21.1% of all milk production, 18.9% of all beef, 28.7% of all chicken, 23.5% of all eggs, 13.2% of cereals, and 23.2% of all hay produced in Norway. Trøndelag is very much a rural county, housing merely 8.7% of Norway&#x27;s population.

===Domestic Breeds===
Trøndelag is the origin of multiple animal breeds, the best known being Grey Troender sheep and Sided Troender cattle (STN).

Sided Troender cattle, as the name implies, is a white cow with coloured sides. It is based on &quot;Rørosfe&quot; from the Røros area, but later merged with the less standardized Nordland cattle. Together they are viewed as one breed with roots in both Trøndelag and Nordland, and has been since the 1920s. The breed standards are based on the original Trønder standards rather than the looser Nordland standards, with some cows being red, prioritizing black sides on hornless white cows. These are the traits most reminiscing of the old &quot;Rørosfe&quot;.

Red Troender cattle is a now extinct breed based on the Scottish Ayrshire cattle. This domestic breed of horned red cows was mixed into extinction in the 1960s, and is now succeeded by Norwegian Red Cattle (NRF).

Tautersheep () was a breed of sheep from the island Tautra in Frosta Municipality, which was and still is heavily populated by monks, who have held sheep since the 11th century. It is thought that the breed is a fork of Spanish Merino sheep brought to Norway by monks during the 1500s. This theory has little written evidence to support it, which may be explained by Spains monopoly on Merino sheep until the 1800s, and export of the breed was punishable by death. Another theory is that the fine wool-features come from Moroccan sheep that were left on some islands outside Frøya. The presence of Moroccan sheep on Tarva was documented in 1757, and they are thought to have been brought inland. What is known for certain is that Hertfordshire Ryelander rams were imported in the late 1700s to mate with the local Tautra sheep. The Norwegian government held a breeding station on Edøy, that was laid to waste by invading forces during WWII. Despite a couple of decentralized breeding stations the population was too low, and to prevent inbreeding it was mixed, amongst others with Old Norwegian Sheep, to improve the quality of other breeds.

Grey Troender sheep is an endangered domesticated breed counting only 50 specimens in the year 2000. The crossbreeding to create the Grey Troender started in the late 1800s with heavy influence from Old Norwegian Sheep and Tautra Sheep. To protect this breed the government subsidises breeders. By 2011 the population had grown to 1200, whereof 500 are fertile ewes, distributed among 35 herds, and efforts are being made to revive the breed..The Committee on Farm Animal Genetic Resources has collected and frozen 3500 sperm-samples for future breeding.

Troender Rabbit () Is the only domestic Norwegian breed of rabbit. The breed was very popular during WWII as it grew fast and provided a fair amount of meat. Interest in the breed tapered off in the 1970s, and the population was as low as 40 specimens in the 1990s. The population in 2017 was around 80 specimens.f

<text>The term Full Gospel or Fourfold Gospel is an evangelical doctrine that summarizes the Gospel in four aspects, namely the salvation, sanctification, faith healing and Second Coming of Christ. It has been used in various Christian traditions, including Keswickian, Pentecostal, Anabaptist, and Baptist denominations.

== History and usage ==

This term has its origin in 1887 in a series of sermons called &quot;Fourfold Gospel&quot; by the Canadian pastor Albert Benjamin Simpson, founder of the Alliance World Fellowship, a denomination that teaches a form of Keswickian theology. According to him, this concept represents the four aspects of the ministry of Jesus Christ; Christ the Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and King who will soon return.
In October 1922, the Canadian evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the Foursquare Church, used the expression &quot;Foursquare Gospel&quot; referring to the doctrine in a sermon in Oakland, California, and stated that it would be the center of her teaching. According to her, this concept represented the four aspects of the ministry of Jesus Christ; Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, Healer, and King. Various other Pentecostal denominations have been influenced by this doctrine, which is sometimes known as the &quot;Full Gospel&quot;. A variety of Pentecostals have further developed the motif of the full gospel, predominantly the five-fold theme of salvation, sanctification, Spirit baptism, divine healing, and the coming kingdom.

The Missionary Church, an Anabaptist denomination with Radical Pietist and Wesleyan influences holds a commitment to &quot;A. B. Simpson’s fourfold emphasis on Jesus Christ as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer and Coming King&quot;.

<text>Wielka Piaśnica is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Puck, within Puck County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately west of Puck and north-west of the regional capital Gdańsk.

==History==
According to the 1921 census, the village had a population of 50, entirely Polish by nationality and Roman Catholic by confession.

===World War II===

After the 1939 Invasion of Poland, German SS from Danzig (Gdańsk) and local German &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; members executed about 12,000 civilians,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry/Orla-Bukowska&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mainly Polish and Kashubian intelligentsia from the Pomeranian Voivodeship, in the Darżlubska forest next to the village. Among the victims were approximately 1,200 mentally ill persons from local hospitals, killed in the course of the forced euthanasia policy dubbed Action T4.

The mass executions began in October 1939 and lasted until April 1940. An exhumation of mass graves was carried after World War II in 1946. Out of total number of 35 graves, 30 were localised of which 26 were exhumed. Only 305 bodies (in two mass graves) were found, the rest of the bodies were burnt by Germans in August–September 1944. Sonderkommandos (forced prison labourers) from Stutthof concentration camp were used to cover up the tracks and were later executed.

<text>Clive Eric Cussler (July 15, 1931 – February 24, 2020) was an American adventure novelist and underwater explorer. His thriller novels, many featuring the character Dirk Pitt, have been listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; fiction best-seller list more than 20 times. Cussler was the founder and chairman of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), which has discovered more than 60 shipwreck sites and numerous other notable underwater wrecks. He was the sole author or main author of more than 80 books. He often placed himself into his books as himself.

His novels have inspired various other works of fiction.

==Early life==
Clive Cussler was born in Aurora, Illinois, the son of Eric Edward Cussler and Amy Adeline (née Hunnewell), and grew up in Alhambra, California. His father was from Germany and his mother&#x27;s ancestors were from England.

In his memoir &quot;The Sea Hunters: True Adventures with Famous Shipwrecks&quot;, Cussler revealed that his father served in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front during World War I. Furthermore, one of Cussler&#x27;s uncles served in the Imperial German Air Service and became a flying ace, shooting down 14 Allied aeroplanes.

He was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout when he was 14 years old. He attended Pasadena City College for two years and then enlisted in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. During his service with the Air Force, he was promoted to sergeant and worked as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer for the Military Air Transport Service (MATS).

==Career==
After his discharge from the military, Cussler went to work for the advertising industry, first as a copywriter and later as a creative director for two of the nation&#x27;s most successful advertising agencies. As part of his duties, Cussler produced radio and television commercials, many of which won international awards including an award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.

After the publication in 1996 of Cussler&#x27;s first nonfiction work, &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot;, he was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree in 1997 by the Board of Governors of the State University of New York Maritime College who accepted the work in lieu of a Ph.D. thesis. This was the first time in the college&#x27;s 123-year history that such a degree had been awarded.

In 2002, Cussler was awarded the Naval Heritage Award from the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation for his efforts concerning marine exploration.

Cussler was a fellow of the Explorers Club of New York, the Royal Geographical Society in London, and the American Society of Oceanographers.

===Literary career===
Clive Cussler began writing in 1965 when his wife took a job working nights for the local police department where they lived in California. After making dinner for the children and putting them to bed, he had no one to talk to and nothing much to do, so he decided to start writing. His most famous character is marine engineer, government agent and adventurer Dirk Pitt. The Dirk Pitt novels frequently have an alternative history premise—such as &quot;what if Atlantis were real?&quot; or &quot;what if Abraham Lincoln wasn&#x27;t assassinated but was kidnapped?&quot;

The first two Pitt novels, &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot; and &quot;Iceberg&quot;, were relatively conventional maritime thrillers. The third, &quot;Raise the Titanic!&quot;, made Cussler&#x27;s reputation and established the pattern that subsequent Pitt novels would follow: a blend of adventure and advanced technology, generally involving cal villains, lost ships, beautiful women, and sunken treasure.

Cussler&#x27;s novels almost always begin with a chapter set in the past. These contain none of the novel&#x27;s main characters and often seem disconnected from the plot until the main characters discover a mystery or secret relating the events of the first chapter to the rest of the story. This is almost always in the form of a long-lost artifact that is important to the villain&#x27;s or hero&#x27;s objectives. Often in the first chapter, a ship or airplane carrying a top-secret, important, or dangerous cargo is lost and never found, until it is recovered by a modern character later in the book.

Cussler&#x27;s novels, like those of Michael Crichton, are examples of techno-thrillers that do not use military plots and settings. Where Crichton strove for scrupulous realism, however, Cussler prefers fantastic spectacles and outlandish plot devices. The Pitt novels, in particular, have the improbable quality of the James Bond or Indiana Jones movies, while also sometimes borrowing from Alistair MacLean&#x27;s novels. Pitt himself is a super-hero reminiscent of Doc Savage and other characters from pulp magazines.

Cussler had seventeen consecutive titles listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; fiction best seller list. In 2014, McFarland Publishing released &quot;The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review&quot; by Steven Philip Jones, the first critical review textbook of Cussler&#x27;s novels.

===NUMA===
As an underwater explorer, Cussler discovered more than 60 shipwreck sites and wrote non-fiction books about his findings. He was also the initiator of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), a non-profit organization with the same name as the fictional government agency that employs Dirk Pitt.

Important finds by NUMA include:

* , the ship famed for being the first to come to the aid of survivors.
* , the first ironclad of the civil war, formerly the icebreaker &quot;Enoch Train&quot;.

A visual and interactive depiction of Cussler&#x27;s NUMA Foundation Expeditions has been made available as an extension of NUMA&#x27;s original website that has since been deleted.

Finds formerly believed to be important include:
* &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, the famed ghost ship that was found abandoned with cargo intact (the identification of this wreck as the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; has since been placed into a state of question after one researcher disputed the claim&#x27;s authenticity).

==Adaptations==
* The first film adaptation of a Clive Cussler novel was &quot;Raise the Titanic!&quot; (1980) featuring Richard Jordan as Dirk Pitt, Jason Robards as Admiral James Sandecker, David Selby as Gene Seagram, and Anne Archer as Dana Seagram.
* Paramount Pictures released the movie &quot;Sahara&quot; on April 8, 2005, featuring Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn as Al Giordino, William H. Macy as Admiral Sandecker, and Penélope Cruz as Eva Rojas. It grossed $122 million with $241 million in production and distribution expenses.

==Personal life==
Clive Cussler married Barbara Knight in 1955, and they remained married for nearly 50 years until her death in 2003. Together they had three children—Teri, Dirk, and Dayna—four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. 

He was an avid car collector of classic automobiles that are on display at the Cussler Museum in Arvada, Colorado. Clive Cussler was a part-time resident of both Arizona and Colorado.

Cussler died at his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, on February 24, 2020, at age 88 of undisclosed causes.

==Bibliography==

===Dirk Pitt Adventures===
===The NUMA Files===
This series of books is based on the character Kurt Austin, Team Leader of NUMA&#x27;s Special Assignments division and his adventures. Some characters from the Pitt novels appear such as Sandecker, Al Giordino, Rudi Gunn, Hiram Yaeger and St. Julien Perlmutter. Pitt makes brief appearances in the books &quot;Serpent&quot;, &quot;White Death&quot;, &quot;Polar Shift&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;The Storm&quot;, &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, and &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; and is mentioned in &quot;Lost City&quot;. Juan Cabrillo, the captain of the ship &quot;Oregon&quot;, also made a brief appearance in &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

===The &quot;Oregon&quot; Files===
This series of books features a ship named the &quot;Oregon&quot;, which Cussler introduced in the Dirk Pitt Adventures novel &quot;Flood Tide&quot; (1997). While appearing to be a decrepit freighter, it is actually a high-tech advanced ship used by an unnamed and mysterious &quot;Corporation&quot; under the leadership of Juan Cabrillo. The ship is run like a business, with its crew being shareholders, taking jobs for the CIA and other agencies to help stop crime and terrorism. The crew is adept at disguises, combat, computer hacking and more to aid them in their missions. Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala, and Dirk Pitt all make cameo appearances in the fourth volume, &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; (Cabrillo speaks to Pitt on the telephone; and Austin and Zavala appear at the end).

===Isaac Bell Adventures===
These books are set mostly in the U.S. in the early part of the 20th century. They center around Isaac Bell, a brilliant investigator for the Van Dorn Detective Agency, which appears to be modeled after the real-life Pinkerton Agency. Like Pitt, Bell has an affinity for automobiles and is a crack shot. The first book reveals that Bell survives into 1950 with a wife and grown children. Though the setting is a century ago, the books still qualify as techno-thrillers, since they feature the advanced technology of that time such as private express trains, telegraphs, telephones, dreadnought battleships and early airplanes. Isaac Bell also is a principal character of the background story in the Fargo Adventures novel &quot;The Gray Ghost&quot;.

===Fargo Adventures===
The series focuses on Sam and Remi Fargo, a married couple who are professional treasure hunters.

===Non-fiction===
===Children&#x27;s books===

<text>Cape Coast is a city and the capital of the Cape Coast Metropolitan District and the Central Region of Ghana. It is located about from Sekondi-Takoradi and approximately from Accra. The city is one of the most historically significant settlements in Ghana. As of the 2010 census, Cape Coast has a population of 108,374 people. The majority of people who lived in the city are Fante.

The city was once the capital of the Fetu Kingdom, an aboriginal Guan kingdom located north of Cape Coast. Once the Europeans arrived, they established the Cape Coast Castle, which eventually went under the hands of the British who named the castle and its surrounding settlement the headquarters of the Royal African Company. Cape Coast became the capital of the Gold Coast from 1821 until 1877, where it was transferred to Accra.

Cape Coast is a educational hub in Ghana, home to the University of Cape Coast and the Cape Coast Technical University, along with many other secondary and technical institutions. The city&#x27;s economy is dominated by the tourism and service, with sites such as the Cape Coast Castle (World Heritage Site), the Kakum National Park, and the PANAFEST festival serving as attractions to tourists, and the Kotokuraba Market being the largest market in the city.

== Toponymy ==
The traditional name of the city is &quot;Oguaa&quot;, from the Fante word &quot;Gua&quot;, meaning &quot;market&quot;. Another traditional name is &quot;Koto-Kuraba&quot; meaning &quot;crab-hamlet&quot;, which is a corrupted version of the word &quot;Koto-wuraba&quot;, meaning &quot;crab rivulets&quot;. The word survives in the name of a market in the city.

&quot;Cabo Corso&quot; (&quot;short cape&quot;) was the first European name given to the settlement by the early Portuguee navigators who first discovered it. The name was later corrupted by the British to &quot;Cape Coast&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early settlement ===
The origin of the indigenous inhabitants of the settlement is thought to share similarities to those of Edina, as Cape Coast became the principal town of the Fetu Kingdom. &quot;Fetu&quot; was an old Guan (Etsii) kingdom who had its paramountcy located north of Cape Coast. That particular site is known nowadays as Effutu.

At a point in time, a market, known at the time as &quot;Ogua&quot;, grew and developed into an active commercial centre. Because of this growth, the King of Fetu appointed a chief to represent the settlement. The market drew the attention of William Towerson, the first documented English navigator to have reach the Guinea coast, who touched land in 1555.

=== Arrival of Europeans === 

Trade grew between the people of Fetu and the Europeans. Sometime in 1650, a plot of land was bought from the King of Fetu by Hendrik Carloff, acting for Dutch privateers working against the Dutch West India Company. In 1655, a fort was built on the site of Carolusborg under the hands of the Swedish. It switch hands several times before 1664, when it was captured from the Dutch by a joint English and Dutch force.

After the attack, the English named Cape Coast the headquarters of the Royal African Company in 1678. The Danes acquired a plot on top of a hill that was located about north east of the fort. While the Cape Coast Castle was being built, the Danish built a fort on their land, known as Fort Frederiksborg. The fort was later bought out by the English.

For half a century, the English maintained Frederiksborg as a fortified outpost of the castle and renamed it Fort Royal, but by the middle of the 18th century the outpost had been abandoned. Other forts were built during this time, such as Phipps Tower, which was later abandoned and is now manage by the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board.

=== Colonial times ===
The Napoleonic Wars at the beginning of the 19th century and the political unrest in the Gold Coast region as a result of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade by Denmark and Britain are contributing factors in the Asante invasion of the coast in 1806. Cape Coast itself avoided the attack, but the confidence of the townspeople in the British ability to protect them against the Asante plummeted.

More forts were built, such as Smith&#x27;s Tower on top of Dawson Hill and Fort McCarthy.

Cape Coast was threatened a second time by the Asante in 1824 after British troops under Charles MacCarthy were defeated. the town was largely burnt down in 1817, slowing down its economy.

Before the building of the Sekondi Harbour in the 1890s, the town was the most important anchorage in the county. Trading during the time was at its peak, but after 1850, the year the British acquired Danish possessions in which conditions turned south. Trade declined, rivalry with the Dutch got to new heights, and Asante pressures escalated.

The capital of the Gold Coast was transferred from Cape Coast to Accra in 1877. This, along with many other causes, resulted in irreversible damage to the town&#x27;s economy. The 1880s saw a minor boom to its economy with the gold rush.

=== Present (1900–present) ===
The city&#x27;s St. Francis Cathedral was dedicated in 1928. The building is the first Catholic Cathedral built in Ghana. In addition, one of the first Catholic schools in Ghana, St. Augustine&#x27;s College, was established in Cape Coast during 1936. The cocoa marketing boom of the 1900s that Ghana experienced, the city experienced a certain period of economic prosperity.

After the completion of harbours and railways in other parts of the country such as Sekondi and Kumasi, cocoa cultivation and trade in Ghana diversified and Cape Coast lost some importance. However, after the establishment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese and the university of the city in 1950 and 1962 respectively, Cape Coast became a educational hub in Ghana.

==Transportation==
Transportation in the city is regulated by the Transport Department of the Cape Coast Metropolitan Assembly, with Dennis K. Sulemanu acting as the transport officer of the department.

In certain areas such as Abura, with a population of 15,000 in 2000 and is located close to major establishments, transportation needs are served by local transport (taxis and minibuses). Most residents in Cape Coast do not own personal vehicles, with the exception of the city&#x27;s middle class, which included government and educational staff. Congestion is present, made worse by the city being located south of the Accra–Takoradi trunk road.

In 1873, there was a proposal for an line to link the settlements of Cape Coast and Kumasi in order to send troops to fight the Asante. It never came to fruition due to the war ending sooner than expected.

Plans for the construction of an airport for the city was announced by Mahamudu Bawumia at the New Patriotic Party&#x27;s manifesto launch on August 18, 2024. According to Mahamudu, the in funding has been secured from South Korean investors.

Results from a 2005 study found that Cape Coast has close to no irrigated vegetable farming taking place within the city proper expect for the premises of Cape Coast University. Close to 90% vegetables consumed by the city&#x27;s residents come from sources such as Kumasi and as far as Togo and its border with Ghana.

The city&#x27;s topography makes farming difficult to achieve. There are limited suitable areas that could be used for the basis of farming, the ones that do fit the criteria are prone to floods. This makes Cape Coast and its surrounding areas one of the most water scarce in Ghana, resulting in most of the residents resorting to fishing.

=== Fishing ===

Fishing proves a livelihood to most of the residents of Cape Coast, whose residents live in the southern fishing communities. Trade, sewing, and carving also are sources of income alongside fishing. Children are also involved in the occupation as a way of participation and respect.

Due to the decline of fish populations, which many blamed on the fishing practice called &quot;Saiko&quot; where unwanted fish captured by large ships are exchanged at sea for goods such as fruit, water and livestock bought by locals, fishers livelihoods are at stake since their lives depend on the occupation.

The triangular-shaped market was developed in the late 1930s by the colonial government. Since then, it had become one of the largest sources of income for the municipal authority in the city, employing about 35% of the female employed population.

=== Tourism ===

Cape Coast has been experiencing an increasing number of tourists due to attractions such as the Cape Coast Castle (World Heritage Site), the Kakum National Park, and the PANAFEST festival. Although, access to areas such as compounds that houses shrines such as the &quot;Tree Shrine&quot;, a silk cotton tree near anaafo market are prohibited. The city&#x27;s infrastructure however is underdeveloped, impacting the quality of life for the residents and the overall experience of the tourists. As of 2000, there are no streets in the city that prioritizes pedestrian access. Residents often are not aware of the role that they play in the tourism industry.

Cape Coast&#x27;s tourism&#x27;s sector was looked after by the Central Regional Development Commission (CEDECOM). In order to fund the development of the sector, CEDECOM reached out to UNDP and USAID, which in turn contacted the Debt for Development Coalition (DDC) for a &#x27;debt swap&#x27; arrangement. After cooperating with multiple different parties, the Natural Resource Conservation and Historic Preservation project was launched. The project focused on the rehabilitation and transformation of the city&#x27;s castles and fortresses into heritage creations, and resulted in the creation of the Kakum National Park.

<doc id="358196" wikidata="Q7098949" url="?curid=358196" title="Optimal solutions for the Rubik's Cube">
<text>Optimal solutions for the [[Rubik&#x27;s Cube]] are solutions that are the shortest in some sense. There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution. The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called &quot;face turns&quot;. A move to turn an outer layer two quarter (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM &quot;Half Turn Metric&quot;). It means that the length of an optimal solution in HTM ≤ the length of an optimal solution in QTM.

The maximal number of face turns needed to solve any instance of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube is 20, and the maximal number of quarter turns is 26. These numbers are also the diameters of the corresponding Cayley graphs of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group. In STM (slice turn metric) the minimal number of turns is unknown, lower bound being 18 and upper bound being 20.

There are many algorithms to solve scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as God&#x27;s algorithm.

A randomly scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Cube will most likely be optimally solvable in 18 moves (~ 67.0%), 17 moves (~ 26.7%), 19 moves (~ 3.4%) or 16 moves (~ 2.6%) in HTM. By the same token, it is estimated that there is only 1 configuration which needs 20 moves to be solved optimally in almost 90×109, or 90 billion, random scrambles. The exact number of configurations requiring 20 optimal moves to solve the cube is still unknown.

== Move notation ==
To denote a sequence of moves on the 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube, this article uses &quot;Singmaster notation&quot;, which was developed by David Singmaster.

The following are standard moves, which do not move centre cubies of any face to another location:

The letters &quot;L&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; indicate a clockwise quarter turn of the left, right, front, back, up, and down face respectively. A half turn (i.e. 2 quarter turns in the same direction) are indicated by appending a &quot;2&quot;. A counterclockwise turn is indicated by appending a prime symbol ( &#x27; ).

Computer solvers can find either optimal or non-optimal solution in a given turn metric. To distinguish between these states, an asterisk symbol ( * ) is being used. For example, a solution followed by a (18f) means that an 18-move long solution in the face-turn metric was found but that specific solution was not proved to be optimal. On the contrary, a solution followed by a (18f*) means that an 18-move long solution in the face-turn metric was found and that specific solution was proved to be optimal.

==Lower bounds==

It can be proven by counting arguments that there exist positions needing at least 18 moves to solve. To show this, first count the number of cube positions that exist in total, then count the number of positions achievable using at most 17 moves starting from a solved cube. It turns out that the latter number is smaller.

This argument was not improved upon for many years. Also, it is not a constructive proof: it does not exhibit a concrete position that needs this many moves. It was conjectured that the so-called superflip would be a position that is very difficult. A Rubik&#x27;s Cube is in the superflip pattern when each corner piece is in the correct position, but each edge piece is incorrectly oriented. In 1992, a solution for the superflip with 20 face turns was found by Dik T. Winter, of which the minimality was shown in 1995 by Michael Reid, providing a new lower bound for the diameter of the cube group. Also in 1995, a solution for superflip in 24 quarter turns was found by Michael Reid, with its minimality proven by Jerry Bryan. In 1998, a new position requiring more than 24 quarter turns to solve was found. The position, which was called a &#x27;superflip composed with four spot&#x27; needs 26 quarter turns.

==Upper bounds==

The first upper bounds were based on the &#x27;human&#x27; algorithms. By combining the worst-case scenarios for each part of these algorithms, the typical upper bound was found to be around 100.

Perhaps the first concrete value for an upper bound was the 277 moves mentioned by David Singmaster in early 1979. He simply counted the maximum number of moves required by his cube-solving algorithm. Later, Singmaster reported that Elwyn Berlekamp, John Conway, and Richard K. Guy had come up with a different algorithm that took at most 160 moves. Soon after, Conway&#x27;s Cambridge Cubists reported that the cube could be restored in at most 94 moves.

Five computer algorithms (four of which can find an optimal Rubik&#x27;s Cube solution in the half-turn metric) are briefly described below. An animated example solve has been made for each of them. The scrambling move sequence used in all example solves is: U2 B2 R&#x27; F2 R&#x27; U2 L2 B2 R&#x27; B2 R2 U2 B2 U&#x27; L R2 U L F D2 R&#x27; F&#x27;. Use the buttons at the top right to navigate through the solves, then use the button bar at the bottom to play the solving sequence. Example solves. 

===Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm===
Thistlethwaite&#x27;s four-phase algorithm is not designed to search for an optimal solution, its average move count being about 31 moves. Nevertheless, it is an interesting solving method from a theoretical standpoint.

The breakthrough in determining an upper bound, known as &quot;descent through nested sub-groups&quot; was found by Morwen Thistlethwaite; details of Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm were published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1981 by Douglas Hofstadter. The approaches to the cube that led to algorithms with very few moves are based on group theory and on extensive computer searches. Thistlethwaite&#x27;s idea was to divide the problem into subproblems. Where algorithms up to that point divided the problem by looking at the parts of the cube that should remain fixed, he divided it by restricting the type of moves that could be executed. In particular he divided the cube group into the following chain of subgroups:

: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3
: formula_4
: formula_5

Next he prepared tables for each of the right coset spaces formula_6. For each element he found a sequence of moves that took it to the next smaller group. After these preparations he worked as follows. A random cube is in the general cube group formula_7. Next he found this element in the right coset space formula_8. He applied the corresponding process to the cube. This took it to a cube in formula_9. Next he looked up a process that takes the cube to formula_10, next to formula_11 and finally to formula_12.

Although the whole cube group formula_7 is very large (~4.3×1019), the right coset spaces formula_14 and formula_11 are much smaller.
The coset space formula_16 is the largest and contains only 1082565 elements. The number of moves required by this algorithm is the sum of the largest process in each step.

Initially, Thistlethwaite showed that any configuration could be solved in at most 85 moves using a totally different method. In January 1980 he improved his strategy to yield a maximum of 80 moves. Later that same year, he reduced the number to 63 using a new approach, and then again to 52 using an entirely different approach which is now known as Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm. By exhaustively searching the coset spaces it was later found that the worst possible number of moves for each stage was 7, 10, 13, and 15 giving a total of 45 moves at most. There have been implementations of Thistlewaite&#x27;s algorithm in various computer languages.

===4-list algorithm===
The main idea behind the 4-list algorithm (sometimes denoted as Shamir&#x27;s algorithm) is a bidirectional search, also known as a meet-in-the-middle approach. A group of researchers - Adi Shamir, Amos Fiat, Shahar Mozes, Ilan Shimshoni and Gábor Tardos - demonstrated how to apply the algorithm to the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in 1989, based on earlier work by Richard Schroeppel and Adi Shamir from January 1980 (which was published in 1981). 

The 4-list algorithm is not designed to search for an optimal solution as quickly as possible. Its purpose is to find a solution being at most 20 moves long, but without any guarantee that the solution found is optimal. 
If the algorithm is not terminated upon finding the first solution, it can find all solutions including optimal ones. However, the first report of optimal solutions for randomly scrambled cubes came from Richard Korf in 1997, using his own algorithm. The search time required for the 4-list algorithm to find an optimal solution is considerably longer compared to Kociemba&#x27;s or Feather&#x27;s algorithm.

Bidirectional search works by searching forward from the scrambled state, and backward from the solved state 
simultaneously, until a common state is reached from both directions. The solution is then found by combining 
the forward search path with the inverse of the backward search path.

To find a solution using the 4-list algorithm, a list of all 621,649 permutations that reach depths 0-5 is first stored in RAM. By cleverly multiplying all possible pairs of elements from that list and sorting the resulting products, all permutations that reach depths 0-10 are then generated in lexicographical order from both scrambled and solved states, ultimately leading to a match being found at their intersection. As a consequence of the lexicographic ordering, it is possible to eliminate duplicate permutations and to count the number of unique permutations without storing any of the created products in RAM.

===Kociemba&#x27;s algorithm===
Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm was improved by Herbert Kociemba in 1992. He reduced the number of intermediate groups to only two:
*formula_1
*formula_18
*formula_19

Kociemba&#x27;s two-phase algorithm is not designed to search for an optimal solution, its purpose is to quickly find a reasonably short suboptimal solution. A randomly scrambled cube would be typically solved in a fraction of a second in 20 moves or less, but without any guarantee that the solution found is optimal. While it is technically possible to search for an optimal solution using Kociemba&#x27;s algorithm by reducing a two-phase solver to only a one-phase solver (only phase 1 would be used until the cube is completely solved, no phase 2 operation being done at all), more hardware utilization would be necessary in that case because a fast optimal solver requires significantly more computing resources than an equally fast suboptimal solver. 

As with Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm, he would search through the right coset space formula_8 to take the cube to group formula_9. Next he searched the optimal solution for group formula_9. The searches in formula_8 and formula_9 were both done with a method equivalent to iterative deepening A* (IDA*). The search in formula_8 needs at most 12 moves and the search in formula_9 at most 18 moves, as Michael Reid showed in 1995. By also generating suboptimal solutions that take the cube to group formula_9 and looking for short solutions in formula_9, much shorter overall solutions are usually obtained.

In 1995 Michael Reid proved that using these two groups every position can be solved in at most 29 face turns, or in 42 quarter turns. This result was improved by Silviu Radu in 2005 to 40.

At first glance, this algorithm appears to be practically inefficient: if formula_7 contains 18 possible moves (each move, its prime, and its 180-degree rotation), that leaves formula_30 (over 1 quadrillion) cube states to be searched. Even with a heuristic-based computer algorithm like IDA*, which may narrow it down considerably, searching through that many states is likely not practical. To solve this problem, Kociemba devised a lookup table that provides an exact heuristic for formula_7. When the exact number of moves needed to reach formula_9 is available, the search for suboptimal solutions becomes virtually instantaneous (note that the search for optimal solution takes much longer time): one need only generate 18 cube states for each of the 12 moves and choose the one with the lowest heuristic each time. This allows the second heuristic, that for formula_9, to be less precise and still allow for a solution to be computed in reasonable time on a modern computer.

===Korf&#x27;s algorithm===
Using these group solutions combined with computer searches will generally quickly give very short solutions. But these solutions do not always come with a guarantee of their minimality. To search specifically for minimal solutions a new approach was needed.

In 1997 Richard Korf wrote the first program to solve randomly scrambled cubes optimally. Of the ten random cubes he did, none required more than 18 face turns. The method he used is called IDA* and is described in his paper &quot;Finding Optimal Solutions to Rubik&#x27;s Cube Using Pattern Databases&quot;. Korf describes this method as follows
: IDA* is a depth-first search that looks for increasingly longer solutions in a series of iterations, using a lower-bound heuristic to prune branches once a lower bound on their length exceeds the current iterations bound.

It works roughly as follows. First he identified a number of subproblems that are small enough to be solved optimally. He used:

#The cube restricted to only the corners, not looking at the edges
#The cube restricted to only 6 edges, not looking at the corners nor at the other edges.
#The cube restricted to the other 6 edges.

Clearly the number of moves required to solve any of these subproblems is a lower bound for the number of moves needed to solve the entire cube.

Given a random cube C, it is solved as iterative deepening. First all cubes are generated that are the result of applying 1 move to them. That is C * F, C * U, ... Next, from this list, all cubes are generated that are the result of applying two moves. Then three moves and so on. If at any point a cube is found that needs too many moves based on the lower bounds to still be optimal it can be eliminated from the list.

Although this algorithm will always find optimal solution, its search time is considerably longer in comparison with Kociemba&#x27;s or Feather&#x27;s algorithm.

===Further improvements, and finding God&#x27;s Number===
In 2006, Silviu Radu further improved his methods to prove that every position can be solved in at most 27 face turns or 35 quarter turns. Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman in 2007 used a supercomputer to show that all unsolved cubes can be solved in no more than 26 moves (in face-turn metric). Instead of attempting to solve each of the billions of variations explicitly, the computer was programmed to bring the cube to one of 15,752 states, each of which could be solved within a few extra moves. All were proved solvable in 29 moves, with most solvable in 26. Those that could not initially be solved in 26 moves were then solved explicitly, and shown that they too could be solved in 26 moves.

Tomas Rokicki reported in a 2008 computational proof that all unsolved cubes could be solved in 25 moves or fewer. This was later reduced to 23 moves. In August 2008, Rokicki announced that he had a proof for 22 moves.

Finally, in 2010, Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson, and John Dethridge gave the final computer-assisted proof that all cube positions could be solved with a maximum of 20 face turns.
In 2009, Tomas Rokicki proved that 29 moves in the quarter-turn metric is enough to solve any scrambled cube. And in 2014, Tomas Rokicki and Morley Davidson proved that the maximum number of quarter-turns needed to solve the cube is 26.

The face-turn and quarter-turn metrics differ in the nature of their antipodes.
An antipode is a scrambled cube that is maximally far from solved, one that requires the maximum number of moves to solve. In the half-turn metric with a maximum number of 20, there are hundreds of millions of such positions. In the quarter-turn metric, only a single position (and its two rotations) is known that requires the maximum of 26 moves. Despite significant effort, no additional quarter-turn distance-26 positions have been found. Even at distance 25, only two positions (and their rotations) are known to exist. At distance 24, perhaps 150,000 positions exist.

===Feather&#x27;s algorithm===
In 2015, Michael Feather introduced a unique two-phase algorithm on his website. It is capable of generating both suboptimal and optimal solutions in reasonable time on a modern device. Unlike Thistlethwaite&#x27;s or Kociemba&#x27;s algorithm, Feather&#x27;s algorithm is not heavily based on the mathematical field of group theory.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube can be simplified by using only 3 colors instead of usual 6 colors. Generally, opposite faces would share the same color. On a 6-color cube, a solved 3-color cube would be represented by a state in which only opposite colors appear on opposite faces. 

In a nutshell, Feather&#x27;s algorithm goes like this: any 3-color solutions that arise from the nodes being generated are then looked up in the array containing distances from intermediate 3-color solutions to the final 6-color solution (a total of 3,981,312 configurations), and if it is 8 moves or less (of which there are 117,265 configurations) then a solution is generated. One can think of it as a brute-force search enhanced by using distance arrays to prune the search tree where possible, and also reducing the size of the distance arrays effectively by using cube symmetry.

When searching for an optimal solution, Feather&#x27;s algorithm is finding suboptimal solutions on the way. This is an advantage because in many cases it does not have to search the depth of the optimal solution length because it has already found a suboptimal solution at a lower depth that is equal to the optimal solution length, hence it only has to complete search depth N−1 to prove that solution length N is optimal.

Feather&#x27;s algorithm was implemented in the first online optimal Rubik&#x27;s Cube solver, more specifically in the first client-side processing (JavaScript) solver with a graphical user interface running in a web browser and being able to generate optimal solutions in a timely manner. That includes computing 19-move long optimal solutions as they will occur roughly in a 3.4% of all cases in a batch of randomly scrambled cubes. The solver has multiple options for different size distance arrays to maximize use of available RAM, and it also uses all available processors to get the best performance from a wide variety of platforms.

<text>Massamá () is a former civil parish in the municipality of Sintra, Lisbon District, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Massamá e Monte Abraão. The population in 2011 was 28,112, in an area of 2.78 km².

It was separated from Queluz parish in 1997. The parish consists of three different zones. The old zone is known as the 2nd phase, a newer zone is known as the 6th phase, while the newest zone, Massamá-Norte (North Massamá, also known as 7th phase) is located outside the parish of Massamá, belonging to Belas parish, though it is usually considered as a zone from Massamá, as it is connected to the rest of Massamá. Belas town is actually several kilometers from Massamá Norte.

The name Massamá comes from the Mozarabic term “Mactama” which means “place with good water” or “fountain”. Due to its location between Sintra and Lisbon, this was the place where ancient warriors would take a break to rest and drink water from the local springs.

==Notable people==
*Pedro Passos Coelho, Prime Minister of Portugal, lives in Massamá.

<text>The southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) is a species of rockhopper penguin that is sometimes considered distinct from the northern rockhopper penguin. It occurs in subantarctic waters of the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, as well as around the southern coasts of South America.

==Taxonomy==
In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the southern rockhopper penguin in the first volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen owned by Peter Collinson. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the southern rockhopper penguin with the red-billed tropicbird in the genus &quot;Phaethon&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Phaethon demersus&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The use of Linnaeus&#x27; binomial name was not adopted by later ornithologists, perhaps because he had already used the specific &quot;demersa&quot; for the African penguin which he placed with the wandering albatross in the genus &quot;Diomedea&quot;.

The southern rockhopper penguin was formally described in 1781 by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster under the binomial name &quot;Aptenodytes chrysocome&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;fine&quot; with meaning &quot;diver&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;chrysocome&quot; is from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;golden-haired&quot; (from meaning &quot;gold&quot; and meaning &quot;hair&quot;).

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. c. filholi&quot; Hutton, FW, 1879 – Kerguelen Islands and subantarctic islands of New Zealand
* &quot;E. c. chrysocome&quot; (Forster, JR, 1781) – Cape Horn to the Falkland Islands

The rockhopper penguin complex is confusing. Many taxonomists consider all three rockhopper penguin forms subspecies. Some split the northern subspecies (&quot;moseleyi&quot;) from the southern forms (&quot;chrysocome&quot; and &quot;filholi&quot;). Still others consider all three distinct. The subspecies recognized for the southern rockhopper penguin complex are:
* &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome&quot;, the western rockhopper penguin or American southern rockhopper penguin – breeds around the southern tip of South America.
* &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome filholi&quot;, the eastern rockhopper penguin or Indopacific southern rockhopper penguin – breeds on subantarctic islands of the Indian and western Pacific oceans.

The northern rockhopper penguin lives in a different water mass from the western and eastern rockhopper penguin, separated by the Subtropical Front, and they are genetically different. Therefore, northern birds are sometimes separated as &quot;E. moseleyi&quot;. The rockhopper penguins are closely related to the macaroni penguin (&quot;E. chrysolophus&quot;) and the royal penguin (&quot;E. schlegeli&quot;), which may just be a colour morph of the macaroni penguin.

Interbreeding with the macaroni penguin has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.

==Description==
This is the smallest yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin in the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;. It reaches a length of and typically weighs , although there are records of exceptionally large rockhoppers weighing . It has slate-grey upper parts and has straight, bright yellow eyebrows ending in long yellowish plumes projecting sideways behind a red eye.

==Ecology==

The southern rockhopper penguin group has a global population of roughly 1 million pairs. About two-thirds of the global population belongs to &quot;E. c. chrysocome&quot;, which breeds on the Falkland Islands and on islands off Patagonia. These include most significantly Isla de los Estados, the Ildefonso Islands, the Diego Ramírez Islands and Isla Noir. &quot;E. c. filholi&quot; breeds on the Prince Edward Islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Campbell Island, the Auckland Islands and the Antipodes Islands. Outside the breeding season, the birds can be found roaming the waters offshore their colonies.

These penguins feed on krill, squid, octopus, lantern fish, mollusks, plankton, cuttlefish, and mainly crustaceans.

A rockhopper penguin, named Rocky, in Bergen Aquarium in Norway lived to 29 years 4 months. It died in October 2003. This stands as the age record for rockhopper penguins, and possibly it was the oldest penguin known.

==Behaviour==

Their common name refers to the fact that, unlike many other penguins, which get around obstacles by sliding on their bellies or by awkward climbing using their flipper-like wings as aid, rockhoppers will try to jump over boulders and across cracks.

This behaviour is by no means unique to this species however – at least the other &quot;crested&quot; penguins of the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot; hop around rocks too. But the rockhopper&#x27;s congeners occur on remote islands in the New Zealand region, whereas the rockhopper penguins are found in places that were visited by explorers and whalers since the Early Modern era. Hence, it is this particular species in which this behaviour was first noted.

Their breeding colonies are located from sea level to cliff-tops and sometimes inland. Their breeding season starts in September and ends in November. Two eggs are laid but only one is usually incubated. Incubation lasts 35 days and their chicks are brooded for 26 days.

===Variation in foraging behaviour===
Rockhopper penguins are known to have complex foraging behaviors. Influenced by factors such as sea ice abundance, prey availability, breeding stage, and seasonality, rockhopper penguins must be able to adapt their behavior to fit the current conditions. Rockhopper penguins employ different strategies according to their conditions. When making foraging trips, rockhoppers typically leave and return to their colonies in groups. One study showed they are known for going up to away from their colonies when foraging. Females typically forage during the day in 11–12 hour trips consisting of many dives, but they will occasionally forage at night. Night dives are typically much shallower than day dives. Dives typically last around 12h, but can be up to 15hrs, with penguins leaving the colony around dawn (04:00) and returning at dusk (19:00).
Rockhopper penguins employ different strategies and foraging behaviors depending on the climate and environment. A main factor is food location. Subantarctic penguins must dive for longer periods of time and much deeper in search of food than do species in warmer waters where food is more easily accessible.

==== Benthic and pelagic dives ====
Rockhopper penguins are known to employ two different types of dives when foraging, pelagic and benthic dives. Pelagic dives are typically short and relatively shallow and used very frequently. Benthic dives are much deeper dives near the seafloor (up to deep) that typically last longer and have longer bottom time. Penguins performing benthic dives typically only perform a few depth wiggles (changes in depth profile) at their maximum depth. at an average speed of range of . Although deeper dives tend to be a bit longer than shallow dives, foraging rockhoppers will minimize their travel time when performing benthic dives to gain maximum efficiency. Benthic dives in particular show a stronger correlation to full stomachs than pelagic dives. Emperor penguins, gentoo penguins, yellow-eyed penguins and king penguins also use this deep-dive technique to obtain food.

Prey availability is dependent on many factors, such as current climate and conditions of the area. Typically, females will bring back a majority of crustaceans and occasionally some fish for their young. The female&#x27;s foraging success directly affects chick growth. If food is scarce, females are able to fast for very long periods of time and sometimes will only forage for the chick&#x27;s benefit.

==== Dive limitations ====
Because foraging conditions and outcomes are so variable, several factors can limit foraging practices. The timing of breeding, incubation and brooding periods greatly affect foraging time, as females are unable to leave broods for long periods of time. Females during the brooding period will follow a much more fixed foraging schedule, leaving and returning to the colony at roughly the same time each day. When not in breeding season, females have much more variability in the length of foraging trips. If females have low energy levels because they are fasting while provisioning chicks, they may make several short foraging trips instead of one longer one.

While benthic dives are efficient and favorable for rockhoppers, they present physiological limitations such as limits in lung capacity, which affects duration of dives. The longest aerobic dive rockhoppers can perform is about 110 seconds long, but dives can last upwards of 180–190 seconds.

==Status and conservation==
The southern rockhopper penguin group is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Its population has declined by about one-third in the last thirty years [when?].
This decline has earned them the classification of a vulnerable species by the IUCN. Threats to their population include commercial fishing and oil spills.

With the approval of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), Drusillas Park in East Sussex holds the studbook for rockhopper penguins in Europe. Zoo manager Sue Woodgate has specialist knowledge of the species, so the zoo is responsible for co-ordinating the movements of penguins among zoos in Europe to take part in breeding programmes and offer their advice and information about the species.

==Relationship with humans==

The indigenous Yahgan people whose territory in Tierra del Fuego overlaps with its distribution often hunted them by slingshot or dart as a source of food.

Rockhopper penguins are the most familiar of the crested penguins to the general public in the present day. Their breeding colonies, namely those around South America, today attract many tourists who enjoy watching the birds&#x27; antics. Historically, the same islands had been popular stopover and replenishing sites for whalers and other seafarers since at least the early 18th century. Almost all crested penguins depicted in movies, books and other media are ultimately based on &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome&quot;.

<text>Kenneth Erwin Hagin (August 20, 1917 – September 19, 2003) was an American preacher. He is known for pioneering the Word of Faith movement, following in the footsteps of E. W. Kenyon.

== Biography ==
=== Personal life ===
Kenneth E. Hagin was born August 20, 1917, in McKinney, Texas, the son of Lillie Viola Drake Hagin and Jess Hagin. According to Hagin, he was born with a deformed heart and what was believed to be an incurable blood disease. He was not expected to live and at age 15 he became paralyzed and bedridden. In April 1933 he converted to Christianity. During a dramatic conversion experience, he reported dying, due to the deformed heart, three times in 10 minutes, each time seeing the horrors of hell and then returning to life. He remained paralyzed after his conversion.

On August 8, 1934, he says he was raised from his deathbed by a revelation of &quot;faith in God&#x27;s Word&quot; after reading Mark 11:23–24. He was also healed of his paralysis and never struggled with walking. His dramatic healing is detailed in Roberts Liardon&#x27;s book &quot;God&#x27;s Generals&quot;.

<text>Eid al-Adha () is the second of the two main festivals in Islam alongside Eid al-Fitr. It falls on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijja, the twelfth and final month of the Islamic calendar. Celebrations and observances are generally carried forward to the three following days, known as the Tashreeq days.

Eid al-Adha is also sometimes called Eid II or &quot;Greater Eid&quot; (). As with Eid al-Fitr, the Eid prayer is performed on the morning of Eid al-Adha, after which &quot;udhiyah&quot;, or the ritual sacrifice of sheep, may be performed. In Islamic tradition, it honours the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God&#x27;s command. Depending on the narrative, either Ishmael or Isaac are referred to with the honorific title &quot;Sacrifice of God&quot;. Pilgrims performing the Hajj typically perform the tawaf and saee of Hajj on Eid al-Adha, along with the ritual Stoning of the Devil on the Eid day and the following days.

==Etymology==
The Arabic word () means &#x27;festival&#x27;, &#x27;celebration&#x27;, &#x27;feast day&#x27;, or &#x27;holiday&#x27;. The word is a triliteral root (&quot;ʕ-y-d&quot;), with associated root meanings of &quot;to go back, to rescind, to accrue, to be accustomed, habits, to repeat, to be experienced; appointed time or place, anniversary, feast day&quot;. Arthur Jeffery contests this etymology, and believes the term to have been borrowed into Arabic from Syriac, or less likely Targumic Aramaic.

The holiday is called () or () in Arabic. The words () and () are synonymous in meaning &#x27;sacrifice&#x27; (animal sacrifice), &#x27;offering&#x27; or &#x27;oblation&#x27;. The first word comes from the triliteral root () with the associated meanings &quot;immolate; offer up; sacrifice; victimize&quot;. No occurrence of this root with a meaning related to sacrifice occurs in the Qur&#x27;an but in the Hadith literature. Assyrians and other Middle Eastern Christians use the term to mean the Eucharistic host. The second word derives from the triliteral root () with associated meanings of &quot;closeness, proximity... to moderate; kinship...; to hurry; ...to seek, to seek water sources...; scabbard, sheath; small boat; sacrifice&quot;. Arthur Jeffery recognizes the same Semitic root, but believes the sense of the term to have entered Arabic through Aramaic.

Eid al-Adha is pronounced &quot;Eid al-Azha&quot; and &quot;Eidul Azha&quot;, primarily in Iran and influenced by the Persian language like the Indian subcontinent; ; , .

==Origin==

One of the main trials of Abraham&#x27;s life was to receive and obey the command of God to slaughter his beloved son Ishmael. According to the narrative, Abraham kept having dreams that he was sacrificing his son. Abraham knew that this was a command from God and he told his son, as stated in the Quran, Abraham prepared to submit to the will of God and to slaughter his son as an act of faith and obedience to God. During the preparation, Iblis (Satan) tempted Abraham and his family by trying to dissuade them from carrying out God&#x27;s commandment, and Abraham drove Iblis away by throwing pebbles at him. In commemoration of their rejection of Iblis, stones are thrown during Hajj rites at symbolic pillars, symbolising the place at which Iblis tried to dissuade Abraham.

Acknowledging that Abraham was willing to sacrifice what is dear to him, God honoured both Abraham and his son. Angel Gabriel (Jibreel) called Abraham, &quot;O&#x27; Ibrahim, you have fulfilled the revelations,&quot; and a ram from heaven was offered by Angel Gabriel to prophet Abraham to slaughter instead of his son. Many Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha to commemorate both the devotion of Abraham and the survival of his son Ishmael.

This story is known as the Akedah in Judaism (Binding of Isaac) and originates in the Torah, in the first book of Moses (Genesis, Ch. 22). The Akedah is referred to in the Quran in its 37th surah, As-Saaffat.

The word &quot;Eid&quot; appears once in Al-Ma&#x27;ida, the fifth surah of the Quran, with the meaning &quot;a festival or a feast&quot;.

==Observances==
In the days preceding Eid al-Adha and during the Eid and Tashreeq days, Muslims recite the takbir. Like on Eid al-Fitr, the Eid prayer is performed on Eid al-Adha any time after sunrise and before the Zuhr prayer. In the event of a &quot;force majeure,&quot; the prayer may be delayed to the day after, or the second day after Eid. The Eid prayer is followed by a khutbah (sermon). At the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims embrace and exchange gifts and greetings with one another, such as the phrase Eid Mubarak. Many Muslims also take this opportunity to invite their friends, neighbours and colleagues to the festivities to better acquaint them about Islam and Muslim culture.

=== Udhiyah ===
After the Eid prayer, udhiyah, or the ritual sacrifice of cattle, may be performed. Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice halal cattle, usually a camel, goat, sheep, or ram, as a symbol of Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his only son. The animals have to meet certain age and quality standards to be considered for sacrifice. In Pakistan alone, roughly 7.5 million animals, costing an estimated $3 billion (equivalent to $ in ), were sacrificed in 2011. The meat from the sacrificed animal is generally divided into three parts: the family performing the udhiyah retains a third; while the remainder is equally divided between friends and relatives, and the poor.

The tradition for Eid al-Adha involves slaughtering an animal and sharing the meat in three equal parts – for family, for relatives and friends, and for poor people. The goal is to make sure every Muslim gets to eat meat. However, there is a dissent among Muslim scholars regarding the obligatory nature of this sacrifice. While some scholars, such as Al-Kasani, categorise the sacrifice as obligatory (wāǧib), others regard it only as an &quot;established custom&quot; (sunna mu&#x27;akkada). Alternatives such as charitable donations or fasting have been suggested to be permissible by several fuqaha.Muslims are expected to dress in their finest clothing to perform Eid prayer in a large congregation in an open &quot;waqf&quot; (&quot;stopping&quot;) field called Eidgah or mosque. Cuisine traditionally associated with Eid al-Adha includes ma&#x27;amoul and samosas.
===Traditions===

Around the world, there are multiple different traditions that are followed on Eid al-Adha. For example, in places such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, applying henna is a famous tradition amongst women. In Pakistan, children receive Eidi which is money and gifts given from elders. In the Middle East, traditional sweets are made. In African nation, gifts are given among friends and family is invited to feasts. While the cultures are different, the key values of celebration remain the same. Those values are giving, feasts, family, and grant celebrations. 

==In the Gregorian calendar==

While Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar. Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four Gregorian dates in parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International Date Line.

The following list shows the official dates of Eid al-Adha for Saudi Arabia as announced by the Supreme Judicial Council. Future dates are estimated according to the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia. The Umm al-Qura calendar is just a guide for planning purposes and not the absolute determinant or fixer of dates. Confirmations of actual dates by moon sighting are applied on the 29th day of the lunar month prior to Dhu al-Hijja to announce the specific dates for both Hajj rituals and the subsequent Eid festival. The three days after the listed date are also part of the festival. The time before the listed date the pilgrims visit Mount Arafat and descend from it after sunrise of the listed day.

In many countries, the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.

==Environmental impact==

The celebration of Eid al-Adha is noted for causing a lot of plastic waste from one use plastic bags used to distribute meat in. Activist groups in countries like Indonesia have opted for an eco-friendly celebration of the festival.

<doc id="358230" wikidata="Q2054483" url="?curid=358230" title="Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act">
<text>The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (, , PBA Ban) is a United States law prohibiting a form of late termination of pregnancy called &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;, referred to in medical literature as intact dilation and extraction. Under this law, any physician &quot;who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both&quot;. The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;.

==Provisions==
This statute prohibits a method of abortion; the statute calls the prohibited method &quot;partial birth abortion&quot;. The procedure described in the statute is used in the second trimester, from 15 to 26 weeks, most of which occurs before viability. The law itself contains no reference to gestational age or viability. The statute is directed only at a method of abortion, rather than at preventing any woman from obtaining an abortion.

The statute includes two findings of Congress:

The statute also provides that:

Hadley Arkes commented, in an editorial in the &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;[t]hat provision went even further than the law was obliged to go, for as the American Medical Association testified during the hearings, a partial-birth abortion bore no relevance to any measure needed to advance the health of any woman.&quot;

Citing the Supreme Court case of &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; (1973), some pro-life supporters have asserted that the word &quot;health&quot; would render any legal restriction meaningless, because of the broad and vague interpretation of &quot;health&quot;. This was of particular concern when it came to anticipated arguments that such a definition would encompass &quot;mental health&quot;, which some thought would inevitably be expanded by court decisions to include the prevention of depression or other non-physical conditions. Pro-choice groups object to this statute primarily because there is no exemption if the health of a woman is at risk.

== Partial-birth abortion defined by law ==

The phrase &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; was first coined by Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. The phrase has been used in numerous state and federal bills and laws, although the legal definition of the term is not always the same. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act defines &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; as follows:

In the 2000 Supreme Court case of &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion was ruled unconstitutional, in part because the language defining &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; was deemed vague. In 2006, the Supreme Court in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; found that the 2003 act &quot;departs in material ways&quot; from the Nebraska law and that it pertains only to a specific abortion procedure, intact dilation and extraction. Some commentators have noted that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act&#x27;s language was carefully crafted to take into account previous rulings. Although in most cases the procedure legally defined as &quot;partial birth abortion&quot; would be medically defined as &quot;intact dilation and extraction&quot;, these overlapping terms do not always coincide. For example, the IDX procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g. due to a miscarriage or feticide) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction. Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;, which specifies that partial live delivery must precede &quot;the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus&quot;. Additionally, a doctor may extract a fetus past the navel and then &quot;disarticulate [i.e. decapitate] at the neck&quot;, which could fall within the terms of the statute even though it would not result in an intact body and therefore would not be an intact dilation and extraction.

==Legislative and judicial history==
The Republican-led Congress first passed similar laws banning partial-birth abortion in December 1995, and again October 1997, but they were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.

In the House, the final legislation was supported in 2003 by 218 Republicans and 63 Democrats. It was opposed by 4 Republicans, 137 Democrats, and 1 independent. Twelve members were absent, 7 Republicans and 5 Democrats. In the Senate the bill was supported by 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats. It was opposed by 3 Republicans, 30 Democrats, and 1 independent. Two Senators were absent, Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a supporter of the bill, and John Edwards (D-NC), an opponent of the bill.

The only substantive difference between the House and Senate versions was the Harkin Amendment expressing support for &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. A House–Senate conference committee deleted the Harkin Amendment, which therefore is absent from the final legislation. On November 5, 2003, after being passed by both the House and the Senate, the bill was signed by President George W. Bush to become law.

The constitutionality of the law was challenged immediately after the signing. Three different U.S. district courts declared the law unconstitutional. All three cited the law&#x27;s omission of an exception for the health of the woman (as opposed to the life of the woman), and all three decisions cited precedent set by &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) and &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; (2000). The federal government appealed the district court rulings, which were then affirmed by three courts of appeals. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the &quot;Carhart&quot; case on February 21, 2006, and agreed to hear the companion &quot;Planned Parenthood&quot; case on June 19, 2006.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court in a 5–4 decision, &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, held that the statute does not violate the Constitution. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority which included Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissent which was joined by Stephen Breyer, David Souter, and John Paul Stevens. Kennedy&#x27;s majority opinion argued that the case differed from &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion as unconstitutional, in that the Partial Birth Abortion Act defined the banned procedure more clearly. In dissent, Ginsburg argued that the decision departed from established abortion jurisprudence, and that lack of a health exception &quot;jeopardizes women’s health and places doctors in an untenable position&quot;. The replacement of O&#x27;Connor by Alito was identified as a key difference between the 5–4 decision against the Nebraska law in &quot;Stenberg&quot; and the 5–4 support for the abortion ban in &quot;Gonzales&quot;.

==Public opinion==
A Rasmussen Reports poll four days after the court&#x27;s decision found that 40% of respondents &quot;knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures&quot;. Of those who knew of the decision, 66% agreed with the decision and 32% were opposed. An ABC poll from 2003 found that 62% of respondents thought partial-birth abortion should be illegal; a similar number of respondents wanted an exception &quot;if it would prevent a serious threat to the woman&#x27;s health&quot;. Additional polls from 2003 found between 60–75% in favor of banning partial-birth abortions and between 25–40% opposed.

==Clinical response==
In response to this statute, many abortion providers have adopted the practice of inducing fetal demise before beginning late-term abortions. Typically, a solution of potassium chloride or digoxin is injected directly into the fetal heart using ultrasound to guide the needle. This is often done by providers who do not perform intact dilation and extraction procedures (as well as by those who do) because they feel the broad wording of the ban compels them &quot;to do all they can to protect themselves and their staff from the possibility of being accused&quot;.

<text>A roof garden is a garden on the roof of a building. Besides the decorative benefit, roof plantings may provide food, temperature control, hydrological benefits, architectural enhancement, habitats or corridors for wildlife, recreational opportunities, and in large scale it may even have ecological benefits. The practice of cultivating food on the rooftop of buildings is sometimes referred to as rooftop farming. Rooftop farming is usually done using green roof, hydroponics, aeroponics or air-dynaponics systems or container gardens.
==History==
Humans have grown plants atop structures since the ziggurats of ancient Mesopotamia (4th millennium BC–600 BC) had plantings of trees and shrubs on aboveground terraces. An example in Roman times was the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, which had an elevated terrace where plants were grown. A roof garden has also been discovered around an audience hall in Roman-Byzantine Caesarea. The medieval Egyptian city of Fustat had a number of high-rise buildings that Nasir Khusraw in the early 11th century described as rising up to 14 stories, with roof gardens on the top story complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigating them.

Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are often depicted as tall structures holding vegetation; even immense trees.

In New York City between 1880 and Prohibition large rooftop gardens built included the Hotel Astor (New York City), the American Theater on Eighth Avenue, the garden atop Stanford White&#x27;s 1890 Madison Square Garden, and the Paradise Roof Garden opened by Oscar Hammerstein I in 1900.

Commercial greenhouses on rooftops have existed at least since 1969, when Terrestris rooftop nursery opened on 60th st. in New York City.

In the 2010s, large commercial hydroponic rooftop farms were started by Gotham Greens, Lufa Farms, and others.

==Environmental impact==
Roof gardens are most often found in urban environments. Plants have the ability to reduce the overall heat absorption of the building which then reduces energy consumption for cooling. &quot;The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is insolation, the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings in the city and the storage of this heat in the building material and its subsequent re-radiation. Plant surfaces however, as a result of transpiration, do not rise more than above the ambient and are sometimes cooler.&quot; This then translates into a cooling of the environment between , depending on the area on earth (in hotter areas, the environmental temperature will cool more). The study was performed by the University of Cardiff.

A study at the National Research Council of Canada showed the differences between roofs with gardens and roofs without gardens against temperature. The study shows temperature effects on different layers of each roof at different times of the day. Roof gardens are obviously very beneficial in reducing the effects of temperature against roofs without gardens. “If widely adopted, rooftop gardens could reduce the urban heat island, which would decrease smog episodes, problems associated with heat stress and further lower energy consumption.”

Aside from rooftop gardens providing resistance to thermal radiation, rooftop gardens are also beneficial in reducing rain run off. A roof garden can delay run off; reduce the rate and volume of run off. “As cities grow, permeable substrates are replaced by impervious structures such as buildings and paved roads. Storm water run-off and combined sewage overflow events are now major problems for many cities in North America. A key solution is to reduce peak flow by delaying (e.g., control flow drain on roofs) or retaining run-off (e.g., rain detention basins). Rooftop gardens can delay peak flow and retain the run-off for later use by the plants.”

==Urban agriculture==

“In an accessible rooftop garden, space becomes available for localized small-scale urban agriculture, a source of local food production. An urban garden can supplement the diets of the community it feeds with fresh produce and provide a tangible tie to food production.” At Trent University, there is currently a working rooftop garden which provides food to the student café and local citizens.

Available gardening areas in cities are often seriously lacking, which is likely the key impetus for many roof gardens. The garden may be on the roof of an autonomous building which takes care of its own water and waste. Hydroponics and other alternative methods can expand the possibilities of roof top gardening by reducing, for example, the need for soil or its tremendous weight. Plantings in containers are used extensively in roof top gardens. Planting in containers prevents added stress to the roof&#x27;s waterproofing. One high-profile example of a building with a roof garden is Chicago City Hall.

For those who live in small apartments with little space, square foot gardening, or (when even less space is available) green walls (vertical gardening) can be a solution. These use much less space than traditional gardening. These also encourage environmentally responsible practices, eliminating tilling, reducing or eliminating pesticides, and weeding, and encouraging the recycling of wastes through composting.

== Importance to urban planning ==

Becoming green is a high priority for urban planners. The environmental and aesthetic benefits to cities are the prime motivation. It was calculated that the temperature in Tokyo could be lowered by if 50% of all available rooftop space were planted with greenery. This would lead to savings of approximately 100 million yen. 

Singapore is active in green urban development. &quot;Roof gardens present possibilities for carrying the notions of nature and open space further in tall building development.&quot; When surveyed, 80% of Singapore residents voted for more roof gardens to be implemented in the city&#x27;s plans. Recreational reasons, such as leisure and relaxation, beautifying the environment, and greenery and nature, received the most votes. Planting roof gardens on the tops of buildings is a way to make cities more efficient.

A roof garden can be distinguished from a green roof, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. The term roof garden is well suited to roof spaces that incorporate recreation, and entertaining and provide additional outdoor living space for the building&#x27;s residents. It may include planters, plants, dining and lounging furniture, outdoor structures such as pergolas and sheds, and automated irrigation and lighting systems.

Although they may provide aesthetic and recreational benefits a green roof is not necessarily designed for this purpose. A green roof may not provide any recreational space and be constructed with an emphasis on improving the insulation or improving the overall energy efficiency and reducing the cooling and heating costs within a building.

Green roofs may be extensive or intensive. The terms are used to describe the type of planting required. The panels that comprise a green roof are generally no more than a few centimeters up to 30 cm (a few inches up to a foot) in depth, since weight is an important factor when covering an entire roof surface. The plants that go into a green roof are usually sedum or other shallow-rooted plants that will tolerate the hot, dry, windy conditions that prevail in most rooftop gardens. With a green roof, &quot;the plants&#x27; layer can shield off as much as 87% of solar radiation while a bare roof receives 100% direct exposure&quot;.

The planters on a roof garden may be designed for a variety of functions and vary greatly in depth to satisfy aesthetic and recreational purposes. These planters can hold a range of ornamental plants: anything from trees, shrubs, vines, or an assortment of flowers. As aesthetics and recreation are the priority they may not provide the environmental and energy benefits of a green roof.

<text>Borrowstounness, commonly known as Bo&#x27;ness ( ), is a town and former burgh and seaport on the south bank of the Firth of Forth in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. Historically part of the county of West Lothian, it now lies within the Falkirk council area, northwest of Edinburgh and east of Falkirk. At the 2011 census, the population of Bo&#x27;ness was 15,100.

Until the 20th century, Bo&#x27;ness was the site of various industrial activities, including coal mining, saltmaking and pottery production. With its location beside the Forth, the town and its harbour grew in importance in the Industrial Revolution and later continued to grow into the Victorian era. Since the late 20th century, deindustrialisation has changed the nature of the town, with the coal mine closing in 1982 and the waterfront area now being primarily used for leisure purposes. However, some industry remains in the town including an ironworks and a timberyard/sawmill beside the Forth. The centre of the town contains several listed buildings and is part of a conservation area. The town is the home of the Museum of Scottish Railways and also a regional motor museum.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Borrowstoun&quot;, from the Old English for &quot;Beornweard&#x27;s farm&quot;, refers to a hamlet a short way inland from Borrowstounness. The suffix &quot;ness&quot;, meaning &quot;headland&quot;, serves to differentiate the two. The shortened form &quot;Bo&#x27;ness&quot; first appears in the 18th century.

==History==
===Roman history===

Bo&#x27;ness has important historical links to the Roman period and marks the eastern extent of the Antonine Wall (at Carriden in the north-east of Bo&#x27;ness) which stretched from Bo&#x27;ness to Old Kilpatrick on the west coast of Scotland. The Antonine Wall was named as an extension to the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2007. A Roman fortlet can still be seen at Kinneil to the west of Bo&#x27;ness.

Roman artefacts, some with inscriptions, have been found in the eastern part of the town at Carriden. A Roman fort called &quot;Veluniate,&quot; long since lost to history, once stood on the site now occupied by the grounds of Carriden House. Indeed, it is said that stones from the fort were used in the building of the mansion house.

Several artefacts have been uncovered over the years by the local farming community, including the Bridgeness Slab with many of them now on display in the National Museum of Scotland or at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. A replica was unveiled by Bo&#x27;ness Community Council and Falkirk Council on 7 September 2012 in Kinningars Park. A video about its history and manufacture is available online. Other Roman sites have been identified at Muirhouses (known locally as &#x27;The Murrays&#x27;) and Kinglass on the south-east side of the town.
===Commerce and industrial===

The town was a recognised port from the 16th century. Coal was shipped from Bo&#x27;ness to supply Edinburgh Castle in 1548. A harbour was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1707. The harbour, built in stages in the 18th century, was extended and complemented by a dry dock in 1881 (works designed by civil engineers Thomas Meik and Patrick Meik). The commercial port (heavily used for the transport of coal and pit props) eventually closed in 1959, badly affected by silting and the gradual downturn of the Scottish coal mining industry. Plans currently exist for the regeneration of the docks area including reopening the port as a marina though these are on hold indefinitely. Shipowning and maritime businesses in the town is evidenced by the ownership of , a ship owned by the Lovart Company of Bo’ness, that later sank in a collision off Denmark. Bo&#x27;ness was granted the right of exports and customs dues in 1672 and the office was transferred from Blackness. A large Customs House for the harbour was completed in 1880 on Union Street and still stands today as private dwellings.

Bo&#x27;ness was a site for coal mining from medieval times. Clay mining was carried out on a smaller scale. The shore was the site of industrial salt making, evaporating seawater over coal fires. The ruins of several fisheries (fish storage houses) along the shoreline evidences long gone commercial fishing activity. The town was also home to several sizable potteries, one product being the black &#x27;wally dugs&#x27; which sat in pairs over many fireplaces. Metalworking is still carried out, and examples of the Bo&#x27;ness Iron Company&#x27;s work are to be found in many places.

Kinneil Colliery was a large coal mine on the western edge of the town, that at its peak employed over 1,200 people. Production at the mine began in the late 19th century, expanded significantly after 1951 and was eventually merged with the Valleyfield Colliery via a tunnel underneath the Forth, connecting the two collieries. The mine closed in 1982 due to ‘severe geological conditions’. Today the above ground site is a nature reserve open to the public.
When the town&#x27;s commissioners bought the land for the Bo&#x27;ness Town Hall and park in the 1890s, the town&#x27;s prosperity was on the rise. By its completion, the story was not so encouraging. Plans for the town hall and original library were approved however by the Dean of Guild Court on 14 October 1902. The building was officially opened on 14 September 1904. As part of the ceremony, a memorial stone was laid beneath which was placed a glass jar containing a copy of The Scotsman The Glasgow Herald, Bo&#x27;ness Journal and Linlithgow Gazette, a list of councillors and a copy of the council minutes.

In the twentieth century Bo&#x27;ness was one of several Scottish ports involved in the shipbreaking industry. The shipbreaking yard was established by the Forth Ship Breaking Company (1902–20), which was then taken over by P&amp;W Maclellan who continued operating until about 1970. On a high spring tide the ship destined to be broken up would be manoeuvred to the far (north) side of the river and then steamed across with all speed to drive her as far as possible up the beach. A fo’c’stle crew would lower the ship&#x27;s anchors as soon as she came to rest to stop her sliding back into the river. The bows would come almost up to Bridgeness Road. Among many ships scrapped at the yard were the ocean liners and , cargo ship , and warships , , &quot;Newark&quot;, , &quot;Ramsey&quot;, and .

&quot;The Bo&#x27;ness Journal and Linlithgow Gazette&quot; was a newspaper published in the town. It is now &quot;The Linlithgow Journal and Gazette&quot;. The newspaper officers were at 37–43 North Street which was built in 1884 and today is a category B listed building in the town.

==Economy and landmarks==

Ballantine Bo&#x27;ness Iron Company and Ballantine Engineering is an ironworks company in Bo’ness. The company was founded in 1856 and has produced ironworks for bridges in the UK, including the fascia panels of Westminster Bridge and North Bridge in Edinburgh. The company went into administration in 2013 but was revived with government support as ‘Ballantine Castings’ in 2014. In 2019, the company produced ironwork replacements for the roof of the Palace of Westminster and Elizabeth Tower. Other industry in the town includes Walker timberyard and sawmill which is in Bo&#x27;ness beside the Forth on the Carriden Industrial Estate.

One of the main local employers is the Ineos petrochemical facility (formerly BP) in nearby Grangemouth.

Kinneil House is a historic house to the west of Bo&#x27;ness now in the care of Historic Scotland. It sits within a public park, which also incorporates a section of the Roman Antonine Wall. Kinneil was mentioned by Bede, who wrote that it was named &quot;Pennfahel&quot; (&#x27;Wall&#x27;s end&#x27;) in Pictish and &quot;Penneltun&quot; in Old English. It was also Pengwawl in old Welsh. In the grounds of Kinneil House is the ruin of the small cottage where James Watt worked on his experimental steam engine and the steam cylinder of a Newcomen engine. The remains of an engine house are in Kinningars Park, off Harbour Road.

Dymock&#x27;s Building is a Category A listed 17th century former merchant&#x27;s house, finished in orange harling. The house was restored in the late 1990s under the management of the National Trust for Scotland and the Pollock Hammond partnership. It is now used as social housing, being split into 8 separate dwellings.

==Culture==
===Community and culture===
Bo&#x27;ness is now primarily a commuter town, with many of its residents travelling to work in Edinburgh, Glasgow or Falkirk. Present-day attractions in the town include the Bo&#x27;ness &amp; Kinneil Railway, the Birkhill Fireclay Mine and the local motor museum. Kinneil House, built by the powerful Hamilton family in the 15th century, lies on the western edge of the town. 

Bo&#x27;ness is also home to the recently refurbished Hippodrome Cinema, which is the oldest picture house in Scotland. The building, along with many other buildings in Bo&#x27;ness, was designed by Matthew Steele, a local resident and architect. The Hippodrome was built in 1912. Some footage of it survives from 1950 during the Bo&#x27;ness Children&#x27;s Fair Festival. The Bo&#x27;ness Children&#x27;s Fair Festival continues to this day, covered by Valley FM, a local radio station that broadcasts for a limited number of days each year to cover the festival.

Bo&#x27;ness also has their own theatre name The Barony Theatre, Bo&#x27;ness which was transformed into a theatre in the 20th Century, prior to this it was known as a primary school &#x27;Borowstoun Primary&#x27;. Annually, their band of players &#x27;The Barony Players&#x27; put on acclaimed plays such as The Steamie, Gregory&#x27;s Girl, Dad&#x27;s Army and The Crucible. They also host visiting companies who produce in their venue such as the annual pantomime which is always a sell out success.

The town&#x27;s war memorial is on a hill overlooking the Forth on Stewart Avenue. The war memorial is in the form of a large granite obelisk and was unveiled on 12 July 1924, with later plaques added after the Second World War. The town also has a commemorative clock and lantern, erected in 1985 through donations from the Linlithgow and Bo&#x27;ness Rotary Club.

The current Bo&#x27;ness library is in a restored early 18th century building (previously the West Pier Tavern) on Scotland Street. The previous Carnegie library was in the Town Hall but moved to its current home in 1980 once conversions were completed.

===Religion===

There are a number of churches, including Bo&#x27;ness Old Kirk, Carriden Parish Church, St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church, Craigmailen United Free Church, St. Catharine&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Bo&#x27;ness Apostolic Church, Bo&#x27;ness Baptist Church, The Bo&#x27;ness Salvation Army and St. Mary of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church. Rev Albert Bogle, minister at the town&#x27;s St Andrew&#x27;s Church, was the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2012 to 2013. Craigmailen United Free Church is a Victorian Gothic church constructed between 1883 and 1885 and designed by the architects McKissack &amp; Rowan. Bo&#x27;ness Old Kirk is a Victorian church that was completed in the Corbiehall area of the town in 1888 and that replaced a much older church building.

===Sport===
Bo&#x27;ness is home to the football club Bo&#x27;ness United, and also to Bo&#x27;ness United Ladies and Bo&#x27;ness United Under 16s. A large fire damaged Bo&#x27;ness United&#x27;s football ground in June 2019. It was the home to Bo&#x27;ness F.C. until 1932.

Bo&#x27;ness Academy has a rugby team. Bo&#x27;ness RFC has had its first ever rugby club established in September 2011. Bo&#x27;ness Cycling Club was reformed in 2010 as Velo Sport Bo&#x27;ness. Jim Smellie was 11 times Scottish Cycling Champion, and some of the trophies collected over the years can be viewed at Kinneil House Museum.

Bo&#x27;ness has also played an important role in British motorsport. Hillclimb events, including the first ever round of the British Hill Climb Championship and several thereafter, were held on a course on the Kinneil estate most years from 1932 until 1966. Since 2008, an annual Revival event for classic road-going and competition cars has been held on approximately the same course. Bo&#x27;ness Hill Climb is a hillclimbing course on the Kinneil Estate (site of the historic Kinneil House).

===Parks===

Bo&#x27;ness has several community parks and recreation grounds. Douglas Park is one of the largest parks in Bo&#x27;ness, it has views looking across the River Forth and includes a children&#x27;s play area, football fields and a pavilion. The park was the site of a geophysics survey in 2020 that identified two prehistoric round barrows underneath the park. Glebe Park is a small formal park in the town centre adjacent to Bo&#x27;ness Town Hall, with a Bandstand at its centre that was constructed in 1902 by the Walter McFarlane &amp; Co Saracen Foundry and which is now on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.

<text>Class is a 1983 American comedy-drama film directed by Lewis John Carlino, starring Rob Lowe, Jacqueline Bisset, Andrew McCarthy, and Cliff Robertson. In addition to being Lowe&#x27;s second film (released four months after &quot;The Outsiders&quot;), it marked the film debuts of McCarthy, John Cusack, Virginia Madsen, Casey Siemaszko, and Lolita Davidovich.

==Plot==
Upon first arriving at prep school, Jonathan Ogner is mocked for wearing his school uniform. Then, going up to his dorm he meets his roommate, who introduces himself as Squire Franklin Burroughs IV but tells him to call him &quot;Skip&quot;. Skip then takes off his bath robe, revealing a red bra and panties, then explains to the shocked Jonathan that it is tradition for seniors to parade around campus wearing only girls&#x27; underwear.

Jonathan does not have any, so Skip gives him a set from his dresser. They head out of the dorm together until they get to the final door where Skip stays behind and locks the door. The other students laugh and mock Jonathan for wearing girls&#x27; underwear. Mortified, Jonathan tries to get back inside. After discovering all the doors are locked, he climbs a trellis leading into his room where he finds Skip rolling on the floor laughing.

Skip tries to tell Jonathan it was a practical joke and to laugh it off, but Jonathan is too embarrassed. Later, during lunchtime in the cafeteria, the other students again taunt Jonathan as he tries to eat. When Skip invites him over to his table to sit with him and his friends, Jonathan turns to reveal that he is crying. Skip is now deeply remorseful for pulling the prank on Jonathan as he flees the cafeteria.

When Skip returns to their room to apologize to Jonathan, he finds him hanging with a rope around his neck in an apparent suicide. Going to get help, on his return to the room, Skip and the gathering crowd find not Jonathan but a mannequin with a picture of the dean&#x27;s face attached to its head. The crowd crack up hysterically at Skip as the dean says he wants to see him and Jonathan in his office. As the crowd disperses, Skip finds Jonathan very much alive and laughing hysterically in the closet. He grudgingly accepts the prank reversal and they become fast friends. Afterwards they share secrets, and Jonathan confesses he cheated on the SAT.

After several failed attempts to find Jonathan a date, Skip vows to help him have a successful sexual encounter. He sends Jonathan to Chicago to gain sexual experience before their reputations are ruined. He is picked up by Ellen, a beautiful older woman, and has an affair with her. He falls in love with her, although she considers it to be just a fling. Jonathan lied, claiming to be a Ph.D. student. When he proclaims his love to Ellen during one of their sessions, she has second thoughts about continuing. Her decision is finalized when she discovers Jonathan is both much younger than he had claimed and that he also attends the same school as her son.

Over Christmas break, Skip invites Jonathan to spend Christmas with him and his family at the Burroughs estate. Here, Jonathan discovers that Ellen is Skip&#x27;s mother and is married. He tries to end the affair, but she contacts him several times. Eventually, he agrees to meet to talk. Lying to Skip, he claims to need time alone. When Jonathan and Ellen meet, they have sex again. Attempting to cheer up his friend, Skip and friends go to the hotel room. There they discover Jonathan in bed with Skip&#x27;s mother, upsetting Skip. Later, the friends have a fist fight, but later reconcile.

==Cast==

==Production==
Principal photography for the film took place in Chicago and the surrounding area between September and November 1982. Suffield House, a private mansion in Lake Forest, played the part of Skip Burroughs&#x27; family estate, given the fictitious address of 65 Spring Creek Road, Barrington Hills. Lake Forest College was used for numerous scenes; including the hockey scenes, the exterior dorm scenes, and, most notably, the lunchroom scenes.

Bisset replaced Lesley Ann Warren for the role of Ellen Burroughs. Bisset was disappointed that scenes involving her character&#x27;s backstory were cut. These included a scene at the end where her son visited her in a mental hospital. &quot;When you&#x27;re in a comedy ... It&#x27;s always difficult to develop a character because they always cut for comedy, the comic effect. I lost a couple of scenes that would have explained my character better. She was more interesting in the original script. Why does she do what she does? She&#x27;s a very unhappy woman. She doesn&#x27;t have any relationship at home. Cliff tells her in the bedroom that she&#x27;s a Burroughs and as long as she&#x27;s a Burroughs she must behave. That&#x27;s not much of a relationship to have with your husband. So she&#x27;s a bit off balance, greatly in need of a childlike component in her life. She&#x27;s been completely buckled down by Cliff. There&#x27;s absolutely no fantasy aspect to her life. She&#x27;s condemned to being an adult... The director sees it much more as a rites-of-passage film&quot;, Bisset said.

McCarthy attended an open call held at New York University and wound up with the lead part in the film.

Lowe said, &quot;It was a very atypical role for me. So it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable when I&#x27;m too readily associated with it. &#x27;Oh yeah, him, he was in &quot;Class&quot;.&#x27; It was such an extroverted role, and most of my work has been just the opposite. I like the movie. I think it was fun, not the vile concoction a lot of people seem to think it was.&quot;
Madsen dislikes talking about her experience making the film, stating in a 2013 interview, &quot;Those guys were assholes. They were really shitty to me. It was bad. Bad memories.&quot; Rob Lowe said her comment was justifiable, pointing out &quot;her big part in that movie required her shirt to get ripped off, and looking back, it couldn&#x27;t be a more egregious, vintage, lowbrow, 1980s &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;-esque, shoehorned-in moment... I can imagine it was not much fun to do that big sequence with a bunch of laughing, ogling frat-boy actors. I mean, can you imagine putting up with me, [John] Cusack, Alan Ruck, and Andrew McCarthy at 18?&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 29% rating based on reviews from 14 critics.

&quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;&quot;Class&quot; is anything but classy...[It] seems something like an unofficial remake of one of Bisset&#x27;s first Hollywood efforts, the 1969 &quot;The First Time&quot;&quot;.

Vincent Canby wrote &quot;The movie can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it&#x27;s a lighthearted comedy, set in what appears to be a posh New England–style prep school just outside Chicago, or a romantic drama about a teen-age boy who has a torrid affair with his roommate&#x27;s mother. Either way it&#x27;s pretty awful.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said it was a &quot;prep-school retread of &quot;The Graduate&quot; that knows some of its scenes are funny and some are serious, but never figures out quite how they should go together;&quot; the film is &quot;entertaining when it&#x27;s not dealing with its real subject matter, painful when it is, and agonizing when it confuses rigid mortification with humor.&quot;

<text>Dumbarton (; , or ; or , meaning &#x27;fort of the Britons&#x27;) is a town in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, on the north bank of the River Clyde where the River Leven flows into the Clyde estuary. In 2006, it had an estimated population of 19,990.

Dumbarton was the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, and later the county town of Dunbartonshire.
Dumbarton Castle, on top of Dumbarton Rock, dominates the area. Dumbarton was a royal burgh between 1222 and 1975.

Dumbarton emerged from the 19th century as a centre for shipbuilding, glassmaking, and whisky production. However, these industries have since declined, and Dumbarton today is increasingly a commuter town for Glasgow east-southeast of it. Dumbarton F.C. is the local football club. Dumbarton is home to BBC Scotland&#x27;s drama studio.

== History ==
Dumbarton history goes back at least as far as the Iron Age and probably much earlier. It has been suggested that in Roman times Dumbarton was the &quot;place of importance&quot; named as Alauna in Ptolemy&#x27;s historic map. Dumbarton is also sometimes associated with the little-known, and hard to place, Roman province of Valentia. However, more recent studies favour locations in England or Wales for this province. In post-Roman times the settlement at Dumbarton was known as Alcluith, there is a record in Irish chronicles of the death of Guret, &quot;rex Alo Cluathe&quot; (&quot;king of Clyde Rock&quot;), in AD 658.

The fortress of Dumbarton was the stronghold of the kingdom of Alclud, and the centre of Breton power in northern Britain, for more than two centuries from the mid-seventh century, until the Vikings destroyed the fortress after a four-month siege in 870. The loss of the British power base led to the emergence of the new kingdom of Strathclyde, or Cumbria, with a major centre at Govan. The title &quot;king of the Britons of Srath Clúade&quot; was first used in 872. Dumbarton was later the county town of the county of Dunbartonshire, formerly known as &quot;Dumbartonshire&quot;. The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Dùn Breatainn&quot; meaning &quot;fort of the Brythons (Britons)&quot;, and serves as a reminder that the earliest historical inhabitants of Clydesdale spoke an early form of the Welsh language.

Alexander II granted the status of royal burgh in 1222.

In September 1605 Chancellor Dunfermline reported to King James VI that inundations of the sea were likely to destroy and take away the whole town. It was estimated that the flood defences would cost 30,000 pounds Scots, the cost being levied nationwide.

A bridge over the River Leven had been proposed in 1682. The Old Dumbarton Bridge was eventually built in 1765 by John Brown of Dumbarton, at the site of a ferry crossing. It was constructed at the behest of the Duke of Argyll, who was anxious to obtain access to Glasgow from his estate at Rosneath. The bridge, with five segmental arches with rounded cutwaters, resulted in the extension of Dumbarton to West Bridgend. The bridge was substantially developed in 1884 and 1934. It is now B-listed and was refurbished in 2006.

Hartfield House was completed in 1853.
During World War II Dumbarton was heavily bombed by the German air force. The Germans were targeting the shipyards, and the area in the vicinity of the yards was consequently hit, with Clyde and Leven Street being severely damaged. In an attempt to lure the German aircraft away from the shipyards, decoy lights were routinely placed on the Kilpatrick hills above the town, lights were set out on reservoirs to mimic those of the shipyards reflecting on the waters of the Leven and Clyde. The ploy was sometimes successful in diverting the bombers and many bombs fell harmlessly onto the moors and lochs. The Auchenreoch Muir &#x27;Starfish&#x27; site above Dumbarton was part of a system of decoy fires operated by the RAF that used pyrotechnics to simulate the appearance of the incendiaries dropped by the German pathfinder aircraft, thereby diverting the bombers from their intended targets. 23 bomb craters are still identifiable in the area around the surviving control bunker as evidence of the success of the diversion.
The one time village and estate of Dumbuck now lie partly within the boundary of Dumbarton, while the remaining portion comprising the associated Dumbuck Hill and its large incorporated quarry (Dumbuck Quarry) are treated here together with the neighbouring village of Milton, as the next adjacent generally recognised locality today. In the Dumbarton portion, the Category B-listed Dumbuck House, originally constructed for Colonel Andrew Geils, was the original estate house and was converted into a hotel in the 20th century; more recently it has been permitted to fall into disrepair and its future is currently uncertain. For additional information regarding the Dumbuck estate, including mention of the somewhat bizarre Kosmoid Company that occupied the estate for a short while, refer the article on Andrew Geils. Information on the well known &quot;Dumbuck Crannog&quot; archaeological feature is presently included in the Wikipedia article for Milton Island.

=== Castle ===


Dumbarton Castle sits on Dumbarton Rock, a volcanic plug dating back 334 million years, at the east bank mouth of the River Leven, where it flows into the Clyde estuary.

The Castle has an illustrious history and many well-known figures from Scottish and British history have visited it. The castle was a royal fortress long before Dumbarton became a royal burgh; its ownership went from Scottish to English and back again. The castle was an important place during the Wars of Independence and was used to imprison William Wallace for a short time after his capture by the English. It was from here that Mary, Queen of Scots, was conveyed to France for safety as a child. Mary was trying to reach Dumbarton Castle when she suffered her final defeat at Langside. In later times, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II visited the castle.

Today, Dumbarton Rock is a Scheduled Ancient Monument; it has legal protection in order to maintain and conserve the site for the future. As such any sort of work on the rock is strictly regulated by the Scottish Government and activities such as climbing on the rock are forbidden. From the top of the castle can be seen both the River Clyde and Leven Grove Park.

=== Levengrove Park ===
Levengrove Park was developed in 1885 on grounds of the former Levengrove Estate by the Denny and McMillan families who owned shipbuilding companies with yards located adjacent to the Castle, and gifted to the town.

A grave site in the park sits as the resting place for the viscera of former Scottish king Robert the Bruce. Removal of these &quot;viscera&quot; for local burial was commonplace at the time, when a person&#x27;s remains were to be transported a long distance for their own burial.

== Geography and governance ==

From 1975 Dumbarton lent its name to a local government district in the Strathclyde region of Scotland. In 1996 the administrative functions of this district transferred to the West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute unitary councils (see Subdivisions of Scotland). West Dunbartonshire Council is based in modern offices within the old Dumbarton Burgh Hall in Church Street.

There is a Dumbarton constituency of the Scottish Parliament and a former Dumbarton constituency of the House of Commons.

===Districts===
There are a number of distinct areas within the town:
* Barnhill
*Bellsmyre
*Brucehill
*Castlehill
* Dumbarton East incl. Newtown
* Garshake
*Kirktonhill
* Levengrove
*Oxhill
*Silverton
*Townend
* Westcliff
* West Bridgend

==Education==

Two secondary schools are located in Dumbarton, namely Dumbarton Academy and Our Lady &amp; St Patrick&#x27;s High School. The town is also served by eight primary schools; Aitkenbar Primary, St. Michael&#x27;s Primary, Knoxland Primary, Braehead Primary, St. Peter&#x27;s Primary, St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary and Dalreoch Primary.

== Economy and transport ==

=== Shipbuilding ===
From the mid 18th century to the early 19th century Dumbarton&#x27;s main industry was glassmaking. As the glass industry declined the town became a major centre for shipbuilding and remained so well into the 20th century. There were many shipbuilding yards, although a number of them were later absorbed by larger yards. A great many ships were built in the town, the most famous of which is probably the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; which was built by Scott &amp; Linton, she was one of the final Tea Clippers to be built, and one of the fastest. The ship is the last survivor of its type and can be seen today at dry dock in Greenwich, London.

=== William Denny and Brothers ===
The last major Dumbarton shipyard was William Denny and Brothers which closed in 1963, and the remaining smaller yards followed over the next few decades. Until recently, the old Denny&#x27;s shipyard tender &quot;The Second Snark&quot; was still in use on the Firth of Clyde as a passenger ferry and cruise boat. Denny&#x27;s was an innovative company that had a reputation for research and development; high-pressure turbines and hull stabilisation were two areas where they were highly respected. They even built an early design of helicopter in 1909 and in their final years they were involved in hovercraft development in the form of the Denny D2 Hoverbus. A film clip of this vessel on its maiden trip to Oban exists in the Scottish Film Archive.

The last surviving part of the Denny&#x27;s shipbuilding company is the Denny Ship Model Experiment Tank which forms part of the Scottish Maritime Museum. This was the first commercial ship model testing tank built in the world and it retains many original features today: a water tank as long as a football pitch, clay moulding beds for casting wax model ship hulls and the original Victorian machinery used for shaping models.

During the Second World War Blackburn Aircraft were to produce Sunderland flying boats from a factory adjacent to Denny&#x27;s shipyard.

There is still a shipyard on the river Leven, Sandpoint Marina. A statue of the shipbuilder and shipowner, Peter Denny, stands outside the Municipal Buildings.

=== Whisky ===

Whisky production also grew to become a major industry in the town. In 1936 Canadian distilling company Hiram Walker bought over the Glasgow-based distiller George Ballantine &amp; Son Ltd. In 1938 they built a large whisky distillery on the river Leven (on the site of the Archibald McMillan shipyard). As a result, the town became known as a major centre of the whisky industry in the mid to late 20th century. Hiram Walker itself was acquired by Allied Breweries in 1988 to form Allied Distillers, itself becoming part of Allied Domecq before eventually being taken over in 2005 by the French-based alcohol giant Pernod Ricard. The large Dumbarton distillery had been mothballed since 2002 and not long after the Pernod-Ricard takeover the giant red-brick buildings of the Dumbarton &#x27;Ballantine&#x27;s&#x27; distillery which had dominated the town for over sixty years were earmarked for demolition and redevelopment, the remains of the distillery were demolished throughout January and February 2017. The large bonded warehouse complex to the east of the town and the bottling complex to the north-west were retained.

Other whisky-related site closures such as the Inverleven distillery which closed in 1991 and the J&amp;B Scotch Whisky bottling plant and bond in the north of the town have contributed to the decline in Dumbarton&#x27;s importance to the drink industry. However, part of the J&amp;B bond has found a new life as a film set for television productions such as &#x27;
River City, Still Game and Two Doors Down.

Ballantine&#x27;s Whisky became well known for the rather unusual &#x27;security&#x27; guards used at their bonded warehouse complex at Dumbuck in Dumbarton; these are a large flock of white Chinese geese that were first introduced in 1959. Starting with just six individuals, this has risen to close to 100 birds today. They have the nickname &#x27;The Scotch watch&#x27; and have been widely used in promotional material for the Ballantine&#x27;s blended whisky. The geese are part of the tradition of the facility, and are both a tourist attraction and advertising icon. The Goosekeeper at the time (as of 1996) was Arthur Carroll, but as of 1997 they have been replaced by CCTV cameras.

=== Other industries ===
With the decline of the whisky industry, Dumbarton is becoming more a commuter town for those who work in nearby Glasgow and other locations. The Faslane naval base is a major employer for the area. The Strathleven Industrial Estate near Dumbarton was once the location of several major manufacturers such as Burroughs (Adding Machines) and Westclox. Technology overtook these companies and they closed down with the loss of many jobs.

The estate has also been the home of Polaroid UK since 1965. This was the largest Polaroid plant outside the US and at its peak it employed about 1800 people. Failing to recognise the impact of digital photography was its downfall and while they still have a presence in Dumbarton, fewer than 100 people are now employed there (mainly in the manufacture of sunglass lenses). The generator supplier Aggreko plc has had a facility in the town since the 1970s, in 2012 it opened a new, larger facility at the former J&amp;B plant.

=== Transport ===
Dumbarton is situated on the main A82 road, linking Glasgow to the western Scottish Highlands. Dumbarton is a short distance from Balloch pier, where cruises can be taken on Loch Lomond. Dumbarton is also served by three railway stations: Dumbarton Central, Dumbarton East and Dalreoch railway station. All three stations are situated on the North Clyde Line, which provides a direct link from Helensburgh in the west, through Glasgow Queen Street to Edinburgh Waverley in the east.

=== Media ===

Nation Radio Scotland, the local commercial radio station for West Dunbartonshire is based in the town, having moved from Clydebank in 2016. It formerly was named &quot;Dumbarton Festival Radio&quot;, &quot;Castle Rock FM&quot; until 2003, and then Your Radio until 2020.

The town has two local weekly newspapers, &quot;The Lennox Herald&quot; and &quot;The Dumbarton Reporter&quot;.

== Culture ==

=== Sports ===

There were at one stage two league football clubs from the town, Dumbarton Harp F.C and Dumbarton F.C (Also known as &#x27;Sons of the Rock&#x27;). Dumbarton F.C. are the only league club in Dumbarton still in operation, playing in the Scottish Professional Football League at Scottish League Two level.

Dumbarton F.C play home games at the Dumbarton Football Stadium (known as the C&amp;G Systems Stadium for sponsorship reasons) adjacent to Dumbarton Rock. They won the 1882–83 Scottish Cup and are five times runners-up.

The Scottish League was formed in 1890 with Dumbarton as founding members. The first championship was shared between Dumbarton and Rangers, in the absence of a goal-difference rule to act as a tiebreaker.

There are seven bowling clubs in Dumbarton: Brock Bowling Club, Dixon BC, Dumbarton BC, Dumbuck BC, Eastfield BC, Rock BC and Townend BC.

The town is the birthplace of the motor-racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart OBE. He competed in Formula One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers&#x27; Championships. The Stewart Family owned and ran the garage at Dumbuck in Milton to the East of the town, the Garage later being taken over by Jackie&#x27;s close friend John Lindsay.

=== Arts ===

Scottish poet Robert Burns was made freeman of Dumbarton. He refers to Dumbarton in a letter written on 7 July 1787.
:&quot;... I have lately been rambling over by Dumbarton and Inverary, and running a drunken race on the side of Loch Lomond with a wild Highlandman; his horse, which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather, zigzagged across before my old spavin’d hunter, whose name is Jenny Geddes, and down came the Highlandman, horse and all, and down came Jenny and my bardship; so I have got such a skinful of bruises and wounds, that I shall be at least four weeks before I dare venture on my journey to Edinburgh.&quot;

Dumbarton is also immortalised in the traditional Scottish song &quot;Dumbarton&#x27;s Drums&quot;.
:&quot;Across the fields of bounding heather,&quot;
:&quot;Dumbarton sounds the hour of pleasure;&quot;
:&quot;The joy I know will know no measure,&quot;
:&quot;When Johnnie kneels and kisses me.&quot; (one verse) 
The song was recorded by the internationally renowned Midgies Ceilidh Band at a live concert in Saint Augustine&#x27;s Church in the town&#x27;s High Street, the chorus being sung by the audience of local people.

Novelist A. J. Cronin&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Archibald Montgomerie, owned a hat shop at 145 High Street.

Dumbarton is the birthplace of David Byrne, a Grammy Award, Academy Award and Golden Globe-winning musician best known as the founding member and principal songwriter of new wave band Talking Heads.

=== Royal Scottish Pipe Band Championships ===
Held in Dumbarton since 2000, the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Championships sees over 140 bands enter yearly, including representatives from Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and Ireland. The championships is one of the biggest and most prestigious pipe band events in the world. Besides the pipe band championships there is a funfair and Highland dancing competitions.

=== Theatre ===
The Denny Civic Theatre is used by a number of local groups, including the Dumbarton People&#x27;s Theatre.

=== Overtoun House ===
Overtoun House is a mansion in the Scots Baronial style built on an estate in the hills overlooking the town between 1859–1862 for a wealthy chemical manufacturer originally from Glasgow, John Campbell White.

<doc id="358245" wikidata="Q1010998" url="?curid=358245" title="Portree">
<text>Portree (; , ) is the capital and largest town of the Isle of Skye in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. It is a civil parish and lies within the Highland council area, around from its administrative centre of Inverness.

Portree has a harbour, fringed by cliffs, with a pier designed by Thomas Telford. Attractions in the town include the former Aros Centre, now the Isle of Skye Candle Co. Visitor Centre, which celebrates the island&#x27;s Gaelic heritage. Further arts provision is made through arts organisation ATLAS Arts, a Creative Scotland regularly-funded organisation. The town also serves as a centre for tourists exploring the island.

Around 939 people (37.72% of the population) can speak Scottish Gaelic.

Portree is connected to the Skye Bridge by the A87 road, which then leads northwards to Uig. The A855 road also leads north out of the town, passing through villages such as Achachork, Staffin and passes the rocky landscape of the Storr before reaching the landslip of the Quiraing.

==Etymology==
The current name, &#x27; translates as &#x27;king&#x27;s port&#x27;, possibly from a visit by King James V of Scotland in 1540. However this etymology has been contested, since James did not arrive in peaceful times. The older name appears to have been &#x27;, meaning &#x27;slope harbour&#x27;.

Prior to the 16th century the settlement&#x27;s name was Kiltaraglen (&#x27;the church of St. Talarican&#x27;) from Gaelic &quot;&quot;.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
Archaeological investigations in advance of construction of a housing development in 2006–2007, by CFA Archaeology, uncovered evidence of occupation of Portree from the Early Bronze Age to the Medieval period (the earliest radiocarbon date was 2570 BC, and the latest was AD 1400). They also found stone tools that indicated people were in the area in the Early to Mid Neolithic, possibly as far back as the Late Mesolithic.

The archaeologists discovered the remains of timber roundhouses, a circular ditch-defined enclosure, miniature souterrains, probable standing stone sockets and an assortment of pits. While not many artefacts were recovered there was an assemblage of Beaker pottery. This was the first discovery of a site dating from the Later Bronze Age on the Isle of Skye.

The archaeologists also found evidence of the shooting range that was created in the 1800s with the formation of the Rifle Volunteer movement, set up in 1859 to defend the country against a potential French invasion. The first official unit in Portree was the 8th Inverness-shire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed in July 1867.

==History==
In the 1700s, the town was a popular point of departure for Scots sailing to America to escape poverty. This form of use repeated during the famine in the 1840s. Both times, the town was saved by an influx of boats, often going between mainland Scotland and the Outer Hebrides, who used Portree&#x27;s pier as a rest point. The town also began exporting fish at this time, which contributed greatly to the local economy.

The Royal Hotel is the site of MacNab&#x27;s Inn, the last meeting place of Flora MacDonald and Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746.

The town had the last manual telephone exchange in the UK, which closed in 1976.

==Tourism==

Portree is considered to be among the &quot;20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland&quot; according to Condé Nast Traveler and is visited by many tourists each year.

A report published in mid 2020 indicated that visitors added £211 million in a single year to the Isle of Skye&#x27;s economy, prior to travel restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was expected to decline substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Skye is highly vulnerable to the downturn in international visitors that will continue for much of 2020 and beyond&quot;, Professor John Lennon of Glasgow Caledonian University told a reporter in July 2020.

In 2016, over 150,000 people stopped at the VisitScotland centre in Portree, a 5% increase over 2015. Overcrowding during peak season was a problem, however, before the pandemic, since it is &quot;the busiest place on the island&quot;. One news item recommended that some tourists might prefer accommodations in quieter areas such as Dunvegan, Kyleakin and the Broadford and Breakish area.

The 2020 reports did not cover tourism in Portree specifically but a December 2018 report by well-known travel writer Rick Steves had recommended the village as &quot;Skye’s best home base&quot; for visitors. He indicated that Portree &quot;provided a few hotels, hostels and bed-and-breakfasts in town, while more B&amp;Bs line the roads into and out of town&quot;. The tourism bureau added that visitors would appreciate the &quot;banks, churches, cafes and restaurants, a cinema at the Aros Centre, a swimming pool and library, (...) petrol filling stations and supermarkets&quot;.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and STV North (formerly Grampian Television). Television signals are received from one of the local relay transmitters (Penifiler and Skriaig).

Portree is served by nation-wide stations, BBC Radio Scotland on 92.9 FM and BBC Radio Nan Gaidheal (for Gaelic listeners) on 104.7 FM. The local radio station Radio Skye is a community based station that broadcasts to the Isle Of Skye and Loch Alsh on 106.2 FM and 102.7 FM.

==Education==
Portree now has 6 schools. This includes 2 primary schools (Portree Primary School and Portree Gaelic Primary School) one high school (Portree High School) one nursery (Portree Nursery) one Pre-school (Portree Pre-school) and one college (Portree College).

== Sport ==
The town plays host to the Isle of Skye&#x27;s shinty club, Skye Camanachd. They play at Pairc nan Laoch above the town on the road to Struan.

Portree is home to two football clubs that play in the Skye and Lochalsh amateur football league called Portree and Portree Juniors.

Portree is now home to a new youth football club, Skye Young Boys.

==Climate==

Like most of the British Isles, Portree has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). The nearest weather station to Portree is located at Prabost, approximately north-west of Portree.

==Portree shale==
Portree shale is a geologic association in the vicinity of Portree, the existence of which is linked with potential petroleum occurrences of commercial importance.

<text>Helensburgh ( ; ) is a town on the north side of the Firth of Clyde in Scotland, situated at the mouth of the Gareloch. Historically in Dunbartonshire, it became part of Argyll and Bute following local government reorganisation in 1996.

==History==
===History context (Prehistoric–1858)===
Although it has long been known that there are some prehistoric remains in the Helensburgh area, recent fieldwork by the North Clyde Archaeological Society has uncovered more. However the oldest building in the town itself is Ardencaple Castle which was the ancestral home of Clan MacAulay, and the history of which may date back to the twelfth century. Today only one tower of this building remains, the rest having been demolished in 1957–59.
In 1752 Sir James Colquhoun (died 1786), chief of the Clan Colquhoun of Luss, bought the land which was to become Helensburgh; at that time it was known by such names as Malig, Millig or Milligs.

In 1776 he placed an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper seeking to feu the land, and in particular he stated that &quot;bonnet makers, stocking, linen and woolen weavers will meet with encouragement&quot;. However his efforts were unsuccessful, partly because roads were rudimentary and also because the shore at Helensburgh made it unattractive to shipping – it was shallow, dotted with large rocks and subject to a prevailing onshore wind.

No precise date is known for the change of name to Helensburgh. However it was probably around 1785 when Sir James decided to name the town after his wife, Lady Helen Sutherland (1717–1791); she was the granddaughter of the 16th Earl of Sutherland. However, for a few years both the old and new names for the town were in use and it was also known for a time simply as the New Town. The town&#x27;s coat of arms is based on those of the Colquhouns and the Sutherlands.

Helensburgh received its burgh charter from King George III in 1802. This was somewhat surprising, as the 1799 Statistical Account of Scotland indicates that Helensburgh only had a population of about 100 at that time. To commemorate the bicentenary of the burgh charter in 2002 many members of Helensburgh Heritage Trust combined to produce a special history book of the town. Henry Bell (1767–1830) had arrived in Helensburgh by 1806. By training he was a millwright, but he had also worked for a period in a shipyard at Bo&#x27;ness. He probably designed and built the Baths Inn which he and his wife then ran as a hotel; he designed and built other buildings, such as Dalmonach Works at Bonhill in West Dunbartonshire (now demolished) and St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church in Carluke in South Lanarkshire. The Baths Inn later became the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, and it is now private accommodation as part of Queen&#x27;s Court at 114 East Clyde Street.

===&quot;Comet&quot;===
At that time the taking of baths (hot and cold, fresh water and salt water) was considered to be advantageous to the health. As a result of his initiative Helensburgh began to develop as a holiday resort, and Bell also served as the town&#x27;s first recorded Provost from 1807–09.

When Henry Bell came to Helensburgh, roads to Glasgow were in poor condition and the journey by boat could take several days, depending on the strength and direction of the wind and on tidal conditions. Consequently, in 1812 Henry Bell introduced the paddle steamer &quot;Comet&quot; to bring guests from Glasgow in comfort and more speedily to his hotel. The &quot;Comet&quot; was the first commercial steamship in Europe.

That this vessel and subsequent steamships could travel straight into the wind meant that Helensburgh&#x27;s shallow shore line was a much smaller problem for sailors. As a result, the town began to grow from a population of about 500 in 1810 to 2,229 by the 1841 Census. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Bell in Scottish and British economic history; not only was he a pioneer of tourism, but it can also be argued that the later pre-eminence of the River Clyde in shipbuilding was in no small measure due to him.

===Railway revolution===

Following the arrival of the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway in 1858 the population of Helensburgh grew even more rapidly, reaching 5,964 in the 1871 Census. The Municipal Buildings, designed by John Honeyman, were completed in 1879.

Glasgow at this time was developing very rapidly as an industrial city, but this rapid growth caused it to become dirty, smoky and unpleasant. The railway meant that the wealthier business people of Glasgow could now set up home in the fresh air of Helensburgh and commute daily between the two places. This led to the expansion of the town northwards up the hill and the building of many substantial Victorian villas. The best known of these is The Hill House which was designed in 1902–03 by Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and which now belongs to the National Trust for Scotland. These parts of the town are laid out in the gridiron pattern, Helensburgh being an early example of a planned town in Scotland. 

In 1960 the line from Helensburgh Central to Glasgow Queen Street Low Level and on to Airdrie was electrified with the then revolutionary new Blue Trains providing faster, regular interval services. Unfortunately, equipment problems led to the temporary withdrawal of the Blue Trains which did not return to traffic until late 1961. Since then traffic on this route has risen steadily, helped from October 2010 when two trains each hour commenced running right through to Edinburgh via the newly re-opened (and electrified) Airdrie-Bathgate line.

By the late 1870s the North British Railway Company (which had become owner of the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway) felt that its steamer services were at a competitive disadvantage, because passengers had to walk from Helensburgh Station, through the town centre and down the pier, thus causing longer journey times. By contrast their competitors on the other side of the Clyde, the Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway had stations right beside their piers. The North British therefore proposed to extend the railway line through the town centre from the station on to the pier.

This proposal split opinion in the town down the middle, with Parliament ultimately deciding against it. Consequently, the North British Railway Company decided to build its &quot;station in the sea&quot; at Craigendoran just outside the eastern boundary of the town, and this opened in 1882. Shipping services stopped in 1972 but Craigendoran railway station remains in use. In 1894 the West Highland Railway (a subsidiary of the North British Railway by then) was opened from Craigendoran junction to Fort William, with a new station at Helensburgh Upper. This new railway had no significant effect on the population of the town, but it did alter its appearance, with the construction of a substantial embankment up the hill from Craigendoran and of a deep cutting on the approaches to Helensburgh Upper.

===World War I and II===

There are 205 men and 1 woman named on Helensburgh&#x27;s war memorial in Hermitage Park. In 2020 the Helensburgh War Memorial Project published its researches and added a further 59 &quot;missing names&quot; to the list; all were men. It also gave a variety of explanations as to why these names were not on the war memorial. If the 1911 census is used, which recorded a population of 8,529, then it can be calculated that Helensburgh lost three percent of its population to the war. This is a particularly significant portion when it is considered that women, children, and elders, amongst other demographics, were not conscripted for the front line. It is thought that a similar number suffered serious physical and mental injuries. 

When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the British Government was concerned that London and other ports in the south of England would become the targets for German bombing. Consequently, they decided to build two military ports in Scotland which would be more difficult for German bombers to reach. In 1941 Military Port Number 1 opened at Faslane on the Gareloch, 5 miles (8 km) from Helensburgh. A railway was built linking Faslane to the West Highland Line. A vast tonnage of wartime supplies was moved through Faslane, and it was also used as a port for troop movements. Much of the area around Helensburgh was taken over by both British and American Armed Forces for a variety of wartime activities.

After the end of the War, Faslane was split in two. The southern half was used by the Royal Navy and the northern half for shipbreaking until 1980. In 1957 the Royal Navy closed its submarine base in Rothesay Bay and transferred it to Faslane. Six years later the British Government decided to buy seaborne nuclear weapons from the United States and to base them in submarines at Faslane which became known as the Clyde Submarine Base. This decision had a substantial impact on Helensburgh and the surrounding area particularly with the provision of housing for naval personnel. A further increase in the town&#x27;s population resulted, it rising to 15,852 in the 1991 Census. From 1996 surface vessels have also been based there, and this caused a change of the official name to Her Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base Clyde.

===Recent history and regeneration===

In 1971, Helensburgh was given its first conservation area, covering The Hill House and Helensburgh Upper Station. This was joined in 1994 by The Upper Helensburgh Conservation Area, which includes architectural works by William Leiper and Baillie Scott, and in 2019, by the Town Centre Conservation Area. 

In a 2006 survey, Helensburgh was shown to be the second most expensive town in which to buy property in Scotland.

The town contains many tree-lined streets, and the cherry blossom in the Spring is a particular feature; a consequence is that the town has been referred to as &quot;the Garden City of the Clyde&quot;. In 2016 the Helensburgh Tree Conservation Trust was invited to become a member of The National Tree Collections of Scotland because the range and quality of its street trees; at the time no other Scottish town had received this accolade.

In 2015, Colquhoun Square underwent a major redesign (as part of a wider redevelopment project that included the west esplanade) where parts of the square were pedestrianised. An integral part of this redesign was the creation of the award-winning Outdoor Museum, which consisted of the erection of 120 plinths, which over time would be gradually filled with items or replicas connected with Helensburgh&#x27;s history and character, including a puppet&#x27;s head used by John Logie Baird in his first television experiments and the ship&#x27;s bell from Henry Bell&#x27;s paddle steamer &quot;Comet&quot;. In addition, a number of brass plaques have been set into the pavements and these give a description of the condition of the streets of the town in 1845.

That same year, the previously derelict Clyde Street School reopened as the Helensburgh and Lomond Civic Centre of Argyll and Bute Council after significant renovations and the addition of both a new wing and public cafe. Displays from the collections of Helensburgh Heritage Trust can also be seen there.

The Tower Digital Arts Centre, housed in the former St Columba Church on Sinclair Street, was converted in 2016 into a first release double screen cinema and arts centre for the town.

The West King Street Hall next door was converted and took on a new role two years later as the Scottish Submarine Centre. The Centre now houses the last (1955) Stickleback-class submarine built for the Royal Navy.

In 2016 proof was found that a building long suspected of having been designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was actually his work. It was built as the Helensburgh &amp; Gareloch Conservative Club, and the top floor only of this large building is now known as the Mackintosh Club. It is located in the town centre at 40 Sinclair Street. 

Three years later, Helensburgh&#x27;s other Mackintosh work, the Hill House, became enclosed in a protective structure, known as &quot;The Box&quot;, a cautionary measure intended to slow down damages caused by damp penetration by allowing for the building to dry out. The design of The Box is notable for its chainmail mesh walls as well as the internal walkways that allow visitors to view Hill House&#x27;s exterior from elevated viewpoints.

In June 2021, a pavilion was added to Hermitage Park, marking the end of a four-year project. The Park Pavilion is a Passivhaus design, believed to be the first non-domestic Passivhaus building in Scotland.

In October the following year, a £22 million leisure centre was officially opened on the Helensburgh pier, replacing the previous swimming pool which had closed two months prior. The building&#x27;s roof was heavily damaged by Storm Éowyn in January 2025.

==Geography and geology==

Helensburgh is northwest of Glasgow. The town faces south towards Greenock across the Firth of Clyde, which is approximately wide at this point. Ocean-going ships can call at Greenock, but the shore at Helensburgh is very shallow, although to the west of the town the Gareloch is deep.

Helensburgh lies at the western mainland end of the Highland Boundary Fault. This means that the hills to the north of Helensburgh lie in the Highlands, whereas the land to the south of Helensburgh is in the Lowlands or Central Belt of Scotland. Consequently, there is a wide variety of landscape in the surrounding area – for example, Loch Lomond (part of Scotland&#x27;s first National Park) is only over the hill to the north-east of Helensburgh. Although the Highland Boundary Fault is not geologically active, very minor earthquakes do occur occasionally in the area.

During the last ice age, the weight of the ice pushed the land downwards. Consequently, when the ice melted, sea levels were higher than they are now. Evidence of this can clearly be seen in Helensburgh where the first two blocks of streets nearer the sea are built on a raised beach. Behind them the land rises up quite steeply for one block and then rises more gently – and this is a former sea cliff which has been eroded. The land, now free of the weight of the ice, is slowly rising up, and the minor local earthquakes reflect this.

Further evidence of the last ice age can also be seen at low tide, where the beach is dotted with large boulders known as glacial erratics – these were carried from a distance inside the glaciers and dropped into their current locations when the glaciers melted.

==Climate==

Helensburgh has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Transport==

The town is served by three railway stations: Helensburgh Central, Craigendoran, and Helensburgh Upper. Both Helensburgh Central and Craigendoran form part of the North Clyde Line, with Helensburgh Central acting as a terminus. Helensburgh Upper, meanwhile, is positioned on the West Highland Line and accommodates the Caledonian Sleeper. 

Helensburgh is also served by a number of buses. These provide links to Glasgow, the Vale of Leven and Carrick Castle.

A special local form of transport is the paddle steamer &quot;Waverley&quot; which used to call in to Helensburgh pier during summer sailings. It advertises itself as the last sea-going paddle steamer in the world and was launched in 1946 for service from Craigendoran pier; however Craigendoran pier is now derelict, services having been withdrawn in 1972. Towards the end of 2018 Helensburgh pier was closed to all maritime craft because of its poor condition, and so there is no certainty as to when calls by the &quot;Waverley&quot; will resume.

==Demographics==
===Population and employment===

In 2022 the National Records of Scotland estimated the population of Helensburgh to be 13,230. Helensburgh today acts as a commuter town for nearby Glasgow, and also serves as a main shopping centre for the area and for tourists and day trippers attracted to the town&#x27;s seaside location. Helensburgh is also influenced by the presence of the Clyde Naval Base at Faslane on the Gareloch, which is home to the United Kingdom&#x27;s submarine fleet with their nuclear weapons, as well as a major local employer.

===Religion===

Most of the major Scottish Christian denominations have churches in Helensburgh. The biggest of these was the Church of Scotland which by 1880 had 5 congregations in the town, each with its own building. However, with falling church attendances, and a vision to rationalise resources to better enable mission, these had all merged by 2015, so that the only Church of Scotland congregation is Helensburgh Parish Church in Colquhoun Square. Helensburgh is the largest Church of Scotland Parish in Scotland.

The Scottish Catholic Church has a significant influence within the town, with a parish church named St Joseph&#x27;s on Lomond Street. St Joseph&#x27;s church hall was originally the parish church in Helensburgh.

The St. Michael and All Angels Church holds distinction for being the town&#x27;s only category A listed church. This building for the congregation of the Scottish Episcopal Church was designed in 1868 by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.

===Education===

Overall, there are seven schools within Helensburgh. 

Among these are three state primary schools: Colgrain, John Logie Baird, and Hermitage Primary. These schools provide pupils for Hermitage Academy, the town&#x27;s state secondary school. Helensburgh also has a Roman Catholic state primary school, namely St. Joseph&#x27;s. 

Parklands School is also provided by Argyll and Bute Council and is a purpose-built school for pupils with Complex Special Educational Needs. Standing in the School grounds is Ardlui House which provides residential short breaks for up to 2 weeks for the same types of children and young people.

The sole independent school, Lomond School, was founded in 1977 as a result of a merger between St Bride&#x27;s School (which was for girls) and Larchfield School (which was primary only and for boys). Both primary and secondary education are provided at Lomond School and the school caters for both day pupils and boarders, a large proportion of the latter coming from abroad.

===Medical services===

The town has two medical practices, both located within the same Medical Centre in East King Street. There are also a number of dentists and opticians in the town.

Built as the Victoria Infirmary, the Victoria Integrated Care Centre no longer cares for in-patients and the original building is now little used. However a variety of clinics do take place in buildings in the grounds.

In 2006 the Helensburgh district opted to come within the NHS Highland area, which is based in Inverness. However, because of the great distance between the Helensburgh area and Inverness, NHS Highland has an arrangement with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde which ensures that the latter provides the services needed locally.

===Sport and leisure===

Sports are well represented with various football, rugby, cricket, athletics, netball, hockey, curling, bowling, golf, sailing and fishing clubs amongst others active in the town. The seafront has an indoor swimming pool, an esplanade walk, a range of shops, cafes and pubs, and sailing facilities including Helensburgh Sailing Club.

Helensburgh is home to a number of annual events, with the local branch of the Round Table running an annual fireworks display on Guy Fawkes Night and hosting a Real Ale Festival. Helensburgh &amp; Lomond Highland Games take place annually around the start of June.

In regard to the arts, Helensburgh has a digital arts centre, known as The Tower, which functions as a cinema and also hosts live performances in music and theatre.

There are a number of footpaths in and around Helensburgh, and it is also the starting point for some long distance walking and kayaking. In the town itself there are footpaths inside the Duchess Woods, Argyll &amp; Bute&#x27;s only local nature reserve. 

A longer footpath is the Three Lochs Way which connects Loch Lomond with Helensburgh, the Gareloch and Loch Long, and which runs for 34 miles (55 km). 

The longest by far of all the walks with a local start is the John Muir Way. This commemorates John Muir who is celebrated worldwide as the &quot;Father of National Parks&quot; and runs from Helensburgh for 134 miles (215 km) to his birthplace at Dunbar in East Lothian.

The Clyde Sea Lochs Trail is a road route from Dumbarton, through Helensburgh, round the Rosneath Peninsula, and ending at Arrochar, with information panels along the way.

The Argyll Sea Kayak Trail also starts at Helensburgh pier, but finishes at Oban measuring at a distance of around 95 miles (150 km).

<doc id="358249" wikidata="Q442501" url="?curid=358249" title="João Manuel, Prince of Portugal">
<text>Dom João Manuel, Hereditary Prince of Portugal () (3 June 1537 – 2 January 1554) was a Portuguese &quot;infante&quot; (prince), the eighth child of King John III of Portugal by his wife Catherine of Austria, daughter of Philip I of Castile and Joanna of Castile. As the heir to the throne he was styled Prince of Portugal.

== Early life ==

João Manuel was born on 3 June 1537 in the Royal Palace of Évora and became the heir to the throne of Portugal in 1539. He survived his four older brothers who died in childhood but was a sickly teenager. The successive inter-marriages between the houses of Spain and Portugal are believed to have some responsibility for his ill health.

On 11 January 1552, he married Princess Joanna of Spain, his double-first cousin, through both paternal and maternal line, daughter of his paternal aunt Isabella of Portugal and of his maternal uncle, Emperor Charles V.

== Death ==

João Manuel died of what the sources refer to as consumption, the old term used to refer to tuberculosis, on 2 January 1554, but some historians believe his death occurred as a result of diabetes, a disease inherited from his maternal grandfather, Philip I. Eighteen days later, a posthumous son was born, who later became Sebastian I of Portugal.

<text>Brentwood is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C., Bounded by Rhode Island Avenue NE, the train tracks of the Rhode Island Ave-Brentwood Metro station, Montana Avenue NE, and New York Avenue NE. And is named after the Brentwood Mansion built at Florida Avenue and 6th Street NE in 1817 by Robert Brent, the first mayor of Washington City. He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor on her marriage as second wife to Congressman Joseph Pearson, and it stood for a hundred years before burning down in 1917.

==History==
The mansion stood on a large expanse of land, a farm owned by Mayor Robert Brent, that also went to Eleanor. Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further. The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present neighborhood known as Brentwood. Images of the mansion may be found in the book &quot;Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington&#x27;s Destroyed Buildings&quot; by James W. Goode, and in several books in the collection of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. A descendant (Edward Sisson) of the family that owned the mansion throughout its existence has posted a collection of paintings, drawings, photos, and histories of the mansion online in an &quot;album&quot; titled &quot;Worthington House and Brentwood Mansion&quot; on a Mac Web Gallery site. The Frick Art Reference Library has drawings, paintings, and perhaps photographs (although none appear to be accessible on-line as of late 2007). On the Web, a small drawing of the mansion, together with a brief description of its owners in 1873, Capt. and Mrs. Carlile Pollock Patterson, may be found in &quot;Washington Outside and Inside&quot; by George Alfred Townsend, at page 620, searchable as a Google book.

The design of Brentwood Mansion has traditionally been ascribed to the Capitol&#x27;s architect, Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The 2006 book &quot;The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe&quot;, by Michael W. Fazio and Patrick Alexander Snadon (who call the house the Pearson House) states that this is uncertain. At the time of the house&#x27;s design, Latrobe was suffering family troubles and his records for this period are poor.

During the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (1869–1877), Brentwood Mansion was a center of Washington social life, with many parties hosted by Elizabeth (Eliza) Worthington Patterson (daughter of Joseph Pearson and his third wife Catherine Worthington Pearson) and her husband Carlile Pollock Patterson. Patterson had known Grant since 1852; Patterson&#x27;s brother-in-law David Dixon Porter, married to Patterson&#x27;s sister George Ann, was the highest-ranking Admiral in the US Navy; and Patterson&#x27;s brother Thomas H. Patterson was commander of the Washington Navy Yard (1873–1876) before becoming the Rear Admiral in command of the Asiatic Squadron (1877–1880). Patterson Street, N.E., which is adjacent to the property, was probably named for the Patterson family.

C.P. Patterson, a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department, had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it. After C.P. Patterson&#x27;s death in 1881, long-delayed financial problems came to a head, and on June 6, 1884, three years after Patterson&#x27;s death, Congress enacted a private bill, House bill No. 4689, entitled &quot;An act for the relief of Eliza W. Patterson,&quot; C.P. Patterson&#x27;s widow, excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land. President Chester A. Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill, but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature. In a message dated June 21, 1884, the President explained &quot;I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer, in view of the services he had rendered his country, from the burdens of taxation, but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law.&quot;

After five more years of drift in management of the property, in March 1889, Patterson&#x27;s son-in-law, Lt. Francis Winslow (II) USN (oldest brother of future Rear Admiral Cameron Winslow), after 19 years of Naval service during the slow-promotion post-war years, resigned from the Navy to devote himself to subdividing, renting, developing, and selling portions of the property. He was successful. A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the United States Supreme Court, Francis Winslow v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR Co., 188 U.S. 646 (1903), which includes excerpts of the will by which Mrs. Patterson came into the property on the death of her mother, Catherine Worthington Pearson, in 1868. The suit, which the Patterson/Winslow family won, involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad. (Winslow (II) also developed an expertise in oysters, having led government surveys in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. A &quot;google&quot; search on &quot;Francis Winslow&quot; and &quot;oyster&quot; returns dozens of &quot;hits,&quot; referring to the Francis Winslow who managed the Brentwood property. His work is still cited today (2007) as authoritative and accurate. Winslow was also a leader of US government survey expeditions in Nicaragua, studying potential routes for a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific.).

The death of Francis Winslow (II) in 1908, suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle, led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers. In 1917, 100 years after it was built, the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned, and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp, Camp Meigs. Three of Francis Winslow (II)&#x27;s sons were officers in World War I, and they may have staged in that camp, on their own family land. In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished. Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co., a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s.

In the 1920s, Lt. Winslow&#x27;s son, Francis Winslow (III), ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson/Winslow land. His most notable achievement was the development of the Union Market. For years called the Florida Avenue Market, it still operates after 80 years as the city&#x27;s principal wholesale food and produce market.

In the early 1940s, the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as &quot;square 710&quot;, on which stands the new headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (200 Florida Avenue, N.E.). The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow (III) as trustee, asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate. Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum, whereupon, according to the family, the District informed him that it simply didn&#x27;t have the money to pay the larger judgment. Regardless of payment or nonpayment, title had vested in the government. At about this time, Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17-year-old daughter in a 1946 car accident, and was then diagnosed with cancer. He died in 1948.

His youngest brother Cameron, an insurance executive in Hartford, CT, stepped in as trustee, but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court-ordered price of &quot;square 710.&quot; If not, there may be the ironic situation of a government law-enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price. Cameron Winslow, determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property, and unable to manage the properties day-to-day from Hartford, began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s, completing the last of the sales in the 1960s, breaking up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before.

Over the decades, much of the land was acquired by or donated to Gallaudet University, a prominent school for the deaf. Cogswell Hall, a residence hall of Gallaudet University, is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion. According to a website on Washington ghost stories, students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl. Allegedly, blankets have been yanked off, an unplugged alarm clock went off, papers have moved with no draft or breeze, there are feelings of being watched, and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there.

==Brentwood today==
Brentwood neighborhood as it is today (whose boundaries are somewhat different than the original Brent property, as increased by Pearson) is trapezoidal in its geography. It is bounded by New York Avenue to the south, Montana Avenue to the east, Rhode Island Avenue NE to the north, and the tracks of the Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor to the west. It is serviced by the Rhode Island Ave–Brentwood Metro station. Politically, Brentwood is in Ward 5.

It is best known as the site of the Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr. Processing and Distribution Center, the postal mail sorting facility through which anthrax-contaminated mail addressed to two members of the U.S. Senate passed in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Curseen and Morris were members of the American Postal Workers Union, AFL–CIO who died after exposure to the anthrax in the incident. The facility was closed October 21, 2001, because of anthrax contamination and did not reopen until December 21, 2003.

The area also is the site of a major rapid transit rail maintenance facility of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA), the principal public transit operator in metropolitan Washington, D.C.

<text>Ffion Llywelyn Hague, Baroness Hague of Richmond, (&quot;née&quot; Jenkins; 21 February 1968) is a Welsh broadcaster, author, former civil servant, and wife of Conservative politician William Hague. Born Ffion Jenkins in Cardiff, she is a native Welsh speaker and first became known when she was selected to teach the language to her future husband when he was Secretary of State for Wales.

She is the younger sister of Manon Antoniazzi, who served as the assistant private secretary to Prince Charles and is now Chief Executive and Clerk of the Senedd.

== Early life ==
She is the daughter of Emyr and Myra Jenkins. Her father was a television presenter, director of the Eisteddfod, and the chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales. Her mother was a Welsh tutor and magistrate. She attended Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, a Welsh-language comprehensive school in Cardiff, and went on to study English at Jesus College, Oxford. After graduating she joined the civil service. She played the clarinet in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and sang in the National Youth Choir of Wales.

== Career ==
Hague was a director of the Outward Bound Trust from 1 April 2009 until 7 December 2012. She was a director of Hanson Green, an executive recruitment firm from 11 December 2003, until it merged with Directorbank on 1 February 2008. Previously, she had been a director of &quot;The Voices Foundation&quot; from 23 September 1998, until she resigned on 12 July 2005.

Hague is also a published author best known for her biography of David Lloyd George, entitled &quot;The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George&#x27;s Life&quot;. For S4C, she presented the series &quot;Mamwlad&quot; (2012), &quot;Tri Lle&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dwy Wraig Lloyd George&quot; (2009). She has also presented programmes for BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4.

== Personal life ==
She met William Hague in 1995, when she became his private secretary at the Welsh Office. Because of the embarrassment caused by the previous Welsh secretary John Redwood, who was unable to sing the Welsh national anthem, it was decided that his successor should learn the words.

They were married on 19 December 1997, at the Palace of Westminster, and currently reside in Richmond, North Yorkshire. When her husband was raised to the peerage in 2015 as Baron Hague of Richmond, she became The Lady Hague of Richmond. William Hague disclosed in September 2010 that she had suffered a number of miscarriages as they tried to start a family. They do not have any children.

In 2015 the couple became owners by purchase of Cyfronydd Hall near Welshpool, Wales. 

Hague was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours &#x27;for Public Service and to Business&#x27;.

<doc id="358256" wikidata="Q7989116" url="?curid=358256" title="Westminster Abbey Choir School">
<text>Westminster Abbey Choir School is a boarding preparatory school for boys in Westminster, London and the only remaining choir school in the United Kingdom which exclusively educates choristers (i.e. only choirboys attend the school). It is located in Dean&#x27;s Yard, by Westminster Abbey. It educates about 30 boys, aged 8–13 who sing in the Choir of Westminster Abbey, which takes part in state and national occasions as well as singing evensong every day (except Wednesday) and gives concert performances worldwide. Recent tours include to America, Hungary and Moscow. Other tours have included Australia, America and Hong Kong.
The school is one of only three choir schools that educate only the male trebles of the choir, the others being Saint Thomas Choir School in New York City and Escolania de Montserrat in Spain.
The headteacher is Dr Emma Margrett who became the first female headteacher of Westminster Abbey Choir School on 1 January 2024. The organist and master of the choristers is Andrew Nethsingha, former Director of Music at St John’s College Cambridge.

<doc id="358259" wikidata="Q6271068" url="?curid=358259" title="Poles in the Soviet Union">
<text>The Polish minority in the Soviet Union are Polish diaspora who used to reside near or within the borders of the Soviet Union before its dissolution. Some of them continued to live in the post-Soviet states, most notably in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, the areas historically associated with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan among others.

==History of Poles in the Soviet Union==

===1917–1920===

Millions of Poles lived within the Russian Empire (along with Austria-Hungary and the Prussian Kingdom) following the military Partitions of Poland throughout the 19th century, which resulted in the extinction of the Polish state. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, followed by the Russian Civil War, the majority of the Polish population saw cooperation with the Bolshevik forces as betrayal and treachery to Polish national interests. Polish writer and philosopher Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz lived through the Russian Revolution while in St. Petersburg. What he saw, had a profound effect on his works, many of which display themes of the horrors of the Civil War he witnessed.
Among the many Polish victims of the revolution was the father of Polish eminent composer Witold Lutosławski, Marian Lutosławski and his brother Józef, murdered in Moscow in 1918 as alleged &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;.

There were also some Poles (or those of partial Polish descent) associated with the communist movement. Famous revolutionaries include Konstantin Rokossovsky, Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, Julian Marchlewski, Stanislaw Kosior, Karol Świerczewski and Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka secret police which would later turn into the NKVD. The Soviet Union also organized Polish units in the Red Army and a Polish Communist government-in-exile, however the former were persecuted and subject to mock trials following the end of the Second World War and the latter being appointed and installed by the Soviet regime as opposed to the legitimate government-in-exile based in London. Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee was created in 1920 but failed to control Poland.

===1921–1938===
Polish communities were inherited from Imperial Russia after the creation of the Soviet Union. After World War I, Poland reestablished itself as an independent country, and its borders with the USSR were finalized by the Peace of Riga in 1921 at the end of the Polish-Soviet War, which left significant territories populated by Poles near or within the confines of the Soviet Union. According to the 1926 Soviet census, there were a total of 782,334 Poles in the USSR. The largest concentration of Poles was in what was then Soviet Ukraine, where according to the Soviet census in 1926 476,435 Poles lived. Those estimates are considered to have been lowered by Soviet officials. Church and independent estimates show estimates of 650,000 to 700,000 Poles living in that area. This suggests that the total Polish population of the USSR was in excess of 1,000,000.

Initially the Soviets pursued a policy where the local national language was used as a tool for eradication of national identity in favour of &quot;communist education of masses&quot;. In the case of the Poles this meant a goal of Sovietisation of the Polish population. However this proved extremely difficult as the Soviet communists themselves realised that the Poles were en masse opposed to communist ideology, seeing it as hostile to Polish identity and their predominant Roman Catholic religion. The policy of religious discrimination, plunder and terror further strengthened Polish resistance to Soviet rule. As a result, the Soviet authorities started to imprison and forcefully remove all those seen as an obstacle to their policies.

Two Polish Autonomous Districts were created, with one in Belarus and one in Ukraine. The first one was named &quot;Dzierzynszczyzna&quot;, after Felix Dzierżyński; the second was named &quot;Marchlewszczyzna&quot; after Julian Marchlewski. Following the failure of the Sovietisation of the USSR&#x27;s Polish minority, the Soviet rulers decided to portray Poles as enemies of the state and use them to fuel Ukrainian nationalism in order to direct Ukrainian anger away from the Soviet government. After 1928 Soviet policies turned to outright eradication of Polish national identity. Special centers were established where the youth was indoctrinated towards hatred against the Polish state, all contacts with relatives within Poland were dangerous and could result in imprisonment. Newspapers printed out in the Polish language were de facto used to print anti-Polish propaganda. Following attacks on the Polish minority, from 18 February 1930 till 19 March 1930 over 100,000 people from Polish areas were expelled by the Soviet authorities.

Following the collectivization of agriculture under Joseph Stalin, both autonomies were abolished and their populations were subsequently deported to Kazakhstan in 1934–1938. 
In 1936 the Poles were deported from the territories of Belarus and Ukraine adjacent to the state border (the first recorded deportation of a whole ethnic group in the USSR). Tens of thousands of ethnic Poles became victims of the Great Purge in 1937–1938 (see Polish operation of the NKVD). The Communist Party of Poland was also decimated in the Great Purge and was disbanded in 1938. Another decimated group of Poles was the Roman Catholic clergy, who opposed the forced atheization.

A number of Poles fled to Poland during this time, among them Igor Newerly and Tadeusz Borowski.

===1939–1947===
During World War II, after the Soviet invasion of Poland the Soviet Union occupied vast areas of eastern Poland (referred to in Poland as &quot;Kresy wschodnie&quot; or &quot;eastern Borderlands&quot;), and another 5.2–6.5 million ethnic Poles (from the total population of about 13.5 million residents of these territories) were added, followed by further large-scale forcible deportations to Siberia, Kazakhstan and other remote areas of the Soviet Union.

The number of Poland&#x27;s citizens held captive in the Soviet Union is a matter of dispute, and ranges from over 300,000 up to nearly 2 million, according to various sources. On March 30, 2004, the head of the Archival Service of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, General Vasili Khristoforov gave alleged exact numbers of deported Poles. According to him, in 1940 exactly 297,280 Poles were deported, in June 1941 another 40,000. These numbers do not include POWs, prisoners, small groups, people arrested trying to cross the new borders, people who voluntarily moved into the USSR, and men drafted into the Red Army and into construction battalions or &quot;stroybats&quot;.

In August 1941, following the German attack on the USSR and the dramatic change in Soviet/Polish relations, according to a January 15, 1943, note from Beria to Stalin, 389,041 Polish citizens (including 200,828 ethnic Poles, 90,662 Jews, 31,392 Ukrainians, 27,418 Belarusians, 3,421 Russians, and 2,291 persons of other nationalities) held in special settlements and prisoner of war camps were granted &#x27;amnesty&#x27; and allowed to enroll in Polish army units. The location of reception centres was kept secret and no travel facilities provided. Nevertheless, 119,855 Poles were evacuated to Iran with General Anders&#x27; army, which subsequently fought alongside the Allies in Iran and Italy; 36,150 were transferred to the Polish Army which fought with the Red Army on the Eastern Front and 11,516 are reported to have died in 1941–1943.

The following are cases of direct executions of Poles during the 1939–1941 occupation:
*Katyn massacre about 22,000
* executions of prisoners after the German invasion 1941.

After World War II most Poles from &quot;Kresy&quot; were expelled into Poland, but officially 1.3 million stayed in the USSR. Some of them were motivated by the traditional Polish belief that one day they would become again lawful owners of the land they lived on. Some of them were kept forcefully in. Some simply stayed, without force or ideological reasons.

Wanda Wasilewska was an exceptional case – she became a Soviet citizen and did not return after the war.

===1947–1991===
The Polish minority was one of the few whose numbers decreased over time, according to official statistics. There was also the repatriation of Poles (1955–1959).

After 1989, Poles who survived in Kazakhstan started to emigrate due to national tensions, mainly to Russia and, supported by an immigration society, to Poland. The number remaining is between 50,000 and 100,000.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the following post-Soviet countries have significant Polish minorities: 
*Lithuania, around 250,000 (7% of population), see also Polish minority in Lithuania,
*Belarus, at least 420,000 (almost 4.5% of population), see also Polish minority in Belarus,
*Ukraine, at least 150,000, see also Polish minority in Ukraine,
*Russia, more than 100,000, see also Polish minority in Russia,
*Kazakhstan – between 60,000 and 100,000, see also Poles in Kazakhstan.
*Latvia, around 50,000, see also Poles in Latvia.
*Azerbaijan – between 1,000 and 2,000, see also Poles in Azerbaijan.
*Polish minorities are also found in Georgia, Moldova and Uzbekistan.

==Demographics==

<text>The Player is a 1992 American satirical black comedy mystery film directed by Robert Altman and written by Michael Tolkin, based on his 1988 novel. The film stars Tim Robbins, Greta Scacchi, Fred Ward, Whoopi Goldberg, Peter Gallagher, Brion James and Cynthia Stevenson, and is the story of a Hollywood film studio executive who kills an aspiring screenwriter he believes is sending him death threats.

&quot;The Player&quot; has many film references and Hollywood in-jokes, with 65 celebrities making cameo appearances in the film. Altman once stated that the film &quot;is a very mild satire,&quot; offending no one. The film received three nominations at the 65th Academy Awards: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. The film also won two Golden Globes, Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical and Best Actor – Comedy or Musical for Robbins.

==Plot==
Griffin Mill is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow. He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only twelve out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming exec Larry Levy begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.

Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane, and Kahane&#x27;s girlfriend June Gudmundsdottir tells him that Kahane is at the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena, at a screening of &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill&#x27;s offer, calling him a liar and continuing to goad him about his job security at the studio. In the bar&#x27;s parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water while screaming, &quot;Keep it to yourself!&quot; Mill then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery.

The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, studio security chief Walter Stuckel confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane&#x27;s funeral and gets into conversation with Gudmundsdottir. Detectives Avery and DeLongpre suspect Mill is guilty of murder.

Mill receives a postcard from the stalker suggesting that they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley and Andy Sivella, who pitch &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;, a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker does not appear. After leaving the bar, Mill receives a fax in his car, advising him to look under his raincoat. He discovers a live rattlesnake in a box and, terrified, bludgeons it with his umbrella.

Mill tells Gudmundsdottir that his near-death experience made him realize he has feelings for her. Apprehensive that Levy continues encroaching on his job, Mill invites the two writers to pitch &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; to him, convincing Levy that the movie will be an Oscar contender. Mill&#x27;s plan is to let Levy shepherd the film through production and have it flop. Mill will step in at the last moment, suggesting some changes to salvage the film&#x27;s box office, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. Having persuaded Sherow to leave for New York on studio business, Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship blossoms.

After Sherow confronts Mill about his relationship with Gudmundsdottir, Mill coldly severs their relationship in front of two writers. Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to an isolated Desert Hot Springs resort and spa. In the middle of Mill and Gudmundsdottir making love, Mill confesses his role in Kahane&#x27;s murder, and Gudmundsdottir responds by saying she loves him. Mill&#x27;s attorney informs him that studio head Joel Levison has been fired, and that the Pasadena police want Mill to participate in a lineup. An eyewitness has come forward, but she fails to identify Mill.

One year later, studio power players are watching the end of &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; with a new, tacked-on, upbeat ending and famous actors in the lead roles. Mill&#x27;s plan to save the movie has worked and he is head of the studio. Gudmundsdottir is now Mill&#x27;s wife and pregnant with his child. Sherow objects to the film&#x27;s new ending and is fired by Levy. Mill rebuffs her when she appeals her termination to him. Mill receives a pitch over the phone from Levy and a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Recognizing the pitch as blackmail, Mill gives the writer a deal, if he can guarantee an ending in which the executive lives happily with the writer&#x27;s widow. The writer&#x27;s title for the film is &quot;The Player&quot;.

==Production==
Writer-producer Michael Tolkin initially had no intention of allowing his 1988 novel, &quot;The Player&quot;, to be adapted into a film, having written it to distance himself from his career in the movie industry. However, when producer David Brown acquired the film rights, he urged Tolkin to adapt it himself. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they sought financing and refined the script, Tolkin ventured into directing with &quot;The Rapture&quot; (1991) and enlisted that film&#x27;s producer, Nick Wechsler, to join &quot;The Player&quot;″s production team. The producers encountered difficulties in selling the film, as studio executives doubted the appeal of a narrative centered on the inner workings of Hollywood filmmaking. Cary Brokaw, the CEO of Avenue Pictures, rejected the script twice, in 1989 and 1990. However, in 1991, after witnessing Altman&#x27;s work on the British film &quot;Vincent &amp; Theo&quot; (1990), Brokaw approached Altman, who eagerly embraced the project.

Principal photography for the film commenced in mid-June 1991 in Los Angeles, California, with an eight-week schedule. Before production, meticulous planning went into crafting the film&#x27;s opening scene, an eight-minute unbroken tracking shot. Models were utilized to map out the shot, and the studio lot location was resurfaced to ensure smooth movement for the dolly and crane. The day before filming, the actors and crew rehearsed the scene. Altman filmed ten takes. Notably, Altman instructed actor Fred Ward, portraying a studio security chief, to incorporate references to other films renowned for their tracking shots into his dialogue to add irony to the scene.

Altman also successfully persuaded a plethora of A-list actors to make cameo appearances in the film based on his esteemed reputation in the industry. These stars agreed to participate without reviewing the script and contributed their union-scale salaries for one day of filming to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, a retirement community for industry professionals. Despite the large ensemble, the film was completed within a budget ranging from approximately $8 to $10 million. Funding for the project came from Avenue Pictures&#x27; &quot;internal funds&quot; and the pre-sale of foreign rights to Spelling International. Furthermore, principal actors agreed to defer their wages. Chevy Chase was interested in playing the role of Griffin Mill, but Warner Bros. didn&#x27;t want Chase to star in the film.

Despite the difficulties of funding, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were highly sought-after by nearly every major Hollywood studio. Eventually, Fine Line Features, a division of New Line Cinema, secured the rights with a guarantee of $5.1 million. President of Fine Line Features, Ira Deutchman, stated that the film would be promoted as a comedy to attract audiences who might not typically be interested in a movie about Hollywood. Release dates were strategically planned to coincide with the 64th Academy Awards in March 1992, aiming to capitalize on the ceremony&#x27;s publicity and generate word-of-mouth buzz. Preview screenings were positive. The filmmakers hoped audiences would be drawn to the film&#x27;s story rather than its celebrity cameos; therefore, Altman insisted on not featuring the actors&#x27; names in advertisements.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Bitingly cynical without succumbing to bitterness, &quot;The Player&quot; is one of the all-time great Hollywood satires — and an ensemble-driven highlight of the Altman oeuvre.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars out of four and called it &quot;a smart movie, and a funny one. It is also absolutely of its time. After the savings and loan scandals, after Michael Milken, after junk bonds and stolen pension funds, here is a movie that uses Hollywood as a metaphor for the avarice of the 1980s. It is the movie &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; wanted to be.&quot; Gene Siskel also gave the film a perfect four-star grade and wrote, &quot;If you knew nothing and cared nothing about the movie business, you can still appreciate &quot;The Player&quot; as a ripping good thriller, too.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Robert Altman has not really been away. Yet his new Hollywood satire titled &quot;The Player&quot; is so entertaining, so flip and so genially irreverent that it seems to announce the return of the great gregarious film maker whose &quot;Nashville&quot; remains one of the classics of the 1970&#x27;s&quot;.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Mercilessly satiric yet good-natured, this enormously entertaining slam dunk represents a remarkable American come-back for eternal maverick Robert Altman.&quot; Terrence Rafferty of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a brilliant dark comedy about the death of American filmmaking,&quot; adding: &quot;In this picture Altman is doing one of his specialties: exploring an odd American subculture—revealing its distinctive textures and explicating the peculiar principles of social intercourse which keep it functioning. But when his idiosyncratic style of anthropological realism is applied to the tight community of Hollywood &#x27;players&#x27; it has an almost hallucinatory effect.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Altman has made a movie that&#x27;s supremely deft and pleasurable. As if to taunt his detractors, he even &#x27;tells a story&#x27; this time, and he does a better job of it than the hacks who have been getting work when he couldn&#x27;t.&quot;

&quot;The Player&quot; was Altman&#x27;s comeback to making films in Hollywood. Altman was praised for the sex scene in which Robbins and Scacchi were filmed from the neck up. Scacchi later claimed that Altman had wanted a nude scene, but that it was her refusal which led to the final form. The editing of &quot;The Player&quot; by Geraldine Peroni was honored by a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. In 2004, Tony Sloman wrote an appreciation of the film&#x27;s editing:

&quot;The Player&quot; was placed on 80 critics&#x27; year-end best lists, second only to &quot;Howards End&quot; in 1992.

===Awards and nominations===
==Legacy==
In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s 25th anniversary year, it named &quot;The Player&quot; in its list of the 25 best movies since the magazine&#x27;s beginnings. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;The Player&quot; as one of the best movies of the 90&#x27;s.

=== Television adaptation ===
In 1997, the film was adapted into a pilot that wasn&#x27;t picked up. It starred Patrick Dempsey, Michael Parks, Arye Gross, Shelley Duvall, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Jennifer Grey, Seymour Cassel, and more.

<doc id="358264" wikidata="Q766014" url="?curid=358264" title="Tribeca">
<text>Tribeca ( ), originally written as TriBeCa, is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan in New York City. Its name is a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Triangle Below Canal Street&quot;. The &quot;triangle&quot; (more accurately a quadrilateral) is bounded by Canal Street, West Street, Broadway, and Chambers Street. By the 2010s, a common marketing tactic was to extend Tribeca&#x27;s southern boundary to either Vesey or Murray Streets to increase the appeal of property listings.

The neighborhood began as farmland, then was a residential neighborhood in the early 19th century, before becoming a mercantile area centered on produce, dry goods, and textiles, and then transitioning to artists and then actors, models, entrepreneurs, and other celebrities. The neighborhood is home to the Tribeca Festival, which was created in response to the September 11 attacks, to reinvigorate the neighborhood and downtown after the destruction caused by the terrorist attacks.

Tribeca is part of Manhattan Community District 1, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10007 and 10013. It is patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Name==
Tribeca is one of a number of neighborhoods in New York City whose names are syllabic abbreviations or acronyms, including SoHo (South of Houston Street), NoHo (North of Houston Street), Nolita (North of Little Italy), NoMad (North of Madison Square), DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), and BoCoCa, the last of which is actually a collection of neighborhoods (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn and Carroll Gardens).
The name &quot;Tribeca&quot; was coined in the early 1970s and originally applied to the narrower area bounded by Broadway and Canal, Lispenard, and Church Streets, which appears to be a triangle on city planning maps. Residents of this area formed the TriBeCa Artists&#x27; Co-op in filing legal documents connected to a 1973 zoning dispute. An April 1976 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described that residents had used such names as &quot;Lo Cal&quot; and &quot;So So&quot; for the neighborhood, and that the City Planning Commission had established the name and that it covered &quot;Canal Street on the north, Barclay Street on the south, West Street, and Broadway on the east&quot;. According to a local historian, the name had been misconstrued by the newspaper reporter as applying to a much larger area, which is how it came to be the name of the current neighborhood.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The area now known as Tribeca was farmed by Dutch settlers to New Amsterdam, prominently Roeleff Jansen (who obtained the land patent, called Dominie&#x27;s Brouwery, from Wouter van Twiller in 1636) and his wife Anneke Jans who later married Everardus Bogardus. The land stayed with the family until 1670 when the deed was signed over to Col. Francis Lovelace. In 1674 the Dutch took possession of the area until the English reclaimed the land a year later. In 1674, representing the Duke of York, Governor Andros took possession of the land.

Tribeca was later part of the large tract of land given to Trinity Church by Queen Anne in 1705. In 1807, the church built St. John&#x27;s Chapel on Varick Street and then laid out St. John&#x27;s Park, bounded by Laight Street, Varick Street, Ericsson Place, and Hudson Street. The church also built Hudson Square, a development of brick houses that surrounded the park, which would become the model for Gramercy Park. The area was among the first residential neighborhoods developed in New York City beyond the city&#x27;s colonial boundaries, and remained primarily residential until the 1840s.

Several streets in the area are named after Anthony Lispenard Bleecker and the Lispenard family. Beach Street was created in the late 18th century and was the first street on or adjacent to the farm of Anthony Lispenard Bleecker, which was just south of what is now Canal Street; the name of the street is a corruption of the name of Paul Bache, a son-in-law of Anthony Lispenard. Lispenard Street in Tribeca is named for the Lispenard family, and Bleecker Street in NoHo was named for Anthony Lispenard Bleecker.

=== Commercial and industrial development ===
During the 1840s and then continuing after the American Civil War, shipping in New York City – which then consisted only of Manhattan – shifted in large part from the East River and the area around South Street to the Hudson River, where the longer piers could more easily handle the larger ships which were then coming into use. In addition, the dredging of the sand bars which lay across the entrance to New York Harbor from the Atlantic Ocean made it easier for ships to navigate to the piers on the Hudson, rather than use the &quot;back door&quot; via the East River to the piers there. Later, the Hudson River piers also received freight via railroad cars ferried across the river from New Jersey.
The increased shipping encouraged the expansion of the Washington Market – a wholesale produce market that opened in 1813 as &quot;Bear Market&quot; – from the original market buildings to buildings throughout its neighborhood, taking over houses and warehouses to use for the storage of produce, including butter, cheese, and eggs. In the mid-19th century, the neighborhood was the center of the dry goods and textile industries in the city, and St. John&#x27;s Park was turned into a freight depot. Later, the area also featured fireworks outlets, pets stores, radios – which were clustered in a district that was displaced by the building of the World Trade Center – sporting goods, shoes, and church supplies. By the mid-19th century, the area transformed into a commercial center, with large numbers of store and loft buildings constructed along Broadway in the 1850s and 1860s.

Development in the area was further spurred by New York City Subway construction, namely the extension of the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line (today&#x27;s ), which opened for service in 1918, and the accompanying extension of Seventh Avenue and the widening of Varick Street during subway construction in 1914, both of resulted in better access to the area for vehicles and for subway riders. The area was also served by the IRT Ninth Avenue Line, an elevated train line on Greenwich Street demolished in 1940.

After the construction of the Holland Tunnel from 1920 to 1927 and the transition of freight shipping from ships and railroads to trucks, the truck traffic generated by the market and other businesses caused considerable congestion in the area. This provoked the building between 1929 and 1951 of the Miller Highway, an elevated roadway that came to be called the West Side Highway, the purpose of which was to handle through automobile traffic, which thus did not have to deal with the truck congestion at street level. Because of a policy of &quot;deferred maintenance&quot;, the elevated structure began to fall apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the highway was shut down in 1973. The roadway project planned to replace it, called Westway, was fought by neighborhood activists, and was eventually killed by environmental concerns. Instead, West Street was rebuilt to handle through traffic.

=== Redevelopment ===
By the 1960s, Tribeca&#x27;s industrial base had all but vanished, and the produce market moved to Hunts Point in the Bronx in the 1960s. The city put an urban renewal plan into effect, which involved the demolition of many old buildings, with the intent of building high-rise residential towers, office buildings, and schools. Some of these were constructed, including Independence Plaza in 1975 on Washington Street, the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1980, and Washington Market Park in 1981. Some warehouse buildings were converted to residential use, and lofts began to be utilized by artists, who lived and worked in their spaces, a model which had been pioneered in nearby SoHo. In the early 1970s, a couple of years after artists in SoHo were able to legalize their live/work situation, artist and resident organizations in the area to the south, then known as Washington Market or the Lower West Side, sought to gain similar zoning status for their neighborhood. One of the neighborhood groups called themselves the &quot;Triangle Below Canal Block Association&quot;, and, as activists had done in SoHo, shortened the group&#x27;s name to the Tribeca Block Association. The Tribeca name came to be applied to the area south of Canal Street, between Broadway and West Street, extending south to – as variously defined – Chambers, Vesey, or Murray Street.
In 1996, the Tribeca Open Artist Studio Tour was founded as a non-profit, artist-run organization with the mission to empower the working artists of Tribeca while providing an educational opportunity for the public. For 15 years, the annual free walking tour through artist studios in Tribeca has allowed people to get a unique glimpse into the lives of Tribeca&#x27;s best creative talent. Tribeca suffered both physically and financially after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, but government grants and incentives helped the area rebound fairly quickly. The Tribeca Film Festival was established to help contribute to the long-term recovery of lower Manhattan after 9/11. The festival also celebrates New York City as a major filmmaking center. The mission of the film festival is &quot;to enable the international film community and the general public to experience the power of film by redefining the film festival experience.&quot; Tribeca is a popular filming location for movies and television shows.

By the early 21st century, Tribeca became one of Manhattan&#x27;s most fashionable and desirable neighborhoods, well known for its celebrity residents. Its streets teem with art galleries, boutique shops, restaurants, and bars. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked its 10013 zip code as New York City&#x27;s most expensive (however, the adjacent, low-income neighborhood of Chinatown, also uses the 10013 zip code). Tribeca was the safest neighborhood in New York City, according to NYPD and CompStat statistics. In the 2010s, several skyscrapers were completed, including 30 Park Place (containing the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown), 56 Leonard Street, and 111 Murray Street.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Tribeca as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called SoHo-TriBeCa-Civic Center-Little Italy. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of SoHo-TriBeCa-Civic Center-Little Italy was 42,742, a change of 5,985 (14%) from the 36,757 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 66.1% (28,250) White, 2.2% (934) African American, 0.1% (30) Native American, 22.2% (9,478) Asian, 0% (11) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (171) from other races, and 2.6% (1,098) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.5% (2,770) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Tribeca and other Lower Manhattan neighborhoods, had 63,383 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are young to middle-aged adults: half (50%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 14% are between 0–17, and 18% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 7%, respectively.

==Places==

Tribeca is dominated by former industrial buildings that have been converted into residential buildings and lofts, similar to those of the neighboring SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the neighborhood was a center of the textile/cotton trade.

Notable buildings in the neighborhoods include the historic neo-Renaissance Textile Building, designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh and built in 1901, and the Powell Building, a designated Landmark on Hudson Street, which was designed by Carrère and Hastings and built in 1892. Other notable buildings include the New York Telephone Company building at 140 West Street, between Vesey and Barclay, with its Mayan-inspired Art Deco motif, and the former New York Mercantile Exchange at 6 Harrison Street.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, abandoned and inexpensive Tribeca lofts became hot-spot residences for young artists and their families because of the seclusion of lower Manhattan and the vast living space. Jim Stratton, a Tribeca resident since this period, wrote the 1977 nonfiction book entitled &quot;Pioneering in the Urban Wilderness&quot;, detailing his experiences renovating lower Manhattan warehouses into residences.

<text>The Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (Cantonese: 香港管弦樂團) is a symphony orchestra based in Hong Kong. Colloquially referred to as the HKPO or HKPhil (Cantonese: 港樂), the orchestra was first established in 1947 as an amateur orchestra under the name Sino-British Orchestra (中英管弦樂團), it was renamed the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 1957 and became a professional orchestra in 1974 under the funding of the government.

==History==

===Sino-British Orchestra===
The Sino-British Club was an organisation founded in 1946, aimed at promoting harmony among different groups in Hong Kong (especially British and native Hongkongese) through cultural activities. Various groups were found under the club, including drama, literature, film, and music.

In 1947, Anthony Braga, one of the leaders of the music group of the Sino-British Club, suggested to form a symphony orchestra to gather instrumentalists in the city and provide musical performance to the citizens, as the society was still recovering from the World War II. About 20 amateur musicians were found, and a chamber orchestra was formed quickly. Weekly rehearsal started in the summer.

Solomon Bard, a violinist who just finished his medical degree in the UK, returned to Hong Kong in the autumn of 1947, and was invited by Braga to be the conductor of the orchestra. Bard took over the orchestra, and conducted its debut performance on 30 April 1948 in St. Stephen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College.

===Arrigo Foa===
Bard continued his directorship of the orchestra after the debut. In 1953, Bard invited the Italian violinist and conductor Arrigo Foa to take over the orchestra, and Bard worked as the concertmaster and deputy conductor of the Orchestra.

Foa was a professional musician who joined Shanghai Municipal Orchestra as concertmaster in 1919. He succeeded Mario Paci as the conductor of the Shanghai orchestra in 1942, under the Japanese occupation. Foa migrated to Hong Kong in 1953 and led the orchestra immediately. He led the orchestra to play a critically acclaimed concert with pianist Louis Kentner.

Under the professional training of Foa, the orchestra improved rapidly, and gained a higher reputation in the city. Collaborating artists included pianist Julius Katchen and violinist Ruggiero Ricci.

===Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra===
In 1957, members of the orchestra decided to separate the group from Sino-British Club. As an independent organisation, the orchestra was renamed to the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, and registered as the Hong Kong Philharmonic Society. Most of the musicians remained, and Foa and Bard stayed on the same positions in the new ensemble.

In 1974, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra became the first professional orchestra in Hong Kong, while the Sino-British Club dismissed in the same year. Kek-tjiang Lim was the orchestra&#x27;s first music director with the ensemble in professional status, from 1974 to 1975. In February 1986, the HKPO made its debut tour of several cities in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with conductor Kenneth Schermerhorn and soloists Stephanie Chase (violin) and Li Jian (piano). In the autumn of 1995, the HKPO travelled to nine cities in the United States and Canada in its North American début under conductor David Atherton. In 2003, the orchestra made its European début with performances in London&#x27;s Barbican Hall, Belfast, Dublin and Paris (Théâtre des Champs-Élysées).

The orchestra&#x27;s most recent and longest-serving music director was Jaap van Zweden, from 2012 to 2024. In June 2023, Tarmo Peltokoski first guest-conducted the orchestra. In July 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Peltokoski as its next music director, effective with the 2026-2027 season, with an initial contract of four years. He is to hold the title of music director-designate for the 2025-2026 season.

The orchestra&#x27;s current chief executive is Benedikt Fohr. Fohr is scheduled to stand down from the post at the close of the 2024-2025 season, in July 2025.

In addition to classical performances, the orchestra occasionally appears backing local pop stars such as Hacken Lee, Jacky Cheung, Frances Yip, Teresa Carpio, Leehom Wang and Hins Cheung.

==Recording history==
The orchestra made its debut recording under the label Philips in 1978. Its repertoire includes &quot;Butterfly Lovers&#x27; Violin Concerto&quot; and selected Chinese orchestral works, under the baton of Hans Gunther Mommer. In the 1980s, the orchestra made a serious recording for HK Records. Recordings were also made for the label Marco Polo after Klaus Heymann founded Naxos.

Under the directorship of David Atherton, several recordings were released on Virgin Classics and GMN. In 1997, the orchestra was featured in Tan Dun&#x27;s album &quot;Heaven Earth Mankind: Symphony 1997&quot; (Sony Classical Records), as a celebration for the handover of Hong Kong.

The orchestra started a four-year project in 2015, making it the first Hong Kong and mainland Chinese orchestra to perform Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;. The four operas were performed, one per year, in concert and recorded live for the Naxos label.

Each year the orchestra holds a crossover concert with selected cantopop singers. Live recordings are made after each production. Since the concert of Michael Kwan (conducted by Joseph Koo) in 1982, the most successful one has been the live recording of the concert with Jacky Cheung (conducted by Yip Wing-sie) in 1996.

== Performance venues ==
After the reorganization from the Sino-British Orchestra into the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 1957, the orchestra played the first concert in Loke Yew Hall, the University of Hong Kong. Hong Kong City Hall Concert Hall was the performance venue of the orchestra in its early years. The orchestra was the first to perform in the Hong Kong Cultural Centre after the venue&#x27;s opening in 1989, participating in the International Celebration of the Arts, which was a festival to open the centre. Since then, Hong Kong Philharmonic has been the most frequent orchestra to perform in the venue. The orchestra officially became the venue partner of Hong Kong Cultural Centre in 2009.

The orchestra also gives an annual outdoor performance, &#x27;Symphony Under the Stars&#x27;, Hong Kong&#x27;s largest outdoor symphonic concert, which attracts thousands of participants every year. Venues include the Happy Valley Racecourse and the New Central Harbourfront.

<doc id="358276" wikidata="Q5127848" url="?curid=358276" title="Class (philosophy)">
<text>A class is a collection whose members either fall under a predicate or are classified by a rule. Hence, while a set can be extensionally defined only by its elements, a class has also an intensional dimension that unites its members. When the term &#x27;class&#x27; is applied so that it includes those sets whose elements are intended to be collected without a common predicate or rule, the distinction can be indicated by calling such sets &quot;improper class.&quot; 

Philosophers sometimes distinguish classes from types and kinds. The &quot;class&quot; of human beings is discussed, as well as the &quot;type&quot; (or &quot;natural kind&quot;), human being, or humanity. While both are typically treated as abstract objects and not different categories of being, types not classes are usually treated as universals. Whether natural kinds ought to be considered universals is vexed; see natural kind.

Types and kinds are discussed differently. Socrates is considered a &quot;token&quot; of a type (or an &quot;instance&quot; of the natural kind, human being) but a &quot;member&quot; of the class of human beings. He is a token (instance) not member of the type (kind), human beings. He is a member not type (or kind) of a class. The terminology is that types (or kinds) have tokens (or instances) while classes have members.

A class is conceptualized similarly to a set defined by its members. The class is extensional. A set defined intensionally is a set of things that meet some requirement to be a member. Such a set creates a type. It also creates a class from the extension of the intensional set. A type always has a corresponding (potentially empty) class, but a class does not necessarily have a corresponding type.

<text>In mathematics, a Cayley graph, also known as a Cayley color graph, Cayley diagram, group diagram, or color group, is a graph that encodes the abstract structure of a group. Its definition is suggested by Cayley&#x27;s theorem (named after Arthur Cayley), and uses a specified set of generators for the group. It is a central tool in combinatorial and geometric group theory. The structure and symmetry of Cayley graphs makes them particularly good candidates for constructing expander graphs.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a group and formula_2 be a generating set of formula_1. The Cayley graph formula_4 is an edge-colored directed graph constructed as follows:

* Each element formula_5 of formula_1 is assigned a vertex: the vertex set of formula_7 is identified with formula_8
* Each element formula_9 of formula_2 is assigned a color formula_11.
* For every formula_12 and formula_13, there is a directed edge of color formula_11 from the vertex corresponding to formula_5 to the one corresponding to formula_16. 

Not every convention requires that formula_2 generate the group. If formula_2 is not a generating set for formula_1, then formula_7 is disconnected and each connected component represents a coset of the subgroup generated by formula_2.

If an element formula_9 of formula_2 is its own inverse, formula_24 then it is typically represented by an undirected edge.

The set formula_2 is often assumed to be finite, especially in geometric group theory, which corresponds to formula_7 being locally finite and formula_1 being finitely generated.

The set formula_2 is sometimes assumed to be symmetric (formula_29) and not containing the group identity element. In this case, the uncolored Cayley graph can be represented as a simple undirected graph.

== Examples ==
* Suppose that formula_30 is the infinite cyclic group and the set formula_2 consists of the standard generator 1 and its inverse (−1 in the additive notation); then the Cayley graph is an infinite path.
* Similarly, if formula_32 is the finite cyclic group of order formula_33 and the set formula_2 consists of two elements, the standard generator of formula_1 and its inverse, then the Cayley graph is the cycle formula_36. More generally, the Cayley graphs of finite cyclic groups are exactly the circulant graphs.
* The Cayley graph of the direct product of groups (with the cartesian product of generating sets as a generating set) is the cartesian product of the corresponding Cayley graphs. Thus the Cayley graph of the abelian group formula_37 with the set of generators consisting of four elements formula_38 is the infinite grid on the plane formula_39, while for the direct product formula_40 with similar generators the Cayley graph is the formula_41 finite grid on a torus.

* A Cayley graph of the dihedral group formula_42 on two generators formula_43 and formula_44 is depicted to the left. Red arrows represent composition with formula_43. Since formula_44 is self-inverse, the blue lines, which represent composition with formula_44, are undirected. Therefore the graph is mixed: it has eight vertices, eight arrows, and four edges. The Cayley table of the group formula_42 can be derived from the group presentation formula_49 A different Cayley graph of formula_42 is shown on the right. formula_44 is still the horizontal reflection and is represented by blue lines, and formula_52 is a diagonal reflection and is represented by pink lines. As both reflections are self-inverse the Cayley graph on the right is completely undirected. This graph corresponds to the presentation formula_53
* The Cayley graph of the free group on two generators formula_43 and formula_44 corresponding to the set formula_56 is depicted at the top of the article, with formula_57 being the identity. Travelling along an edge to the right represents right multiplication by formula_58 while travelling along an edge upward corresponds to the multiplication by formula_59 Since the free group has no relations, the Cayley graph has no cycles: it is the 4-regular infinite tree. It is a key ingredient in the proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox.
* More generally, the Bethe lattice or Cayley tree is the Cayley graph of the free group on formula_33 generators. A presentation of a group formula_1 by formula_33 generators corresponds to a surjective homomorphism from the free group on formula_33 generators to the group formula_64 defining a map from the Cayley tree to the Cayley graph of formula_1. Interpreting graphs topologically as one-dimensional simplicial complexes, the simply connected infinite tree is the universal cover of the Cayley graph; and the kernel of the mapping is the fundamental group of the Cayley graph.

* A Cayley graph of the discrete Heisenberg group formula_66 is depicted to the right. The generators used in the picture are the three matrices formula_67 given by the three permutations of 1, 0, 0 for the entries formula_68. They satisfy the relations formula_69, which can also be understood from the picture. This is a non-commutative infinite group, and despite being embedded in a three-dimensional space, the Cayley graph has four-dimensional volume growth.
== Characterization ==
The group formula_1 acts on itself by left multiplication (see Cayley&#x27;s theorem). This may be viewed as the action of formula_1 on its Cayley graph. Explicitly, an element formula_72 maps a vertex formula_73 to the vertex formula_74 The set of edges of the Cayley graph and their color is preserved by this action: the edge formula_75 is mapped to the edge formula_76, both having color formula_11. In fact, all automorphisms of the colored directed graph formula_7 are of this form, so that formula_1 is isomorphic to the symmetry group of formula_7. 

The left multiplication action of a group on itself is simply transitive, in particular, Cayley graphs are vertex-transitive. The following is a kind of converse to this:

To recover the group formula_1 and the generating set formula_2 from the unlabeled directed graph formula_7, select a vertex formula_84 and label it by the identity element of the group. Then label each vertex formula_85 of formula_7 by the unique element of formula_1 that maps formula_88 to formula_89 The set formula_2 of generators of formula_1 that yields formula_7 as the Cayley graph formula_93 is the set of labels of out-neighbors of formula_88. Since formula_7 is uncolored, it might have more directed graph automorphisms than the left multiplication maps, for example group automorphisms of formula_1 which permute formula_2. 

== Elementary properties ==

* The Cayley graph formula_93 depends in an essential way on the choice of the set formula_2 of generators. For example, if the generating set formula_2 has formula_101 elements then each vertex of the Cayley graph has formula_101 incoming and formula_101 outgoing directed edges. In the case of a symmetric generating set formula_2 with formula_105 elements, the Cayley graph is a regular directed graph of degree formula_106
* Cycles (or &quot;closed walks&quot;) in the Cayley graph indicate relations among the elements of formula_107 In the more elaborate construction of the Cayley complex of a group, closed paths corresponding to relations are &quot;filled in&quot; by polygons. This means that the problem of constructing the Cayley graph of a given presentation formula_108 is equivalent to solving the Word Problem for formula_108.
* If formula_110 is a surjective group homomorphism and the images of the elements of the generating set formula_111 for formula_112 are distinct, then it induces a covering of graphs formula_113 where formula_114 In particular, if a group formula_1 has formula_101 generators, all of order different from 2, and the set formula_2 consists of these generators together with their inverses, then the Cayley graph formula_93 is covered by the infinite regular tree of degree formula_119 corresponding to the free group on the same set of generators.
* For any finite Cayley graph, considered as undirected, the vertex connectivity is at least equal to 2/3 of the degree of the graph. If the generating set is minimal (removal of any element and, if present, its inverse from the generating set leaves a set which is not generating), the vertex connectivity is equal to the degree. The edge connectivity is in all cases equal to the degree.
* If formula_120 is the left-regular representation with formula_121 matrix form denoted formula_122, the adjacency matrix of formula_93 is formula_124.
* Every group character formula_125 of the group formula_1 induces an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of formula_93. The associated eigenvalue is formula_128 which, when formula_1 is Abelian, takes the form formula_130 for integers formula_131 In particular, the associated eigenvalue of the trivial character (the one sending every element to 1) is the degree of formula_93, that is, the order of formula_2. If formula_1 is an Abelian group, there are exactly formula_135 characters, determining all eigenvalues. The corresponding orthonormal basis of eigenvectors is given by formula_136 It is interesting to note that this eigenbasis is independent of the generating set formula_2. More generally for symmetric generating sets, take formula_138 a complete set of irreducible representations of formula_64 and let formula_140 with eigenvalue set formula_141. Then the set of eigenvalues of formula_93 is exactly formula_143 where eigenvalue formula_144 appears with multiplicity formula_145 for each occurrence of formula_144 as an eigenvalue of formula_147

== Schreier coset graph ==
If one instead takes the vertices to be right cosets of a fixed subgroup formula_148 one obtains a related construction, the Schreier coset graph, which is at the basis of coset enumeration or the Todd–Coxeter process.

== Connection to group theory ==
Knowledge about the structure of the group can be obtained by studying the adjacency matrix of the graph and in particular applying the theorems of spectral graph theory. Conversely, for symmetric generating sets, the spectral and representation theory of formula_93 are directly tied together: take formula_138 a complete set of irreducible representations of formula_64 and let formula_152 with eigenvalues formula_141. Then the set of eigenvalues of formula_93 is exactly formula_143 where eigenvalue formula_144 appears with multiplicity formula_145 for each occurrence of formula_144 as an eigenvalue of formula_147

The genus of a group is the minimum genus for any Cayley graph of that group.

=== Geometric group theory ===
For infinite groups, the coarse geometry of the Cayley graph is fundamental to geometric group theory. For a finitely generated group, this is independent of choice of finite set of generators, hence an intrinsic property of the group. This is only interesting for infinite groups: every finite group is coarsely equivalent to a point (or the trivial group), since one can choose as finite set of generators the entire group.

Formally, for a given choice of generators, one has the word metric (the natural distance on the Cayley graph), which determines a metric space. The coarse equivalence class of this space is an invariant of the group.

== Expansion properties ==

When formula_29, the Cayley graph formula_93 is formula_162-regular, so spectral techniques may be used to analyze the expansion properties of the graph. In particular for abelian groups, the eigenvalues of the Cayley graph are more easily computable and given by formula_163 with top eigenvalue equal to formula_162, so we may use Cheeger&#x27;s inequality to bound the edge expansion ratio using the spectral gap.

Representation theory can be used to construct such expanding Cayley graphs, in the form of Kazhdan property (T). The following statement holds: 

For example the group formula_165 has property (T) and is generated by elementary matrices and this gives relatively explicit examples of expander graphs.

== Integral classification ==

An integral graph is one whose eigenvalues are all integers. While the complete classification of integral graphs remains an open problem, the Cayley graphs of certain groups are always integral.
Using previous characterizations of the spectrum of Cayley graphs, note that formula_93 is integral iff the eigenvalues of formula_167 are integral for every representation formula_168 of formula_1.

=== Cayley integral simple group ===

A group formula_1 is Cayley integral simple (CIS) if the connected Cayley graph formula_93 is integral exactly when the symmetric generating set formula_2 is the complement of a subgroup of formula_1. A result of Ahmady, Bell, and Mohar shows that all CIS groups are isomorphic to formula_174, or formula_175 for primes formula_176. It is important that formula_2 actually generates the entire group formula_1 in order for the Cayley graph to be connected. (If formula_2 does not generate formula_1, the Cayley graph may still be integral, but the complement of formula_2 is not necessarily a subgroup.)

In the example of formula_182, the symmetric generating sets (up to graph isomorphism) are
*formula_183: formula_93 is a formula_185-cycle with eigenvalues formula_186
*formula_187: formula_93 is formula_189 with eigenvalues formula_190
The only subgroups of formula_191 are the whole group and the trivial group, and the only symmetric generating set formula_2 that produces an integral graph is the complement of the trivial group. Therefore formula_191 must be a CIS group.

The proof of the complete CIS classification uses the fact that every subgroup and homomorphic image of a CIS group is also a CIS group.

=== Cayley integral group ===

A slightly different notion is that of a Cayley integral group formula_1, in which every symmetric subset formula_2 produces an integral graph formula_93. Note that formula_2 no longer has to generate the entire group.

The complete list of Cayley integral groups is given by formula_198, and the dicyclic group of order formula_199, where formula_200 and formula_201 is the quaternion group. The proof relies on two important properties of Cayley integral groups:
* Subgroups and homomorphic images of Cayley integral groups are also Cayley integral groups.
* A group is Cayley integral iff every connected Cayley graph of the group is also integral.

=== Normal and Eulerian generating sets ===

Given a general group formula_1, a subset formula_203 is normal if formula_2 is closed under conjugation by elements of formula_1 (generalizing the notion of a normal subgroup), and formula_2 is Eulerian if for every formula_13, the set of elements generating the cyclic group formula_208 is also contained in formula_2.
A 2019 result by Guo, Lytkina, Mazurov, and Revin proves that the Cayley graph formula_93 is integral for any Eulerian normal subset formula_203, using purely representation theoretic techniques.

The proof of this result is relatively short: given formula_2 an Eulerian normal subset, select formula_213 pairwise nonconjugate so that formula_2 is the union of the conjugacy classes formula_215. Then using the characterization of the spectrum of a Cayley graph, one can show the eigenvalues of formula_93 are given by formula_217 taken over irreducible characters formula_125 of formula_1. Each eigenvalue formula_220 in this set must be an element of formula_221 for formula_222 a primitive formula_223 root of unity (where formula_224 must be divisible by the orders of each formula_225). Because the eigenvalues are algebraic integers, to show they are integral it suffices to show that they are rational, and it suffices to show formula_220 is fixed under any automorphism formula_227 of formula_221. There must be some formula_101 relatively prime to formula_224 such that formula_231 for all formula_232, and because formula_2 is both Eulerian and normal, formula_234 for some formula_235. Sending formula_236 bijects conjugacy classes, so formula_215 and formula_238 have the same size and formula_227 merely permutes terms in the sum for formula_220. Therefore formula_220 is fixed for all automorphisms of formula_221, so formula_220 is rational and thus integral.

Consequently, if formula_244 is the alternating group and formula_2 is a set of permutations given by formula_246, then the Cayley graph formula_247 is integral. (This solved a previously open problem from the Kourovka Notebook.) In addition when formula_248 is the symmetric group and formula_2 is either the set of all transpositions or the set of transpositions involving a particular element, the Cayley graph formula_93 is also integral.

== History ==
Cayley graphs were first considered for finite groups by Arthur Cayley in 1878. Max Dehn in his unpublished lectures on group theory from 1909–10 reintroduced Cayley graphs under the name Gruppenbild (group diagram), which led to the geometric group theory of today. His most important application was the solution of the word problem for the fundamental group of surfaces with genus ≥ 2, which is equivalent to the topological problem of deciding which closed curves on the surface contract to a point.

<text>Hairspray is an American musical with music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, with a book by Mark O&#x27;Donnell and Thomas Meehan, based on John Waters&#x27;s 1988 film of the same name. The songs include 1960s-style dance music and &quot;downtown&quot; rhythm and blues. Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, the production follows teenage Tracy Turnblad&#x27;s dream to dance on &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot;, a local TV dance program based on the real-life &quot;Buddy Deane Show&quot;. When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight, leading to social change as Tracy campaigns for the show&#x27;s integration.

The musical opened in Seattle in 2002 and moved to Broadway later that year. In 2003, &quot;Hairspray&quot; won eight Tony Awards, including one for Best Musical, out of 13 nominations. It ran for 2,642 performances, and closed on January 4, 2009. &quot;Hairspray&quot; has also had national tours, a West End production, and numerous foreign productions and was adapted as a 2007 musical film. The London production was nominated for a record-setting eleven Laurence Olivier Awards, winning four, including Best New Musical.

==Background==
According to interviews included as an extra feature on the 2007 film&#x27;s DVD release, theater producer Margo Lion first conceived of &quot;Hairspray&quot; as a stage musical in 1998 after seeing the original film on television. &quot;I was home looking at a lot of movies, and one of those movies was &quot;Hairspray&quot;.&quot; She contacted John Waters, who gave her his blessing, then acquired the rights from New Line Cinema. Lion contacted Marc Shaiman, who expressed interest in the project only if his partner, Scott Wittman, could participate, and Lion agreed. The two enlisted the help of actress and singer Annie Golden to produce a demo recording containing three songs, one of which, &quot;Good Morning Baltimore&quot;, became the show&#x27;s opening number. Based on their initial work, Lion was confident that she had hired the right team.

Lion contacted Rob Marshall about directing the musical. At the time he was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of &quot;Chicago&quot;, but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of &quot;Hairspray&quot; with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film. Marshall remembered Marissa Jaret Winokur from her brief appearance in the film &quot;American Beauty&quot; and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman. The two immediately felt she was right to play Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions. They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later. A year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Certain she would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a hysterectomy, telling only her immediate family. The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project. Meanwhile, Marshall began work on &quot;Chicago&quot;, and Lion hired Jack O&#x27;Brien and Jerry Mitchell to direct and to choreograph, respectively. Winokur was one of the first to audition for the role of Tracy and spent two years preparing with voice and dance lessons. Divine portrayed Tracy&#x27;s mother, Edna Turnblad, in the original film, and Shaiman liked the idea of maintaining the tradition of casting a man as Edna. Harvey Fierstein auditioned for the role with a &quot;half-hour vocal audition&quot;. He thought they were &quot;pacifying&quot; him, but was told, &quot;They don&#x27;t want anyone but you&quot;.

According to Shaiman, one song, &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;ve Been&quot;, became controversial during the genesis of the score:

This was ... inspired by a scene late in the [1988] movie that takes place on the black side of town. It never dawned on us that a torrent of protest would follow us from almost everyone involved with the show. &quot;It&#x27;s too sad. ... It&#x27;s too preachy. ... It doesn&#x27;t belong. ... Tracy should sing the eleven o&#x27;clock number.&quot; We simply didn&#x27;t want our show to be yet another showbiz version of a civil rights story where the black characters are just background. And what could be more Tracy Turnblad-like than to give the &quot;eleven o&#x27;clock number&quot; to the black family at the heart of the struggle? Luckily ... the audiences embraced this moment, which enriches the happy ending to follow, and it is our proudest achievement of the entire experience of writing &quot;Hairspray&quot;.

==Productions==
===Original Broadway production===
After a successful tryout at Seattle&#x27;s 5th Avenue Theatre, &quot;Hairspray&quot; opened on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on August 15, 2002.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
It is June 1962 in Baltimore. Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (&quot;Good Morning Baltimore&quot;) and goes to school, where she receives a warning for &quot;inappropriate hair height&quot;. After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot; (&quot;The Nicest Kids in Town&quot;). Edna, Tracy&#x27;s shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny&#x27;s mother, Prudy, complains about it being &quot;race music&quot;. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held because Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for &quot;nine months&quot;, Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, Edna refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot;) have similar arguments with their mothers (&quot;Mama, I&#x27;m a Big Girl Now&quot;).

After gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (&quot;I Can Hear the Bells&quot;). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot;, rejects Tracy at the audition because of her size (&quot;(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs&quot;), and rejects a black girl, Little Inez.

Back at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her &quot;monumental hair-don&#x27;t&quot;. There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of &quot;Negro Day&quot; on &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot;, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the next day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (&quot;The Madison&quot;). After Corny sees Tracy dance, he gives her a place on the show (&quot;The Nicest Kids in Town&quot; (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, at Corny&#x27;s suggestion, sings &quot;It Takes Two&quot; to Tracy, much to Amber&#x27;s dismay. (It Takes Two). After the show, Mr. Spritzer, the show&#x27;s worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy&#x27;s appointment to the Council. Threatening to fire Corny from the show, Velma is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (&quot;Velma&#x27;s Revenge&quot;).

At the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr. Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (&quot;Welcome to the 60&#x27;s&quot;) and Tracy becomes the shop&#x27;s spokes-girl. At school, signs of Tracy&#x27;s fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member, sporting Tracy&#x27;s signature hairdo. During a game of dodgeball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother&#x27;s record shop for a platter party (&quot;Run and Tell That&quot;).

At the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day&#x27;s Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except on the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (&quot;Big, Blonde and Beautiful&quot;).

===Act II===
After the march, most of the women are locked up in a women&#x27;s penitentiary (&quot;The Big Dollhouse&quot;). Because of Velma&#x27;s dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the rest, except Tracy, who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma&#x27;s manipulations. Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (&quot;Good Morning Baltimore&quot; (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur&#x27;s joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it took to bail everyone out. Edna sympathizes with Tracy&#x27;s dream—she had dreamed of making her &quot;own line of queen-sized dress patterns&quot;. Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (&quot;(You&#x27;re) Timeless to Me&quot;). During the night, Link sneaks into the jail, where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny&#x27;s mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for &quot;going to jail without her permission&quot; and ties her up in her bedroom, where Seaweed comes to her rescue. Both couples declare their love (&quot;Without Love&quot;). After escaping their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle&#x27;s Record Shop. Tracy thinks it unfair that after all their hard work, &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot; is still segregated. They devise a plan to integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (&quot;I Know Where I&#x27;ve Been&quot;).

On the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (&quot;(It&#x27;s) Hairspray&quot;). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (&quot;Cooties&quot;). As the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important: Link&#x27;s and her future. She then proclaims &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot; is &quot;now and forevermore&quot; racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public&#x27;s response to the telecast, announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and given her a full college scholarship, and offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow – beauty products for women of color, much to her chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop the Beat&quot;).

===Score revisions and additional songs===
&quot;Hairspray&quot; went through several revisions during its pre-Broadway run in Seattle, in the process eliminating and replacing several musical numbers. In Seattle, an infomercial about safety on the road titled &quot;Blood on the Pavement&quot; followed &quot;The Nicest Kids in Town&quot;, and is included on the cast album following &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop the Beat&quot;. Early versions of the show featured &quot;Velma&#x27;s Cha-Cha&quot; and &quot;The Status Quo&quot; (Seattle) (with its short reprise &quot;Rage&quot;) during Tracy&#x27;s audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for &quot;(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs&quot;. After Tracy&#x27;s rejection from the Council, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer Tracy up, singing that &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Get Better than This&quot;. Later replaced by the similar &quot;Positivity&quot;, the scene was cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.

After Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song, &quot;The New Girl in Town&quot;, sung first by the Councilettes and later by the Black girls. Although cut during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the 2007 film and appears in the show&#x27;s instrumental score. &quot;The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha&quot; was another cut number that originally followed &quot;Big, Blonde, and Beautiful&quot;. Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene. A song called &quot;Step on Up&quot; was also cut in favor of &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;ve Been&quot;. Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a &quot;Miss Auto Show&quot; competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of &quot;Miss Teenage Hairspray&quot;. For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called &quot;Take a Spin&quot; sung by Corny in the place of &quot;(It&#x27;s) Hairspray&quot;. After Amber&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Cooties&quot;, Tracy had a song before the finale, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;Til the Fat Lady Sings&quot;, that was cut after readings of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture&#x27;s soundtrack.

==Instrumentation and chorus==
Hairspray&#x27;s orchestration calls for 15 musicians: two keyboards, the first of which is played by the conductor, electric bass, two guitars, drums, percussion, two trumpets, trombone, two woodwind players, two violins, and cello. The guitarists both double on acoustic and electric guitars, with the first playing lead and the second rhythm, and the trumpet doubles on flugelhorn; the original production also featured a piccolo trumpet double during tryouts. The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones and flute. The second woodwind player doubles on tenor, alto, soprano and baritone saxophones and flute, while the backup chorus calls for three males and three females. 

In the original Broadway production, a few of the actors mimed on musical instruments in order to fulfil a minimum musician requirement at the Neil Simon Theatre.

Touring productions often use smaller/reduced orchestrations to save on costs – the UK 2017/18 tour which used a 12-piece orchestration – two keyboards (Of which the first is played by the conductor), two guitars, electric bass, drums, percussion, two woodwind players (in which the second one is playing alto, tenor, soprano and baritone saxophones and flute), trombone and two trumpets and a 12-piece background chorus: six males and six females.

==Themes==
&quot;Hairspray&quot; explores racial prejudice and freedom of expression. It highlights individuality, and the importance of everyone working together for something to become revolutionary. The musical is empowering, as although it touches on racial issues prevalent in 1960s America, it focuses more on the associated attitudes, and the power we have to change discrimination. The musical encourages individuality, acceptance and freedom. It applies to any social context and time, as it highlights ongoing issues such as fat-shaming, racism and discrimination. It also explores femininity. Notably, Edna Turnblad is performed in drag. Allowing a drag role adds queerness to the musical, which has no gay characters. Edna is considered to be the non-racialized who is part of the story. The musical also challenges societal norms of femininity. Edna&#x27;s body size emphasizes the show&#x27;s diva roles. The musical highlights female characters who are strong and associated with diva characteristics.

&quot;Hairspray&quot; emphasizes issues of acceptance and discrimination within society. Set in the 1960s, it highlights racial discrimination against African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, with a focus on popular culture. The Civil Rights Movement gained African-Americans the right to vote, gave them a voice, and introduced freedom for all, but African-Americans still experienced vast inequality during this time. This reality, of the whites holding all institutional and political power, is portrayed in &quot;Hairspray&quot; in &quot;The Corny Collins Show&quot;. African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show only once a month, and there is a stereotypical racial representation of dance style. The social representation in &quot;Hairspray&quot; parallels the reality of the 1960s. By the end of the show, African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show. The show acknowledges the challenges and limitations enforced on African Americans during this time, and reminds audiences of the Civil Rights Movement&#x27;s achievements. Its message can also be used to empower change for other forms of discrimination relevant in today’s society.

==Response==
===Critics===
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot; received 13 favorable and four mixed reviews. In his &quot;Variety&quot; review, Charles Isherwood wrote: &quot;this sweet, infinitely spirited, bubblegum-flavored confection won&#x27;t be lacking for buyers any time soon. Arriving in an aerosol fog of advance hype, it more than lives up to its promise.&quot; Ben Brantley wrote: &quot;So what if it&#x27;s more than a little pushy in its social preaching? Stocked with canny, deliriously tuneful songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien with a common touch that stops short of vulgarity, &#x27;Hairspray&#x27; is as sweet as a show can be without promoting tooth decay. ...[it] succeeds in recreating the pleasures of the old-fashioned musical comedy without seeming old-fashioned. ...Shaiman... is taking the infectious hooks and rhythms from period pop and R&amp;B and translating them into the big, bouncy sound that Broadway demands... And while the savvy arrangements... nod happily to Motown, Elvis, Lesley Gore ballads and standards like &#x27;Higher and Higher&#x27;, the score&#x27;s appeal isn&#x27;t nostalgic. It&#x27;s music that builds its own self-contained, improbably symmetrical world&quot;. New York&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote, &quot;As Tracy, Marissa Jaret Winokur has the heft, the pipes and an enormously appealing stage presence. Her dancing may not be as special as the plot suggests, but she wins your heart... With this role, Fierstein places himself in the great line of Broadway divas.&quot;

===Box office and business===
&quot;Hairspray&quot; opened with a $12 million advance; after the 2003 Tony Awards, it was expected to do five times the business it normally did on a Monday. The entire $10.5 million investment was recouped by May 2003 (about nine months after it opened on Broadway). In 2002–03 it averaged 99% capacity; in 2007 it averaged 86%.

==Adaptations==

A film version was released in July 2007. The film was directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman and starred John Travolta as Edna, Christopher Walken as Wilbur, Queen Latifah as Maybelle, Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma, James Marsden as Corny, and Nikki Blonsky as Tracy. Hugh Jackman and Joey McIntyre were also considered to play Corny. NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot;, directed by Kenny Leon and Alex Rudzinski, aired in December 2016 to mostly positive reviews.

<doc id="358304" wikidata="Q1506501" url="?curid=358304" title="Sydney Symphony Orchestra">
<text>The Sydney Symphony Orchestra (SSO) is an Australian symphony orchestra based in Sydney. With roots going back to 1908, the orchestra was made a permanent professional orchestra on the formation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932. The orchestra has performed at the Sydney Opera House as its home concert hall, since the venue&#x27;s opening in 1973. Simone Young is the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor and the first female conductor in the post.

==Venues and programming==

The Sydney Symphony performs around 150 concerts a year to a combined annual audience of more than 350,000. The regular subscription concert series are mostly performed at the Sydney Opera House, but other venues around Sydney are used as well, including the City Recital Hall at Angel Place and the Sydney Town Hall. The Town Hall was the home of the orchestra until the opening of the Opera House in 1973. Since then, most concerts have been taking place in the Opera House&#x27;s Concert Hall (capacity: 2,679 seats). A major annual event for the orchestra is Symphony in the Domain, a free evening outdoor picnic concert held in the summer month of January in the large city park known as The Domain. Lately it has been presented in Parramatta. This event draws audiences of over 80,000 and is a long-established part of the Sydney summer cultural calendar.

==History==
The first concert by a group calling themselves the Sydney Symphony Orchestra was held on 30 September 1905. Sponsored by the Musicians Union, this group was formed from musicians who had come together to form an orchestra to accompany the pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s Sydney concerts when he toured Australia in 1904. A more sustained effort to establish an orchestra began in 1908 when an alliance between musicians, their union and leading business and legal figures organised regular subscription concerts. Between 1908 and 1917, a total of 47 concerts was held by a group calling themselves the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. These concerts included many Sydney premieres of key works of the classical repertoire including Schumann&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in B-flat, Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 1 in C minor, and in 1910, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; as well as a number of quite recent, even modernist works including, in 1910, Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone-poem &quot;Don Juan&quot;; in 1911, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;; in 1912, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;; in 1913, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;; in 1914, Borodin&#x27;s &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot;; and in 1917, Borodin&#x27;s Symphony in B minor and Glazunov&#x27;s Symphony in C minor. This initiative folded when most of the orchestra&#x27;s members were recruited by the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music&#x27;s orchestra, then conducted by its founding director, Henri Verbrugghen.
Verbrugghen resigned from the Conservatorium in 1922 amidst controversy regarding funding for his orchestra. The Conservatorium student orchestra, supplemented by teachers continued to give concerts throughout the 1920s. Although there were regular calls for the government to provide funding for a permanent full-time professional orchestra, no such orchestra had been established in Sydney when the ABC began operation in 1932. Despite expectations, according to Fraser, the ABC&#x27;s initial intervention was quite modest. It simply adopted the 20 piece orchestra already engaged in the Sydney studio by the ABC&#x27;s predecessor, the privately run Australian Broadcasting Company. Within the year, this orchestra was expanded to a 24-player concert orchestra used primarily for the purposes of broadcasting. However it sometimes combined for concerts with the NSW State Conservatorium under different names including the ABC Symphony Orchestra and the NSW State Symphony Orchestra. It was not until 1936 that the ABC sponsored a new series of orchestra concerts in Sydney under the name of the &quot;Sydney Symphony Orchestra&quot;. At this time the orchestra was increased to 45 players, and sometimes augmented to 70 players for public performances. It also again inaugurated annual concert seasons in that year. In 1937, the ABC purchased the name &quot;Sydney Symphony Orchestra&quot; from George Plummer who had been instrumental in establishing the initial Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1908.

Because of the political instability in Europe in the 1930s, many leading artists spent large amounts of time in Australia. Performances were given under the direction of Antal Doráti and Sir Thomas Beecham. Soloists appearing with the orchestra included Arthur Rubinstein, Bronisław Huberman, Artur Schnabel and Jascha Spivakovsky.

At the end of World War II, the ABC reached agreement with the Sydney City Council and the New South Wales state government to jointly fund the orchestra. The new 80-member Sydney Symphony Orchestra gave its first concert in January 1946.
Eugene Goossens joined the orchestra as its first chief conductor in 1947. Goossens introduced outdoor concerts and conducted Australian premieres of contemporary music. In 1948, he uttered the prophetic words, &quot;Sydney must have an opera house!&quot;. Goossens was knighted in 1955, the year before his term was due to end. His tenure was abruptly cut short in March 1956 under personal circumstances deemed &#x27;scandalous&#x27; at the time, and he was forced to return to England in disgrace.

Sir Eugene Goossens was succeeded by Nikolai Malko, Dean Dixon, Moshe Atzmon and Willem van Otterloo. Under van Otterloo, the orchestra made an eight-week European tour in 1974 which culminated in two concerts in Amsterdam and The Hague. Also under van Otterloo, the orchestra established the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House as its home base for most of its concerts.

In 1982, Sir Charles Mackerras, a former oboist with the orchestra, became the first Australian to be appointed its chief conductor. His term ended in 1985, although illness prevented him from conducting some later concerts. Zdeněk Mácal was initially appointed on a three-year contract from 1986 until 1988, which was reduced to one year, at his request; he nevertheless left abruptly in the first season. The young Australian conductor Stuart Challender, who had taken over some of Mackerras&#x27;s commitments in 1985, became the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor in 1987. In Australia&#x27;s bicentennial year (1988), Challender led the orchestra in a successful tour of the United States. He remained as chief conductor until his death in December 1991.

In 1994, the orchestra received increased support from the federal government, enabling it to raise the number of players to 110, increase touring and recording ventures, and improve orchestral salaries. That year, it also appointed Edo de Waart as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor and artistic director. de Waart held the post until 2003.

Since de Waart&#x27;s tenure, the Sydney Opera House has been the orchestra&#x27;s full-time home, with all rehearsals taking place in the Opera House Concert Hall. Highlights of his tenure in Sydney included Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in concert, a focus on the works of his personal favourite Mahler and tours of Europe (1995), Japan (1996) and the United States (1998).

Gianluigi Gelmetti was chief conductor from 2004 to 2008, succeeded by Vladimir Ashkenazy (2009–2013). In May 2012, David Robertson was named as the SSO&#x27;s next chief conductor, with an initial contract from 2014 to 2018. In July 2017, the SSO announced the extension of Robertson&#x27;s contract by one year, through to the end of 2019. Robertson concluded his SSO chief conductorship in 2019.

Simone Young first guest-conducted the SSO in 1996. In December 2019, the SSO announced the appointment of Young as its next chief conductor, effective in 2022, with an initial contract of 3 years. Young is the first female conductor to be named chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. In February 2024, the SSO announced the extension of Young&#x27;s contract as its chief conductor through the end of 2026.

==Financial structure==
The SSO, like all the other major symphony orchestras in Australia, was funded by the federal government as a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from the 1950s until the mid-2000s. A federal government review in 1994 severed the day-to-day management of the orchestra from the ABC and full independence was achieved on 1 January 2007. The orchestra now operates as a public company with a board of directors. Funding is provided by federal and state governments, corporate and private sponsorships and commercial activities as well as ticketing income.

==The SSO and the Sydney Opera House==

The Sydney Opera House, while among the most famous buildings of the 20th century, is problematic for the orchestra. The SSO was instrumental in calling for a new Opera House to be built and it was always intended to be their home venue. However, control of the Opera House has always rested with a separate body, the Sydney Opera House Trust, and the two institutions have had conflicts.

The longest running point of contention is the refusal by the Opera House Trust to allow the orchestra to drill small holes into the concert hall stage to allow proper seating of the endpins (spikes on the bottom) of their cellos and double basses, which is believed to give a better resonance to these instruments. The orchestra seats their endpins in planks of wood placed on the stage, as the Opera House Trust maintains that the entire building is heritage-listed under Australian law and that such work would therefore be illegal. Edo de Waart was particularly critical of this during his tenure as Chief Conductor in the 1990s, arguing in the press that the building had been specifically constructed for the orchestra and that it was a scandal that the orchestra was being forced to accept a reduced sound quality. However, the Opera House Trust has refused to bend and as of 2012 the orchestra was still using the planks of wood.

In November 2016, temporary sound reflectors were installed in the concert hall of the Opera House, to assist in amelioration of the acoustics. Renovations were completed in 2022.

<doc id="358308" wikidata="Q4848433" url="?curid=358308" title="Bailiff (Channel Islands)">
<text>The Bailiff is the chief justice in each of the Channel Island bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, also serving as president of the legislature and having ceremonial and executive functions. Each bailiwick has possessed its own bailiff since the islands were divided into two jurisdictions in the 13th century. The bailiffs and deputy bailiffs are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Secretary of State for Justice (not by the governments or legislatures of the islands) and may hold office until retirement age (65 in Guernsey, 70 in Jersey).

== Name ==
After 1212, the King of England appointed a custodian to manage the Crown&#x27;s affairs in the Channel Islands. At this time, there was no distinction between Warden/Governor and Bailiff, as evolved in later centuries. Officeholder Philip de Aubigné styled his role in 1218 as , being the Latin term for a person who looked after the interests of a Lord. With this meaning, could be translated to the English word &#x27;Warden&#x27;, by which the office is normally called today and became officially known after 1259.

The Warden was normally absent from the island, only regularly visiting for the triennial assize. Therefore, the Warden&#x27;s quotidian duties would have been carried out by a team of deputies, who were islanders and who became referred to as the . As such, one or more . By the end of the 13th century, the modern position of Bailiff appears in record, emerging from this position of .

== Roles of the bailiffs ==
Originally, the bailiff was both legislator and judge, but the position has become increasingly concentrated on the judicial functions. The bailiff presides in the main trial court in his island – the Royal Court of Jersey and the Royal Court of Guernsey, where they sit with Jurats, elected lay judges responsible for making finds of fact. The bailiff of each island is also a member of the court of appeal in his island, and that of the other.
The bailiffs are the presidents (presiding officers) of the legislatures—the States of Jersey Assembly and the States of Deliberation in Guernsey.

Constitutional changes introduced in Jersey (2005) and Guernsey (2004) created posts of chief minister and in Jersey (but not in Guernsey) created a ministerial system of government. This has altered the executive functions of the bailiffs but they continue to have a residual executive role (for example, they see any correspondence between the chief minister of their island and the UK government and may be involved in any political decisions affecting the constitutional relationship between the islands and the United Kingdom). Each bailiff continues to be the &#x27;first citizen&#x27; of the island, carrying out civil and ceremonial roles.

The last lay (that is, not legally-qualified) Bailiff in either jurisdiction was Sir Edgar McCulloch, Bailiff of Guernsey, who served in the role from 1884–1895. By constitutional convention he or she (though to date there have been no women holders of the office) and the deputy bailiff are now invariably selected from among those who have previously held the senior office within the Law Officers of the Crown–the Procureur in Guernsey and the Attorney General in Jersey. Bailiffs and deputy bailiffs in modern times have also invariably been qualified as advocates in their respective islands.

A deputy bailiff in each bailiwick may preside in the Royal Court and States chamber when the bailiff is not available. Senior jurats may be appointed as lieutenant-bailiffs to perform some ceremonial duties in lieu of the bailiff on occasion as well as presiding over judicial proceedings generally of an administrative nature.

In 1617 a Privy Council decision clarified the division of civil and military responsibilities between the bailiffs and the lieutenant governors in Guernsey and Jersey. For the first time, the Crown laid down the bailiff&#x27;s precedence over the governor in judicial affairs and in the States chamber.

==Bailiff of Guernsey==

The Bailiff of Guernsey was less clearly delineated as to separation of legislative or administrative and judicial functions than that of the Bailiff of Jersey. He was head of the administration in Guernsey and used to preside over a number of States committees.

In 2000, the European Court of Human Rights held in &quot;McGonnell v. United Kingdom&quot; that there was a breach of Article 6 in Guernsey where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as president of the States of Guernsey when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the Royal Court of Guernsey in a case where that legislation was relevant. The court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff &#x27;was subjectively biased&#x27;, stated that the &#x27;mere fact&#x27; that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff&#x27;s impartiality.

The Bailiff remains civil head of the island, as well as head of the judiciary, the Presiding Officer of the States of Deliberation&#x27;.

The Bailiff is ex officio, a Judge of the Court of Appeal and its President. The Bailiff represents Guernsey as civic head of the community in and outside the Island, on occasions of a non-political nature and will greet and welcome members of the Royal Family and dignitaries visiting the Island on behalf of the people of Guernsey. May be appointed as a member of the Court of Appeal of Jersey.

==Bailiff of Jersey==
The Bailiff of Jersey (, Jèrriais: ) is the chief justice of the island and the presiding officer of the States Assembly.

The position of bailiff was created shortly after the Treaty of Paris 1259 in which the King of England, Henry III, gave up claim to all of the Duchy of Normandy but the Channel Islands. Rather than absorb the islands into the Kingdom of England, a warden (now lieutenant governor) and bailiff were appointed to run the island on his behalf.

===Current roles===
The modern-day roles of the bailiff are as follows:
* Chief judge 
* President of the States Assembly, carrying out functions of a presiding officer
* Civic head of the Bailiwick of Jersey
* Guardian of the constitution
* President of the Licensing Assembly, regulating alcohol sales
* Must give permission for certain types of public entertainment to take place.

<doc id="358330" wikidata="Q1725409" url="?curid=358330" title="Peano curve">
<text>In geometry, the Peano curve is the first example of a space-filling curve to be discovered, by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. Peano&#x27;s curve is a surjective, continuous function from the unit interval onto the unit square, however it is not injective. Peano was motivated by an earlier result of Georg Cantor that these two sets have the same cardinality. Because of this example, some authors use the phrase &quot;Peano curve&quot; to refer more generally to any space-filling curve.

==Construction==
Peano&#x27;s curve may be constructed by a sequence of steps, where the formula_1th step constructs a set formula_2 of squares, and a sequence formula_3 of the centers of the squares, from the set and sequence constructed in the previous step. As a base case, formula_4 consists of the single unit square, and formula_5 is the one-element sequence consisting of its center point.

In step formula_1, each square formula_7 of formula_8 is partitioned into nine smaller equal squares, and its center point formula_9 is replaced by a contiguous subsequence of the centers of these nine smaller squares.
This subsequence is formed by grouping the nine smaller squares into three columns, ordering the centers contiguously within each column, and then ordering the columns from one side of the square to the other, in such a way that the distance between each consecutive pair of points in the subsequence equals the side length of the small squares. There are four such orderings possible:
*Left three centers bottom to top, middle three centers top to bottom, and right three centers bottom to top
*Right three centers bottom to top, middle three centers top to bottom, and left three centers bottom to top
*Left three centers top to bottom, middle three centers bottom to top, and right three centers top to bottom
*Right three centers top to bottom, middle three centers bottom to top, and left three centers top to bottom
Among these four orderings, the one for formula_7 is chosen in such a way that the distance between the first point of the ordering and its predecessor in formula_3 also equals the side length of the small squares. If formula_9 was the first point in its ordering, then the first of these four orderings is chosen for the nine centers that replace formula_9.

The Peano curve itself is the limit of the curves through the sequences of square centers, as formula_1 goes to infinity.

==L-system construction==
The Peano curve shown in the introduction can be constructed using a Lindenmayer system. This L-system can be described as follows:

where &quot;&quot; means &quot;draw forward&quot;, &quot;+&quot; means &quot;turn clockwise 90°&quot;, and &quot;−&quot; means &quot;turn anticlockwise 90°&quot;. The image in the introduction shows the images of the first three iterations of the rules.

The curve shown in the &#x27;construction&#x27; section be constructed as follows:

where &quot;&quot; means &quot;draw forward&quot;, &quot;+&quot; means &quot;turn clockwise 90°&quot;, and &quot;−&quot; means &quot;turn anticlockwise 90°&quot;. The image above shows the first two iterations of the rule.

==Variants==
In the definition of the Peano curve, it is possible to perform some or all of the steps by making the centers of each row of three squares be contiguous, rather than the centers of each column of squares. These choices lead to many different variants of the Peano curve.

A &quot;multiple radix&quot; variant of this curve with different numbers of subdivisions in different directions can be used to fill rectangles of arbitrary shapes.

The Hilbert curve is a simpler variant of the same idea, based on subdividing squares into four equal smaller squares instead of into nine equal smaller squares.

<doc id="358335" wikidata="Q476871" url="?curid=358335" title="The Call of the Wild">
<text>The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London, published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively more primitive and wild in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.

London spent about a year in Yukon, and his observations form much of the material for the book. The story was serialized in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the summer of 1903 and was published later that year in book form. The book&#x27;s great popularity and success made a reputation for London. As early as 1923, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations.

One of the more notable earlier films was filmed in 1935, starring Clark Gable and Loretta Young, as well as Frank Conroy and Jack Oakie. Considerable liberties were taken with the story line.

== Summary ==

The story opens in 1897 with Buck, a powerful 140-pound St. Bernard–Scotch Shepherd mix, happily living in California&#x27;s Santa Clara Valley as the pampered pet of Judge Miller and his family. One night, assistant gardener Manuel, needing money to pay off gambling debts, steals Buck and sells him to a stranger. Buck is shipped to Seattle, where he is 
confined in a crate, starved, and ill-treated. When released, Buck attacks his handler, the &quot;man in the red sweater&quot; who teaches Buck the &quot;law of club and fang&quot;, sufficiently cowing him. The man shows some kindness after Buck demonstrates obedience.

Shortly after, Buck is sold to two French-Canadian dispatchers from the Canadian government, François and Perrault, who take him to Alaska. Buck is trained as a sled dog for the Klondike region of Canada. In addition to Buck, François and Perrault have ten dogs on their team. Buck&#x27;s teammates teach him how to survive cold winter nights and about pack society. Over the next several weeks on the trail, a bitter rivalry develops between Buck and the lead dog, Spitz, a vicious and quarrelsome white husky. Buck eventually kills Spitz in a fight and becomes the new lead dog.

When François and Perrault complete the round-trip of the Yukon Trail in record time, returning to Skagway with their dispatches, they are given new orders from the Canadian government. They sell their sled team to a &quot;Scotch half-breed&quot; man, who works in the mail service. The dogs must make long, tiring trips, carrying heavy loads to the mining areas. While running the trail, Buck seems to have memories of a canine ancestor who has a short-legged hairy man as a companion. Meanwhile, the weary animals become weak from the hard labor, and the wheel dog, Dave, a morose husky, becomes terminally sick and is eventually shot.

With the dogs too exhausted and footsore to be of use, the mail carrier sells them to three stampeders from the American Southland (the present-day contiguous United States)—a vain woman named Mercedes, her sheepish husband Charles, and her arrogant brother Hal. They lack survival skills for the Northern wilderness, struggle to control the sled, and ignore others&#x27; helpful advice—particularly warnings about the dangerous spring melt. When told her sled is too heavy, Mercedes dumps out crucial supplies in favor of fashion objects. She and Hal foolishly create a team of 14 dogs, believing they will travel faster. The dogs are overfed and overworked, then starved when food runs low. Most of the dogs die on the trail, leaving only Buck and four other dogs when they pull into the White River.

The group meets John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs&#x27; poor condition. The trio ignores Thornton&#x27;s warnings about crossing the ice and press onward. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses to continue. After Hal whips Buck mercilessly, Thornton hits him and cuts Buck free. The group presses onward with the four remaining dogs, but their weight causes the ice to break and the dogs and humans (along with their sled) to fall into the river and drown.

As Thornton nurses Buck back to health, Buck grows to love him. Buck fends off a malicious man named Burton who hit Thornton while the latter was defending an innocent &quot;tenderfoot.&quot; This gives Buck a reputation all over the North. Buck also saves Thornton when he falls into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, a man called Matthewson wagers Thornton on Buck&#x27;s strength and devotion. Buck pulls a sled with a half-ton () load of flour, breaking it free from the frozen ground, dragging it , and winning Thornton US$1,600 ().

Using his winnings, Thornton pays his debts and continues searching for gold with partners Pete and Hans, sledding Buck and six other dogs to search for a fabled Lost Cabin. Once they locate a suitable gold find, the dogs find they have nothing to do. Buck has more ancestor memories of being with the primitive &quot;hairy man.&quot; While Thornton and his two friends pan gold, Buck hears the call of the wild, explores the wilderness, and socializes with a wolf from a local pack. However, Buck does not join the wolves and returns to Thornton. Buck repeatedly goes back and forth between Thornton and the wild, unsure of where he belongs. Returning to the campsite one day, he finds Hans, Pete, and Thornton along with their dogs have been murdered by Native American Yeehats. Enraged, Buck kills several Natives to avenge Thornton, then realizes he no longer has any human ties left. He goes looking for his wild brother and encounters a hostile wolf pack. He fights them and wins, then discovers that the lone wolf he had socialized with is a pack member. Buck follows the pack into the forest and answers the call of the wild.

The legend of Buck spreads among other Native Americans as the &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; of the Northland (Alaska and northwestern Canada). Each year, on the anniversary of his attack on the Yeehats, Buck returns to the former campsite where he was last with Thornton to mourn his death. Every winter, leading the wolf pack, Buck wreaks vengeance on the Yeehats &quot;as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.&quot;

== Background ==

California native Jack London had traveled around the United States as a hobo, returned to California to finish high school (he dropped out at age 14), and spent a year in college at Berkeley, when in 1897 he went to the Klondike by way of Alaska during the height of the Klondike Gold Rush. Later, he said of the experience: &quot;It was in the Klondike I found myself.&quot;

He left California in July and traveled by boat to Dyea, Alaska, where he landed and went inland. To reach the goldfields, he and his party transported their gear over the Chilkoot Pass, often carrying loads as heavy as on their backs. They were successful in staking claims to eight gold mines along the Stewart River.

London stayed in the Klondike for almost a year, living temporarily in the frontier town of Dawson City, before moving to a nearby winter camp, where he spent the winter in a temporary shelter reading books he had brought: Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. In the winter of 1898, Dawson City was a city comprising about 30,000 miners, a saloon, an opera house, and a street of brothels.
In the spring, as the annual gold stampeders began to stream in, London left. He had contracted scurvy, common in the Arctic winters where fresh produce was unavailable. When his gums began to swell he decided to return to California. With his companions, he rafted down the Yukon River, through portions of the wildest territory in the region, until they reached St. Michael. There, he hired himself out on a boat to earn return passage to San Francisco.

In Alaska, London found the material that inspired him to write &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. Dyea Beach was the primary point of arrival for miners when London traveled through there, but because its access was treacherous Skagway soon became the new arrival point for prospectors. To reach the Klondike, miners had to navigate White Pass, known as &quot;Dead Horse Pass&quot;, where horse carcasses littered the route because they could not survive the harsh and steep ascent. Horses were replaced with dogs as pack animals to transport material over the pass; particularly strong dogs with thick fur were &quot;much desired, scarce and high in price&quot;.

London would have seen many dogs, especially prized husky sled dogs, in Dawson City and the winter camps situated close to the main sled route. He was friends with Marshall Latham Bond and his brother Louis Whitford Bond, the owners of a mixed St. Bernard-Scotch Collie dog about which London later wrote: &quot;Yes, Buck is based on your dog at Dawson.&quot; Beinecke Library at Yale University holds a photograph of Bond&#x27;s dog, taken during London&#x27;s stay in the Klondike in 1897. The depiction of the California ranch at the beginning of the story was based on the Bond family ranch.

== Publication history ==
On his return to California, London was unable to find work and relied on odd jobs such as cutting grass. He submitted a query letter to the San Francisco &quot;Bulletin&quot; proposing a story about his Alaskan adventure, but the idea was rejected because, as the editor told him, &quot;Interest in Alaska has subsided to an amazing degree.&quot; A few years later, London wrote a short story about a dog named Bâtard who, at the end of the story, kills his master. London sold the piece to &quot;Cosmopolitan Magazine&quot;, which published it in the June 1902 issue under the title &quot;Diablo – A Dog&quot;. London&#x27;s biographer, Earle Labor, says that London then began work on &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; to &quot;redeem the species&quot; from his dark characterization of dogs in &quot;Bâtard&quot;. Expecting to write a short story, London explains: &quot;I meant it to be a companion to my other dog story &#x27;Bâtard&#x27; ... but it got away from me, and instead of 4,000 words it ran 32,000 before I could call a halt.&quot;

Written as a frontier story about the gold rush, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; was meant for the pulp market. It was first published in five installments in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which bought it for $750 in 1903 (~$ in ). In the same year, London sold all rights to the story to Macmillan, which published it in book format. The book has never been out of print since that time.

=== Editions ===
* The first edition, by Macmillan, released in August 1903, had 10 tipped-in color plates by illustrators Philip R. Goodwin and Charles Livingston Bull, and a color frontispiece by Charles Edward Hooper; it sold for $1.50. It is presently available with the original illustrations at the Internet Archive.

== Genre ==

&quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; falls into the categories of adventure fiction and what is sometimes referred to as the animal story genre, in which an author attempts to write an animal protagonist without resorting to anthropomorphism. At the time, London was criticized for attributing &quot;unnatural&quot; human thoughts and insights to a dog, so much so that he was accused of being a nature faker. London himself dismissed these criticisms as &quot;homocentric&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot;. London further responded that he had set out to portray nature more accurately than his predecessors.

Along with his contemporaries Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser, London was influenced by the naturalism of European writers such as Émile Zola, in which themes such as heredity versus environment were explored. London&#x27;s use of the genre gave it a new vibrancy, according to scholar Richard Lehan. 

The story is also an example of American pastoralism—a prevailing theme in American literature—in which the mythic hero returns to nature. As with other characters of American literature, such as Rip van Winkle and Huckleberry Finn, Buck symbolizes a reaction against industrialization and social convention with a return to nature. London presents the motif simply, clearly, and powerfully in the story, a motif later echoed by 20th-century American writers William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway (most notably in &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;). E.L. Doctorow says of the story that it is &quot;fervently American&quot;.

The enduring appeal of the story, according to American literature scholar Donald Pizer, is that it is a combination of allegory, parable, and fable. The story incorporates elements of age-old animal fables, such as &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables,&quot; in which animals speak the truth, and traditional beast fables, in which the beast &quot;substitutes wit for insight&quot;. London was influenced by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, written a few years earlier, with its combination of parable and animal fable, and by other animal stories popular in the early 20th century. In &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, London intensifies and adds layers of meaning that are lacking in these stories.

As a writer, London tended to skimp on form, according to biographer Labor, and neither &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; nor &quot;White Fang&quot; &quot;is a conventional novel&quot;. The story follows the archetypal &quot;myth of the hero&quot;; Buck, who is the hero, takes a journey, is transformed, and achieves an apotheosis. The format of the story is divided into four distinct parts, according to Labor. In the first part, Buck experiences violence and struggles for survival; in the second part, he proves himself a leader of the pack; the third part brings him to his death (symbolically and almost literally); and in the fourth and final part, he undergoes rebirth.
== Themes ==

London&#x27;s story is a tale of survival and a return to primitivism. Pizer writes that: &quot;the strong, the shrewd, and the cunning shall prevail when ...life is bestial&quot;.

Pizer also finds evidence in the story of a Christian theme of love and redemption, as shown by Buck&#x27;s refusal to revert to violence until after the death of Thornton, who had won Buck&#x27;s love and loyalty. London, who went so far as to fight for custody of one of his own dogs, understood that loyalty between dogs (particularly working dogs) and their masters is built on trust and love.

Writing in the &quot;Introduction&quot; to the Modern Library edition of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, E. L. Doctorow says the theme is based on Darwin&#x27;s concept of the survival of the fittest. London places Buck in conflict with humans, in conflict with the other dogs, and in conflict with his environment—all of which he must challenge, survive, and conquer. Buck, a domesticated dog, must call on his atavistic hereditary traits to survive; he must learn to be wild to become wild, according to Tina Gianquitto. He learns that in a world where &quot;the club and the fang&quot; are law, where the law of the pack rules and a good-natured dog such as Curly can be torn to pieces by pack members, survival by whatever means is paramount.

London also explores the idea of &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot;. Buck, raised as a pet, is by heredity a wolf. The change of environment brings up his innate characteristics and strengths to the point where he fights for survival and becomes the leader of the pack. Pizer describes how the story reflects human nature in its prevailing theme of strength, particularly in the face of harsh circumstances.

The veneer of civilization is thin and fragile, writes Doctorow, and London exposes the brutality at the core of humanity and the ease with which humans revert to a state of primitivism. His interest in Marxism is evident in the sub-theme that humanity is motivated by materialism, and his interest in Nietzschean philosophy is shown by Buck&#x27;s characterization. Gianquitto writes that in Buck&#x27;s characterization, London created a type of Nietzschean Übermensch – in this case a dog that reaches mythic proportions.

Doctorow sees the story as a caricature of a &quot;bildungsroman&quot; – in which a character learns and grows – in that Buck becomes progressively less civilized. Gianquitto explains that Buck has evolved to the point that he is ready to join a wolf pack, which has a social structure uniquely adapted to and successful in the harsh Arctic environment, unlike humans, who are weak in the harsh environment.
== Writing style ==

The first chapter opens with the first quatrain of John Myers O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem, &quot;Atavism&quot;, published in 1902 in &quot;The Bookman&quot;. The stanza outlines one of the main motifs of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;: that Buck when removed from the &quot;sun-kissed&quot; Santa Clara Valley where he was raised, will revert to his wolf heritage with its innate instincts and characteristics.

The themes are conveyed through London&#x27;s use of symbolism and imagery which, according to Labor, vary in the different phases of the story. The imagery and symbolism in the first phase, to do with the journey and self-discovery, depict physical violence, with strong images of pain and blood. In the second phase, fatigue becomes a dominant image and death is a dominant symbol, as Buck comes close to being killed. The third phase is a period of renewal and rebirth and takes place in the spring, before ending with the fourth phase, when Buck fully reverts to nature and is placed in a vast and &quot;weird atmosphere&quot;, a place of pure emptiness.

The setting is allegorical. The southern lands represent the soft, materialistic world; the northern lands symbolize a world beyond civilization and are inherently competitive. The harshness, brutality, and emptiness in Alaska reduce life to its essence, as London learned, and it shows in Buck&#x27;s story. Buck must defeat Spitz, the dog who symbolically tries to get ahead and take control. When Buck is sold to Charles, Hal, and Mercedes, he finds himself in a dirty camp. They treat their dogs badly; they are artificial interlopers in the pristine landscape. Conversely, Buck&#x27;s next masters, John Thornton and his two companions are described as &quot;living close to the earth&quot;. They keep a clean camp, treat their animals well, and represent man&#x27;s nobility in nature. Unlike Buck, Thornton loses his fight with his fellow species, and not until Thornton&#x27;s death does Buck revert fully to the wild and his primordial state.

The characters too are symbolic of types. Charles, Hal, and Mercedes symbolize vanity and ignorance, while Thornton and his companions represent loyalty, purity, and love. Much of the imagery is stark and simple, with an emphasis on images of cold, snow, ice, darkness, meat, and blood.

London varied his prose style to reflect the action. He wrote in an over-affected style in his descriptions of Charles, Hal, and Mercedes&#x27; camp as a reflection of their intrusion into the wilderness. Conversely, when describing Buck and his actions, London wrote in a style that was pared down and simple—a style that would influence and be the forebear of Hemingway&#x27;s style.

The story was written as a frontier adventure and in such a way that it worked well as a serial. As Doctorow points out, it is good episodic writing that embodies the style of magazine adventure writing popular in that period. &quot;It leaves us with satisfaction at its outcome, a story well and truly told,&quot; he said.
== Reception and legacy ==

&quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; was enormously popular from the moment it was published. H. L. Mencken wrote of London&#x27;s story: &quot;No other popular writer of his time did any better writing than you will find in &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of it in 1903: &quot;If nothing else makes Mr. London&#x27;s book popular, it ought to be rendered so by the complete way in which it will satisfy the love of dog fights apparently inherent in every man.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; wrote that it was a book: &quot;untouched by bookishness...The making and the achievement of such a hero [Buck] constitute, not a pretty story at all, but a very powerful one.&quot;

The book secured London a place in the canon of American literature. The first printing of 10,000 copies sold out immediately; it is still one of the best-known stories written by an American author and continues to be read and taught in schools. It has been published in 47 languages. London&#x27;s first success, the book secured his prospects as a writer and gained him a readership that stayed with him throughout his career.

After the success of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, London wrote to Macmillan in 1904 proposing a second book (&quot;White Fang&quot;) in which he wanted to describe the opposite of Buck: a dog that transforms from wild to tame: &quot;I&#x27;m going to reverse the process...Instead of devolution of decivilization ... I&#x27;m going to give the evolution, the civilization of a dog.&quot;

<doc id="358336" wikidata="Q607596" url="?curid=358336" title="Gibson Girl">
<text>The Gibson Girl was the personification of the feminine ideal of physical attractiveness as portrayed by the pen-and-ink illustrations of artist Charles Dana Gibson during a 20-year period that spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. The artist saw his creation as representing the composite of &quot;thousands of American girls&quot;.

==Image==

The Gibson Girl image that appeared in the 1890s combined elements of older American images of contemporary female beauty, such as the &quot;fragile lady&quot; and the &quot;voluptuous woman&quot;. From the &quot;fragile lady&quot; she took the basic slender lines, and a sense of respectability. From the &quot;voluptuous woman&quot; she took a large bust and hips, but was not vulgar or lewd, as previous images of women with large busts and hips had been depicted. From this combination emerged the Gibson Girl, who was tall and slender, yet with ample bosom, hips and buttocks. She had an exaggerated S-curve torso shape achieved by wearing a swan-bill corset. Images of her epitomized the late 19th- and early 20th-century Western preoccupation with youthful features and ephemeral beauty. Her neck was thin and her hair piled high upon her head in the contemporary bouffant, pompadour, and chignon (&quot;waterfall of curls&quot;) fashions. The statuesque, narrow-waisted ideal feminine figure was portrayed as being at ease and stylish.

She was a member of upper middle class society, always perfectly dressed in the latest fashionable attire appropriate for the place and time of day. The Gibson Girl was also one of the new, more athletic-shaped women, who could be found cycling through Central Park, often exercised and was emancipated to the extent that she could enter the workplace. In addition to the Gibson Girl&#x27;s refined beauty, in spirit, she was calm, independent and confident, and sought personal fulfillment. She could be depicted attending college and searching for a husband, but she would never have participated in the suffrage movement.

Taking part in the suffrage movement was something more associated with the New Woman, another cultural image of women that emerged around the same time as the Gibson Girl. As a more popular version of the New Woman, the Gibson Girl both undermined and sanctioned some women&#x27;s desires for progressive sociopolitical change. The New Woman was the more disconcerting of the two images at the time as she was seen as an example of change and disruption within the old patterns of social order, asking for the right to equal educational and work opportunities as well as progressive reform, sexual freedom and suffrage. Whilst the Gibson Girl took on many characteristics of the New Woman, she did so without involving herself in politics and thus did not appear to contemporaries at the time to be usurping traditionally masculine roles as the New Woman was deemed to. She therefore managed to stay within the boundaries of feminine roles without too much transgression.

Gibson depicted her as an equal and sometimes teasing companion to men. She was also sexually dominant, for example, literally examining comical little men under a magnifying glass, or, in a breezy manner, crushing them under her feet. Next to the beauty of a Gibson Girl, men often appeared as simpletons or bumblers; and even men with handsome physiques or great wealth alone could not provide satisfaction to her. Gibson illustrated men so captivated by her looks that they would follow her anywhere, attempting to fulfill any desire, even if it was absurd. One memorable drawing shows dumbstruck men following a Gibson Girl&#x27;s command to plant a young, leafless tree upside-down, roots in the air, simply because she wanted it that way. Most often, a Gibson Girl appeared single and uncommitted. However, a romance always relieved her boredom. Once married, she was shown deeply frustrated if romantic love had disappeared from her life, but satisfied if socializing with girlfriends or happy when doting on her infant child. In drawings such as these there was no hint at pushing the boundaries of women&#x27;s roles; instead they often cemented the long-standing beliefs held by many from the old social orders, rarely depicting the Gibson Girl as taking part in any activity that could be seen as out of the ordinary for a woman.


The artist believed that the Gibson Girl represented the beauty of American women:

Gibson believed that America&#x27;s women would become more beautiful:

Many women posed for Gibson Girl-style illustrations, including Gibson&#x27;s wife, Irene Langhorne, who may have been the original model, and was a sister of Viscountess Nancy (Langhorne) Astor. Other models included Mabel Normand, Evelyn Nesbit, Minnie Clark, and Clara B. Fayette. The most famous Gibson Girl was probably the American-British stage actress, Camille Clifford, whose high coiffure and long, elegant gowns that wrapped around her hourglass figure and tightly corseted wasp waist defined the style. 

Among the many &quot;Gibson Girl&quot; illustrators were Howard Chandler Christy whose work celebrating American &quot;beauties&quot; was similar to Gibson&#x27;s, and Harry G. Peter, who was most famous for his art on Wonder Woman comics.

In the newly developing art of cinema, although most leading actresses were at the cutting style of the day, the ones who came to embody it best were the Biograph girls, Florence Lawrence and to a more ingénue side of it, Mary Pickford. They personified and catapulted the cult of &quot;the ideal woman&quot; for the masses beyond American borders. Camille Clifford, a woman known as the &quot;ideal Gibson Girl&quot;, posed for various photographers and produced photographs that exemplified the physical characteristics of the Gibson Girl.

==Popularity==
Some people argue that the Gibson Girl was the first national beauty standard for American women. Gibson&#x27;s fictional images of her published in newspapers and magazines during the Belle Époque were extremely popular. Merchandise bearing her image included saucers, ashtrays, tablecloths, pillow covers, chair covers, souvenir spoons, screens, fans, and umbrella stands.

By the outbreak of World War I, changing fashions caused the Gibson Girl to fall out of favor as women favored practical clothing compatible with changing times over the elegant dresses, bustle gowns, shirtwaists, and terraced, floor-length skirts favored by the Gibson Girl. The image was not forgotten, however. The USAAF World War II-era SCR-578, and the similar post-war AN/CRT-3, survival radio transmitters carried by aircraft on over-water operations, were given the nickname &quot;Gibson Girl&quot; because of their &quot;hourglass&quot; shape; this allowed them to be held securely between the thighs whilst the generator handle was turned.

<text>Doug is an American animated sitcom created by Jim Jinkins and produced by Jumbo Pictures. It originally aired on Nickelodeon from August 11, 1991, to January 2, 1994, and on ABC from September 7, 1996, to June 26, 1999. The show focuses on the early adolescent life and zany hijinks of its title character, Douglas &quot;Doug&quot; Funnie, who experiences common predicaments while attending school in his new hometown of Bluffington. Doug narrates each story in his journal, and the show incorporates many imagination sequences. The series addresses numerous topics, including trying to fit in, platonic and romantic relationships, self-esteem, bullying, and rumors. Many episodes center on Doug&#x27;s attempts to impress his classmate and crush, Patti Mayonnaise.

Jinkins developed &quot;Doug&quot; from drawings in his sketchbook that he created over the course of the 1980s. &quot;Doug&quot;, a mostly autobiographical creation, was largely inspired by Jinkins&#x27;s childhood growing up in Virginia, with most characters in the series being based on real individuals. He first pitched &quot;Doug&quot; as a children&#x27;s book to uninterested publishers before Nickelodeon purchased the show. Following this, the series underwent further development, in which Jinkins meticulously detailed every aspect of the show&#x27;s setting. Jinkins was insistent that the series would have a purpose and instructed writers to annotate each script with a moral. The show&#x27;s unusual soundtrack consists largely of scat singing and mouth noises.

The series premiered on the cable network Nickelodeon, as the first of the original three Nicktoons alongside two other original animated series, &quot;Rugrats&quot; (which premiered directly after &quot;Doug&quot;) and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (which premiered directly after &quot;Rugrats&quot;). The original run consisted of 52 episodes over four seasons that were broadcast from 1991 to 1994, with Games Animation and Ellipse Programmé co-producing. Due to Nickelodeon opting against renewing the show for a fifth season, The Walt Disney Company would acquire Jumbo Pictures alongside the &quot;Doug&quot; intellectual property, subsequently green-lighting the show for three additional seasons of 65 episodes. Jinkins made several creative changes during this time. The show moved to ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup, co-produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. In 1998, the series also aired on television syndication. It became a top-rated show, inspiring various books, merchandise, a live musical stage show, and a theatrical feature, &quot;Doug&#x27;s 1st Movie&quot;, released as the series&#x27; conclusion in 1999. The series has seen multiple home video releases during its run.

==Premise==
The series revolves around Douglas &quot;Doug&quot; Funnie, an 11 (later 12)-year-old boy who wants to be another face in the crowd, but by possessing a vivid imagination and a strong sense of right and wrong, he is more likely to stand out. He keeps a journal, which he treats as an autobiography, as he records numerous experiences over the series, which range from learning to dance to getting a bad haircut. Doug Funnie and his family (which consists of his parents Theda and Phil, sister Judy, and dog Porkchop) move from the town of Bloatsburg to Bluffington after his dad receives a job promotion. Bluffington is in the United States but not in any specific U.S. state. However, Bluffington is loosely based on the city of Richmond, Virginia, where creator Jim Jinkins was born and raised.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

Beyond the title character, &quot;Doug&quot; features a large ensemble cast of characters. Many of the series&#x27; ancillary characters, among them Ms. Wingo and Mr. Spitz, are based on authority figures from Jinkins&#x27; childhood.

*Doug Funnie (voiced by Billy West from seasons 1–4, Tom McHugh seasons 5–7): Doug is depicted as a shy, insecure, self-conscious, and gullible 11 (later 12)-year-old boy who more often than not tries to deal with his fear of failure. He has talents for writing, drawing, making music (he plays a banjo), and caring for animals (he owns a dog named Porkchop). While Doug just wants to fit in with his peers, he has a vivid imagination and an unparalleled sense of morality that both make him stand out amongst them. Doug narrates every episode and writes his experiences in his journal. He has an alter ego, Quailman, who was inspired by Jinkins&#x27;s and Roberts&#x27;s childhood home movies in which they posed as superheroes. Billy West, the original voice behind Doug, was assigned by executive Vanessa Coffey, to Jinkins&#x27;s initial reluctance, but Jinkins would eventually come to view it as the best possible voice for the character. West, in recording lines for Doug, noted that &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of me in there, because I&#x27;m going through my own experiences in there, because I have a conscience.&quot;
*Porkchop (voiced by Fred Newman): Doug&#x27;s anthropomorphic pet Bull Terrier who is one of Doug&#x27;s sidekicks and accompanies him nearly everywhere he goes. He sometimes assists Doug in making decisions and acts as his conscience. Porkchop is very talented in many things such as acting. He lives in an igloo-shaped doghouse in the Nickelodeon series, and a tipi in the Disney series. During a Christmas special, it is shown that Doug got Porkchop as a Christmas gift and that Porkchop once saved Beebe Bluff&#x27;s life when she was about to fall through some thin ice. Porkchop, along with Doug, originally first appeared in ID spots for the USA Network children&#x27;s block, &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot;.
*Mosquito &quot;Skeeter&quot; Valentine (voiced by Fred Newman): Skeeter is Doug&#x27;s blue-skinned best friend. He is a normal boy who is more sociable than Doug, though he occasionally makes honking noises. Skeeter and his family have lived in Bluffington for some time, so he helps Doug acclimate to Bluffington. For example, Skeeter helps Doug order food at the popular Bluffington restaurant Honker Burger in the series premiere (resulting in their friendship). The character was based on Jinkins&#x27; high school best friend, Tommy Roberts.
*Patti Mayonnaise (voiced by Constance Shulman): Patti is an intelligent, lovely, talented, and athletic girl who is Doug&#x27;s female best friend and love interest. She is kind and helpful, but she does have weaknesses, such as a tendency to be competitive, being gullible, and to anger easily if pushed too far. Jinkins based the character on his adolescent crush from junior high and high school, and culled her name from two girls from his childhood, Pam Mayo and a girl named Patty.
*Roger M. Klotz (voiced by Billy West in the Nickelodeon series, Chris Phillips in the Disney series): Roger is Doug&#x27;s green-skinned nemesis, and a school bully. However, he is not prominently shown as an actual bully, instead having mischievous tendencies, playing practical jokes on characters. He is older than others in his class, as it took him three years to graduate from sixth grade. Roger has a crush on Doug&#x27;s sister Judy and in certain episodes tries to woo her. Roger and his divorced mother lived in a trailer park in the Nickelodeon series; in the Disney series, Roger&#x27;s family becomes wealthy from a real-estate deal struck between the owner of the trailer park and the Bluff family. Roger was inspired from a bully who lived in the same neighborhood as Jinkins. He adopted the bully&#x27;s neighbors&#x27; last name, Klotz, for the character.
*Beebe Bluff (voiced by Alice Playten): The heiress to the Bluff family fortune. Beebe is the daughter of Bill Bluff, the richest man in the town and a friend of Mayor White. The Bluff family is the namesake of the town of Bluffington, and in the second series, the school is even named after Beebe. Despite a certain air of superiority over her peers, Beebe maintains friendships with Patti Mayonnaise and most of her other contemporaries. Doug had his first kiss with her in the episode &quot;Doug&#x27;s Secret Admirer&quot;, although it was out of gratitude rather than love, since she already has a crush on Skeeter. Beebe was Alice Playten&#x27;s final animated role before her death in 2011.
*Judith &quot;Judy&quot; Anastasia Funnie (voiced by Becca Lish): Judy Funnie is Doug&#x27;s older sister. Judy is very intelligent and especially dramatic. Unsurprisingly, she attends the Moody School, a school for artistically talented teenagers. Judy often gives or directs performances at Bluffington Elementary, which Doug initially dreads out of fear that Judy will embarrass him (as she has done in the past). Judy is usually seen wearing only purple and black, and rarely takes off her beret or her sunglasses. She has a very strong beatnik personality. Her actress, Becca Lish, also voices Doug&#x27;s mother, Theda Funnie, his friend Connie Benge, bass player Wendy Nespah of Doug&#x27;s favorite band The Beets, the hairdresser Fluke and many other characters.
*Chalky Studebaker (voiced by Doug Preis): Chalky is considerably the most athletic of Doug&#x27;s main circle of friends, and he is an excellent student. He wants to follow the footsteps of his older brother, Cliff.
*Connie Benge (voiced by Becca Lish): A naive schoolgirl who is best friends with Patti and Beebe, and also one of Doug&#x27;s friends. She had a small crush on Doug in the Nickelodeon series. Although she was rather heavy-set in the first series, she lost weight between the two series and received a new wardrobe and hairstyle after going to a beauty camp for the summer, making her look quite different in either show. In certain episodes of the first series, the color schemes for Connie&#x27;s hair and skin are switched, giving her lime green hair and violet skin instead of indigo hair and pale green skin.
*Al and Moo Sleech (voiced by Eddie Korbich): Nerdy twin brothers and two of Doug&#x27;s best friends. Doug looks to them for technical help whenever he needs it. They tend to speak to each other using their own &quot;twin language&quot; using numbers for various words and phrases. In the Disney series, they skip all of the middle school grades and enter high school, but they maintain their relationships with Doug and others. They are each shown to have a crush on Judy. The two try to hide the fact that their father is not as intelligent as they are and is a hardworking doughnut baker.
*Mr. Bud Dink (voiced by Fred Newman): A slightly odd, purple-skinned, dimwitted, retiree who lives next door to the Funnies with his wife and foil, Tippy (voiced by Doris Belack). Doug frequently approaches Mr. Dink for advice, but sometimes it is useless. He and his wife&#x27;s last name comes from an acronym: Dual Income, No Kids, which supports Mr. Dink&#x27;s spending on various things he claims as &quot;very expensive&quot;. In later Nickelodeon episodes, Mrs. Dink becomes mayor of Bluffington, a role she continues in the Disney version.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Doug&quot; was created by animator Jim Jinkins. He was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1953, and grew up fascinated by drawing. He went on to animation and filmmaking at Ohio State University, and upon graduation, got a job working at PBS in their children&#x27;s programming unit. Jinkins first sketched the character of Doug while doodling without thought, not aiming to create a character based on himself. In the 1980s, he began working on an autobiographical character named Brian, which he later changed to Doug, as it was a very common name. He began to view the character as his &quot;alter-ego&quot;, drawing him in various silly and occasionally cynical scenarios in his sketchbook.

In 1984, Jinkins&#x27;s career took a turn for the worse, as well as his personal life: he had a rough breakup and suffered injuries in a biking accident. During this time, he gained a new outlook on life. Desiring to &quot;create a place where there was no overdue rent and no delinquent phone bills,&quot; he began doodling and formed the basis for Bluffington, the central location in &quot;Doug&quot;. The character&#x27;s early designs were solidified alongside friend David Campbell at a small Mexican restaurant in New York. He later credited the character&#x27;s odd coloring choices from being in a &quot;margarita stupor&quot;. Campbell suggested he make Doug into a children&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Doug Got a New Pair of Shoes&quot;, which was rejected by all of the city&#x27;s publishing houses. Simon &amp; Schuster was interested, but management changed before it purchased the pitch. The character made its first animated appearance in a 1988 Florida Grapefruit Growers commercial, and it was also used for a 1989 promotional bumper for the USA Network.

Meanwhile, cable network Nickelodeon, aiming to expand its content and find creative auteurs, began a search for animators to develop their first original animated series. This was very unusual for the time period, which often consisted of pre-licensed characters, such as &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot;. Jinkins had actually worked at the network before it was renamed Nickelodeon; he was employed in the late 1970s, on their first show &quot;Pinwheel.&quot; Jinkins set up a meeting with executive Vanessa Coffey to show her the book prototype. Coffey ran out of the room (&quot;which is, you know, disturbing,&quot; Jinkins would recall), but only to inform her boss that &quot;This [Jinkins] guy is the real deal, and we&#x27;re taking him to pilot.&quot; Employing voice artists and writers from New York, Jinkins created a pilot for &quot;Doug&quot;, titled &quot;Doug Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. It was one of three six-minute pilots chosen out of eight to premiere as Nickelodeon&#x27;s debut animated series, or Nicktoons. It also tested the highest out of eight that were shown to test audiences, scoring the highest of eight points. The long contract development took nearly a year to complete. Jinkins made sure that his contract allowed him to take the series to another network if Nickelodeon did not complete the show&#x27;s order.

In another unusual move, Nickelodeon allowed their purchased pilots to be animated at independent studios. Jinkins and Campbell founded Jumbo Pictures in July 1990 to produce &quot;Doug&quot;. He would later recall the oddity of the deal, remarking, &quot;that was a moment in time where we were able to be an independent production company and deliver those shows.&quot; Coffey was the main executive in charge of the series&#x27; production, and Jinkins would later give her credit in bringing the show to air. The pilot was a success, as Nickelodeon happily decided to greenlight production for the first season, scheduling it for early August 1991. The plan was to make 26 segments, but pair up 2 each to make up the 30-minute runtime of programming.

===Writing and design===
Jinkins characterized the series as not entirely autobiographical, but emotionally accurate to his childhood experiences. The show was designed and based on his experiences growing up in Virginia, designing it as such to give the viewers &quot;a roller coaster of emotions.&quot; Each character in the series was based on people from Jinkins&#x27; life, with some exaggerations. Prior to the show&#x27;s premiere, Jinkins sent messages to each subject of inspiration, notifying them of their inclusion. Jinkins&#x27; religious upbringing also made its way into the series, albeit without direct reference. For example, if an episode is set on Sunday, Doug&#x27;s family is dressed in their church clothes. Jinkins felt it was important to not insert overly religious themes into the series, but he viewed it essential that each episode contain a moral. The series was also inspired by &quot;Peanuts&quot;.

The show&#x27;s design was labor-intensive, intended to convey a certain logic to the show&#x27;s universe. In the show&#x27;s pitch bible, which Jinkins described as &quot;huge&quot;, contain floor plans for each main character&#x27;s homes, as well as maps of each street. In addition, Jinkins and the series&#x27; developers paid particular attention to more hidden elements within the series, such as the founding fathers of the show&#x27;s central town. In writing the series, the production schedule was built around spending several weeks writing the series&#x27; scripts. Jinkins asked each writer to place a central theme at the top of each script — what issue Doug is dealing with, and what he learns. Jinkins often told staff that he wanted the show to remain relevant &quot;in 30 years,&quot; aiming for a timeless effect. While developing the series, Jinkins wanted to change its name from &quot;Doug&quot; to &quot;The Funnies&quot;, but the network encouraged him to stick with the original name. There was a &quot;cross-pollination&quot; among the network&#x27;s writing staff. This involved story editors being assigned to the show, among them Mitchell Kriegman of &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; and Will McRobb of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;. &quot;There was definitely camaraderie and a quirkiness about who they were hiring,&quot; Jinkins later said. &quot;Sometimes it didn&#x27;t work quite so well, but working with McRobb was awesome!&quot; McRobb, who worked with Spümcø on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; at the same time, called working on both shows &quot;schizophrenic&quot; due to the contrast between the two studios&#x27; working environment; Jumbo Pictures was relatively peaceful and conformed to what little resistance Nickelodeon executives had while Spümcø had frequent feuds, if not necessarily aggressive conflicts with them. McRobb convinced a team at Spümcø, including John Kricfalusi and Vincent Waller to work on layouts for a single episode of &quot;Doug&quot;; they considered the experience to be &quot;joyless&quot;, but Kricfalusi did not mind as it brought more funding to the studio. The episode, &quot;Doug Is Quailman/Doug Out in Left Field&quot;, was apparently vandalized by the staff with hidden Ren and Stimpy cameos, which were not visible in the final cut.

In translating the show into animation, the characters&#x27; designs were solidified. &quot;Jim Jinkins is an illustrator and not an animator, so his initial drawings were a little bit more of a wiggly line,&quot; said Yvette Kaplan. The designs were inspired by Jinkins&#x27; period working for R. O. Blechman at the Ink Tank, incorporating Blechman&#x27;s nervous line quality.

===Music===
Jinkins was also very involved in the show&#x27;s music. One of the show&#x27;s most notable elements is its unique a cappella soundtrack by voice actor Fred Newman. &quot;Fred showed me how you could take out a guitar and use a tuna can filled with water that you&#x27;d thump with your finger,&quot; said Jinkins. The concept of making music out of anything, or making something good out of nothing, is explored in &quot;Doug&#x27;s Garage Band&quot; (episode 38, part 2), which ends in Doug performing the song &quot;Bangin’ on a Trashcan&quot;.

In the series, Doug&#x27;s favorite rock group is The Beets, a play on the Beatles—the band&#x27;s members also visually resemble caricatures of Ringo Starr (of the Beatles) and Robert Plant (of Led Zeppelin), and their penchant for endless reunion tours owes to the Who. Jinkins viewed the series&#x27; music as part of the storytelling.

Newman deliberately attempted to deviate from the standard for animated cartoons, which traditionally followed the style of Carl Stalling&#x27;s work, with the frantic pacing being ill-suited for the show. The most complicated piece of music created for the series was for the opening sequence, which was recorded preceding animation, rather than the typical method of composing it afterward. The series&#x27; theme song is largely composed of simple sounds, mostly &quot;doo-doo&quot; and &quot;na-na&quot;, performed in a scat singing style with increasing intensity, and culminating in a crescendo of several harmonies. Newman&#x27;s scat singing also plays over transitions in the series. The show also incorporated many homemade sound effects.

In the closing credits for the first season of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Doug&quot;, two different pieces of music would play: the first piece would be taken from the second segment in the episode, and during the last third, Porkchop would don headphones and listen to music from the first segment, drowning out the original background music and annoying Doug, ending with Doug chasing Porkchop. Subsequent seasons, however, use a single piece of music for their closing credits (despite using the same animation). Starting with the Disney series, the credits have used Doug chasing Porkchop to the left and right only for Porkchop to chase Doug to the left while the credits play.

===Disney acquisition===

The original deal required Jumbo to produce 65 episodes of &quot;Doug&quot;, which Nickelodeon would air in blocks of 13 per season. After four seasons and 52 episodes of &quot;Doug&quot;, Nickelodeon declined to order the additional 13, citing the show&#x27;s expensive budget during a budget freeze. The network had a two-year window in which it could reverse the decision. The show received strong interest from several networks, among them ABC. Each time they received interest, they would notify Nickelodeon in order to speed up ordering the series&#x27; fifth season. In February 1996, The Walt Disney Company, having closed on its purchase of ABC earlier in the year, purchased &quot;Doug&quot; in a multimillion-dollar deal with Jinkins and Campbell. The deal involved buying Jumbo Pictures and &quot;signing them to five-year contracts, with stock options, to be Disney executives.&quot; The company also purchased the &quot;Doug&quot; trademark and its rights to all future merchandising. Nickelodeon was allowed to retain the rights to the episodes produced from 1991 to 1994.

Due to the length of time between the series&#x27; run on Nickelodeon and its beginning on ABC, there were several creative changes. Production of the series relocated from New York City to Los Angeles. This meant the voice actors recorded their lines remotely instead of together in the studio. Billy West was replaced by Tom McHugh as the voice of Doug, while the role of Roger was taken over by Chris Phillips. Disney could not afford West, as his fame had grown from voicing characters in &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and other animated properties. Jinkins argues that he worked hard to keep West on the series, claiming that the deal the company offered him was breaking their budget. In 2013, despite not returning to the Disney version, West mentioned that he would be open to returning as the role/character.

Several original staff members of &quot;Doug&quot; have openly regarded the Disney run as inferior to the Nickelodeon run. Jinkins was less hands-on regarding the production of the show&#x27;s Disney episodes due to other responsibilities. &quot;I mostly agree with &quot;Doug&quot; fans who think the original 104 eleven-minute &quot;Doug&quot; stories made for Nick were the best&quot;, Jinkins later said. David Campbell felt the Nickelodeon episodes were &quot;quirkier&quot; and better, while Constance Shulman, Patti Mayonnaise&#x27;s voice actress, felt voice recording sessions were not the same in the show&#x27;s newer incarnation: &quot;I missed all the gang crammed in the studio, waiting for their turn for the big group scene. Someone just dimmed the magic a bit.&quot;

Another factor in &quot;Doug&quot; going to Disney might have been Nickelodeon&#x27;s high expectations for the series not being met, something that has been acknowledged by Jinkins as well as &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; creator John Kricfalusi. Among Nickelodeon&#x27;s three original Nicktoons, executives were banking on &quot;Doug&quot; to be the network&#x27;s breakout hit. While &quot;Doug&quot; proved to be popular, it was by far Nickelodeon&#x27;s least popular original Nicktoon, as &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; would (alongside &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;) help revive interest in the adult animation genre that had been largely dormant since &quot;The Flintstones&quot; ended in 1966. Meanwhile, Nickelodeon&#x27;s other original Nicktoon, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, would instead be the network&#x27;s breakout hit and would remain in production until 2004, long after the other two series ended production.

Since the acquisition, Disney has owned the rights to produce any future material in the &quot;Doug&quot; franchise. In 2016, Jinkins stated that Disney had &quot;no interest&quot; in revamping the show.

Doug and Porkchop appear on a billboard in the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; movie, released on Disney+ in May 2022.

In 2023, Jinkins revealed concept art he had drawn for a potential revival titled &quot;Doug Kids&quot; that would focus on the children of Doug and his friends. While no movement has been made, he has stated that he hopes to pitch it to Disney in the future.

==Themes==
The series covers aspects of desiring to be different while coming of age. According to Jinkins, honesty is the series&#x27; main theme:

For example, the episode &quot;Doug&#x27;s in the Money&quot; finds the titular character coming across an envelope of cash and returning it to its elderly owner. It created a heated debate among the series&#x27; writers regarding honesty. In the episode, Doug is rewarded with a stick of gum. &quot;It comes down to how we think about who is involved in a story. In that case, I wanted Doug to do something that hurt where there was no tangible reward,&quot; said Jinkins.

The series also made frequent use of cutaways, frequently showing Doug daydreaming certain scenarios. The use of cutaways declined during the Disney run, but was never eliminated. The technique would become much more frequently used on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which debuted five months before the series concluded.

After the series&#x27; completion, much of the online debate ensued over the race of Doug&#x27;s best friend, Skeeter, who some viewers felt exhibited traits stereotypical of African Americans, and who subsequently drew conclusions that the character was intended to be African American. Jinkins did not envision this discourse on the series&#x27; colors. When creating the show, he came across his 200 design markers and employed an array of bright, wild colors for the characters. Jinkins later told &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2014 that the series&#x27; colors &quot;came to symbolize the irrelevance of race.&quot;

==Home media==
Sony Wonder released a series of &quot;Doug&quot; videos between 1993 and 1996. Walt Disney Home Video released four videos of the Disney episodes in 1997; each collection featured two episodes.

Nickelodeon and Amazon.com teamed up to release &quot;Doug&quot; and other Nick shows on manufacture-on-demand DVD-R discs available exclusively through Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace arm. Seasons 3 and 4 of &quot;Doug&quot; were released on DVD on December 8, 2009, and December 22, 2009, respectively.

Season 4 was supposed to be released as a complete season, but Nickelodeon was unable to secure two episodes from the season and opted to rename the DVD release &quot;Doug: The Best of Season 4&quot;. &quot;Doug: The Complete Nickelodeon Series&quot; was released on June 26, 2014.

===Streaming===
Currently, all of the original run episodes, including the two that are missing from the season 4 DVD since it&#x27;s Paramount+ removal in December 2024, are available from video on demand services such as iTunes Store, PlayStation Network, and Amazon Prime Video, while the Disney run episodes and &quot;Doug&#x27;s First Movie&quot; are on Disney+.

===Broadcast===
Reruns of the Nickelodeon series aired on Noggin until 2002, Nicktoons until 2007, and on TeenNick&#x27;s NickRewind block from 2011 to 2021. Reruns also air on Pluto TV&#x27;s &quot;90s Kids&quot; channel as of October 2023.

The Disney series aired reruns on UPN’s Disney&#x27;s One Too until 2000, Disney Channel until 2002, and on Toon Disney until 2004.

==Reception==
The series premiered alongside &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; on August 11, 1991, being scheduled first among the three series. The show was not as immediately popular as its counterparts, and Jinkins lamented to Coffey this fact. &quot;&quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; is getting so much attention because of [the show&#x27;s creator] John Kricfalusi. I feel like the squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot;. Nickelodeon was largely attempting to push the limits of children&#x27;s programming, while &quot;Doug&quot; was a much gentler, quiet show. While the original Nickelodeon series received mostly positive reviews, the Disney series received a more mixed reception, and became notable for negative reception from fans.

===Ratings===
The new Nicktoons block on Nickelodeon raised the network&#x27;s ratings instantly. &quot;Doug&quot; constantly achieved over 2.0 in the network&#x27;s most desirable demographics.

When the show moved to ABC in 1997, &quot;Doug&quot; became the most popular program on ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup, attracting the highest ratings of any cartoon on the network. Its high-rated second season on the network contributed to its position as the number one network in Saturday morning ratings.

The Disney episodes later reran in broadcast syndication and on the Disney&#x27;s One Too block on UPN.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Doug&quot; received numerous domestic and international awards and nominations. It won two Parents&#x27; Choice Awards, two Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and was nominated for three CableACE Awards and four Daytime Emmy Awards. It was also nominated for the Prix Jeunesse International Award.
==Other media==
===Stage show===
On March 15, 1999, Disney premiered a new musical stage show, &quot;Doug Live!&quot;, at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (at the time known as Disney-MGM Studios) at the Walt Disney World Resort. The show ran until May 12, 2001.

===Film===

A theatrical feature-length film, &quot;Doug&#x27;s 1st Movie&quot;, was released on March 26, 1999, before production on the television show ceased. During this time, meet-and-greet costumed versions of Doug and Patti were seen in Walt Disney World.

===Video game===
A video game for Game Boy Color was released in 2000, titled &quot;Doug&#x27;s Big Game&quot;.

===Comics===
While Doug had never received his own self-titled print media outside of books that retold events of the TV series&#x27; episodes, comics that entailed original stories were published in the magazine Disney Adventures, from Volume 7 #5 in February 1997, to Volume 12 #1 in February 2002. To date, the one-page comic &quot;Neckerchief Grief&quot; is the last official material that features Doug in any major capacity.

<text>The Republic of Central Lithuania (, ), commonly known as the Central Lithuania, and the Middle Lithuania (, , ), was an unrecognized short-lived puppet state of Poland, that existed from 1920 to 1922. It was founded on 12 October 1920, after the successful Żeligowski Mutiny, during which the volunteer 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division under the command of general Lucjan Żeligowski seized the Vilnius Region that Lithuania made claims to. It was incorporated into Poland on 18 April 1922.

Vilnius, the historical capital of Lithuania, had a majority Polish-speaking population with a Lithuanian-speaking minority of only 2–3%. Therefore, the Polish authorities decided that the region should belong to the newly-established Polish state, and attempted to implement this idea using military force, ignoring the Curzon Line and taking advantage of the fact that victorious Poles after the Battle of Warsaw were advancing to the East against the Bolsheviks in the Polish–Soviet War. The Poles reasoned that they were justified in seizing as many mixed areas as possible, as well as to protect the Catholic, predominantly Polish-speaking population in disputed areas. Being utterly militarily outmatched, Lithuania did not stand a chance to maintain control of the region. This led to the renewal of Polish–Lithuanian War, where the so-called Żeligowski Mutiny, secretly ordered by Józef Piłsudski, was part of the military operation, fully supported and backed on the flanks by the Polish army, and consequently to the establishment of the so-called Republic of Central Lithuania.

The republic had features of a state administration, but it was an imitation of a sovereign state which repressed Lithuanian organizations, education, censored and suspended Lithuanian publications. After a variety of delays, a disputed election took place on 8 January 1922, and the territory was annexed by Poland. Several years later, the Polish leader Józef Piłsudski confirmed that he personally ordered Żeligowski to stage a mutiny.

The Polish–Lithuanian border in the interwar period, was recognized by the Conference of Ambassadors of the Entente and the League of Nations. It was not recognized by Kaunas-based Republic of Lithuania until the Polish ultimatum of 1938 in March, when Lithuania acknowledged the status quo of so-called demarcation line, but the newest edition of the Constitution of Lithuania in May 1938 one more time named Vilnius the capital of Lithuania. In 1931, an international court in The Hague stated that the Polish seizure of the region had been a violation of international law, but there were no political repercussions.

==History==

Following the partitions of Poland, most of the lands that formerly constituted the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire. The Imperial government increasingly pursued a policy of Russification of the newly acquired lands, which escalated after the failed January Uprising of 1864. The discrimination against local inhabitants included restrictions and outright bans on the usage of the Polish, Lithuanian (see Lithuanian press ban), Belarusian, and Ukrainian (see Valuyev circular) languages. These measures, however, had limited effects on the Polonisation effort undertaken by the Polish patriotic leadership of the Vilnius educational district. A similar effort was pursued during the 19th century Lithuanian National Revival, which sought to distance itself from both Polish and Russian influences.
The ethnic composition of the area has long been disputed, since censuses from that time and place are often considered unreliable. According to the first census of the Russian Empire in 1897, known to have been intentionally falsified, the population of the Vilna Governorate was distributed as follows: Belarusians at 56.1% (including Roman Catholics), Lithuanians at 17.6%, Jews at 12.7%, Poles at 8.2%, Russians at 4.9%, Germans at 0.2%, Ukrainians at 0.1%, Tatars at 0.1%, and &#x27;Others&#x27; at 0.1% as well.

The German censuses of 1915, 1916 and 1917 of the Vilnius Region (published in 1919) however, reported strikingly different numbers. In 1917 in the Vilnius city Poles were at 53.65%, Jews at 41.45%, Lithuanians at 2.1%, Belarusians at 0.44%, Russians at 1.59%, Germans at 0,63% and &#x27;Other&#x27; at 0.14%. According to the 1916 census, Poles constituted 89.8% of the inhabitants of Vilnius county (excluding the city) and Lithuanians only 4.3%.

Censuses had encountered difficulties in the attempt to categorise their subjects. Ethnographers in the 1890s were often confronted with those who described themselves as both Lithuanians and Poles. According to a German census analyst, &quot;Objectively determining conditions of nationality comes up against the greatest difficulties.&quot;

===Aftermath of World War I===
In the aftermath of the First World War, both Poland and Lithuania regained independence. The conflict between them soon arose as both Lithuania and Poland claimed Vilnius (known in Polish as Wilno) region.

Demographically, the main groups inhabiting Vilnius were Poles and Jews, with Lithuanians constituting a small fraction of the total population (2.0%–2.6%, according to the Russian census of 1897 and the German census of 1916). The Lithuanians nonetheless believed that their historical claim to Vilnius (former capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) had precedence and refused to recognize any Polish claims to the city and the surrounding area.

While Poland under Józef Piłsudski attempted to create a Polish-led federation in the area that would include a number of ethnically non-Polish territories (Międzymorze), Lithuania strove to create a fully independent state that would include the Vilnius region. Two early 20th-century censuses indicated that Lithuanian speakers, whose language in the second half of the 19th century was suppressed by the Russian policies and had unfavourable conditions within the Catholic church, became a minority in the region. Based on this, Lithuanian authorities argued that the majority of inhabitants living there, even if they at the time did not speak Lithuanian, were thus Polonized (or Russified) Lithuanians.

Further complicating the situation, there were two Polish factions with quite different views on creation of the modern state in Poland. One party, led by Roman Dmowski, saw modern Poland as an ethnic state, another, led by Józef Piłsudski, wished to rebuild the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Both parties were determined to take the Poles of Vilnius into the new state. Piłsudski attempted to rebuild the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in a canton structure, as part of the Międzymorze federation:
*Lithuania of Kaunas with Lithuanian language
*Lithuania of Vilnius or Central Lithuania with Polish language
*Lithuania of Minsk with Belarusian language

Eventually, Piłsudski&#x27;s plan failed; it was opposed both by the Lithuanian government and by the Dmowski&#x27;s faction in Poland. Stanisław Grabski, representative of Dmowski&#x27;s faction, was in charge of the Treaty of Riga negotiations with the Soviet Union, in which they rejected the Soviet offer of territories needed for the Minsk canton (Dmowski preferred Poland that would be smaller, but with higher percentage of ethnic Poles). The inclusion of territories predominant with non-Poles would have weakened support for Dmowski.

===Polish–Lithuanian War===
At the end of World War I, the area of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided between the Second Polish Republic, the short-lived unrecognized Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic, and the Republic of Lithuania. Following the start of the Polish–Soviet War, during the next two years, the control of Vilnius and its environs changed frequently. In 1919 the territory was briefly occupied by the Red Army, which defeated the local self-defense units, but shortly afterwards the Soviets were pushed back by the Polish Army. 1920 saw the Vilnius region occupied by the Red Army for the second time. However, when the Red Army was defeated in the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets, knowing that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to hold Vilnius, decided to hand it over to Lithuania. By making such a move, the Soviets hoped to intensify the Polish-Lithuanian dispute over the region.

The regular Polish–Lithuanian War broke out on 26 August 1920, when the Polish Army clashed with Lithuanian troops occupying Suwałki region during the Polish autumn offensive following the Battle of Warsaw. The League of Nations intervened and arranged negotiations in Suwałki. The League negotiated a cease-fire, signed on 7 October 7, placing the city of Vilnius in Lithuania. The Suwałki Agreement was to have taken effect at 12:00 on 10 October.
The Lithuanian authorities entered Vilnius in late August 1920. The Grinius cabinet rejected the proposal to hold a plebiscite to confirm the will of the region&#x27;s inhabitants, knowing that a plebiscite would inevitably legitimize Polish claims to the region. His declaration was promptly accepted by the Seimas, for the percentage of Lithuanian population in Vilnius was very small. On 8 October, General Lucjan Żeligowski and the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division numbering around 14,000 men, with local self-defense, launched the Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny and engaged the Lithuanian 4th Infantry Regiment which promptly retreated. Upon the Polish advance, on October 8, the Lithuanian government left the city for Kaunas, and during withdrawal, meticulously destroyed telephone lines and rail between the two cities, which remained severed for a generation. Żeligowski entered Vilnius on 9 October, to enthusiastic cheers of the overwhelmingly Polish population of the city. The French and the British delegation decided to leave the matter in the hands of the League of Nations. On October 27, while the Żeligowski&#x27;s campaign still continued outside Vilnius, the League called for a popular referendum in the disputed area, which was again rejected by the Lithuanian representation. Poland disclaimed all responsibility for the action, maintaining that Żeligowski had acted entirely on his own initiative. This version of the event was redefined in August 1923 when Piłsudski, speaking in public at a Vilnius theater, stated that the attack was undertaken by his direct order. Żeligowski, a native to Lithuania, proclaimed a new state, the Republic of Central Lithuania (&quot;Litwa Środkowa&quot;). According to historian Jerzy J. Lerski, it was a &quot;puppet state&quot; which the Lithuanian Republic refused to recognize.

The seat of Lithuanian government moved to Lithuania&#x27;s second-largest city, Kaunas. Armed clashes between Kaunas and Central Lithuania continued for a few weeks, but neither side could gain a significant advantage. Due to the mediation efforts of the League of Nations, a new ceasefire was signed on November 21 and a truce six days later.

===Founding of the Republic of Central Lithuania===
On 12 October 1920, Żeligowski announced the creation of a provisional government. Soon the courts and the police were formed by his decree of 7 January 1921, and the civil rights of Central Lithuania were granted to all people who lived in the area on January 1, 1919, or for five years prior to August 1, 1914. The symbols of the state were a red flag with Polish White Eagle and Lithuanian Vytis. Its coat of arms was a mixture of Polish, Lithuanian and Vilnian symbols and resembled the Coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Extensive diplomatic negotiations continued behind the scenes. Lithuania proposed creating a confederation of Baltic Western Lithuania (with Lithuanian as an official language) and Central Lithuania (with Polish as an official language). Poland added the condition that the new state must be also federated with Poland, pursuing Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s goal of creating the Międzymorze Federation. Lithuanians rejected this condition. With nationalistic sentiments rising all over Europe, many Lithuanians were afraid that such a federation, resembling the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from centuries ago, would be a threat to Lithuanian culture, as during the Commonwealth times many of the Lithuanian nobility was Polonized.

General elections in Central Lithuania were decreed to take place on 9 January, and the regulations governing this election were to be issued prior to 28 November 1920. However, due to the League of Nations mediation, and the Lithuanian boycott of the voting, the elections were postponed.

===Mediation===
Peace talks were held under the auspice of the League of Nations. The initial agreement was signed by both sides on 29 November 1920, and the talks started on 3 March 1921. The League of Nations considered the Polish proposal of a plebiscite on the future of Central Lithuania. As a compromise, the so-called &quot;Hymans&#x27; plan&quot; was proposed (named after Paul Hymans). The plan consisted of 15 points, among them were:
*Both sides guarantee each other&#x27;s independence.
*Central Lithuania is incorporated into the Federation of Lithuania, composed of two cantons: Lithuanian-inhabited Samogitia and multi-ethnic (Belarusian, Tatar, Polish, Jewish and Lithuanian) Vilnius area. Both cantons will have separate governments, parliaments, official languages and a common federative capital in Vilnius.
*Lithuanian and Polish governments will create interstate commissions on both foreign affairs, trade and industry measures and local policies.
*Poland and Lithuania will sign a defensive alliance treaty.
*Poland will gain usage of ports in Lithuania.
The talks came to a halt when Poland demanded that a delegation from Central Lithuania (boycotted by Lithuania) be invited to Brussels. Hymans&#x27; proposal left Vilnius in Polish hands, which was unacceptable to Lithuania.

A new plan was presented to the governments of Lithuania and Poland in September 1921. It was basically a modification of &quot;Hymans&#x27; plan&quot;, with the difference that the Klaipėda Region (the area in East Prussia north of the Neman River) was to be incorporated into Lithuania. However, both Poland and Lithuania openly criticized this revised plan and finally this turn of talks came to a halt as well.

===Resolution===

After the talks in Brussels failed, the tensions in the area grew. The most important issue was the huge army Central Lithuania fielded (27,000). General Lucjan Żeligowski decided to pass the power to the civil authorities and confirmed the date of the elections (8 January 1922). There was a significant electioneering propaganda campaign as Poles tried to win the support of other ethnic groups present in the area. The Polish government was also accused of various strong-arm policies (like the closing of Lithuanian newspapers or election violations like not asking for a valid document from a voter). The elections were boycotted by Lithuanians, most of the Jews and some Belarusians. Poles were the only major ethnic group out of which the majority of people voted.

The elections were not recognized by Lithuania. Polish factions, which gained control over the parliament (Sejm) of the Republic (the Sejm of Central Lithuania), on February 20 passed the request of incorporation into Poland. The request was accepted by the Polish Sejm on 22 March 1922.

All of the Republic&#x27;s territory was eventually incorporated into the newly formed Wilno Voivodeship. Lithuania declined to accept the Polish authority over the area. Instead, it continued to treat the so-called Vilnius Region as part of its own territory and the city itself as its constitutional capital, with Kaunas being only a temporary seat of government. The dispute over the Vilnius region resulted in much tensions in the Polish–Lithuanian relations in the interwar period.

==Aftermath==
Alfred Erich Senn noted that if Poland had not prevailed in the Polish–Soviet War, Lithuania would have been invaded by the Soviets, and would never have experienced two decades of independence. Despite the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920, Lithuania was very close to being invaded by the Soviets in summer 1920 and being forcibly incorporated into that state, and only the Polish victory derailed this plan.

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Vilnius and its surroundings of up to 30 kilometres were given to Lithuania in accordance with the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of 10 October 1939, and Vilnius again became the capital of Lithuania. However, in 1940, Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union, forcing the country to become the Lithuanian SSR. Since the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1991, the city&#x27;s status as Lithuania&#x27;s capital has been internationally recognized.

<text>Denise Madeleine Bloch (; 21 January 1916 – 5 February 1945) was a French citizen who worked as an agent with the clandestine British Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization in the Second World War. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially those occupied by Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

Bloch and her family, Jews, evaded capture by the Germans in Paris after its occupation by Nazi Germany in summer 1940. In 1942 the family escaped to Lyon. Bloch became involved in the French Resistance and narrowly avoided arrest in Lyon. Fleeing to southwestern France, she worked for SOE agent George Reginald Starr as his courier. In May 1942, she made a dangerous crossing of the Pyrenees into Spain and hence to SOE headquarters in London to present Starr&#x27;s request for more aid to his resistance forces. Although known to the Germans and with a price on her head, Bloch was trained as a radio operator by SOE and sent back to France in 1944 to help carry out sabotage missions against the Germans. She was captured and sent to prison camps in Germany and executed in late January or early February 1945 at Ravensbrück concentration camp.

== Early life ==
Bloch was born to a Jewish family (Jacques Henri Bloch and Suzanne Levi-Strauss) in Paris, France in 1916. She had three brothers. Her father and two of her brothers were French soldiers taken prisoner by the German army in 1940. The Germans occupied northern France in summer 1940 and anti-Jewish campaigns began. Her mother, her brother Jean-Claude, and Denise then lived a clandestine life avoiding persecution as Jews by using false papers and identities. In the summer of 1942, the family was smuggled across the border from occupied to unoccupied Vichy France arriving in Lyon on 17 July.

== Working for the Resistance and SOE==
In Lyon Bloch became a secretary for Jean-Maxime Aron, a Jewish engineer for Citroen who was working with the French Resistance and the SOE network led by Philippe de Vomécourt. Bloch began working for Aron as a courier, delivering messages to agents around the region. Through her work with Aron, Bloch met several Jews working in the French Resistance and SOE agents sent from London to help the Resistance. As a cover she fabricated an engagement to Dominique Mendelsohn, also involved in the resistance. She helped SOE radio operator Brian Stonehouse and courier Blanche Charlet. She witnessed Stonehouse being escorted by police officers after his arrest on 14 October 1942. (Stonehouse survived the war in German prison camps; Charlet escaped prison and survived.) Mendelsohn was also soon arrested. Realizing she was in danger, on 26 October SOE agent Paul Sarrette decided that he would accompany her from Lyon to a safe house in Marseilles. Bloch sent a telegram to her mother in Lyon with her travel plans. The Germans intercepted the telegram. As a result, Aron, who accompanied Bloch to the railroad station, was arrested. Bloch and Sarrette evaded arrest.

After Aron&#x27;s arrest, Bloch went into hiding in Lyon and later Villefranche-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. She dyed her black hair blond as a disguise, but her height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) made her conspicuous. In January 1943, Sarrette accompanied Bloch to Toulouse which was the territory of SOE agents George Reginald Starr and Henri Sevenet. Starr and Sevenet initially regarded Bloch as a nuisance and Starr proposed &quot;to liquidate her.&quot; However, they decided instead to evacuate her over the Pyrenees to Spain. The mid-winter crossing on foot was thwarted by heavy snow. Bloch returned to Toulouse where she first met Starr in person. He was impressed and invited her to become his courier and stay with him at his base in a house in the isolated village of Castelnau-sur-l&#x27;Auvignon. The two became inseparable and possibly lovers. Starr had no radio operator at the time and Bloch weekly made the long journey to Toulouse to communicate with SOE headquarters in London with SOE agent Marcus Bloom&#x27;s radio. However, in April 1943, Bloom was arrested by the Germans. Without a means of communicating with London and in desperate need of supplies for his resistance groups, Starr sent Bloch to London with a written report of his activities and as an advocate for him. She walked across the Pyrenees mountains with Maurice Dupont as a guide, but the Spanish briefly arrested her and confiscated Starr&#x27;s report. Bloch made her way to the British territory of Gibraltar and was flown to England, arriving there on 21 May.

Illustrating that the Germans knew of Bloch, on 29 June 1943 she was convicted in absentia and sentenced to ten years hard labor.

In London, Bloch was debriefed by SOE and expressed the desire to return to France. SOE initially opposed her return as she was known to the Germans and SOE&#x27;s French section deputy Nicolas Bodington complained that she was a security risk and should be removed from SOE. Bloch, in return, was contemptuous of the SOE. Eventually, SOE decided to train her as a radio operator and send her back to a different area of France where she was not known.

==Return to France==
On 2 March 1944, with fellow SOE agent and former racing car driver, Robert Benoist, Bloch landed at clandestine landing site in central France. Working in the Nantes area for the Clergyman circuit, the pair re-established contact with SOE agent and Benoist&#x27;s fellow racing car driver, Jean-Pierre Wimille. Their objectives were to destroy pylons on the power line at Ile Heron in Nantes and to interrupt railroad transportation in support of the allied invasion of France which took place on 6 June. On 17 June, their preparations apparently in place, Benoist called a meeting of the key members of the network at his villa near Sermaise, a violation of SOE&#x27;s guidance that members of a network should have as little contact with each other as possible. During dinner, he announced that he had received news that his mother was dying and he was leaving to visit her. He warned that if he didn&#x27;t return by lunch the next day, 18 June, the members of the network should disperse. Benoist was arrested by the Germans outside his mother&#x27;s apartment in Paris. His warning to his associates to disperse was not heeded and at about 8 p.m. on 18 June the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) raided the villa and captured Bloch and the others.

==Imprisonment and execution==

Bloch was interrogated at SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and imprisoned at Fresnes Prison. On 8 August 1944, with the allies advancing on Paris, Bloch and other captured SOE agents was sent by train to Germany. In late August she reached Ravensbrück concentration camp for women. Along with SOE agents Violette Szabo and 
Lilian Rolfe she volunteered for a work party at Torgau in Saxony, where conditions were better than at Ravensbrūck. They attempted, but failed to escape. Sent back to Ravensbrück, they were beaten and put in an underground bunker. On 19 October, they were sent to Königsberg in Brandenburg where they were forced to do heavy labor in winter conditions. Recalled to Ravensbrück in late January 1945, they were in pitiful condition. Rolfe was no longer able to walk and Bloch was &quot;suffering from gangrene.&quot; 
A few days later they were taken to the courtyard by the crematorium. Camp commandant Fritz Suhren read the order for their execution and they were each shot in the back of the head with a small caliber pistol. Their bodies were cremated. An eyewitness said the women were &quot;very brave&quot; and that Commandant Suhren was annoyed that the Gestapo &quot;did not themselves carry out the execution.&quot;

Bloch&#x27;s family gravesite at the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris memorialises her life and execution.

<text>The Happiest Millionaire is a 1967 American musical film starring Fred MacMurray, based upon the true story of Philadelphia millionaire Anthony Drexel Biddle. The film, featuring music by the Sherman Brothers, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design by Bill Thomas. The screenplay by A. J. Carothers was adapted from the play, based on the book &quot;My Philadelphia Father&quot; by Cordelia Drexel Biddle. Walt Disney acquired the rights to the play in the early 1960s. The film was the last live-action musical film to be produced by Disney before his death on December 15, 1966.

==Plot==
In autumn of 1916, Irish immigrant John Lawless (Tommy Steele) has applied for a butler position with eccentric Philadelphia millionaire Anthony J. Drexel Biddle (Fred MacMurray). Even though the family is a bit strange, Lawless soon learns that he fits right in. Mr. Biddle takes a liking to him immediately.

Mr. Biddle busies himself with his Biddle Boxing and Bible School (located in his stable) and with his alligators in the conservatory. He is also anxious to get America into the war in Europe, despite the government&#x27;s policy of neutrality. His wife, Cordelia (Greer Garson), stands quietly by, accepting his eccentricities with a sense of pride and class. Their two sons, Tony and Livingston (Paul Petersen and Eddie Hodges) are headed off to boarding school, not to be seen again. Their daughter, Cordy (Lesley Ann Warren), is a tomboy with a mean right hook who was educated by private tutors and has had limited contact with conventional society. She is frustrated by her apparent inability to attract suitors and wants to see what is beyond the Biddle manor.

Mr. Biddle reluctantly lets Cordy go to a boarding school as well after some prodding from both Cordy and from his Aunt Mary (Gladys Cooper). Cordy&#x27;s roommate teaches her how to lure men with feminine wiles, and at a social dance hosted by her aunt and uncle, Cordy meets Angier Buchanan Duke (John Davidson) and they fall in love. He tells Cordy that he is fascinated with the invention of the automobile and wants to head to Detroit, Michigan, to make his fortune there, instead of taking over his family&#x27;s tobacco business.

That winter, Cordy comes back to her parents&#x27; home and tells them that she is engaged. At first, this is a difficult thing for Mr. Biddle to take. He does not want to give up his little girl, but after meeting Angier and witnessing first-hand his Jiu Jitsu fighting skills, Mr. Biddle takes a liking to him and accepts the engagement. Then Cordy travels with Angier to New York City to meet his mother (Geraldine Page). Soon the Biddles and the Dukes are making arrangements for a very grand wedding.

It is by now the spring of 1917, and constant condescending comments from Angier&#x27;s mother anger Cordy. To make matters worse, their families&#x27; elaborate planning for the &quot;social event of the season&quot;, makes both Cordy and Angier feel pushed aside. The tension reaches a climax when Cordy learns that Angier has abandoned his plans for Detroit, and is instead taking his place in the family business, following his mother&#x27;s wishes. Cordy angrily calls the wedding off, thinking of Angier as a mama&#x27;s boy, and Angier storms out of the house. Both families are instantly in a tremendous state of upheaval. Mr. Biddle sends John Lawless to look after Angier.

John finds Angier at the local tavern, contemplating what he will do next, and tries to convince Angier to go back to Cordy. However, Angier is stubborn and thinks of other ways to deal with his problems, among other things saying that he wants to join the Foreign Legion. Angier unwittingly starts a bar fight (with a little help from John) and is hauled off to jail.

The next morning, Mr. Biddle comes to bail Angier out. He tells Angier he has to forget about his own dreams and accept his place in the family business. His words have the desired effect, inspiring Angier to defy his mother and elope with Cordy and go to Detroit. Cordy, however, believes her father talked Angier into it, so to prove his sincerity, amid the cheering of the cellmates, Angier throws Cordy over his shoulder and carries her out of the jail house to start their new life together.

===Longer version===
After Mr. and Mrs. Biddle return home a delegation of Marines arrive to inform him he has been made a &quot;provisional captain&quot; in the Marine Corps and is wanted immediately to go to Parris Island to continue training the recruits, now that America is finally entering the War. Mr. Biddle accepts with delight, and the hearty congratulations of his suddenly appearing Bible Boxing Class.

A car with two people (presumably Cordie and Angie) drives toward a city skyline (presumably Detroit) dominated by factories with smoke clouding the sky at sunset.

==Production==
===Origins===

The film had its origins in the 1955 book &quot;My Philadelphia Father&quot; by Cordelia Biddle, as told to Kyle Crichton. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said the story was told with &quot;charm&quot;. There was early interest in the book for stage adaptation. Crichton adapted the story into a play called &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, which opened on Broadway on November 20, 1956, at the Lyceum Theatre. Walter Pidgeon portrayed Anthony J. Drexel Biddle and George Grizzard played Angie. It was Pidgeon&#x27;s first appearance on Broadway in 21 years, and MGM obtained film rights in exchange for permitting him to appear in the play. Howard Erskine and Joseph Hayes produced the play, and Guthrie McClintic was to direct, but he left the production before opening night. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called the production &quot;decent and amusing&quot; and Pidgeon &quot;wonderful&quot;. The production ran for 271 performances, closing on July 13, 1957.

===Development===
In the early 1960s, Walt Disney acquired the rights to the play, but he had no intent of making it into a musical at first. After the box-office success of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, the first of which he had produced, the film&#x27;s original producer Bill Walsh decided to make the film into a musical, but Disney reassigned him to &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, replacing him with Bill Anderson.

The Sherman Brothers, who wrote the film&#x27;s music, wanted Rex Harrison for the lead role, but Disney insisted on Fred MacMurray. Regardless, Harrison would not have been available, as he was shooting &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; for 20th Century Fox.

In January 1966, a key role went to Tommy Steele, who had achieved success on Broadway in &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot;. Lesley Ann Warren, whom Disney had seen in the 1965 CBS television production of &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s Cinderella&quot;, made her screen debut in the film. She also met future husband Jon Peters during the film&#x27;s production. The role of MacMurray&#x27;s wife went to Greer Garson, who called the film &quot;... a delightful &quot;Life with Father&quot; type picture. I don&#x27;t have much to do but I love working with Fred MacMurray.&quot;

The song &quot;Detroit&quot; contains the lyric &quot;F.O.B. Detroit&quot;. According to the Shermans, Disney overheard them singing the song and misheard the phrase as &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, then scolded them for using such language in a Disney film. The Shermans corrected Disney and the three laughed about it.

The original cast soundtrack was released on Buena Vista Records in stereo (STER-5001) and mono (BV-5001) versions. A second cast recording with studio singers and orchestrations by Tutti Camarata appeared on Disneyland Records in stereo (STER-1303) and mono (DQ-1303).

The cast soundtrack was re-released on CD in 2002 (60781-7), remastered from the original eight-track master tapes to reduce the heavy reverb from the original LP. The soundtrack is currently available on iTunes.

&quot;Are We Dancing?&quot; was included on the 1992 CD compilation The Sherman Brothers. The song along with &quot;Fortuosity&quot; was included on the 2009 Sherman Brothers Songbook compilation set.

The Supremes covered &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long &#x27;Til Christmas&quot; for their planned album of Disney covers, but the tracks from that session were not released until the 1980s.

==Release==
When Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, the film&#x27;s first cut had already been completed. Disney told Anderson to use his own judgement, but added, &quot;Don&#x27;t let the distribution people rush you...&quot; Anderson wanted to shorten the film, as he disliked the musical number &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long &#x27;Til Christmas&quot; as performed by Greer Garson. Disney COO Card Walker wanted to excise even more material, and the two men fought bitterly over the extent of the cuts. The film opened at 164 minutes on a &quot;reserved seating&quot; basis.

Robert Sherman was in England during the film&#x27;s Hollywood premiere at the Pantages Theatre, but he became furious when he discovered in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that a theater in the vicinity was showing a double feature of &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; and &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; at a much lower price. In order to satisfy requests from Radio City Music Hall, the site of the film&#x27;s New York premiere, the studio cut 20 minutes from the film after the premiere. For the general release, the film was shortened even further to 118 minutes. It was not reissued and did not appear on television until 1984, when the 164-minute version was screened at the Los Angeles International Film Expo and aired on The Disney Channel.

===Home media===
&quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; was initially released through VHS on April 7, 1984. Disney later re-released the film through VHS on May 28, 1986, as part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland Campaign&quot;. Both releases are of the 144-minute version.

Anchor Bay Entertainment released separate DVDs of both the long and short versions on July 20, 1999. The long version, presented on home video for the first time, was in 1.66:1 non-anamorphic widescreen, but the short version was 1.33:1.

Disney re-released the film on DVD on June 1, 2004, featuring only the long version and including the intermission music at the end of Act I and the exit music at the end of Act II, elements that had been missing from the Anchor Bay release.

The film became available on the Disney+ streaming service on June 11, 2021.

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther panned the film: &quot;...the whole picture is vulgar. It is an over-decorated, over-fluffed, over-sentimentalized endeavor to pretend the lace-curtain millionaires are—or were—every bit as folksy as the old prize-fighters and the Irish brawlers in the saloon&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that &quot;... adults will find the plot thin and the characters one-dimensional. Lots of kids will find little to hold their interest except the alligators. The children will wonder how John Davidson could have possibly been cast in such an innocent and naive role when he looks at least 25 years old. I mean, that&#x27;s a little late to steal your first kiss. As for the musical numbers, I found them eminently forgettable, with the sole exception of a nicely staged Irish reel&quot;.

Reviewing the film for &quot;Life&quot;, Richard Schickel remarked: &quot;What is missing, quite literally, is magic. The movie&#x27;s length, period, cost, even its eccentric central figure indicate Disney was trying for another &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. It desperately needs her magic umbrella to lift MacMurray and the whole project off the ground. But the people who created the highest moments in &quot;Poppins&quot; with the dance across the rooftops are absent&quot;.

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that the film was &quot;a disappointment&quot; and compared it unfavorably to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;: &quot;There is no such unity of interest and identification in &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;. If there is not really anybody to root against (except maybe Geraldine Page as the tart-tongued Mrs. Duke), there are too many people to root for, and each of them is pursuing his own story-line&quot;.

<doc id="358364" wikidata="Q89753" url="?curid=358364" title="Dungeon">
<text>A dungeon is a room or cell in which prisoners are held, especially underground. Dungeons are generally associated with medieval castles, though their association with torture probably derives more from the Renaissance period. An oubliette (from the French , meaning &#x27;to forget&#x27;) or bottle dungeon is a basement room which is accessible only from a hatch or hole (an &quot;angstloch&quot;) in a high ceiling.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dungeon&quot; comes from French &quot;donjon&quot; (also spelled &quot;dongeon&quot;), which means &quot;keep&quot;, the main tower of a castle. The first recorded instance of the word in English was near the beginning of the 14th century when it held the same meaning as &quot;donjon&quot;. The earlier meaning of &quot;keep&quot; is still in use for academics, although in popular culture, it has come to mean a cell or &quot;oubliette&quot;. Though it is uncertain, both &quot;dungeon&quot; and &quot;donjon&quot; are thought to derive from the Middle Latin word &quot;dominus&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;.

In French, the term &quot;donjon&quot; still refers to a &quot;keep&quot;, and the English term &quot;dungeon&quot; refers mostly to &quot;oubliette&quot; in French. &quot;Donjon&quot; is therefore a false friend to &quot;dungeon&quot; (although the game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is titled &quot;Donjons et Dragons&quot; in its French editions).

An oubliette (same origin as the French &quot;oublier&quot;, meaning &quot;to forget&quot;) is a basement room which is accessible only from a hatch or hole (an &quot;angstloch&quot;) in a high ceiling.

The use of &quot;donjons&quot; evolved over time, sometimes to include prison cells, which could explain why the meaning of &quot;dungeon&quot; in English evolved over time from being a prison within the tallest, most secure tower of the castle into meaning a cell, and by extension, in popular use, an oubliette or even a torture chamber.

The earliest use of &quot;oubliette&quot; in French dates back to 1374, but its earliest adoption in English is Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in 1819: &quot;The place was utterly dark—the oubliette, as I suppose, of their accursed convent.&quot;

==History==
Few Norman keeps in English castles originally contained prisons, which were more common in Scotland. Imprisonment was not a usual punishment in the Middle Ages, with most prisoners awaiting an imminent trial, sentence or a political solution. Noble prisoners were not generally held in dungeons, but lived in some comfort in castle apartments. The Tower of London is famous for housing political prisoners, and Pontefract Castle at various times held Thomas of Lancaster (1322), Richard II (1400), Earl Rivers (1483), Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York (1405), James I of Scotland (1405–1424) and Charles, Duke of Orléans (1417–1430). Purpose-built prison chambers in castles became more common after the 12th century, when they were built into gatehouses or mural towers. Some castles had larger provision for prisoners, such as the prison tower at Caernarfon Castle.

==Features==

Although many real dungeons are simply a single plain room with a heavy door or with access only from a hatchway or trapdoor in the floor of the room above, the use of dungeons for torture, along with their association to common human fears of being trapped underground, have made dungeons a powerful metaphor in a variety of contexts. Dungeons, as a whole, have become associated with underground complexes of cells and torture chambers. As a result, the number of true dungeons in castles is often exaggerated to interest tourists. Many chambers described as dungeons or oubliettes were in fact water-cisterns or even latrines.

An example of what might be popularly termed an &quot;oubliette&quot; is the particularly claustrophobic cell in the dungeon of Warwick Castle&#x27;s Caesar&#x27;s Tower, in central England. The access hatch consists of an iron grille. Even turning around (or moving at all) would be nearly impossible in this tiny chamber.

However, the tiny chamber that is described as the oubliette, is in reality a short shaft which opens up into a larger chamber with a latrine shaft entering it from above. This suggests that the chamber is in fact a partially back-filled drain. The positioning of the supposed oubliette within the larger dungeon, situated in a small alcove, is typical of garderobe arrangement within medieval buildings. These factors perhaps point to this feature being the remnants of a latrine rather than a cell for holding prisoners. Footage of the inside of this chamber can be seen in episode 3 of the first series of &quot;Secrets of Great British Castles&quot;. 
A &quot;bottle dungeon&quot; is sometimes simply another term for an oubliette. It has a narrow entrance at the top and sometimes the room below is even so narrow that it would be impossible to lie down but in other designs the actual cell is larger.

The identification of dungeons and rooms used to hold prisoners is not always a straightforward task. Alnwick Castle and Cockermouth Castle, both near England&#x27;s border with Scotland, had chambers in their gatehouses which have often been interpreted as oubliettes. However, this has been challenged. These underground rooms (accessed by a door in the ceiling) were built without latrines, and since the gatehouses at Alnwick and Cockermouth provided accommodation it is unlikely that the rooms would have been used to hold prisoners. An alternative explanation was proposed, suggesting that these were strong-rooms where valuables were stored. Folklore often has it that one mode of use for oubliettes in the Borders, which would latrines anyway, was to throw attackers into the oubliette, close the latch, and leave them to die. It seems likely that this gruesome act was threatened more often than it was carried out in practice, with the real aim being deterrence of potential attackers via the notoriety of the rumor that such a fate was entirely possible, and (plausibly) perhaps not unlikely, for anyone who might dare to attack.

==In fiction==
Oubliettes and dungeons were a favorite topic of nineteenth century gothic novels or historical novels, where they appeared as symbols of hidden cruelty and tyrannical power. Usually found under medieval castles or abbeys, they were used by villainous characters to persecute blameless characters. In Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;, Catherine de Medici is portrayed gloating over a victim in the oubliettes of the Louvre.
Dungeons are common elements in modern fantasy literature, related tabletop, and video games. The most famous examples are the various &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; media. In this context, the word &quot;dungeon&quot; has come to be used broadly to describe any labyrinthine complex (castle, cave system, etc) rather than a prison cell or torture chamber specifically. A role-playing game largely consisting of dungeon exploration is called a dungeon crawl.

Near the beginning of Jack Vance&#x27;s high-fantasy &quot;Lyonesse Trilogy&quot; (1983–1989), King Casmir of Lyonesse commits Prince Aillas of Troicinet, who he believes to be a vagabond, to an oubliette for the crime of having seduced his daughter. After some months, the resourceful prince fashions a ladder from the bones of earlier prisoners and the rope by which he had been lowered, and escapes.

In the musical fantasy film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, director Jim Henson includes a scene in which the heroine Sarah is freed from an oubliette by the dwarf Hoggle, who defines it for her as &quot;a place you put people... to forget about &#x27;em!&quot;

In the Thomas Harris novel &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Clarice makes a descent into Gumb&#x27;s basement dungeon labyrinth in the narrative&#x27;s climactic scene, where the killer is described as having an oubliette.

In the Robert A. Heinlein novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, the term &quot;oubliette&quot; is used to refer to a trash disposal much like the &quot;memory holes&quot; in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

<doc id="358365" wikidata="Q71018" url="?curid=358365" title="Lothar Bisky">
<text>Lothar Bisky (17 August 1941 13 August 2013) was a German politician. He was the chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor of East Germany&#x27;s Socialist Unity Party (SED). In June 2007 he became co-chairman of The Left (&quot;Die Linke&quot;) party, formed by a merger of the PDS and the much smaller Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative. From 2007 until 2010 he was the President of the Party of the European Left. Also, he was the Publisher of the socialist newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;.

==Background==
Bisky was born in Zollbrück, Pomerania, Germany (now Korzybie, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland), from where he came after 1945 as refugee to Schleswig-Holstein in northern West Germany. In order to get a free university education he emigrated to Communist GDR at the age of 18, and after facing initial doubts due to his heritage was allowed to join the Socialist Unity Party in 1963, but did not rise to leadership positions until shortly after the fall of communism and the resulting purge of hardliners from the party. He was rector of the University of Film and Television (Potsdam-Babelsberg) from 1986 to 1990. In 1991 he became a member of the board of directors of regional television channel ORB (now part of RBB).

==Stasi informer==
In 1995, it was discovered that Bisky had been an informer for the Stasi. The Stasi records on his wife referred to his activities as an informant. Subsequent investigations revealed that Bisky was registered by the Stasi with the code names of &quot;Bienert&quot; between 1966 and 1970, and as &quot;Klaus Heine&quot; from 1987. Lothar Bisky was also described in Stasi records as (reliable), the highest level of trust for an informer.

When Bisky was promoted, the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance () of the Stasi issued a statement where Bisky was described as &quot;a reliable comrade, who strictly follows orders and always is honest with the Ministry for State Security (Stasi)&quot; ().

==Political career==
In 1990 he was a member of the Volkskammer and beginning in 1990 he was a member of the state parliament in Brandenburg.

He was chairman of the PDS from 1993 until his resignation in 2000 over a defeat for the executive committee on support for United Nations military intervention. He was re-elected chairman in 2003 after this &quot;left turn&quot; had cost the party its seats in the Bundestag in 2002. Bisky was seen to be on the moderate, social democratic wing of the party and was a long-time close ally of the party&#x27;s most prominent figure, Gregor Gysi. He was often regarded for his abilities to lead meaningful discussions between parties of completely opposite viewpoints, be it within his own party or in media events with other groups.

The party returned strongly to the Bundestag in the 2005 election. Bisky, one of 54 Left MPs, was nominated by his party to become one of the six vice presidents of the Bundestag. When the new Bundestag was constituted on 18 October, however, he failed three times to be elected. Several MPs explained this with the fact that he was an informant of the Stasi. Later, he failed a fourth time, and subsequently gave up his bid for the vice president position which was given to Petra Pau instead.

==Personal life==
Lothar Bisky was married and the father of three sons. His oldest son, Jens Bisky, is a journalist and writer and the second-oldest, Norbert Bisky, is a painter. His youngest son, Stephan Bisky, died in late 2008 while working towards his neuro-informatics doctorate at the University of Edinburgh.

He died in a hospital in Leipzig as a result of falling down the stairs in his apartment in August 2013.

<doc id="358367" wikidata="Q1332299" url="?curid=358367" title="Pete's Dragon (1977 film)">
<text>Pete&#x27;s Dragon is a 1977 American live-action/animated musical fantasy film directed by Don Chaffey, produced by Jerome Courtland and Ron Miller, and written by Malcolm Marmorstein. Based on the unpublished short story &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon and the USA (Forever After)&quot; by Seton I. Miller and S. S. Field, it stars Helen Reddy, Jim Dale, Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons,and Shelley Winters.

The project was initially conceived in 1957 as a two-part episode of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television series, but it was shelved until it was revived as a musical film in 1975. The film was released on November 3, 1977, to mixed reviews from critics, though some praised the animation.

The film received two nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, for musical scoring and original song. Capitol Records released a single of Reddy performing &quot;Candle on the Water&quot; (with a different arrangement from that in the film) that reached #27 on the Adult Contemporary charts.

The film spawned a live-action remake made by Walt Disney Pictures and released in 2016.

== Plot ==
In Maine in the early 1900s, an orphan named Pete flees from the Gogans – a horrible and abusive farm family that had previously purchased him – with the assistance of an unseen force he calls Elliott. They call for him to return and promise they will treat him better, while also intending to punish him severely. After they abandon their search, he falls asleep. The next morning, he awakens and Elliott is revealed to be a green dragon that can turn invisible.

Pete and Elliott visit Passamaquoddy, where the invisible Elliott&#x27;s clumsiness causes Pete to be labeled a source of bad luck. Lampie, the lighthouse keeper, stumbles out of a tavern and encounters him. Elliott makes himself visible and Lampie, terrified, runs to the townspeople. They dismiss his claims as a drunken rant. In a seaside cave, Pete reprimands Elliott for causing trouble. As they make up, Lampie&#x27;s daughter, Nora, appears, warning that Pete is not safe there because of the incoming tide. After realizing he is an orphan and not from the area, she offers him shelter at the lighthouse, and they bond. He learns the story of her fiancé, Paul, whose ship was lost at sea the year before, and promises to ask Elliott to try to locate him.

Itinerant quack Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, win over the gullible townspeople, who are angered by their return. After Lampie takes Hoagy to the cave where Elliot resides to prove that he is real, their encounter with him goes awry and they flee. Hoagy tries to tell Dr. Terminus about Elliott, but he does not believe him. The next day, the local fishermen complain about the scarcity of fish, believing it&#x27;s Pete&#x27;s fault. Nora says the fishing grounds shift from time to time and Pete should be welcomed into town. That night, Nora and Lampie argue over Lampie&#x27;s claims of seeing Elliott and Nora&#x27;s belief that Paul will return.

Nora takes Pete to start school, where the teacher, Miss Taylor, punishes him for Elliott&#x27;s antics. Enraged, Elliott smashes into the schoolhouse, leaving his shape in the wall and frightening the townspeople. Dr. Terminus, now convinced Elliott is real, discovers from a book that any physical property from dragons can be used for remedies and tonics, and conspires with Hoagy to exploit Elliott for medical profit. Pete accepts Nora and Lampie&#x27;s invitation to live with them. When the Gogans arrive in town and demand he be returned, they brandish a document proving they had legally bought him for fifty dollars (plus fees), but Nora refuses to surrender him. As the Gogans chase them in a boat, Elliott sinks it, saving Pete. Dr. Terminus makes a deal with the Gogans to capture Pete and Elliott, even convincing the townspeople that capturing Elliott will solve their problems.

That evening, a storm blows in, while at sea, a ship approaches Passamaquoddy with Paul on board. Dr. Terminus lures Pete to the boathouse while Hoagy does the same to Elliott, who gets caught in a net, but frees himself. He retrieves Pete in a confrontation with the Gogans, who flee after he destroys their document. Dr. Terminus attempts to harpoon him, but his leg gets caught in the rope and he is sent catapulting through the ceiling, ending up dangling upside down near a utility pole. Elliott saves the Mayor, Miss Taylor, and the members of the Town Board from a falling utility pole, revealing himself to them. At the lighthouse, the lamp has been extinguished by a rogue wave. Elliott lights it with his fire, revealing himself to Nora and saving the ship.

The next morning, the Mayor and townspeople praise Elliott for his help, and Nora is reunited with Paul. He explains he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck at Cape Hatteras and suffered amnesia, but something knocked him out of bed and restored his memory. Elliott reveals to Pete that since he has a family now, he must move on to help another child in trouble, and will not see Pete again. Soon accepting this, Pete says goodbye to him as he and his family watch him fly away, with Pete reminding him that he is supposed to be invisible as he disappears into the sky.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In December 1957, Walt Disney Productions optioned the film rights to the short story &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon and the U.S.A. (Forever After)&quot; that was written by Seton I. Miller and S.S. Field, in which Miller was hired to write the script. Impressed with his performance in &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, Walt Disney had child actor Kevin Corcoran in mind to star in the project as a feature-length film. However, Disney considered the project to be more appropriate for his &quot;Disneyland&quot; anthology program, by which it was slated to be filmed as a two-part episode in the following year. In February 1958, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that filming was scheduled to begin in October. By the following spring, veteran screenwriter Noel Langley had completed his draft of the script. However, Disney was still unsure of how to approach the project, and the project was placed in turnaround.

In 1968, writers Bill Raynor and Myles Wilder were hired to write the script, and completed their outline in October. They submitted their outline to the studio for review, but the project continued to languish in development. In 1975, producer Jerome Courtland re-discovered the project and hired writer Malcolm Marmorstein to write the script. For his script, Marmorstein revised the story from being in contemporary time into a period setting, and had the dragon changed from being wholly imaginary into a real one. In earlier drafts, Elliott was mostly invisible aside from one animated sequence, in which Dr. Terminus would chop up the dragon for his get-rich scheme. However, veteran Disney artist Ken Anderson felt the audience would &quot;lose patience&quot; with the idea and lobbied for Elliott to be seen more in his visible form during the film. In retrospect, Marmorstein conceded that &quot;We tried a completely invisible dragon, but it was no fun. It was lacking. It&#x27;s a visual medium, and you&#x27;re making a film for kids.&quot; He also named the dragon &quot;Elliott&quot; after actor Elliott Gould (who was a friend from his theater days), and named the town &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot; after the real Native American tribe in Maine.

In October 1975, the songwriting duo of Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn were assigned to compose the musical score. The production was directed by British filmmaker Don Chaffey, who had made two smaller films for Disney in the early 1960s between directing larger fantasy adventures (&quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;) for others.

=== Locations ===
The lighthouse for the film was built on Point Buchon Trail in Montana De Oro State Park located south of Los Osos, California, substituting for Maine. It was equipped with such a large beacon that Disney had to get special permission from the Coast Guard to operate it, since doing so during filming would have confused passing ships. Pacific Gas and Electric opened the Point Buchon Trail and allows hikers access to where filming took place ().

=== Animation ===
The film is the first involving animation in which none of the Nine Old Men—Disney&#x27;s original team of animators—were involved. One technique used in the movie involved compositing with a yellowscreen that was originally used in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and similar to today&#x27;s greenscreen compositing, whereby up to three scenes might be overlaid together – for example, a live foreground, a live background, and an animated middle ground containing Elliott. Ken Anderson, who created Elliott, explained that he thought it would be appropriate to make him &quot;a little paunchy&quot; and not always particularly graceful at flying. Don Hahn, who was an assistant director to Don Bluth on &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, gained some experience working with a combination of live-action and animation before later going on to work on &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; premiered on November 3, 1977 at the Radio City Music Hall, in which the film ran 134 minutes. For its general release, it was edited down to 121 minutes. It was later re-released on March 9, 1984, shortened from 121 minutes to 104 minutes. The film&#x27;s movie poster was painted by artist Paul Wenzel.

=== Soundtrack ===
A soundtrack recording (Disneyland 3138) was released that told much of the story and added a narrator, but unlike many other Disney book and records, used the actual dialogue recorded for the film, which the book presented in script format. The inclusion of story led to the omission of several songs, including &quot;The Happiest Home in These Hills,&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s Room for Everyone,&quot; and &quot;Bill of Sale,&quot; while &quot;Brazzle Dazzle Day&quot; is included only in instrumental.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS in early 1980. It was re-released on VHS on October 28, 1994 as a part of Masterpiece Collection. It was originally slated to be released in the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line-up on December 5, 2000, but it was pushed back to January 16, 2001. The DVD includes bonus features such as two animated shorts &quot;Lighthouse Keeping&quot; and &quot;Man, Monsters and Mysteries&quot;, two vintage excerpts from the &quot;Disney Family Album&quot; episode on Ken Anderson and &quot;The Plausible Impossible&quot; from &quot;Disneyland&quot;, and both theatrical trailers for the film.

The film was re-released in a &quot;High-Flying Edition&quot; DVD on August 18, 2009. The DVD includes a half-hour documentary feature, a deleted storyboard sequence, original demo recordings of the songs, and several bonus features transferred from the Gold Classic Collection release. It was released on the 35th-anniversary edition Blu-ray on October 16, 2012.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reaction ===
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film declaring it &quot;the most energetic and enjoyable Disney movie in a long while.&quot; She noted, &quot;Sean Marshall doesn&#x27;t sing well, but Helen Reddy does, so she often accompanies his vocals. Miss Reddy is serviceable but undistinguished as an actress—she has a tendency to behave as if she were a very bright light bulb in a very small lamp—but she so often finds herself in the company of Messrs. Rooney, Dale or Buttons that her scenes work well.&quot; However, she was critical of the film&#x27;s length and the excessive alcohol consumption.

Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, criticizing the score and the live-action footage, but praising the animation of the dragon and the performances, writing &quot;Sean Marshall, as Pete, looks and acts natural on camera which makes him a refreshing change from those sweet little cherubs usually cast in Disney movies. Miss Reddy plays her role with crisp efficiency and fortunately receives strong support for the rest of the cast, particularly Dale, so slick and funny as the conniving medicine man he nearly upstages the cuddly dragon.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote the film was &quot;an enchanting and humane fable which introduces a most lovable animal star (albeit an animated one).&quot; They praised the combination of live-action and animation as &quot;never before more effectively realized&quot; and commented that the film suffered &quot;whenever Elliott is off screen.&quot;

John Skow of &quot;Time&quot; wrote the film was &quot;likeable fantasy&quot;, but dismissed the musical numbers as &quot;a good opportunity to line up for more popcorn.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;At 2 hours 7 minutes it is a trying span for small sitters. The animated excitements keep stopping for songs by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, but they are not showstoppers in the grand sense. Bland, perfunctory and too numerous is more like it.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that &quot;we get the same tired Disney formula: a gooey-faced kid in a phony sound-stage world populated by old actors required to perform ancient vaudeville routines ... Compared to the great Disney animation classics, &#x27;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&#x27; is just TV fare on the wide screen.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;was apparently meant to be a big, rousing musical comedy-fantasy, but it&#x27;s staged and photographed without musical-comedy energy, flair or coordination ... Perhaps children can be counted on to enjoy Elliott&#x27;s mugging and the slapstick interludes that occasionally interrupt the tedium, but parents will see this one more as a chore.&quot;

Critic Leonard Maltin observed that Disney made several attempts to recreate the appeal and success of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), and that &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; did not come close on that score. However, he added that it might please children, and that &quot;the animated title character is so endearing that it almost compensates for the live actors&#x27; tiresome mugging.&quot;

Thomas J. Harris, in his book &quot;Children’s Live-Action Musical Films: A Critical Survey and Filmography&quot;, heavily criticized the story as well as the compositing of the animated Elliott; he also found the &quot;Mary Poppinsish ending&quot; to be &quot;thoroughly unmotivated&quot;, because Pete&#x27;s life before meeting Elliott is never fleshed out.

In 2006, Elliott was ranked fifth on a top 10 list of movie dragons by Karl Heitmueller for MTV Movie News.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Boring and slow, this is a lesser Disney work, though the animation isn&#x27;t without its charms.&quot; Metacritic gave film a score of 46 based on 5 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

=== Box office ===
During its initial release, the film grossed $16.1 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada, which was ranked sixteenth on &quot;Variety&quot;″s box office hits list of 1978. However, the returns were considered disappointing for Disney who were hoping for a &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;-sized blockbuster. The film has a lifetime domestic gross ranging from $36 to 39.6 million.

== Awards and honors ==
== Remake ==

In March 2013, Disney announced a remake of the film, written by David Lowery and Toby Halbrooks, the director/writer and co-producer (respectively) of the Sundance hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t Them Bodies Saints&quot; (2013). The film is a live-action movie instead of an animated movie. It re-imagines a venerable Disney family and is presented as a straightforward drama as opposed to a musical. Principal photography commenced in January 2015 in New Zealand, with Lowery directing, and subsequently released on August 12, 2016.

<text>Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne, (25 September 193921 January 2015) was a British Conservative politician and barrister who served as a European Commissioner from 1989 to 1999. As a member of Parliament from 1974 to 1988, he served several ministerial roles in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, including Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985.

== Early life ==
Leon Brittan was born in London, the son of Rebecca (née Lipetz) and Joseph Brittan, a doctor. His parents were Lithuanian Jews who had migrated to Britain before the Second World War.

Brittan was educated at the Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society and Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association. Brittan then studied at Yale University on a Henry Fellowship. Sir Samuel Brittan, the economics journalist, was his brother. The former Conservative MP Malcolm Rifkind and the music producer Mark Ronson were cousins.

== Political career ==

=== MP and minister ===
After unsuccessfully contesting the constituency of Kensington North in 1966 and 1970, he was elected to Parliament in the general election of February 1974 for Cleveland and Whitby, and became an opposition spokesman in 1976. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1978. Between 1979 and 1981, he was Minister of State at the Home Office. He was then promoted to become Chief Secretary to the Treasury, becoming the youngest member of the Cabinet. He warned cabinet colleagues that spending on social security, health and education would have to be cut &quot;whether they like it or not&quot;.

At the 1983 election, Brittan was elected MP for Richmond. Following the election, he was promoted to Home Secretary, becoming the youngest since Churchill. During the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, Brittan was a strong critic of the leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers. He accused them of organising violence by flying pickets, whom he described as &quot;thugs&quot;. One factor in the defeat of the strike was central control of local police forces. As soon as the strike began, Brittan set up a National Reporting Centre in New Scotland Yard to coordinate intelligence and the supply of police officers between forces as necessary. Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government had carefully planned for a miners&#x27; strike, and a Whitehall committee had been meeting in secret since 1981 to prepare for a protracted dispute.

In 1984, after the murder of Yvonne Fletcher, a police officer, during a protest outside the Libyan embassy in London, Brittan headed the government&#x27;s crisis committee as both Thatcher and the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, were away at the time. In January 2014, secret government documents released by the National Archives disclosed that Libya twice warned British officials that the Libyan embassy protest would become violent – hours before WPC Fletcher was killed.

In September 1986, Brittan was cleared by a High Court Judge of acting unlawfully when, as Home Secretary, he gave MI5 permission to tap the telephone of a leader of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

In September 1985, Brittan was moved to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The reason for his demotion, according to Jonathan Aitken, was that the prime minister Margaret Thatcher felt that Brittan was &quot;not getting the message across on television&quot;. In her memoirs, Thatcher wrote of Brittan: &quot;Everybody complained about his manner on television, which seemed aloof and uncomfortable.&quot;

Brittan had been criticised as a poor communicator and for his role in the suppression of a BBC television programme in the &quot;Real Lives&quot; series on The Troubles in Northern Ireland, &quot;At the Edge of the Union&quot;. Brittan stated that transmission of the programme would be against the national interest and in August 1985 he wrote to the BBC chairman, Stuart Young, asking for the broadcast to be cancelled. The BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors called an emergency meeting and ruled that the documentary could not be shown. The controversy led to a rift between the BBC&#x27;s boards of management and governors. It also led to a day of strike action by hundreds of television and radio workers who protested against what they perceived as government censorship.

=== Resignation over the Westland affair ===
Brittan resigned as Trade and Industry Secretary in January 1986 over the Westland affair. Brittan had authorised the leaking of a letter from the Solicitor General that had accused Michael Heseltine of inaccuracies in his campaign for Westland to be rescued by a consortium of European investors. The rest of the government, led by Margaret Thatcher, supported a deal with the American business Sikorsky Fiat.

Jonathan Aitken wrote of Brittan&#x27;s resignation: &quot;Soon after a poisonous meeting of Tory backbenchers at the 1922 Committee, he fell on his sword. It was a combination of a witch hunt and a search for a scapegoat – tainted by an undercurrent of anti-Semitism. […] I believed what should have been obvious to anyone else, that he was being used as a lightning conductor to deflect the fire that the Prime Minister had started and inflamed&quot;. It was later revealed that Brittan had attempted to persuade British Aerospace and General Electric Company (GEC) to withdraw from the European consortium.

In October 1986, in a House of Commons debate, Brittan made a bitter attack on Michael Heseltine, accusing him of &quot;thwarting the Government at every turn&quot; in its handling of the Westland affair. Brittan said that Government decisions &quot;should have the support of all its members and should not be undermined from within&quot;.

In 1989, Brittan revealed in a Channel 4 programme that two senior Downing Street officials, Bernard Ingham and Charles Powell, had approved the leaking of the letter from the Solicitor General. Brittan&#x27;s claim led to calls from some Labour MPs for a new inquiry into the Westland affair.

=== European Commission ===
Brittan was knighted in the 1989 New Years Honours List. He was made European Commissioner for Competition at the European Commission early in 1989, resigning as an MP to take the position. He accepted the post reluctantly, as it meant giving up his British parliamentary ambitions. Margaret Thatcher appointed Brittan to the Commission as a replacement for Lord Cockfield, whose pro-European enthusiasm she disapproved of; however, in doing so she had overlooked Brittan&#x27;s own record as a supporter of the European Union and subsequently found his views and policies at odds with those she had expected from him. Brittan passed the merger regulation in 1989, which enabled him to ban the ATR/De Havilland planned merger in 1991.

In 1993 he became European Commissioner for Trade and in 1995 European Commissioner for External Affairs, also serving as a Vice-President of the European Commission. Brittan resigned with the rest of the Santer Commission in 1999 amid accusations of fraud against Jacques Santer and Édith Cresson. During his time as a Vice-President of the European Commission, one subsequently prominent member of his official office was Nick Clegg, who became leader of the Liberal Democrats in December 2007 and deputy prime minister in May 2010.

== Peerage ==
Brittan was created a life peer (Baron Brittan of Spennithorne, of Spennithorne in the County of North Yorkshire) on 9 February 2000. He was vice-chairman of UBS AG Investment Bank, non-executive director of Unilever and member of the international advisory committee for Total. In August 2010, Brittan was appointed a trade adviser to the UK government. Prime Minister David Cameron said that Brittan had &quot;unrivalled experience&quot; for the job, which was scheduled to last for six months.

Brittan&#x27;s wife Diana (, born 1940), Lady Brittan of Spennithorne, was named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours &quot;for public service and charity&quot;.

== Death ==
Brittan died at his London home in Pimlico on 21 January 2015, aged 75; he had been ill with cancer for some time. He had two stepdaughters.

== False allegations ==

=== Paedophile dossier ===

In 1984, in his capacity as Home Secretary, Brittan was handed a 40-page dossier by Geoffrey Dickens MP which detailed alleged paedophile activity in the 1980s, including, according to Dickens, allegations concerning &quot;people in positions of power, influence and responsibility&quot;. The whereabouts of the dossier is currently unknown. Brittan denied any knowledge of the matter in an e-mail to a &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; reporter in 2013, and later replied that he had no recollection of it to a query from &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper.

Brittan later declared in 2014 that Dickens had met him at the Home Office and that he had written to Dickens on 20 March 1984, explaining what had been done about the files. In an article for &quot;The Times&quot;, journalist James Gillespie quoted a letter from Dickens dated 7 January 1984 in which he thanked Brittan for his &quot;splendid support&quot;. He also gave examples of the allegations in the dossier, including a woman protesting that her 16-year-old son had become homosexual after working in Buckingham Palace kitchens and a civil servant advocating persons caught by Customs and Excise importing child pornography should be referred to the police.

An initial review by Home Office civil servant Mark Sedwill in 2013 concluded that copies of Dickens&#x27;s material had &quot;not been retained&quot; but that Brittan had acted appropriately in dealing with the allegations. In November 2014, a review by Peter Wanless followed. Wanless said there was no evidence to suggest that files had been removed to cover up abuse.

=== Allegations pursued by Labour MP ===

In June 2014, Brittan was interviewed under caution by police in connection with the alleged rape of a 19-year-old student in his central London flat in 1967 before he became an MP. They had not pursued the allegation when it was first made because of insufficient evidence. The police reopened the investigation after Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, had been lobbied by Labour MP Tom Watson to investigate further. In a statement on 7 July 2014, Brittan denied the claims. At the time of his death, Brittan had not been told by the police that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for the alleged rape of the woman. The deputy assistant commissioner of the Met, Steve Rodhouse, wrote a letter of apology to the solicitors of Brittan&#x27;s widow.

In October 2014, the Labour MP Jimmy Hood used parliamentary privilege to refer to claims that Brittan had been linked to child abuse.
After Brittan died in January 2015, Watson accused him of &quot;multiple child rape&quot;; he said he had spoken to two people who claimed they were abused by Brittan. Convicted fraudster Chris Fay alleged that he had seen a photograph of Brittan with a child at Elm Guest House in mid-1982. In March 2015, it was reported that detectives from Operation Midland, set up by the Metropolitan Police to investigate claims of child sex abuse, had visited and searched two homes in London and Yorkshire formerly owned by Brittan. One of Brittan&#x27;s accusers subsequently told BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; that he originally named Brittan as a joke and told the Metropolitan Police that two well-known campaigners may have led him into making false claims. On 21 March 2016, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that Operation Midland had been closed without any charges being brought.

On 1 September 2017, it was reported that the Metropolitan Police had paid substantial compensation to Brittan&#x27;s widow for having raided the Brittans&#x27; home &quot;after accepting that the searches had been unjustified and should never have taken place.&quot; Carl Beech, whose claims spurred Operation Midland, was convicted of perverting the course of justice in July 2019.

==Honours==
Brittan was created a life peer by the Queen on the advice of Conservative Party leader William Hague. He took the title &quot;Baron Brittan of Spennithorne&quot;, &quot;of Spennithorne in the County of North Yorkshire&quot; on 9 February 2000. He sat with the Conservative Party benches in the House of Lords.

<doc id="358373" wikidata="Q315618" url="?curid=358373" title="Vicente Guerrero">
<text>Vicente Ramón Guerrero Saldaña (; baptized 10 August 1782 – 14 February 1831) was a Mexican military officer from 1810–1821 and a statesman who became the nation&#x27;s second president in 1829. He was one of the leading generals who fought against Spain during the Mexican War of Independence. According to historian Theodore G. Vincent, Vicente Guerrero lived alongside indigenous in Tlaltelulco and had the ability to speak Spanish and the languages of the Indigenous.

During his presidency, he abolished slavery in Mexico. Guerrero was deposed in a rebellion by his Vice-President Anastasio Bustamante.

==Early life==
Vicente Guerrero was born in Tixtla, a town approximately 100 kilometers inland from the port of Acapulco, in the Sierra Madre del Sur. He was the son of María Guadalupe Rodríguez Saldaña, and Juan Pedro Guerrero. His father&#x27;s family included landowners, affluent farmers, traders with broad business connections in Southern Mexico, members of the Spanish militia, gunsmiths, and cannon manufacturers. During his youth, Guerrero worked for his father&#x27;s prosperous mule-driven freight business, which provided him the opportunity to travel across Mexico. His travels exposed him to emerging ideas of independence and dissent against Spanish rule. 

Guerrero&#x27;s ethnic origins have been a subject of debate, with some historians suggesting he was of mixed Indigenous heritage. However, no portraits of him were made during his lifetime and those made posthumously may not be reliable. Fellow insurgent José María Morelos described Guerrero as a &quot;young man with bronzed or tanned skin (&quot;broncineo&quot; in Spanish), tall and strong, with an aquiline nose, bright, light-colored eyes, and prominent sideburns&quot;. He was often supported by the indigenous people throughout the Revolution.
Vicente&#x27;s father, Juan Pedro Guerrero, was a supporter of the Spanish rule, while his uncle, Diego Guerrero, held a prominent position in the Spanish militia. As an adult, Vicente was opposed to the Spanish colonial government. In December 1810, Guerrero enlisted in José María Morelos&#x27;s insurgent army in southern Mexico, beginning his career as a revolutionary leader. He was married to María Guadalupe Hernández, and they had a daughter, María Dolores Guerrero Hernández. María Dolores married Mariano Riva Palacio, who was the defense lawyer for Maximilian I of Mexico in Querétaro, and was the mother of the late nineteenth-century intellectual Vicente Riva Palacio.

==Insurgent==

In 1810, Guerrero joined in the early revolt against Spain, first fighting in the forces of secular priest José María Morelos. When the Mexican War of Independence began, Guerrero was working as a muleteer and in an armory, in Tixtla, when the revolution started. He joined the rebellion in November 1810 and enlisted in a division that independence leader Morelos had organized to fight in southern Mexico.

Guerrero gained expertise in military strategy in the Battle of Zitltala. At the Battle of Tixtla, on May 26 of 1811, Jose Maria Morelos asked the advice of Vicente Guerrero on military strategy to be used on the town of Tixtla because Guerrero was from Tixtla. After the battle, Guerrero was told by Morelos to speak to the indigenous people of Tixtla since he Guerrero was able to speak Nahuatl, the native language in Tixtla, because he had grown up in Tixtla. Morelos told Guerrero to inform the natives of their freedom from the Spanish. Historian William Sprague argued Guerrero was largely supported by the Native Americans throughout the Revolution due to his ability to speak and interact with the natives. By November 1811, Vicente Guerrero, alongside Jose Maria Morelos, took control of the highlands of the Mesa Del Sur, further building Guerrero&#x27;s experience as an insurgent.

Guerrero distinguished himself in the Battle of Izúcar, in February 1812, and had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel when Oaxaca was claimed by rebels in November 1812. In a speech given to the indigenous people in Tlapa in 1815, Guerrero argued for citizenship to be extended to indigenous people to establish a larger free society for those originally not recognized by the Spanish. Initial victories by Morelos&#x27; forces faltered, and Morelos himself was captured and executed in December 1815.

Historian Mario S. Guerrero argued Guerrero&#x27;s guerrilla tactics and successes were just as significant to winning the Mexican Revolution as notable battles. After the death of Jose Morelos, in March 1816,Vicente Guerrero pledged his support behind the Board of Jaujilla. With the Spanish in pursuit, Guerrero used guerilla tactics he learned in his early military experience with Morelos. Guerrero fought in skirmishes with the Spanish in Piaxtla and Xonacatlán. Near Xonacatlán, Guerrero ambushed royalist Captain Jose Vicente Robles’s force of 150 troops, which led to a victory and a smaller force in pursuit of Guerrero.

In March 1816, According to the Historian William Sprague Vicente Guerrero, after the death of Morelos and Juan Nepomuceno Rosains had quit the revolution taking a Spanish pardon, Guerrero had no commander thus Guadalupe Victoria and Isidoro Montes de Oca, gave him the position of &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; of the rebel troops. In 1816, the royal government under Viceroy Apodaca sought to end the insurgency, offering amnesty. Guerrero&#x27;s father carried an appeal for his son to surrender, but Guerrero refused. He remained the only major rebel leader still at large and kept the rebellion going through an extensive campaign of guerrilla warfare. He won victories at Ajuchitán, Santa Fe, Tetela del Río, Huetamo, Tlalchapa, and Cuautlotitlán, regions of southern Mexico that were very familiar to him.

In November 16, 1820 after being appointed commander of the royal forces in Southern Mexico, Agustín de Iturbide was sent against Guerrero&#x27;s forces. Guerrero was victorious against Iturbide, who realized that there was a military stalemate. Guerrero appealed to Iturbide to abandon his royalist loyalty and to join the fight for independence. Events in Spain had changed in 1820, with Spanish liberals ousting Ferdinand VII and imposing the liberal constitution of 1812 that the king had repudiated. Conservatives in Mexico, including the Catholic hierarchy, began to conclude that continued allegiance to Spain would undermine their position and opted for independence to maintain their control. Guerrero&#x27;s appeal to join the forces for independence was successful. Guerrero and Iturbide allied under the Plan de Iguala and their forces merged as the Army of the Three Guarantees.

The Plan of Iguala proclaimed independence, called for a constitutional monarchy and the continued place of the Roman Catholic Church, and abolished the formal &quot;casta&quot; system of racial classification. While Iturbide during the writing of The Plan of Iguala, did not include mulattos and blacks in receiving rights. Vicente Guerrero advocated for all people in Mexico to receive equal protections under the law without regards to race and refused to agree to any alternative. Clause 12 was incorporated into the plan: &quot;All inhabitants... without distinction of their European, African or Indian origins are citizens... with full freedom to pursue their livelihoods according to their merits and virtues.&quot; The Army of the Three Guarantees marched triumphantly into Mexico City on September 27, 1821.

Iturbide was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico by Congress. In January 1823, Guerrero, along with Nicolás Bravo, rebelled against Iturbide, returning to southern Mexico to raise rebellion, according to some assessments because their careers had been blocked by the emperor. Their stated objectives were to restore the Constituent Congress. Guerrero and Bravo were defeated by Iturbide&#x27;s forces at Almolongo, now in the State of Guerrero, less than a month later. When Iturbide&#x27;s imperial government collapsed in 1823, Guerrero was named one of Constituent Congress&#x27;s ruling triumvirate.

==1828 presidential election==

Guerrero was a liberal by conviction, and active in the York Rite Masons, established in Mexico after independence by Joel Roberts Poinsett, the U.S. diplomatic representative to the newly independent Mexico. The Scottish Rite Masons had been established before independence. Following independence the &quot;Yorkinos&quot; appealed to a broad range of Mexico&#x27;s populace, as opposed to the Scottish Rite Masons, who were a bulwark of conservatism, and in the absence of established political parties, rival groups of Masons functioned as political organizations. Guerrero had a large following among urban &quot;Yorkinos&quot;, who were mobilized during the 1828 election campaign and afterwards, in the ouster of the president-elect, Manuel Gómez Pedraza.

In 1828, the four-year term of the first president of the republic, Guadalupe Victoria, came to an end. Unlike the first presidential election and the president serving his full term, the election of 1828 was highly partisan. Guerrero&#x27;s supporters included federalist liberals, members of the radical wing of the York Rite Freemasons. During Guerrero’s campaign he advocated for political opportunities for all regardless of their race and wealth through universal suffrage in Mexico. General Gómez Pedraza won the September 1828 election to succeed Guadalupe Victoria, with Guerrero coming in second and Anastasio Bustamante, third through indirect election of Mexico&#x27;s state legislatures. Gómez Pedraza was the candidate of the &quot;Impartials&quot;, composed of Yorkinos concerned about the radicalism of Guerrero and Scottish Rite Masons (&quot;Escocés&quot;), who sought a new political party. Among those who were Impartials were distinguished federalist Yorkinos Valentín Gómez Farías and Miguel Ramos Arizpe. The U.S. diplomatic representative in Mexico, Joel Roberts Poinsett was enthusiastic about Guerrero&#x27;s candidacy, writing 

Guerrero himself did not leave an abundant written record, but some of his speeches survive.
Two weeks after the September 1 election, Antonio López de Santa Anna rose in rebellion in support of Guerrero. As governor of the strategic state of Veracruz and former general in the war of independence, Santa Anna was a powerful figure in the early republic, but he was unable to persuade the state legislature to support Guerrero in the indirect elections. Santa Anna resigned the governorship and led 800 troops loyal to him in capturing the fortress of Perote, near Xalapa. He issued a political plan there calling for the nullification of Gómez Pedraza&#x27;s election and the declaration of Guerrero as president.

In November 1828 in Mexico City, Guerrero supporters took control of the Accordada, a former prison transformed into an armory, and days of fighting occurred in the capital. President-elect Gómez Pedraza had not yet taken office and at this juncture he resigned and soon went into exile in England. With the resignation of the president-elect and the ineffective rule of the sitting president, civil order dissolved. On 4 December 1828, a riot broke out in the Zócalo and the Parián market, where luxury goods were sold, was looted. Order was restored within a day, but elites in the capital were alarmed at the violence of the popular classes and the huge property losses. With the resignation of Gómez Pedraza, and Guerreros&#x27;s cause backed by Santa Anna&#x27;s forces and the powerful liberal politician Lorenzo de Zavala, Guerrero became president. Guerrero took office as president, with Bustamante, a conservative, becoming vice president. One scholar sums up Guerrero&#x27;s situation, &quot;Guerrero owed the presidency to a mutiny and a failure of will on the part of [President] Guadalupe Victoria...Guerrero was to rule as president with only a thin layer of support.&quot;

==Presidency==
A liberal folk hero of the independence insurgency, Guerrero became president on 1 April 1829, with conservative Anastasio Bustamante as his vice president. For some of Guerrero&#x27;s supporters, a visibly mixed-race man from Mexico&#x27;s periphery becoming president of Mexico was a step toward what one 1829 pamphleteer called &quot;the reconquest of this land by its legitimate owners&quot; and called Guerrero &quot;that immortal hero, favorite son of Nezahualcoyotzin&quot;, the famous ruler of prehispanic Texcoco. Some creole elites (American-born whites of Spanish heritage) were alarmed by Guerrero as president, a group that liberal Lorenzo de Zavala disparagingly called &quot;the new Mexican aristocracy&quot;.

Guerrero set about creating a cabinet of liberals, but his government already encountered serious problems, including its very legitimacy, since president-elect Gómez Pedraza had resigned under pressure. Some traditional federalists leaders, who might have supported Guerrero, did not do so because of the electoral irregularities. The national treasury was empty and future revenues were already liened. Spain continued to deny Mexico&#x27;s independence and threatened reconquest.

A key achievement of his presidency was the abolition of slavery in most of Mexico. The slave trade had already been banned by the Spanish authorities in 1818, a ban that had been reconfirmed by the nascent Mexican government in 1824. A few Mexican states had also already abolished the practice of slavery, but it was not until September 16, 1829 that abolition across almost all of the nation was proclaimed by the Guerrero administration. Slavery at this point barely existed throughout Mexico, and only the state of Coahuila y Tejas was significantly affected, due to the immigration of slaveowners from the United States. In response to pressure from Texan settlers, Guerrero exempted Texas from the decree on December 2, 1829.

Guerrero called for public schools, land title reforms, industry and trade development, and other programs of a liberal nature. As president, Guerrero championed the causes of the racially oppressed and economically oppressed. Initially, the leader of the colonization of Texas, Stephen F. Austin, proved enthusiastic towards the Mexican government. 

During Guerrero&#x27;s presidency, the Spanish tried to reconquer Mexico but were defeated at the Battle of Tampico.

==Fall and execution==
Guerrero was deposed in a rebellion under Vice-President Anastasio Bustamante that began on 4 December 1829. Guerrero left the capital to fight in the south, but was deposed by the Mexico City garrison in his absence on 17 December 1829. Guerrero had returned to the region of southern Mexico where he had fought during the war of independence.

Open warfare between Guerrero and his opponent in the region Nicolás Bravo was fierce. Bravo and Guerrero had been comrades in the insurgency during the War of Independence. Bravo controlled the highlands of the region, including the town of Guerrero&#x27;s birth, Tixtla. Guerrero had strength in the hot coastal regions of the Costa Grande and Tierra Caliente, with mixed race populations that had been mobilized during the insurgency for independence. Bravo&#x27;s area had a mixed population, but politically was dominated by whites. The conflict in the south occurred for all of 1830, as conservatives consolidated power in Mexico City.

The war in the south might have continued even longer, but ended in what one historian has called &quot;the most shocking single event in the history of the first republic: the capture of Guerrero in Acapulco through an act of betrayal and his execution a month later.&quot; Guerrero controlled Mexico&#x27;s principal Pacific coast port of Acapulco. An Italian merchant ship captain, Francisco Picaluga, approached the conservative government in Mexico City with a proposal to lure Guerrero onto his ship and take him prisoner for the price of 50,000 pesos, a fortune at the time. Picaluga invited Guerrero on board for a meal on 14 January 1831. Guerrero and a few aides were taken captive and Picaluga sailed to the port of Huatulco, where Guerrero was turned over to federal troops. Guerrero was taken to Oaxaca City and summarily tried by a court-martial.

His capture was welcomed by conservatives and some state legislatures, but the legislatures of Zacatecas and Jalisco tried to prevent Guerrero&#x27;s execution. The government&#x27;s 50,000 peso payment to Picaluga was exposed in the liberal press. Despite pleas for his life, Guerrero was executed by firing squad in Cuilapam on 14 February 1831. His death did mark the dissolution of the rebellion in southern Mexico, but those politicians involved in his execution paid a lasting price to their reputations.

Many Mexicans saw Guerrero as the &quot;martyr of Cuilapam&quot; and his execution was deemed by the liberal newspaper &quot;El Federalista Mexicano&quot; &quot;judicial murder&quot;. The two conservative cabinet members considered most culpable for Guerrero&#x27;s execution, Lucas Alamán and Secretary of War José Antonio Facio, &quot;spent the rest of their lives defending themselves from the charge that they were responsible for the ultimate betrayal in the history of the first republic, that is, that they had arranged not just for the service of Picaluga&#x27;s ship but specifically for his capture of Guerrero.&quot;

Historian Jan Bazant speculates as to why Guerrero was executed rather than sent into exile, as Iturbide had been, as well as Antonio López de Santa Anna, and long-time dictator of late-nineteenth century Mexico, Porfirio Díaz. &quot;The clue is provided by Zavala who, writing several years later, noted that Guerrero was of mixed blood and that the opposition to his presidency came from the great landowners, generals, clerics and Spaniards resident in Mexico...Guerrero&#x27;s execution was perhaps a warning to men considered as socially and ethnically inferior not to dare to dream of becoming president.&quot;

Honors were conferred on surviving members of Guerrero&#x27;s family, and a pension was paid to his widow. In 1842, Vicente Guerrero&#x27;s remains were exhumed and returned to Mexico City for reinterment. He is known for his political discourse promoting equal civil rights for all Mexican citizens. He has been described as the &quot;greatest man of color&quot; to ever live.

==Legacy==

Guerrero is a Mexican national hero. The state of Guerrero is named in his honour. Several towns in Mexico are named in honor of this famous general, including Vicente Guerrero in Durango, Vicente Guerrero in Baja California and the Colonia Guerrero.

According to historian Theodore G. Vincent, In 1831 after Vicente Guerrero’s death, Vicente Guerrero’s wife, Guadalupe, daughter, Dolores, and former supports of Guerrero formed a political thought group. Vincent titled these supporters as, “Guerreroistas.&quot; As a Guerreroistas, historian Vincent argues that they believed in similar ideals of equal rights for all races.

Vicente Guerrero by his Guerreroistas is often mentioned as it pertains to race and linage using his legacy of the revolution to support their actions. According to Theodore G. Vincent, Guerrero’s grandson, Vicente Riva Palacio, influenced by his family of Guerreroistas received the opportunity, from Guerrero’s “puro” political party in 1861, to investigate the Spanish Inquisition in Mexico and published over 38,000 pieces of evidence of Spanish abuse and Mexican opposition to it. Vincente Riva Palacio, according to Vincent attributed his beliefs and political actions to his mother Dolores and connects Palacio directly to Guerrero beliefs and Guerreroistas. According to historian Theodore Vincent, in 1986, Antonio Riva Palacio referenced his linage being connected to Vicente Guerrero and his motivation to continue Vicente Guerrero’s legacy of equality and equity for all Mexicans no matter their racial background.

According to the historian and politician Lorenzo de Zavala, who published in his book, &quot;Ensayo Historico De Las Revolutions De Mexico&quot;, &quot;Desde 1808 Hasta 1830,&quot; an encounter Vicente Guerrero had with his father in 1817. According to Zavala, Vicente Guerrero was approached by his father to lay down his arms and take a Spanish pardon and Vicente replied, &quot;Companions, you see this respectable old man, he is my father. He comes to offer me money and position in the name of the Spaniards. I have always had respect for my father, but my country comes first.” These words contribute to mythology surrounding Guerrero that historian Theodore Vincent argues makes up Mexican culture. According to the Center of Documentation and Analysis, in 2007, Guerrero&#x27;s words, &quot;La Patria es Primero,&quot; has been placed in gold writing above the Mexican Chamber of Deputies in honor of Guerrero to represent his legacy and its effect on Mexican government and culture.

<text>Petra Pau (born 9 August 1963) is a German politician of The Left. She has been a member of the Bundestag since 1998. Since 2006, she has also served as one of the Vice Presidents of the Bundestag, being the first member of her party to hold this office. Pau belongs to the reform-oriented wing of her party, actively supporting parliamentary representative democracy.

== Political career ==
Pau&#x27;s first involvement in politics came in 1983 when she joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED), the governing party of East Germany. She worked as a functionary for the Free German Youth as a leader of the East German pioneers. After German reunification, the SED became the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and she was elected as a PDS member to the Borough Assembly of Hellersdorf in Eastern Berlin in October 1990. She became district chairwoman of the PDS branch in Hellersdorf in October 1991, and was elected chairwoman of the Berlin PDS association in October 1992. From 2000 to 2002, she was deputy chairwoman of the federal party.

She was elected to the state parliament of Berlin in 1995, and remained a member until 1998, when she was elected to the Bundestag for the Berlin Mitte – Prenzlauer Berg constituency. Controversial boundary changes abolished this constituency and for the 2002 election, she contested Berlin-Marzahn-Hellersdorf, regarded as a safe seat for the PDS. She was elected for that constituency and became one of only two members of the Bundestag for her party, which fell below the 5% electoral threshold. The new Left party regained proportional representation in 2005, in part due to Pau being reelected in Marzahn-Hellersdorf and the Left winning two other constituency seats. A party that wins at least three constituency seats qualifies for proportional representation even if it falls below the threshold. 

Pau retained the constituency in 2009, 2013, and 2017, but was defeated in 2021 by CDU candidate Mario Czaja. She nonetheless reentered the Bundestag on the Left party list.

After the 2005 federal election, the Left group offered Lothar Bisky as their candidate for of the Bundestag, but he failed to win a majority after four rounds of voting. They subsequently put forward Pau, who was elected on the first ballot. She has been reelected as in each subsequent term. Since the 2013 term, she has been the longest-serving .

Speaking of her upbringing, Pau said: &quot;Of course my past is typical for someone who grew up in the GDR. I was a teacher and Pioneer leader in East Berlin. It is my past which drives me today in my commitment to a democratic society, and I reject any suggestion that this is not the case or even possible.&quot; In her capacity as , she seeks to be impartial but not apolitical, and champions civil rights and democracy.

On 11 October 2024, Pau declared she would not run again for the Bundestag.

<doc id="358375" wikidata="Q7989023" url="?curid=358375" title="Westland affair">
<text>The Westland affair in 1985–86 was an episode in which Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and her Secretary of State for Defence, Michael Heseltine, went public over a cabinet dispute with questions raised about whether the conventions of cabinet government were being observed and about the integrity of senior politicians.

The argument was over the future of Westland Helicopters, Britain&#x27;s last helicopter manufacturer, which was to be the subject of a rescue bid. The Defence Secretary, Heseltine, favoured a European solution, integrating Westland with a consortium including British Aerospace (BAe), Italian (Agusta) and French companies. Thatcher and Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan, while ostensibly maintaining a neutral stance, wanted to see Westland merge with Sikorsky, an American company.

Heseltine refused to accept Thatcher&#x27;s choice and claimed that Thatcher had refused to allow a free ministerial discussion of the matter, even suggesting that she had lied about cancelling a scheduled meeting. In January 1986, when he was ordered to cease campaigning for his European consortium, he resigned and walked out of a Cabinet meeting. Brittan was then forced to resign for having ordered the leaking to the press of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine, and for his lack of candour to the House of Commons about his efforts to persuade BAe to withdraw from Heseltine&#x27;s consortium.

Thatcher&#x27;s survival as Prime Minister briefly appeared in question, but she rode out the crisis. The episode nonetheless was an embarrassment to the Conservative Thatcher government and undermined her reputation.

==April 1985==
The Westland affair originated with Alan Bristow&#x27;s bid for the company in April 1985. By June, Bristow was threatening to end his bid unless the Government assured him that there would be future orders for the company from the Ministry of Defence and that the repayment of over £40 million of launch aid for Westland&#x27;s newest helicopter from the Department of Trade and Industry was waived.

Heseltine at this time was uninterested in Westland helicopters when approached by Norman Tebbit, the then Trade and Industry Secretary, as plenty of American helicopters were available to meet Britain&#x27;s defence requirements. He attended two meetings about the company&#x27;s future in June 1985, chaired by Thatcher. It was decided that Tebbit should persuade the Bank of England to co-operate with the main creditors in the hope that a recovery plan and new management would end the threat of receivership.

Bristow withdrew his bid and in late June Sir John Cuckney was brought in as chairman of Westland.

==November 1985==
Cuckney proposed that a new minority shareholder of 29.9% be introduced to Westland. No British firm was willing, but Sikorsky was interested. Cuckney proposed that Westland merge with United Technologies Corporation, of which the US company Sikorsky was a subsidiary. Heseltine came out against this plan after realising that Westland would probably become responsible for assembling the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, which the Ministry of Defence would then be under great pressure to buy. He preferred Westland to go into receivership so that British companies GEC and British Aerospace could buy the viable parts of the business.

In mid-October Heseltine suggested a European consortium which would include French Aérospatiale, German MBB and Italian Agusta (Sikorsky was now negotiating a strategic linkup with Italian Fiat). Leon Brittan, who had replaced Tebbit as Trade and Industry Secretary in September 1985, at first urged Thatcher to consider a European option (Heseltine later claimed Brittan this option, although Brittan denied this). The Government was officially neutral (i.e. arguing that it was a matter for Westland directors and shareholders) but by November Heseltine was lobbying hard for the European option.

In late November Peter Levene, Chief of Procurement at the Ministry of Defence, had a meeting at the Ministry with his French, West German and Italian counterparts (the National Armaments Directors or NADs) and the representatives of the consortium, and agreed to &quot;buy European&quot; for certain classes of helicopters. If Westland went ahead with Sikorsky its helicopters, under this new agreement, would be unable to be bought by the four governments. The meeting was later praised by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee. Thatcher, who only learned of the meeting through Cuckney, was displeased, as were Brittan and the Treasury, who thought the US option might be cheaper, although Thatcher and Leon Brittan kept to their official pretence of neutrality.

==December 1985==
In early December Thatcher had two &quot;ad hoc&quot; meetings with Heseltine, Brittan, Tebbit, William Whitelaw (Deputy Prime Minister), Geoffrey Howe (Foreign Secretary) and Nigel Lawson (Chancellor of the Exchequer) on 5 and 6 December. Brittan argued that the NADs&#x27; opposition should be set aside, but Howe and Tebbit were not unsympathetic to Heseltine&#x27;s proposed consortium, and the decision was deferred to the Cabinet Economic Affairs Committee (E(A)) on Monday 9 December 1985. Cuckney and a Westland financial adviser were invited to attend the E(A) meeting. Cuckney said that it was the management&#x27;s view that the Sikorsky option was the best one. A majority of the E(A) meeting agreed to dismiss the NADs&#x27; opposition. Thatcher, who complained that three hours had been spent discussing a company with a market capitalisation of only £30m (a tiny amount in government terms), allowed Heseltine until 4 pm on Friday 13 December to submit a viable proposal for a European deal. He did (with British Aerospace and GEC now part of his consortium), but Westland&#x27;s directors rejected it and chose Sikorsky. Heseltine had expected that there would be a second meeting of E(A) to discuss his consortium, but no such meeting was called; Thatcher later claimed that the Monday meeting had agreed to leave the decision to Westland to take, but it later emerged that Ridley and Lord Young placed such a meeting in their diaries and had been told by Number Ten that it had been cancelled. Heseltine threatened resignation for the first time.

At Cabinet on Thursday 12 December Heseltine had an angry exchange with Thatcher about the allegedly cancelled meeting (Thatcher claimed that no such meeting had ever been scheduled). Westland was not on the Cabinet agenda that day and Thatcher refused to permit a discussion on the matter, arguing that Cabinet could not do so without the necessary papers. Heseltine asked for his dissent to be minuted, and this was not done, although Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong claimed that this had been an error and added it himself. On Monday 16 December Brittan told the House of Commons that the decision was up to Westland; on Wednesday 18 December Heseltine won the backing of the Commons Defence Committee for the European Consortium&#x27;s latest bid. On Thursday 19 December the matter was discussed at Cabinet for ten minutes: Cabinet approved leaving the decision to Westland and Heseltine was ordered to cease campaigning for the European option.

Over Christmas, Thatcher discussed with close colleagues the option of sacking Heseltine, as Brittan had urged her to do (Chief Whip John Wakeham cautioned against), but—as she later admitted in her memoirs—she shrank from doing so as he was too popular and weighty a political figure. Thatcher and ministerial colleagues spent two and a half hours writing three successive drafts of a letter threatening Heseltine with the sack, but did not send it as her press adviser Bernard Ingham advised that Heseltine might use it an excuse to resign.

==January 1986: leaks==
By now the political row was being discussed in the media, partly because of the lack of other news in December. Cuckney wrote to Thatcher, at her behest, asking for reassurance that the Sikorsky deal would not damage Westland&#x27;s business prospects in Europe. Heseltine was not satisfied with Thatcher&#x27;s draft reply when he saw it and consulted Sir Patrick Mayhew (Solicitor-General and acting Attorney-General as Sir Michael Havers was ill) on the grounds that the government might be legally liable for any incorrect advice. Heseltine supplied extra material about the risk of losing European business, which Thatcher did not include in her reply to Cuckney. Thatcher replied to Cuckney to the effect that the British Government would continue to support Westland in gaining orders in Europe.

In early January Heseltine then wrote to David Horne of Lloyds Merchant Bank, who was advising the European consortium (in reply to planted questions from Horne which had been dictated to him over the phone by one of Heseltine&#x27;s staff), giving him the advice which Thatcher had declined to include in her letter to Cuckney. Contradicting Thatcher&#x27;s reassurances to Cuckney, Heseltine claimed that the Sikorsky deal would be &quot;incompatible with participation&quot; in European helicopter projects. Heseltine&#x27;s letter was leaked to &quot;The Times&quot;. This was a blatant challenge to Thatcher&#x27;s authority as Heseltine had not consulted Downing Street, the Department of Trade and Industry or Mayhew before writing to Horne.

Heseltine&#x27;s letter to Horne, on Thatcher&#x27;s request, was referred to the Solicitor-General, Patrick Mayhew. Mayhew sent a reply to Heseltine, noting &quot;material inaccuracies&quot; in Heseltine&#x27;s letter, and asking Heseltine to write to Horne again, correcting them. Mayhew&#x27;s letter of rebuke to Heseltine—marked &quot;Confidential&quot;—reached Heseltine at lunchtime on Monday 6 January and was immediately and selectively leaked to the Press Association by Colette Bowe, chief information officer at the Department of Trade and Industry, at Brittan&#x27;s request. There was controversy over whose orders Colette Bowe was following. The Attorney-General, Sir Michael Havers, took a stern view of leaks, especially of confidential legal advice, and threatened to resign if an official inquiry was not set up to look into it. Thatcher agreed to do this.

==January 1986: Heseltine resigns==
Cabinet met on the morning of Thursday 9 January, with Thatcher already having agreed her position with close colleagues at Chequers that weekend, and arranged that Scottish Secretary George Younger should take over as Defence Secretary if Heseltine resigned. Westland was first on the agenda, and Heseltine and Brittan were permitted to put their cases. Heseltine had won the moral high ground over the leaking saga, but Lawson recorded that he seemed obsessive at Cabinet and attracted little sympathy. Thatcher then reiterated her position, which had already been endorsed by the Cabinet, that Westland&#x27;s future was a matter for Westland to decide, and announced that as this was a time of business negotiations all answers to questions about Westland must be cleared through the Cabinet Office. Heseltine agreed. However, in response to a question by Nicholas Ridley she then confirmed that this also applied to statements which had been made. Heseltine argued that he should be allowed to reaffirm statements he had already made but Thatcher disagreed, arguing that Cabinet collective responsibility should be observed. Heseltine protested that there had been no collective responsibility, gathered up his papers and left. Although eyewitness accounts differ as to the exact details, Peter Jenkins claims that Heseltine lost his cool and proclaimed &quot;I can no longer be a member of this Cabinet&quot;. Heseltine then walked out of Downing Street and announced his resignation to the assembled media.

Thatcher then adjourned the Cabinet for a brief break. George Younger was then offered and accepted the office of Secretary of State for Defence, which Heseltine had just relinquished. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office then requested Malcolm Rifkind to take up Younger&#x27;s previous job, Secretary of State for Scotland, which he accepted. Cabinet then resumed.

At 4 pm that day at the Ministry of Defence (rather than waiting to make a statement to the House of Commons when it resumed four days later) Heseltine delivered a 3,000 word, 22 minute resignation statement detailing his grievances. He blamed Thatcher&#x27;s intransigence, saying his views were ignored. He may well have prepared this earlier, although his private secretary Richard Mottram says not. To Thatcher&#x27;s fury Defence officials had helped him throughout the crisis and in preparing this document. Thatcher sent a letter to Heseltine, as is customary on these occasions.

==Brittan resigns; Thatcher survives==
On 13 January, Thatcher held a meeting with Whitelaw, Brittan, Younger and John Wakeham to decide what should then happen. The conclusion was that Brittan, rather than the Prime Minister, should reply to Heseltine&#x27;s statement on that day.

In his resignation statement in the House of Commons Heseltine accused Brittan of pressuring Sir Raymond Lygo, CEO of British Aerospace, to withdraw from the European Consortium. In response to questions in the House from Heseltine Brittan denied that he had received a letter from Lygo, but later had to admit that he had received a letter from Sir Austin Pearce, Chairman of British Aerospace; he had not disclosed it, he claimed, because it was marked &quot;Private and Strictly Confidential&quot;. He was forced to return to the House a few hours later to apologise.

On 15 January there was a debate on Westland in the Commons in which Thatcher replied to Neil Kinnock, the leader of the Labour Party. Thatcher listed all the ministerial, committee and Cabinet meetings on Westland. Heseltine then made a speech criticising the way collective responsibility had been damaged over Westland.

Sir Robert Armstrong, the Cabinet Secretary, held an inquiry into the leaking of Mayhew&#x27;s letter and reported his findings to the Prime Minister on 21 January. Armstrong concluded that Brittan had told Bowe to leak Mayhew&#x27;s letter through a telephone conversation to Roger Mogg, Brittan&#x27;s private secretary. Thatcher is said to have asked Brittan four times: &quot;Leon, why didn&#x27;t you tell me.&quot; Havers, who demanded the inquiry, later claimed: &quot;Unless the PM is the most marvellous actress I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life she was as shocked as anybody that in fact it was on Leon Brittan&#x27;s instructions.&quot; At the time Brittan claimed he had misunderstood Thatcher&#x27;s wishes but later (on the television programme &quot;The Thatcher Factor&quot; on 7 April 1989) admitted that he had acted on the &quot;express&quot; instructions of Charles Powell and Bernard Ingham, Thatcher&#x27;s two senior advisers. On 23 January, Thatcher had to make a speech to the Commons on Armstrong&#x27;s inquiry. The following day&#x27;s &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; described Thatcher&#x27;s speech as &quot;lackluster&quot;. Scottish Conservative MP and former Trade Minister, Alex Fletcher responded by saying that &quot;the integrity of the Cabinet&quot; was at stake and asked Thatcher if she thought her statement had &quot;enhanced the integrity of your Cabinet?&quot;, reportedly causing Mayhew and Havers, to wince. 

Brittan was being heavily criticised because of the fallout from the leak of the Mayhew letter and because of his lack of candour about the letter from British Aerospace, which critics characterised as misleading of parliament. A meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative back-benchers, held after Thatcher&#x27;s speech on 23 January, demanded Brittan&#x27;s resignation. At the meeting 12 out of 18 speakers called for Brittan to go, with only one MP, Jonathan Aitken, speaking in his defence. On 24 January therefore Brittan resigned because &quot;it has become clear to me that I no longer command the full confidence of my colleagues&quot;.

On 27 January, Labour set down an adjournment motion. Whitelaw, Howe, Wakeham, John Biffen and Douglas Hurd helped Thatcher draft her speech for this occasion. Ronald Millar, one of the Prime Minister&#x27;s friends, was asked to help revise the speech and Thatcher remarked to him that she might not be Prime Minister by six o&#x27;clock that evening if things went badly.

Neil Kinnock, the leader of the Opposition, was generally thought to have made a poor opening speech. Alan Clark recorded in his diary: &quot;For a few seconds Kinnock had her cornered ... But then he had an attack of wind, gave her time to recover.&quot; Heseltine was frustrated at Kinnock&#x27;s failure to exploit the moment and claimed that Thatcher&#x27;s statement brought &quot;the politics of the matter to an end&quot; and that he would support the Government in the lobby.

Sikorsky then bought Westland, aided by mysterious prior purchases by mystery buyers, suspected by Cuckney and others, although without clear proof, of being an illegal concert party.

==Motivations of the actors==
Westland damaged Thatcher&#x27;s reputation for credibility and made her look anti-European for the first time. It has been suggested that Thatcher&#x27;s keenness on American control of Westland may have been linked to the Al-Yamamah arms deal, or that the US might have wanted Westland to sell Black Hawk helicopters to Saudi Arabia in circumvention of Congressional rules which prevented US arms sales to that country at the time.

Leon Brittan&#x27;s behaviour was thought in part to have been motivated by resentment at his demotion from Home Secretary to Trade and Industry Secretary in September 1985. However, he also thought Heseltine&#x27;s mooted European consortium to be monopolistic and anti-competitive.

Apart from his clash of personalities with Thatcher, it was thought that Heseltine, concerned at having to take responsibility for Defence cuts which had been put back until 1986, and worried that Thatcher was unlikely to promote him further, was looking for an excuse to resign. Resigning would put him in good stead to be elected party leader after, as seemed likely at the time, the Conservatives would lose the next election due by summer 1988 at the latest.

Heseltine retired to the back benches and spent nearly five years conducting an undeclared campaign for the party leadership. Although the Thatcher government recovered in the opinion polls and was re-elected in 1987 by a landslide, eventually Heseltine challenged her in November 1990, polling well enough to hasten her resignation.

<text>Gesine Lötzsch (; born 7 August 1961) is a German politician of the left-wing party &quot;Die Linke&quot; (&quot;The Left&quot;). In 2010, with Klaus Ernst, she was elected president of the party.

== Biography ==
Born at Berlin-Lichtenberg in what then was East Germany, Lötzsch joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1984 and continued a member of its successor parties: the &quot;SED-PDS&quot; (1989–1990), the PDS, (1990–2005), &quot;Die Linkspartei.PDS&quot; (2005–2007), and from 2007, &quot;Die Linke&quot;. In 2002, as a candidate of the Party of Democratic Socialism, Lötzsch was elected to the German parliament (the &quot;Bundestag&quot;) for the constituency Berlin-Lichtenberg, which she continues to represent today. For her first term, she and Petra Pau were the only PDS deputies in the chamber as the party failed to surpass the 5% electoral threshold. In the 2021 German federal elections her winning her constituency again proved pivotal as her party again failed to surpass the electoral threshold but gained representation proportional to its vote share due to having won three constituencies (in addition to hers Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick won by Gregor Gysi and Leipzig II won by Sören Pellmann).

Lötzsch has been criticized for suggesting that former employees of the &quot;Stasi&quot;, the secret police of the former East German state, should be allowed to serve in parliaments and governments. The leader of the Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens, Claudia Roth, claimed that Gesine Lötzsch wants to &quot;sweep the past under the carpet&quot;. Lötzsch&#x27;s local party group in Berlin-Lichtenberg has invited former Stasi employees and informers to speak on several occasions with her support: for instance, Erich Mielke&#x27;s immediate deputy, Werner Grossmann, was invited as a speaker. Green member of parliament Wolfgang Wieland criticized her for appearing as a speaker before a revisionist association, the (tr. the Community Initiative for the Protection of the Social Rights).

Gesine Lötzsch was married to Ronald Lötzsch (1931–2018), who in 2010 was revealed to have been an informer for the Stasi.
