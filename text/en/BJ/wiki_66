<text>Kebnekaise (; from Sami or , &quot;Cauldron Crest&quot;) is the highest mountain in Sweden. The Kebnekaise massif, which is part of the Scandinavian mountain range, has two main peaks. The glaciated southern peak used to be the highest at above sea level, but has shrunk by 24 meters during the last 50 years, making the northern icefree peak at the highest. Kebnekaise lies in Swedish Lapland, about north of the Arctic Circle and west of Kiruna near the Kungsleden hiking trail between Abisko and Hemavan.

==Geography==

The Kebnekaise massif lies within a range of the Scandinavian mountains that is bordered by the glacial valleys Ladtjovagge (Sami spelling Láddjuvággi), Tjäktjavagge (Čeakčavággi) and Vistasvagge (Visttasvággi). The highest points of the massif lie along the ridge (called &quot;Vargryggen&quot; in Swedish) that runs from the southern and northern summits to Kebnepakte (Giebmebákti) at . Other subsidiary peaks are Kebnetjåkka (Giebmečohkka), Vierranvárri, Tolpagorni , Guobircohkka , and Siŋŋibákti .

Of the two highest points, the southern peak lies on a glacier situated on a rocky plateau. The glacier has shrunk in recent years, and therefore the summit is not as high as earlier. The top was traditionally said to be , and higher in the oldest measurement, i.e. . If the melting continues at the same rate, the south peak will sink below the north peak (which is the highest &quot;fixed&quot; point in Sweden) within a few years&#x27; time. However, as of July 2015, Tarfala Research Station reports that the glacier has grown by — from its lowest measurement of the previous year.

The massif is heavily glaciated, with Kebnepakteglaciären, Isfallsglaciären, and Storglaciären towards Tarfala Valley to the east, Björlings glaciär to the southeast, and Rabots glaciär to the west, plus several smaller glaciers throughout the area.

Permafrost is widely distributed in the Kebnekaise massif. This is supported by a 100 m deep drilling in bedrock in the Tarfala Valley at the foot of the Kebnekaise. The borehole above the Tarfala research station at an altitude of 1540 meters shows a year-round stable rock temperature of −2.75 °C at a depth of 100 m, which, according to the geothermal gradient indicates a permafrost thickness of about 330 meters. In consequence, the much higher Kebnekaise must show a permafrost thickness of several hundred meters.

In Europe there are no higher mountains further north. During clear weather, a vast area can be seen from the summit, according to some sources as much as 9% of Sweden.

==Climbing routes==
Kebnekaise mountain lodge (&quot;Kebnekaise fjällstation&quot;) is located to the southeast at the foot of Kebnekaise, about , 3–7 hours hike from the trailhead at Nikkaluokta (boat trip possible for 5 km). It is the starting point for an ascent of the south summit via the western route (&quot;västra leden&quot;, about , 5–7 hours to the summit) or the eastern route (&quot;östra leden&quot;, about , 3–5 hours to the summit). The western route leads over steep scree slopes and the intermediate peak Vierranvárri. Most of this route to the top is simple hiking, but there is a short exposed part that could possibly count as scrambling (YDS grade 2). The eastern route leads over glaciers and rocks and offers exposure (YDS grade 4). The steepest section is equipped with fixed steel cables for protection, similar to a via ferrata. There is also a third, less known route only marked with cairns — &quot;Durlings led&quot;, which branches off Kungsleden a few kilometers north of Singi, goes about two kilometers into Singivagge, and then turns north into the valley between Kuopertjåkka and Siŋŋibákti. &quot;Durlings led&quot; eventually merges with the western route at &quot;Kaffedalen&quot;, the pass between Vierranvárri and Kebnekaise. Advantages with this route are lack of exposure and a shorter ascent if Singivagge is used for an overnight camp. A fit hiker used in off track rock and scree walking can summit from the Kungsleden in good weather in about 6 hours up and 4–5 hours back down.

Just below the top plateau is an old smaller cabin at altitude. A large cabin used to stand below the plateau, near the smaller one, until September 2018, when it was demolished by the county administration due to being too worn. A cabin up on the plateau was opened in 2016 as a replacement.

The peak glacier is a small top, merely tens of meters high, on a rocky plateau. To approach the actual mountaintop on the glacier, crampons or other means of enhancing traction may be required, depending on snow conditions. The glacier should be walked upon with great caution; fatal accidents have occurred with people sliding off into the huge void on the eastern side. This danger might not always be apparent, even when there is good visibility.

Routes to the northern summit, including one via the narrow, icy arête from the southern summit, require mountaineering equipment and skills.

Due to the harsh subarctic climate at the location, Kebnekaise sees the vast majority of climbers during the summer months (late June to early September). However, Kebnekaise is also an established destination for winter alpinism and guided skiing tours are organised by the STF lodge&#x27;s guides.

==Climbing history==
The first recorded ascent to the summit was made on 22 August 1883 by an expedition led by Charles Rabot from France with the locals Jon Larsson, Hans Monsen and Peder Abrahamsson Lindgren. They started from the Skjomen fjord, Norway since the first railway in the region was built 1888. This was only published later. More media attention was given to the first Swedish expedition led by Johan Alfred Björling who summited on 9 July 1889.

The Kebnekaise mountain lodge was opened in 1908, starting more substantial tourism to the mountain.

The fastest ascent from the mountain lodge to the summit and back is 1:47:17 made on 9 July 2020 by Petter Engdahl. The fastest woman is Emelie Forsberg in 2:00:40 done on 7 July 2014.

==Norwegian military plane crash==
On 15 March 2012 a RNoAF Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules military aircraft crashed into the western snowy mountain side a short distance below the ridge that runs between the mountain&#x27;s two highest peaks. Five Norwegian officers were killed.

<doc id="367553" wikidata="Q1928579" url="?curid=367553" title="Michael McDowell (politician)">
<text>Michael McDowell (born 1 May 1951) is an Irish independent politician and barrister. Active in Irish politics since the 1980s, he currently serves in Seanad Éireann as a senator for the National University constituency.

A grandson of Irish revolutionary Eoin MacNeill, McDowell was educated at Gonzaga College and studied law at University College Dublin and King&#x27;s Inns. He began practicing as a barrister in 1974, becoming a senior counsel in 1987. Initially a member of Fine Gael, he co-founded the Progressive Democrats in the mid-1980s and was elected three times as a TD for the Dublin South-East constituency, serving in the 25th Dáil (1987–1989), the 27th Dáil (1992–1997), and the 29th Dáil (2002–2007). He served as Attorney General of Ireland from 1999 to 2002 and as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 2002 to 2007.

After Mary Harney resigned as leader of the Progressive Democrats in September 2006, McDowell became party leader and Tánaiste. He led the party into the 2007 general election, where it lost six of its eight seats in Dáil Éireann, including his own. McDowell resigned immediately as party leader—his brief tenure having made him the shortest-serving party leader in the history of the state—and left public life to resume his private legal career. The Progressive Democrats were formally dissolved in 2009. McDowell returned to politics as an independent in 2016 and was elected to Seanad Éireann, to which he was re-elected in 2020. He was regarded as instrumental in opposing the March 2024 constitutional referendums on Family and Care, both of which were comprehensively defeated.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, he was educated at the Jesuit school Gonzaga College, then at University College Dublin where he became auditor of the UCD Law Society. He later attended the King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin where he achieved the Barrister-at-Law degree in 1974. McDowell was a junior counsel on the legal team that defended the murderer Malcolm MacArthur in the notorious GUBU case. In 2002, McDowell excused himself from considering MacArthur&#x27;s parole report, to avoid any possible conflict of interest arising from this representation. He was appointed a senior counsel in 1987. He is the husband of UCD accountancy Professor Niamh Brennan and brother of UCD economics lecturer Moore McDowell.

==Political career==
He became involved in politics, initially as a member of Fine Gael. He contested the 1979 Dublin Corporation election, coming 5th in the 4-seat Area 10 (Mansion House/Pembroke).

When Desmond O&#x27;Malley was expelled from Fianna Fáil in 1985, McDowell immediately wrote to him in support, becoming a founding member of the Progressive Democrats (the PDs). McDowell was one of 14 PDs elected as TDs to the 25th Dáil at the 1987 general election, the first election after the party was founded. He was elected for the Dublin South-East constituency. He lost his seat at the 1989 general election but was made chairman of the party. McDowell regained his seat at the 1992 general election but lost it again at the 1997 general election. At various times, he served as a member of the Progressive Democrats front bench in roles as spokesman for foreign affairs, Northern Ireland and finance. In July 1999, while the PDs were in a coalition government with Fianna Fáil, McDowell was appointed Attorney General of Ireland, a position he held until 2002. In 2000, he proposed changing the name of the party to the Radical Party.

===Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform===
Following the 2002 general election, McDowell regained his Dáil seat. This was the first time McDowell combined winning a Dáil seat with his party&#x27;s entry into government. He was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He was a strong opponent of the policies of Sinn Féin and the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and often took a harder line than his coalition partners, Fianna Fáil. He was named as Politician of the Year for 2004 in the Magill magazine annual awards.

In 2005, he announced plans to introduce Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, although not in the same form as those in Britain. McDowell&#x27;s &quot;Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003&quot; prohibited cut-price drinks promotions and placed restrictions on alcohol advertising, as well as making it mandatory for under-21s to have proof of age when drinking in pubs. This law also banned under-18s from pubs after 9 p.m., a regulation that was highly unpopular and was later relaxed to 10pm during the summer months. In 2005, McDowell proposed to grant licences for &quot;café-bars&quot; which would have a limited capacity and serve meals as well as alcohol. It was hoped that this would combat binge drinking by introducing a more European &quot;café culture&quot;. This initiative was dropped owing to objections from publicans and members of his coalition partners, Fianna Fáil.

In 2004, he proposed a citizenship referendum to end the automatic right to Irish citizenship for those born on the island of Ireland. The referendum was passed with an 80% majority. The referendum was criticised by the some in the opposition, who accused McDowell of pandering to racist elements. He reformed the private security industry, regulating it for the first time under the Private Security Services Act 2004 and establishing the Private Security Authority.

McDowell launched far-reaching reforms of the Garda Síochána and introduced severe penalties (up to five years in jail) for Gardaí who leaked information under the &quot;Garda Síochána Act 2005&quot;, after the force was extensively criticised by the Morris and Barr Tribunals and he was embarrassed by high-profile leaks of his plans for the force to newspapers from high-level Gardaí. He also introduced a voluntary ancillary branch of the police force despite huge resistance from paid employees. McDowell&#x27;s &quot;Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005&quot; on telecommunications data retention compels service providers to store all telephone, SMS and internet records for three years and provide them to Gardaí on request. The Digital Rights Ireland campaign group has filed a suit against the government in the High Court claiming that this law is a breach of the constitutional right to privacy.

His &quot;Defamation Bill&quot; of 2006 proposed a radical reform of Irish defamation law, replacing the torts of libel and slander with one single offence of &quot;defamation&quot; and allowing the press to plead &quot;fair and reasonable publication&quot; as a defence in defamation cases. Related to the defamation reforms, McDowell also proposed a new privacy law which was heavily criticised by the newspaper industry. In 2006, he established the Balance in Criminal Law Review Group, and in 2007 oversaw the enactment of their recommendation to roll back the right to silence.

====Controversies====
As Justice Minister, McDowell attracted a good deal of controversy:

* McDowell authorised the purchase of a farm in north Fingal, at Thornton Hall, on behalf of the state, to build a proposed prison. However this was more expensive compared to the value of similar land close by, and several state organisations already had land closer to the city which might have been used for the same purpose.
* He sped up the deportation of failed asylum seekers, including one case in 2005 where a student, Kunle Eluhanla, was deported back to Nigeria while preparing for his Leaving Certificate examinations. After a public outcry led by Eluhanla&#x27;s classmates, McDowell allowed his return, but not that of others.
* In February 2005, he accused the Sinn Féin leaders Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris of being members of the Provisional IRA Army Council. The allegations were denied by Adams, McGuinness and Ferris.
* In 2004, McDowell called killings by gangs the &quot;sting of a dying wasp&quot;, intimating that gangland killings were coming to an end. However, there were a record number of gun killings in Ireland in 2006 (25 in total), including five murders in six days in December. McDowell has stated that &quot;soft&quot; judges are partly to blame for these killings for granting bail to gang suspects despite Garda objections. These statements have caused anger in the legal profession. One unnamed legal professional described McDowell&#x27;s statements as &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;bordering on impeachable&quot;. In an unprecedented protest, dozens of senior judges boycotted a 2006 Christmas reception given by McDowell. He has been openly criticised by retired judge Fergus Flood over McDowell&#x27;s remarks about the failure of judges to implement the law on bail and mandatory sentences for drug dealing. Flood said the judiciary must have the right to consider each individual case as appropriate and that McDowell should consider the context of his remarks before making statements.
* In May 2005, when addressing the Oireachtas Justice Committee, he made a number of comments insinuating that most asylum seekers were not legally entitled to stay in Ireland and regretting his inability to deport them forthwith because of &quot;due process&quot;.
* On 13 December 2005, using Dáil privilege, he claimed that Frank Connolly, an investigative journalist and a brother of one of the &#x27;Colombia Three&#x27;, had travelled to Colombia under a false passport. McDowell subsequently leaked the alleged faked passport application to a friend, the journalist Sam Smyth of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. McDowell was widely accused of abusing his power as Minister for Justice for political purposes, and prejudicing any potential police investigation. Although Connolly denied McDowell&#x27;s accusations, the controversy led to Irish American private donor Chuck Feeney withdrawing funding from the Centre for Public Inquiry, an investigative organisation which had published two reports embarrassing the government, of which Frank Connolly was the director, after McDowell met with him.
* On 20 March 2006, he apologised for calling the Opposition spokesperson on Finance, Richard Bruton, TD, &quot;the Joseph Goebbels of Irish political life&quot;. He had made these remarks after Bruton had highlighted to the Dáil that despite McDowell&#x27;s claims of increases in Garda personnel in 2005, only 6 extra gardaí had been added to the Dublin police force in that year. McDowell maintained that Bruton specifically chose to compare dates that did not accurately reflect a general increase in Garda numbers. He apologised for the remarks on the &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; radio programme on RTÉ the next day.
* In March 2006, he falsely claimed that Green Party &#x27;people&#x27; were responsible for vandalising Progressive Democrats headquarters. He later withdrew the comment, but then appeared to repeat it again.
* In May 2006, the Supreme Court of Ireland struck down the law on statutory rape as unconstitutional as it did not allow an individual accused to enter the defence of reasonable belief that the victim was of age. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision surprised the whole country, and in the aftermath, McDowell was widely criticised for failing to anticipate the decision.
* On 27 September 2006, he criticised the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern for accepting money from businessmen in 1993 and 1994, calling it unethical and an &quot;error of judgement&quot; and said that the money must be repaid with interest. The statement was greeted with derision by the Opposition, with Fine Gael claiming it was motivated by the Progressive Democrats determination to keep Fianna Fáil in power. Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte said the Progressive Democrats were now handcuffed to Fianna Fáil for the duration of this Dáil, and that there might as well be single-party Government.
*On 6 March 2007, McDowell apologised to the Dáil for omissions from an Act that he had enacted in 2006 on the protection of children from sex abusers in the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2007 in the Dáil, saying: &quot;The primary purpose of this short Bill is to remedy an error in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006. The particular point with which we are dealing was brought to my attention last week by Deputy Rabbitte, for which I thank him. It was a drafting error for which I am politically accountable and regretful.&quot;

===Party leadership===
In June 2006, McDowell was involved in a leadership dispute with party leader Mary Harney, over an alleged promise by Harney to step down in favour of him. The dispute appeared to have been resolved with Harney remaining as leader. On 7 September 2006, Mary Harney unexpectedly resigned as party leader and McDowell became the favourite to succeed her in the consequent leadership election.
Irish media reported on 10 September 2006 that Michael McDowell would be the sole nominee for party leadership, Liz O&#x27;Donnell would become Deputy Leader and that Tom Parlon would become Party President. On 11 September 2006 McDowell was confirmed as party leader and on 13 September 2006, he was appointed Tánaiste.

===2007 general election and resignation as party leader===

During the 2007 general election campaign, the Progressive Democrats erected posters bearing the slogan, &quot;Left wing government? No thanks&quot;. This was an echo of their 2002 election campaign when they issued posters bearing the slogan; &quot;One party government? No thanks&quot; which then targeted Fianna Fáil. In 2007 their target was the Green Party. While McDowell was unveiling the poster during a press briefing in Ranelagh which was the site of his telegraph pole climb in the 2002 election; constituency opponent John Gormley of the Green party turned up to confront McDowell on the issue of an accompanying pamphlet which made misleading claims about the Green party. The ensuing exchange between them was dubbed the &quot;Rumble in Ranelagh&quot; by the media. During the 2007 RTÉ Television election debate, McDowell remarked on the state of the opposition parties: &quot;I&#x27;m surrounded by the left, the hard-left and the left-overs.&quot;

Although he had a high-profile as party leader, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, McDowell&#x27;s vote dropped from 6,093 (18.8%) in the 2002 general election to 4,450 (13.2%) in the 2007 general election. He was beaten for the last seat in the Dublin South-East constituency by John Gormley by a margin of 304 votes. He was the first sitting Tánaiste to lose his seat, and his subsequent departure from politics makes him the &quot;shortest-serving political-party leader in the history of the State&quot;. He stated that his time as a public representative was over. On 25 May 2007, McDowell resigned as leader of the Progressive Democrats and announced that he was quitting politics, immediately and without consultation with his party colleagues, after losing his seat in the Dublin South-East constituency in the general election, while the party fell from eight seats to two.

The reaction of the press was divided:
&quot;That McDowell&#x27;s career in government as Tánaiste is over is partly of his own making as he courted controversy to such a fevered extent that he became the most unpopular political leader in the country.&quot;
&quot;McDowell&#x27;s reforms of the prison service, the Gardaí and immigration policy are a monument to his five years as Minister for Justice. &quot;

The then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Micheál Martin, said he was sad to learn of his cabinet colleague&#x27;s decision to resign. He said &quot;he will be a significant loss&quot; and called him a very formidable parliamentarian.

==Election to Seanad Éireann==
In 2016, McDowell stood for election to Seanad Éireann for the National University constituency. He was elected on the 26th count. He was re-elected to the Seanad in 2020.

=== 2024 constitutional referendums on Family and Care ===
McDowell opposed two proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland, the Thirty-ninth Amendment on the Family, which proposed to expand the constitutional definition of family to include durable relationships outside marriage, and the Fortieth Amendment on Care, which proposed to replace references to women&#x27;s &quot;life within the home&quot; and the constitutional obligation to &quot;endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home” with a new article on supporting care within the family.

Prior to the 2024 Irish constitutional referendums, McDowell formed an group of barristers, Lawyers for No, to voice concern about the potential legal consequences—in areas including family law, tax law, and succession rights—of the proposed amendments. The group also included Michael McNamara, Brenda Power, and Maria Steen. Despite having the political support of all major political parties, both proposed amendments were comprehensively rejected, respectively by 67.7 and 73.9 percent of voters. McDowell was regarded as having played an instrumental role in the outcome.

==Legal career==
After losing his Dáil seat, McDowell returned to work as a senior counsel. In addition, he receives annual pension payments of €60,388, which he donates to charity. He represented the Irish Recorded Music Association in their case to force Eircom and UPC to filter their customers&#x27; Internet access and in some cases cut off their access completely.

==Views==
On 21 July 2010 McDowell suggested at the McGill Summer School that The Twelfth - 12 July, celebrated by Northern Ireland Protestants in commemoration of the Battle of Aughrim (1691) and Battle of the Boyne (1690) should be a public holiday in Ireland. He writes a weekly column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

<text>Pleasley is a village and civil parish with parts in both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. It lies between Chesterfield and Mansfield, south east of Bolsover, Derbyshire, England and north west of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. The River Meden, which forms the county boundary in this area, runs through the village.

The bulk of the village is in the Derbyshire district of Bolsover, and constitutes a civil parish of the same name. The population of this civil parish at the 2011 Census was 2,305. The part in Nottinghamshire is in the district of Mansfield and is unparished. Pleasley is not mentioned in Domesday when it was part of Glapwell parish.

==Buildings==
The parish church of St. Michael is built of squared sandstone and is believed to originate from the 12th century, as it includes a 12th-century chancel arch and font. There are also features from the 13th and 14th century, and evidence of significant restoration in the 19th century, when it was re-roofed in Welsh slate. A new south window was fitted in the chancel at this time. The pulpit came from Derby Cathedral , and there is a second font, which carries the date 1662. The building is a grade II* listed structure. It is situated close to the River Meden which marks the county boundary and also the boundary of the ancient Sherwood Forest.

==Industry==

George Sitwell, ironmaster, mined iron locally and at Pleasley built a furnace, a forge and power saws in the seventeenth century.

Pleasley was a coal mining village for over 100 years. The Stanton Ironworks Company leased the mineral rights in 1872, and work on building the shaft for Pleasley Colliery began soon afterwards. Stanton&#x27;s continued to operate it until nationalisation in 1946, after which it was run by the National Coal Board until it closed in 1983, with some of the workforce transferring to nearby Shirebrook colliery from where the accessible remaining underground coal reserves were mined. The mine was partly demolished but during the demolition it was realised that the pit winding engines were the only pair of such engines left. The former mine is now a museum. The spoil heaps have been turned into a large nature reserve, complete with large ponds, cycle and walking tracks.

Pleasley, as a whole, spreads into two counties, with the old coal mine high above the old village centre and a series of very large old weaving mills below in the Vale being the historic main industries, together with farming.
Pleasley was served by two railway stations Pleasley East and Pleasley West. Both stations closed as well as the lines through them and the nearest active railway stations are now in Mansfield and Shirebrook.

== Education ==
Pleasley has two primary schools, one on the Nottinghamshire side of the village and one on the Derbyshire side.

=== Anthony Bek Primary School ===
Anthony Bek Primary School is located on the Derbyshire side of the village. First opened in 1899, the school is named after Antony Bek, a Bishop of Durham. The Bek family acquired half of the manor of Pleasley in 1280 and Anthony often returned during the crusades with Prince Edward. The school is situated on Rotherham Road, on the opposite side of the bypass to the village centre.

=== Farmilo Primary School ===
Farmilo Primary School is situated on the Nottinghamshire side of the village, close to the Radmanthwaite estate. Farmilo Primary School was originally situated on Chesterfield Road North where it was built in 1920, and is named for Councillor Farmilo who campaigned to have the school built. The school moved to its present location on Woburn Lane in the early 1970s. In 2017 the school took over the adjacent Sure Start centre and extended into it. 
==The localities of Pleasley==

The area of Pleasley itself consists of four distinct areas: Pleasley Village, Upper Pleasley, Pleasley Hill with the Radmanthwaite Estate and Pleasley Vale.
Pleasley Village is the oldest part at the lowest point where the River Meden flows through the valley with a dam and mill pond in the centre of the village. Some original buildings remain, built from local sandstone, noticeably around the old mill site, and the two pubs.

===Upper Pleasley===
Upper Pleasley is situated at the southern end of the village, and is today the area around Terrace Lane. Terrace Lane was initially surrounded by fields, and eventually served as the back entrance to Pleasley Colliery, which is still visible today. Between 1875–1899, two rows of terraced houses were built on what is now Old Terrace. These were built for workers at the colliery. Private bungalows were built along Terrace Lane, and in the 1920s, more pit houses were built on New Terrace, and along the top of Terrace Lane.

The terraced houses on Old Terrace were demolished in the 1970s, and the land stood empty for 30 years. In the early 2000s, this land was built on and a new estate was built, with two new cul-de-sacs being built, and new houses being built along Old Terrace. In 2009, the older houses on New Terrace were demolished, and the remaining houses renovated. New homes were built in the place of the demolished houses, following the existing road layout.

===Pleasley Hill===
Pleasley Hill is an area in Mansfield, adjacent to Pleasley. It once consisted of rows of derelict terraced houses running along the main A617 road leading from Glapwell and the Pleasley By-pass towards Mansfield.

These were the subject of lengthy debate in the area, and were demolished in 2013. In 2015, new houses were built on the land. A small amount of housing regeneration was created by seven derelict terraced homes on Hillmoor Street being sold by Mansfield District Council to a social enterprise group named &quot;TREES&quot; for just one pound. TREES (Training Regeneration Education Employment and Sustainability) – administered under Mansfield-based ex-servicemen&#x27;s charity &quot;Joint Forces Alliance Ltd&quot; – helps veterans to refurbish and ultimately live in the homes. The area is strictly part of Mansfield and prior to Mansfield Mayor Tony Egginton&#x27;s reorganisation of the Wards and ward boundaries in time for the 2011 elections, it had its own &#x27;Pleasley Hill&#x27; ward but afterwards the name became &quot;Bull Farm and Pleasley Hill&quot;.

====Pleasley By-pass Extension====

The Pleasley area is situated around the main A617 road. The Pleasley Hill section is a steep, old winding single-carriageway which was scheduled for an improvement scheme designated &quot;Pleasley By-pass Extension&quot;, a Nottinghamshire County Council initiative intended to link the A617 Chesterfield Road North and MARR junction to the existing Pleasley By-pass, a long-established dual-carriageway created by Derbyshire County Council which terminates on the Nottinghamshire side at the base of Pleasley Hill.

The intended extension situated on the Nottinghamshire side has never been scheduled, and remains as a &#x27;missing&#x27; section and bottleneck to the MARR route. Three proposals were mooted in 2004 with two alternate routes:

# A single carriageway upgrade of the existing Pleasley Hill route
# A single carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery
# A dual carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery.

Nottinghamshire County Council summarised the scheme as:&quot;Pleasley bypass extension has mixed impacts. It has clear economic benefits, and also will reduce accidents, pollution and noise along the existing route. However these are balanced by adverse effects along the new route, such as possible impact on wildlife and also a nearby primary school&quot;.
Mansfield District Council summarised the scheme as:&quot;As with the Rainworth Bypass this scheme will provide considerable environmental benefits and will be an important component in improving links between the District and the M1, via junction 29. Depending on finance being made available it is anticipated that construction of this proposal will commence after 2000/2001&quot;.

Despite extensive planning and preparation, the road scheme was abandoned by Government&#x27;s allocation of regional transport funding in 2009.

===Pleasley Vale===
Pleasley Vale is a deep, narrow valley, much of which is wooded, which has been formed by the River Meden cutting down through the underlying limestone escarpment. The Vale has been the location for industry since at least 1767, when two forges and a corn mill are known to have been operating, powered by the river. The forges were run by George Sitwell, and were called Nether and Upper forge. The engineered river channel made it a good site for further development, and a consortium of businessmen from Nottingham and drapers from Mansfield leased the vale and Pleasley Park in 1782, to construct water-powered cotton mills. The Upper Mill was built first, on the site of the previous corn mill, and was operational by 1785. The Lower Mill was completed seven years later at a cost of £1,190, and was much bigger. A manager&#x27;s house and a row of ten houses for the workers was also completed in 1792. The mills supplied cotton to the expanding East Midland hosiery industry. One of the original three businessmen was Henry Hollins, and by the early 18th century, the mills were run by William Hollins and Co. They were the first and one of the most successful cotton producers in the East Midlands.
The Hollins family managed the mills for many years, but from the 1830s were joined by the Pagets, who introduced steam power to the mills. Fire destroyed the Upper Mill on 25 December 1840, but it was rebuilt by 1844. The Lower Mill also burnt down, and was replaced in 1847. Newer equipment fitted as part of the rebuilding enabled the mills to stay competitive. William Hollins lived at Pleasley Vale, and oversaw the expansion of the community, with the construction of more houses for the workers, the provision of public facilities including a school, wash house, and a cooperative society, and attention to leisure activities by the establishing of a Mechanics Institute, a library and a cricket club. A company farm was also established. St Chad&#x27;s Chapel and the vicarage were commissioned by Charles Paget in 1876. The Chapel was opened in 1881, but was reputedly built in 1861 at Stuffynwood, Derbyshire, and later moved to its present site. It has a small bell turret at its western end, and a number of its features mimic thirteenth and fourteenth century styles. Internally, there is a brass memorial to Paget and his wife Helen Elizabeth.

From the 1890s, the mills produced Viyella, a mixture of cotton with Merino wool, which produces a soft fabric. A third mill (now called Mill 2) was built between the upper and lower mills in 1913. It was originally built as a combing shed, where the cotton fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, but became a mill in 1952 following the addition of a further two floors to the main building, and a three-storey extension on the side. The mills continued to flourish, employing 980 workers at the site in 1934. Transport of raw materials and finished product was provided by the Midland Railway, who opened their Tibshelf and Pleasley branch in 1883, primarily to serve Pleasley Colliery, which began production in 1878. The branch connected with other lines at Mansfield Woodhouse in the east and Alfreton in the west. Sidings and a warehouse were built below the lower mill. By 1938, the upper sidings had been built, which provided direct access to the Upper Mill and the combing shed. The railway and its sidings had both been dismantled by 1967.

The first workers houses were demolished in 1961, to be followed by the school, the baths and the Mechanics Institute. By 1987, production had moved abroad, and the mills closed. Bolsover District Council sought to buy the mill buildings in 1992, using compulsory purchase powers. They were to be converted for use as offices and by light industry. The Council obtained them for just £1.00, and secured over £1 million in funding for the first phase of restoration. The initial building tackled was the latest to be built, and Mill 2 provided of accommodation when it was completed in 1994. Phase 2 consisted of Mill 1 and the North Wing, which provided a further and was completed in 1997. Stage 3 was the refurbishment of Mill 3, which provided of space. By 1998, over £4 million had been spent of the work, and the mill buildings provided accommodation for 45 businesses employing 244 people.

<text>The Endangered Wolf Center is a non-profit wildlife facility in Eureka, Missouri, United States, near St. Louis that is dedicated to preserving and reintroducing to the wild critically endangered species of wolves. It is certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Visitors can tour the facility by making a reservation.

The center was founded in 1971 by renowned naturalist Marlin Perkins and his wife Carol, who saw that wolves around the world were in danger of becoming extinct. Its mission is to preserve and protect Mexican wolves, red wolves, and other wild canid species. Their purpose and passion is to carefully manage breeding, reintroduction and inspiring education programs. Animals born at the facility have been reintroduced to North Carolina (red wolves) and Arizona and New Mexico (Mexican wolves). The center&#x27;s research focuses on reproductive, behavioral, and nutritional needs for the species housed there. The Endangered Wolf Center is a founding member of the AZA&#x27;s Mexican Wolf and Red Wolf Species Survival Plans. As of August 2016, the center had six species of endangered canids: Mexican wolves, red wolves, maned wolves, African painted dogs, fennec foxes, and swift foxes. It had more than 20 Mexican gray wolves, more than any other managed breeding facility. (Only 97 Mexican wolves were known to exist in the wild as of 2015.) The center serves as the cornerstone of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s program to preserve Mexican wolves and reintroduce them to the wild.

The center offers daytime tours and evening wolf howls. Reservations are required.

The Endangered Wolf Center is an independent 501c(3) non-profit and receives no federal or state support. Its programs are supported solely by members, donors and visitors. The center is on the grounds of Washington University in St. Louis&#x27; Tyson Research Center. It is located off Interstate 44, west of Interstate 270 and about southwest of St. Louis. The Endangered Wolf Center was originally named the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center.

<text>Roy Wood (born 8 November 1947) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. He was particularly successful in the 1960s and 1970s as member and co-founder of the Move, Electric Light Orchestra and Wizzard.

Wood formed the Move in 1965, and had hits including &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;. While the Move were still together, Wood, along with his band colleagues Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan, founded Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), which was later to gain major commercial success. After increasing tensions, Wood left ELO in 1972 and formed a new group, Wizzard, who had seven hits, including Wood&#x27;s most regularly broadcast song, &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day&quot;.

As a songwriter, Wood contributed a number of hits to the repertoire of the Move, ELO and Wizzard. Altogether, he had more than 20 singles in the UK Singles Chart under various guises, including three UK No. 1 hits. Wood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 as a member of Electric Light Orchestra.

==Career==
===Early years===
Roy Wood was born on 8 November 1947 in Kitts Green, a suburb of Birmingham, England. For some years the legend persisted that his real name was Ulysses Adrian Wood, until it was revealed that this was probably the result of somebody close to the Move in their early days filling in such names on a &#x27;lifelines&#x27; feature for the press as a joke. His first group in Birmingham in the early 1960s was the Falcons, which he left in 1963 to join Gerry Levene and the Avengers. He then moved to Mike Sheridan and the Nightriders (the band later became the Idle Race). He attended the Moseley College of Art, but was expelled in 1964.

===The Move===

The Move was formed from other Birmingham-based groups, and quickly entered the UK Singles Chart. Their single &quot;Night of Fear&quot; climbed to No. 2 in early 1967. Their third hit, &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;, was the first song played by Tony Blackburn at the launch of BBC Radio 1 on September 30, 1967, and the band evolved over a three-year period. After the departure of the Move&#x27;s lead singer Carl Wayne, Wood&#x27;s influence became more prominent. In 1967, Wood (and fellow Move member Trevor Burton) sang backing vocals on the track &quot;You Got Me Floatin, on the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s album &quot;&quot;.

Wood was keen on musical experimentation, and was an early proponent of combining rock and roll and pop music with other styles, such as classical music, or the big band sound, and introduced classically styled string and brass sections into the pop record. In early 1972, Wood&#x27;s composition &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; was shortlisted by the BBC as one of six possible choices for the UK entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1972. When performed by the New Seekers on the Cliff Richard vehicle &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard!&quot;, the song finished in last place with 3,842 votes. The group included the track on their album &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;. Wood recorded his own version of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;, releasing it on the B-side of his 1973 single, &quot;Dear Elaine&quot;.

===Electric Light Orchestra===
While the Move were still together, Wood, along with his band colleagues Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan, founded Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), which was later to gain major commercial success. The original intention was to split up the Move at the end of 1970, but contractual obligations meant that both they and ELO existed together for a year, until the former finally broke up in June 1972.

In 2017, the ELO line-up of Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, and Richard Tandy were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===Early ELO concerts and formation of Wizzard===
ELO&#x27;s early live performances were chaotic, due to both poor sound quality of the string instruments competing against the guitars and drums, as well as Wood&#x27;s constant moving from instrument to instrument during the shows (playing bass, guitar, cello and saxophone). After increasing tensions, Wood left in July 1972 at the start of the second album sessions, following a trip to Italy. He formed a new group, Wizzard, which assembled cellists, brass players and a bigger rhythm section, with several drummers and percussionists. Wood emulated the wall of sound production style of Phil Spector while successfully and affectionately pastiching the rock and roll style of the early 1960s. Wizzard had seven UK Singles Chart hits with different songs during this period including two consecutive singles, &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot; and &quot;Angel Fingers&quot; which reached the top of that chart. Meanwhile, he released several solo albums, exploring further musical directions. His 1973 album &quot;Boulders&quot; was an almost entirely solo effort, right down to the sleeve artwork, with Wood playing a wide variety of musical instruments. A second solo album, &quot;Mustard&quot;, released in 1975 and including contributions by Phil Everly and Annie Haslam, was less successful.
===Post-Wizzard===
By the late 1970s, Wood was appearing less in public; commercial success faded away, and his musical experiments did not always match popular taste, but he remained productive in the studio as musician, producer and songwriter. He was a fan of Elvis Presley, but never succeeded in getting him to adopt one of his compositions. He was untiring as a producer for other acts, most successfully doo-wop revivalists Darts. In 1976, Wood recorded the Beatles songs &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; for the ill-fated musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

===The Wizzo Band and subsequent work===
In 1977, he formed Wizzo Band, a jazz-rock ensemble, whose only live performance was a BBC simultaneous television and radio broadcast in stereo. The Wizzo Band split early the following year after cancelling a nationwide tour.

Between 1980 and 1982, Wood released a few singles under his own name and also as Roy Wood&#x27;s Helicopters, and played some live dates under this name, with a band comprising Robin George (guitar), Terry Rowley (keyboards), Jon Camp (bass) and Tom Farnell (drums). The release of what would have been the last of these singles, &quot;Aerial Pictures&quot;, backed with &quot;Airborne&quot;, was cancelled owing to the lack of chart success for its predecessors, but both sides appeared for the first time in 2006 on a compilation CD, &quot;Roy Wood – The Wizzard!&quot;. &quot;Aerial Pictures&quot;, using the original backing track, subsequently became a solo single for Carl Wayne, the Move&#x27;s former vocalist.

Wood also made a one-off rock and roll single with Phil Lynott, Chas Hodges and John Coghlan, credited to The Rockers, &quot;We Are The Boys&quot; (1983), and played a leading role in the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986, on 15 March 1986, which was later partly televised by the BBC. As well as designing the logo, Wood performed in a line-up which also included the Electric Light Orchestra and the Moody Blues.

After a hiatus following the release of the album &quot;Starting Up&quot; (1987), a cover version of the Len Barry hit &quot;1–2–3&quot;, and a guest vocal appearance on one track on Rick Wakeman&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, he went on the road with a band billed as Roy Wood&#x27;s Army. He also wrote and recorded two tracks with Lynne in 1989 (&quot;If You Can&#x27;t Get What You Want&quot; and &quot;Me and You&quot;), which were never released.

His most regularly broadcast song is the seasonal Wizzard single &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;, which remains one of the most played Christmas songs in the UK. In 1995, Wood released a new live version as the &#x27;Roy Wood Big Band&#x27;, which charted at No. 59, and in 2000 he joined forces with Mike Batt and the Wombles, for a re-working of &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; and the Wombles&#x27; hit &quot;Wombling Merry Christmas&quot;, together in one song which reached No. 22. Over Christmas 2007, Wood appeared in a catalogue advertisement for Argos, where he played the part of a rowdy neighbour playing guitar along to Wizzard&#x27;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;, and the song once again entered the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 16. In the 2010 Christmas special of the ITV comedy &quot;Benidorm&quot;, Wood in a cameo role performed his Christmas hit at the Benidorm Palace cabaret theatre. He later performed with Wizzard on the Christmas edition of &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; in December 2013.

Wood formed the Roy Wood Rock &amp; Roll Band for occasional live dates and television performances in the UK. They were the support act for Status Quo at several UK dates in the weeks leading up to Christmas 2009 and 2011. In December 2018, Wood and his band&#x27;s touring equipment worth £100,000 was stolen following a ram-raid on a warehouse in Leeds. The police later recovered the van and equipment in East Ardsley.

==Personal life==
Wood currently lives in South Derbyshire. He voted to leave the European Union in the 23 June 2016 referendum, and in May 2019 joined the Brexit Party. Beforehand, he was a longtime member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and expressed interest in standing as a candidate for the party in 2004. Wood has one daughter, named Holly.

Wood was engaged to Annie Haslam for four years, which she later described as &quot;four of the funniest years of my life&quot;, prior to her own marriage in 1991.

==Legacy==
The BBC described Wood in 2008 as being &quot;responsible for some of the most memorable sounds of the Seventies&quot; and &quot;credited as playing a major role in the glam rock, psychedelic and prog rock movements&quot;. In 2008, Wood was awarded an honorary doctorate for his contribution to rock and pop by the University of Derby. In 2015, his long and eclectic career was recognised with the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; award at the Progressive Music Awards in London.

Wood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 as a member of Electric Light Orchestra.

<text>John Gould (; 14 September 1804 – 3 February 1881) was an English ornithologist who published monographs on birds, illustrated by plates produced by his wife, Elizabeth Gould, and several other artists, including Edward Lear, Henry Constantine Richter, Joseph Wolf and William Matthew Hart. Because of his 1840s seven-volume series &quot;The Birds of Australia&quot; and its updates he has been considered the father of bird study in Australia, and the Gould League in Australia is named after him. His identification of the birds now nicknamed &quot;Darwin&#x27;s finches&quot; played a role in the inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection. Gould&#x27;s work is referenced in Charles Darwin&#x27;s book, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

== Early life ==
John Gould was born in Lyme Regis, the first son of a gardener. Both father and son probably had little education. After working on Dowager Lady Poulett&#x27;s glass house, his father obtained a position on an estate near Guildford, Surrey. In 1818, Gould Snr became foreman in the Royal Gardens of Windsor. Gould became an apprentice for 6 years under the care of J. T. Aiton, of the Royal Gardens of Windsor from the age of 14 to 20 years old. The young Gould started training as a gardener. Employed under his father at Windsor from 1818 to 1824, he was then a gardener at Ripley Castle in Yorkshire. He became an expert in the art of taxidermy. In 1824 he set himself up in business in London as a taxidermist. His skill helped him to become the first curator and preserver at the museum of the Zoological Society of London in 1827.

== Research and works published ==
Gould&#x27;s position brought him into contact with the country&#x27;s leading naturalists. This meant that he was often the first to see new collections of birds given to the Zoological Society of London. In 1830 a collection of birds arrived from the Himalayas, many not previously described. Gould published these birds in &quot;A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains&quot; (1830–1832). The text was by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and the illustrations were drawn and lithographed by Gould&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Coxen Gould. Most of Gould&#x27;s work were rough sketches on paper from which other artists created the lithographic plates.

This work was followed by four more in the next seven years, including &quot;Birds of Europe&quot; in five volumes. It was completed in 1837; Gould wrote the text, and his clerk, Edwin Prince, did the editing. The plates were drawn and lithographed by Elizabeth Coxen Gould. A few of the illustrations were made by Edward Lear as part of his &quot;Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae&quot; in 1832. Lear, however, was in financial difficulty, and he sold the entire set of lithographs to Gould. The books were published in a very large size, imperial folio, with magnificent coloured plates. Eventually 41 of these volumes were published, with about 3000 plates. They appeared in parts at £3 3s. a number, subscribed for in advance, and in spite of the heavy expense of preparing the plates, Gould succeeded in making his ventures pay, realising a fortune. This was a busy period for Gould who also published &quot;Icones Avium&quot; in two parts containing 18 leaves of bird studies on 54 cm plates as a supplement to his previous works. No further monographs were published as in 1838 he and his wife moved to Australia to work on the &quot;Birds of Australia&quot;. Shortly after their return to England, his wife died in 1841. Elizabeth Gould completed 84 plates for &quot;Birds of Australia&quot; before her death.

== Work with Darwin ==

When Charles Darwin presented his mammal and bird specimens collected during the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; to the Zoological Society of London on 4 January 1837, the bird specimens were given to Gould for identification. He set aside his paying work and at the next meeting on 10 January reported that birds from the Galápagos Islands which Darwin had thought were blackbirds, &quot;gross-bills&quot; and finches were in fact &quot;a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar&quot; as to form &quot;an entirely new group, containing 12 species.&quot; This story made the newspapers. In March, Darwin met Gould again, learning that his Galápagos &quot;wren&quot; was another species of finch and the mockingbirds he had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties, with relatives on the South American mainland. Subsequently, Gould advised that the smaller southern Rhea specimen that had been rescued from a Christmas dinner was a separate species which he named &quot;Rhea darwinii&quot;, whose territory overlapped with the northern rheas. Darwin had not bothered to label his finches by island, but others on the expedition had taken more care. He now sought specimens collected by captain Robert FitzRoy and crewmen. From them he was able to establish that the species were unique to islands, an important step on the inception of his theory of evolution by natural selection. Gould&#x27;s work on the birds was published between 1838 and 1842 in five numbers as Part 3 of &quot;Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle&quot;, edited by Charles Darwin. Elizabeth Gould illustrated all the plates for Part 3.

== Research in Australia ==
In 1838 the Goulds sailed to Australia, intending to study the birds of that country and be the first to produce a major work on the subject. They took with them the collector John Gilbert. They arrived in Tasmania in September, making the acquaintance of the governor Sir John Franklin and his wife. Gould and Gilbert collected on the island. In February 1839 Gould sailed to Sydney, leaving his pregnant wife with the Franklins. He travelled to his brother-in-law&#x27;s station at Yarrundi, spending his time searching for bowerbirds in the Liverpool Range. In April he returned to Tasmania for the birth of his son. In May he sailed to Adelaide to meet Charles Sturt, who was preparing to lead an expedition to the Murray River. Gould collected in the Mount Lofty range, the Murray Scrubs and Kangaroo Island, returning again to Hobart in July. He then travelled with his wife to Yarrundi. They returned home to England in May 1840.

The result of the trip was &quot;The Birds of Australia&quot; (1840–48), a seven volume work which is the first comprehensive illustrated account of Australian birds. It included a total of 600 plates in seven volumes; 328 of the species described were new to science and named by Gould. He also published &quot;A Monograph of the Macropodidae, or Family of Kangaroos&quot; (1841–1842) and the three-volume work &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot; (1849–1861).

Elizabeth died in 1841 after the birth of their eighth child, Sarah, and Gould&#x27;s books subsequently used illustrations by a number of artists, including Henry Constantine Richter, William Matthew Hart and Joseph Wolf.

Even after leaving Australia, John Gould corresponded with many scientists and collectors in the colonies, including Frederick McCoy, who was the director of the National Museum of Victoria from 1857 to 1899. These letters detail the sale of specimens, including mammals, insects, shells, and bird skins for the museum&#x27;s collections, and copies of Gould&#x27;s scientific publications for the museum library. Gould insisted that any species of birds that were at that time new to Western science be forwarded to him in London to be described and figured.

== Hummingbirds==
Throughout his professional life, Gould had a strong interest in hummingbirds. He accumulated a collection of 320 species, which he exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Despite his interest, Gould had never seen a live hummingbird. In May 1857, he travelled to the United States with his second son, Charles. He arrived in New York too early in the season to see hummingbirds in that city, but on 21 May 1857, in Bartram&#x27;s Gardens in Philadelphia, he finally saw his first live one, a ruby-throated hummingbird. He then continued to Washington D.C. where he saw large numbers in the gardens of the Capitol. Gould attempted to return to England with live specimens, but, as he was not aware of the conditions necessary to keep them, they only lived for two months at most.

== &quot;Birds of Great Britain&quot; ==

The University of Glasgow, which owns a copy of &quot;Birds of Great Britain&quot;, describes John Gould as &quot;the greatest figure in bird illustration after Audubon. Gould was not directly responsible for the illustrations himself, although he supervised their production closely.&quot; London booksellers Henry Sotheran Ltd describe the work as &quot;Gould&#x27;s pride and joy&quot;.

Gould had already published some of the illustrations in &quot;Birds of Europe&quot;, but &quot;Birds of Great Britain&quot; represents a development of an aesthetic style in which illustrations of nests and young are added on a large scale.

Sotheran&#x27;s reports that Gould published the book himself, producing 750 copies, which remain sought after both as complete volumes, and as individual plates, currently varying in price from £450 – £850. The University of Glasgow records that the volumes were issued in London in 25 parts, to make the complete set, between 1863 and 1873, and each set contained 367 coloured lithographs.

Gould undertook an ornithological tour of Scandinavia in 1856, in preparation for the work, taking with him the artist Henry Wolf who drew 57 of the plates from Gould&#x27;s preparatory sketches. According to The University of Glasgow Gould&#x27;s skill was in rapidly producing rough sketches from nature (a majority of the sketches were drawn from newly killed specimens) capturing the distinctiveness of each species. Gould then oversaw the process whereby his artists worked his sketches up into the finished drawings, which were made into coloured lithographs by engraver William Hart.

There were problems: the stone engraving of the snowy owl in volume I was dropped and broken at an early stage in the printing. Later issues of this plate show evidence of this damage and consequently the early issue – printed before the accident – are considered more desirable.

The lithographs were hand coloured. In the introduction for the work, Gould states &quot;every sky with its varied tints and every feather of each bird were coloured by hand; and when it is considered that nearly two hundred and eighty thousand illustrations in the present work have been so treated, it will most likely cause some astonishment to those who give the subject a thought.&quot;

The work has gathered critical acclaim: according to Mullens and Swann, &quot;Birds of Great Britain&quot; is &quot;the most sumptuous and costly of British bird books&quot;, whilst Wood describes it as &quot;a magnificent work&quot;. Isabella Tree writes that it &quot;was seen – perhaps partly because its subject was British, as the culmination of [his] ... genius&quot;.

==Tributes==
A number of animals have been named after Gould, including those in English such as the Gould&#x27;s mouse.

Birds named by or after Gould include:
*Gould&#x27;s petrel (&quot;Pterodroma leucoptera&quot;) 
*Gould&#x27;s shortwing (&quot;Brachypteryx stellata&quot;) 
*Gould&#x27;s frogmouth (&quot;Batrachostomus stellatus&quot;)
*Gould&#x27;s jewelfront (&quot;Heliodoxa aurescens&quot;)
*Gould&#x27;s inca (&quot;Coeligena inca&quot;) 
*Gould&#x27;s toucanet (&quot;Selenidera gouldii)&quot; 
*Dot-eared coquette (&quot;Lophornis gouldii)&quot;
*Olive-backed euphonia (&quot;Euphonia gouldi)&quot;

Two species of reptiles are named in his honour: Gould&#x27;s monitor (&quot;Varanus gouldii)&quot; and Gould&#x27;s hooded snake (&quot;Parasuta gouldii)&quot;.

The Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (&quot;Astacopsis gouldi)&quot; was named after Gould&#x27;s son Charles.

Gould&#x27;s sunbird, or Mrs. Gould&#x27;s sunbird, (&quot;Aethopyga gouldiae&quot;) and the Gouldian finch (&quot;Erythrura gouldiae&quot;) were named after his wife.

A visit to Gould in his old age provided the inspiration for John Everett Millais&#x27;s painting &quot;The Ruling Passion&quot;.

The Gould League, founded in Australia in 1909, was named after him. This organisation gave many Australians their first introduction to birds, along with more general environmental and ecological education. One of its major sponsors was the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.

In 1976, he was honoured on a postage stamp, bearing his portrait, issued by Australia Post. In 2009, a series of birds from his &quot;Birds of Australia,&quot; with paintings by H. C. Richter, were featured in another set of stamps.

== Family ==
Gould married the painter Elizabeth Coxen (18 July 1804 – 15 August 1841) on 5 January 1829.
They had at least three sons, (John) Henry Gould (1829–1855) and Franklin Gould (1839–1873) dying before him.
Their youngest son, Charles Gould, was a geological surveyor.
They also had at least three daughters, although only the names of two are known, Eliza (born c. 1832) and Sarah Gould (born 1841).
Elizabeth Gould died from puerperal fever after giving birth to Sarah, her eighth child.

<text>Dennis Edward Skinner (born 11 February 1932) is a British former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolsover for 49 years, from 1970 to 2019. A member of the Labour Party, he is known for his left-wing views and republican sentiments. Before entering Parliament, he worked for more than 20 years as a coal miner.

Nicknamed the &quot;Beast of Bolsover&quot;, Skinner belonged to the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs. He was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, with brief breaks, for 30 years, and was the committee&#x27;s chairman from 1988 to 1989. He was one of the longest serving members of the House of Commons and the longest continuously serving Labour MP. A lifelong Eurosceptic, Skinner voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. Skinner lost his seat to Mark Fletcher of the Conservative Party, and was succeeded as the Labour candidate for Bolsover by Natalie Fleet.

During his parliamentary career, Skinner was suspended from Parliament on at least ten occasions, usually for using unparliamentary language when attacking opponents. He was also known for regularly heckling upon the arrival of Black Rod in the House of Commons chamber during the State Opening of Parliament. During most of his tenure in the Commons (in the years when the Labour Party were in opposition), Skinner would usually sit on the first seat of the front bench below the gangway in the Commons in a tweed jacket and signature red tie. During the New Labour government from 1997 to 2010, Skinner sat in the equivalent spot on the government benches.

==Early life and career==
Born in Clay Cross, Derbyshire, Skinner is the third of nine children. His father Edward Skinner was a coal miner who was sacked after the 1926 general strike, and his mother Lucy was a cleaner. In June 1942, at the age of 10, Skinner won a scholarship to attend Tupton Hall Grammar School after passing the eleven-plus a year early. In 1949, he went on to work as a coal miner at Parkhouse colliery, working there until its closure in 1962. He then worked at Glapwell colliery near Bolsover. In 1956 Skinner entered the Sheffield Star Walk, an amateur walking race, and finished second.

In 1966, Skinner became the youngest-ever president of the Derbyshire region of the National Union of Mineworkers. After working for 20 years as a miner, he became a member of Derbyshire County Council and a Clay Cross councillor in the 1960s. As chairman of the Clay Cross Council, Skinner was noted for his decision not to wear the traditional council dress and gold chain: &quot;My conscience would not permit me to wear it, because I believe... all the pomp and ceremony attached to local government [and] Parliament is outdated and a waste of time&quot;. In 1967, he attended Ruskin College, after completing a course run by the National Union of Mineworkers at the University of Sheffield. Skinner resigned from the colliery and the Derbyshire Miners&#x27; Union shortly after his election to parliament in June 1970.

==Parliamentary career (1970–2019)==

In 1956, Skinner joined the Labour Party. He was chosen as Parliamentary Prospective candidate for Bolsover on 5 June 1969. Skinner was elected as MP for the then safe Labour seat of Bolsover at the 1970 general election, succeeding Harold Neal. He retained the seat for 49 years (receiving his highest vote share in 1970, whilst achieving his highest majority at the 1997 general election), until he lost it at the 2019 general election to Mark Fletcher of the Conservative Party.

Due to his aggressive rhetoric, Skinner became known as the &quot;Beast of Bolsover&quot;. Skinner recalls that he earned the nickname for his behaviour in a tribute debate in the Commons following the death of former Conservative Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden in 1977: &quot;They were making speeches about the wonder of Anthony Eden, so I got up and talked about miners and people seriously injured and dead in the pits and the £200 given to the widow. There was booing and then all the Tories left and the papers had a go, some serious ones&quot;.

During most of his tenure in the Commons (in the years where the Labour Party were in opposition), Skinner would usually sit on the first seat of the front bench below the gangway in the Commons (known as the &quot;Awkward Squad Bench&quot; because it is where rebel Labour Party MPs have traditionally sat) in a tweed jacket (whilst most other MPs wear suits) and signature red tie. During the New Labour government from 1997 to 2010, Skinner sat in the equivalent spot on the government benches.

In 1979, Skinner played a role in publicly exposing Anthony Blunt as a spy for the Soviet Union. On 15 November 1979, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher revealed Blunt&#x27;s wartime role in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in reply to questions put to her by Ted Leadbitter, the MP for Hartlepool, and Skinner. Thatcher made a full statement to the Commons on the matter the following week:Mr. Leadbitter and Mr. Skinner: asked the Prime Minister if she will make a statement on recent evidence concerning the actions of an individual, whose name has been supplied to her, in relation to the security of the United Kingdom.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: The name which the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter) has given me is that of Sir Anthony Blunt.

On 7 June 1985, Skinner talked out a bill by Enoch Powell which would have banned stem cell research by moving the writ for the by-election in Brecon and Radnor; Skinner later described this as his proudest political moment. On 20 January 1989, he talked out a move to reduce the number of weeks at which an abortion could be legally performed in Britain by moving the writ for the Richmond by-election.

In 2003, Skinner was among the quarter of Labour MPs who voted against the Iraq War; he later rebelled against the party line when he voted against government policy to allow terror suspects to be detained without trial for up to 90 days. In 2007, Skinner and 88 other Labour MPs voted against the Labour Government&#x27;s policy of renewing the Trident Nuclear Missile System.

In January 2012, Skinner was referred to as &quot;a dinosaur&quot; in a controversial jibe by David Cameron, who said &quot;I often say to my children &#x27;No need to go to the Natural History Museum to see a dinosaur, come to the House of Commons at about half past twelve&#x27;&quot;. Cameron received criticism for the remark, and was accused of ageism. Labour MPs complained at the time that Cameron&#x27;s words amounted to &quot;a gratuitous and entirely offensive insult to a greatly respected honourable Member, made entirely because of his age.&quot; House Speaker John Bercow replied at the time: &quot;I&#x27;m always in favour of humour but just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, humour is a matter of subjective judgment. Sometimes people are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny deliberately when they are not. Sometimes they don&#x27;t realise they are funny when they are.&quot; In July 2015, Cameron referenced the dinosaur remark in another jibe in which he said &quot;It&#x27;s always very good to see the Labour Party in full voice, cheering on &#x27;Jurassic Park&#x27;. I would stick to the movie&quot;&quot;.&quot;

In May 2014, Skinner was the principal guest speaker at the Kent Miners Rally at the Aylesham &amp; District Social Club to commemorate 30 years since the 1984–1985 United Kingdom miners&#x27; strike.

Following the retirement of Peter Tapsell in 2015, Skinner was one of the four longest-serving MPs, but did not become Father of the House, as two other MPs, who were also first elected in 1970, had been sworn in earlier on the same day and consecutively both held that position: Gerald Kaufman (2015–2017) and Kenneth Clarke (2017–2019). Skinner, the oldest sitting MP since the death of Kaufman in 2017, stated that in any case he would not accept the honorific title. In 2019, with Clarke&#x27;s impending retirement, the issue of Skinner becoming Father of the House resurfaced, but was rendered moot when Skinner lost his seat at the 2019 general election to Mark Fletcher of the Conservative Party.

In 2017, upon Kaufman&#x27;s death, 85-year-old Skinner became the oldest member of the House of Commons. When Skinner was first elected Bolsover was one of the safest Labour seats in the country, when the town still had a large mining community, but over the following half century with socioeconomic changes in the constituency Skinner&#x27;s vote share dropped from 77% in 1970, still holding a high vote share of 65% in 2005, to only 36% in 2019, with the result that he lost the seat to the Conservatives by a margin of 11%. He was succeeded as the Labour candidate for Bolsover by Natalie Fleet, who became MP for the seat in the 2024 general election.

===Views===
Skinner was a strong supporter of the National Union of Mineworkers and their leader Arthur Scargill in the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. Skinner refused to accept a parliamentary salary in excess of miners&#x27; wages, and during the miners&#x27; strike he donated his wages to the NUM.

Skinner voted for equalisation of the age of consent, civil partnerships, adoption rights for same-sex couples, to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and for same-sex couples to marry, and has a strongly pro-choice stance on abortion.

Following the sudden death of John Smith in 1994, Skinner was among the MPs to pay tribute to him, saying that despite coming from a different wing of the Labour Party, he and Smith &quot;never had words in anger&quot;, and said that he would have become Prime Minister and praised Smith for &quot;dragging the Labour Party from the depths of despair to the pinnacles of power.&quot; Skinner concluded his tribute by saying that the best tribute to Smith would be to pass the Disabled Person&#x27;s Act in his memory.

In 2000, Skinner denounced former ally Ken Livingstone, then serving as a Labour MP. Livingstone had failed to win the party&#x27;s nomination to be a candidate for Mayor of London, and had then decided to run as an independent candidate instead, urging his supporters to help Green Party candidates get elected. Skinner said that Livingstone had betrayed Labour Party activists in his Brent East constituency, whom he described as having fought for him &quot;like tigers&quot; when his majority had been small: &quot;He tells them he&#x27;s going to be the Labour candidate, then he lies to them. To me that&#x27;s as low as you can get&quot;. He contrasted Livingstone with the official Labour candidate, fellow MP Frank Dobson, saying that Dobson was &quot;a bloke and a half... not a prima donna ... not someone with an ego as big as a house&quot;. Skinner said Livingstone would &quot;hit the headlines, but you&#x27;ll never be able to trust him because he&#x27;s broken his pledge and his loyalty to his party. The personality cult of the ego does not work down a coal mine and it does not work in the Labour Party&quot;.

Conversely, despite his renowned left-wing views, Skinner for a long time had a positive relationship with Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading figure on the right wing of the party, stemming from advice that Skinner gave Blair regarding public speaking. As recently as 2018, he described the Blair and Gordon Brown ministries as a &quot;golden period&quot; for the NHS. However, Skinner strongly criticised Blair in 2019, after the former Prime Minister had advised pro-Remain Labour supporters who felt that the party&#x27;s line on Brexit was too ambiguous to vote for explicitly pro-Remain parties in the 2019 European Parliament election; in the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, Skinner described Blair as a &quot;destructive force&quot; who was &quot;try(ing) to destroy the Labour Party so people keep talking about his reign&quot; and stating that he &quot;went into Iraq and destroyed himself. He helped David Cameron and Theresa May into power. You&#x27;re talking about a man who made a mess of it.&quot;

Skinner supported David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership election, which was won by his brother Ed Miliband. In March 2011, he was one of 15 MPs who voted against British participation in NATO&#x27;s Libya intervention.

Skinner was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. Shortly after Corbyn was elected as leader, Skinner was elected to Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee, on which he remained until October 2016. Skinner supported Corbyn, alongside the majority of Labour MPs, in voting against the extension of RAF airstrikes against ISIS in Syria in December 2015.

Skinner has stated that he voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.

Skinner favours abolition of the House of Lords.

===Suspensions===
Skinner was suspended from Parliament on at least 10 occasions, usually for unparliamentary language when attacking opponents. Notable infractions included:
* In 1980, he attempted to raise points of order during question time, against parliamentary practice, which led to a prolonged altercation with Speaker of the House of Commons George Thomas.
* In 1981, accusing Speaker Thomas (a former Labour MP) of attending functions to raise funds for the governing Conservative Party.
* Twice in 1984, once for accusing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of &quot;bribing judges&quot; in relation to a court case the government had won relating to banning GCHQ employees from trade union membership; and the second time for calling SDP leader David Owen a &quot;pompous sod&quot; (and only agreeing to withdraw &quot;pompous&quot;).
* In 1987, for accusing former cabinet minister Norman Tebbit of &#x27;lining his pockets&#x27; and being &#x27;dishonourable&#x27; as a result of his directorship and large shareholdings of British Telecom, a company he had privatised as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, which Labour MPs perceived as a conflict of interest.
* In 1992, referring to the Minister of Agriculture John Gummer as &quot;a little squirt of a Minister&quot; and &quot;a slimy wart on Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s nose&quot;.
* In 1995, accusing the John Major government of a &quot;crooked deal&quot; to sell off Britain&#x27;s coal mines.
* In 2005, when referring to the economic record of the Conservatives in the 1980s, making the remark, &quot;The only thing that was growing then were the lines of coke in front of &#x27;Boy George&#x27; and the rest of the Tories&quot;, a reference to allegations originally published in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; of cocaine use by the newly appointed Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne (though, in the Commons, Skinner referred to the &quot;News of the World&quot;).
* In 2006, accusing Deputy Speaker Alan Haselhurst of leniency towards remarks made by opposition frontbencher and future Prime Minister Theresa May &quot;because she&#x27;s a Tory&quot;.
* In 2016, for referring to Prime Minister David Cameron as &quot;Dodgy Dave&quot; (related to Skinner&#x27;s contention of Cameron&#x27;s dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the Panama Papers. House Speaker John Bercow asked Skinner to withdraw the word &quot;dodgy&quot;. When Skinner refused, he was ordered to leave parliament for the remainder of that day&#x27;s session. In July 2016, Skinner once again referred to Cameron as &quot;Dodgy Dave&quot; in parliament, though this time he was not reprimanded or asked to leave. &quot;Dodgy Dave&quot; has gained usage in the media, and on social media, when Cameron is being referred to disparagingly. Skinner&#x27;s remarks resurfaced online after Cameron was appointed foreign secretary by Rishi Sunak in November 2023.

===Queen&#x27;s Speech quips===
Known for his republican sentiments, Skinner regularly heckled during the annual Queen&#x27;s Speech ceremony. He did this upon the arrival of Black Rod (the symbol of royal authority in the House of Lords) to summon MPs to hear the Queen&#x27;s speech in the Lords&#x27; chamber. The best known, according to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and other sources, are listed as follows:

==After parliament (2019–present)==
During the 2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election which was won by Angela Rayner, Skinner endorsed Richard Burgon for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, saying &quot;I&#x27;m backing Richard to be Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Richard is a socialist who never gives in and never gives up. He gives me hope for the future of our Party. I urge CLPs &amp; unions to nominate Richard and members to vote for him.&quot;

On 6 May 2020, Skinner was named honorary president of the Socialist Campaign Group.

==Popular culture==
===&quot;Nature of the Beast&quot; documentary===

A documentary about Skinner sanctioned by him, &quot;Nature of the Beast&quot;, was completed in 2017 by production company Shut Out The Light. The documentary traces Skinner&#x27;s rise to political icon status and covers his working-class upbringing, his family influences and his hobbies away from &quot;The Palace of Varieties&quot;. Skinner&#x27;s four surviving brothers and several of his Bolsover constituents are interviewed in the documentary.

===Stage play===
Derby Theatre commissioned Kevin Fegan to write a play inspired by Skinner, titled &quot;The Palace of Varieties – life and times of Dennis Skinner&quot;, which was performed at the theatre in early 2022.

===&quot;Tony Skinner&#x27;s Lad&quot;===
In September 2020, Robb Johnson&#x27;s song about Skinner, &quot;Tony Skinner&#x27;s Lad&quot;, topped the Amazon download chart.

==Personal life==
In 1960, Skinner married Mary Parker, from whom he separated in 1989. He has three children and four grandchildren. Since the 1990s, his partner has been former researcher Lois Blasenheim.

In 2014, Skinner released his autobiography &quot;Sailing Close to the Wind: Reminiscences&quot;. In an interview he gave later in the year, Skinner stated that he had never sent an email and did not have a Twitter account, and when asked what he considered Cameron&#x27;s biggest achievement to be, Skinner said &quot;I can&#x27;t trust him as far as I can throw him.&quot;

In 1999, Skinner was diagnosed with advanced bladder cancer and subsequently had surgery to remove a malignant tumour. In 2003, he underwent a double heart bypass operation. He underwent hip surgery in 2019. He was too ill to campaign in the 2019 general election after he was hospitalised with a dangerous infection following the hip operation. He was not present at the count when he lost his seat.

Skinner&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease prior to her death in the 1980s. Skinner sang to his late mother when she was diagnosed with the disease and was inspired by her ability to recall old songs. Since 2008, he has visited care homes in Derbyshire to sing to elderly patients with dementia.

Skinner is a supporter of Derby County Football Club and Derbyshire County Cricket Club.

<doc id="367574" wikidata="Q7769442" url="?curid=367574" title="The Tin Woodman of Oz">
<text>The Tin Woodman of Oz: A Faithful Story of the Astonishing Adventure Undertaken by the Tin Woodman, Assisted by Woot the Wanderer, the Scarecrow of Oz, and Polychrome, the Rainbow&#x27;s Daughter is the twelfth book in the Oz series written by L. Frank Baum and was originally published on May 13, 1918. The Tin Woodman is reunited with his Munchkin sweetheart Nimmie Amee from the days when he was flesh and blood. This was a backstory from Baum&#x27;s 1900 novel, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. It was followed by &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919).

The book was dedicated to the author&#x27;s grandson Frank Alden Baum.

==Plot summary==

The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are regaling each other with tales at the Woodman&#x27;s palace in the Winkie Country when a Gillikin boy named Woot wanders in. After he is fed and rested, Woot asks the Woodman how he came to be made of tin.

He relates how the Wicked Witch of the East enchanted his axe and caused him to chop his body parts off limb by limb, because he was in love with her ward, Nimmie Amee. Each chopped limb was replaced by the tinsmith Ku-Klip with a counterpart made of tin. Without a heart, the Tin Woodman felt he could no longer love Nimmie Amee and he left her. Woot suggests that his new heart may have made him kind, but it did not make him loving, or he would have returned to Nimmie Amee. This shames the Tin Woodman and inspires him to journey to the Munchkin Country and find her.

The Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Woot journey into the Gillikin Country and encounter the inflatable Loons of Loonville, whom they escape by popping several of them. They descend into Yoop Valley, where the giantess Mrs. Yoop dwells, who transforms the travelers into animals for her amusement, just as she has already done to Polychrome, the Rainbow&#x27;s Daughter. The group escape, still in their animal forms.

They arrive at the farm of Jinjur, who renews her acquaintance with them and sends to the Emerald City for help. Dorothy and Ozma arrive and Ozma restores the travelers to their rightful forms. 

The group resumes their quest and come upon the spot where the Tin Woodman had rusted and find another tin man there. After they oil his joints, he identifies himself as Captain Fyter, a soldier who courted Nimmie Amee after the Woodman had left her. The Wicked Witch of the East had made Fyter&#x27;s sword do what the Woodman&#x27;s axe had done—cut off his limbs, which Ku-Klip replaced with tin limbs. He does not have a heart either, but this does not bother him. However, he can rust, which he did one day during a rainstorm. Both tin men now seek the heart of Nimmie Amee, agreeing to let her choose between them.

The five come to the dwelling of the tinsmith Ku-Klip where the Tin Woodman talks to himself—that is, to the head of the man (Nick Chopper) he once was. The Tin Woodman and the Tin Soldier also find a barrel of assorted body parts that once belonged to each of them, but some, like Captain Fyter&#x27;s head, are conspicuously missing. Ku-Klip reveals that he used Fyter&#x27;s head and many body parts from each of them (which never decayed) to create an assistant whom he named Chopfyt. Chopfyt complained about missing an arm until Ku-Klip made him a tin one, and Chopfyt departed for the east.

The companions leave Ku-Klip and continue east themselves to find Nimmie Amee at the foot of Mount Munch. At its summit is a cottage where a rabbit tells them Nimmie Amee now lives happily. The Tin Woodman and Tin Soldier find that Nimmie Amee is now married to Chopfyt. She refuses to leave her domestic life, even to become Empress of the Winkies. The four travelers return to the Emerald City and relate their adventures.

==Context and reception==
&quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; provides backstory for Oz itself; it was not always a fairyland, and became one by being enchanted by the Fairy Queen Lurline, who left a fairy behind to rule it. In &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; Ozma says that she herself was that fairy, though in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; we are told of her restoration to a throne long held by her ancestors.

In any event, this novel marks a clear maturation of Ozma&#x27;s character, now said to appear significantly older than Dorothy (in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; they appeared the same age) and a fairy working her own innate magic.

Baum&#x27;s Oz books had entered a trend of declining sales after 1910. &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; reversed this trend; its first-year sales of 18,600 were enough to make it a &quot;bestselling success.&quot; Significantly, the sales of earlier Oz titles also rebounded from previous declines, many selling 3000 copies that year, and two, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904) and the previous year&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917), selling 4000 copies. Baum earned $6,742.52 from his Oz books that year. (In 1918 the average annual salary of a clerical worker was $940.) Even Baum&#x27;s non-Oz-related early works were affected by the upsurge: &quot;John Dough and the Cherub&quot; (1906) sold 1,562 copies in 1918.

The reason for this reversal of fortune is harder to specify. The psychological shock of the trench-warfare carnage of World War I may have inspired a wave of nostalgia for a simpler time, with Baum&#x27;s books representing a lost &quot;age of innocence&quot;.

A new edition of the book was illustrated by Dale Ulrey in 1955. She illustrated a new edition of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; for Reilly &amp; Lee the following year, but sales did not warrant her continuing to provide new illustrations.

<text>In mathematics, two points of a sphere (or n-sphere, including a circle) are called antipodal or diametrically opposite if they are the endpoints of a diameter, a straight line segment between two points on a sphere and passing through its center.

Given any point on a sphere, its antipodal point is the unique point at greatest distance, whether measured intrinsically (great-circle distance on the surface of the sphere) or extrinsically (chordal distance through the sphere&#x27;s interior). Every great circle on a sphere passing through a point also passes through its antipodal point, and there are infinitely many great circles passing through a pair of antipodal points (unlike the situation for any non-antipodal pair of points, which have a unique great circle passing through both). Many results in spherical geometry depend on choosing non-antipodal points, and degenerate if antipodal points are allowed; for example, a spherical triangle degenerates to an underspecified lune if two of the vertices are antipodal.

The point antipodal to a given point is called its antipodes, from the Greek () meaning &quot;opposite feet&quot;; see . Sometimes the &quot;s&quot; is dropped, and this is rendered antipode, a back-formation.

== Higher mathematics ==
The concept of &quot;antipodal points&quot; is generalized to spheres of any dimension: two points on the sphere are antipodal if they are opposite &quot;through the centre&quot;. Each line through the centre intersects the sphere in two points, one for each ray emanating from the centre, and these two points are antipodal.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is a result from algebraic topology dealing with such pairs of points. It says that any continuous function from formula_1 to formula_2 maps some pair of antipodal points in formula_1 to the same point in formula_4 Here, formula_1 denotes the sphere and formula_2 is real coordinate space.

The antipodal map formula_7 sends every point on the sphere to its antipodal point. If points on the are represented as displacement vectors from the sphere&#x27;s center in Euclidean then two antipodal points are represented by additive inverses formula_8 and formula_9 and the antipodal map can be defined as formula_10 The antipodal map preserves orientation (is homotopic to the identity map) when formula_11 is odd, and reverses it when formula_11 is even. Its degree is formula_13

If antipodal points are identified (considered equivalent), the sphere becomes a model of real projective space.

<doc id="367579" wikidata="Q426015" url="?curid=367579" title="Wizzard">
<text>Wizzard were an English rock band formed by Roy Wood, former member of the Move and co-founder of the Electric Light Orchestra. &quot;The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits&quot; states, &quot;Wizzard was Roy Wood just as much as Wings was Paul McCartney.&quot; They are most famous for their 1973 Christmas single &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Not long after the release of Electric Light Orchestra&#x27;s first album, Wood found himself in political disagreements with the band&#x27;s manager Don Arden. Following a difference of opinion during recording of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;ELO 2&quot;, Wood walked out of the session, went down the road to a studio where the Birmingham group Mongrel (which included his former Move bandmate Rick Price, as well as drummers Charlie Grima and Keith Smart) were recording, and asked them if they would be interested in putting a band together.

Wood left ELO, taking band members Bill Hunt (keyboards and french horn) and Hugh McDowell (cello) with him, as well as ELO&#x27;s sound engineer, Trevor Smith. Despite press reporting a fallout between Wood and co-founder/leader Jeff Lynne, Wood denies that he and Lynne ever had a real row, blaming it on press fabrication and insisting that &quot;We never had a real row and we&#x27;re still mates now.&quot; In fact, Wood claimed that he left the group because he foresaw a fallout between him and Lynne due to their increasing differences of opinion (which he felt were caused, indirectly, by the band&#x27;s management) and wanted to avoid it.

Also in the line-up were saxophone players Mike Burney and Nick Pentelow (the son of actor Arthur Pentelow). Prior to the recording of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Introducing Eddy and the Falcons&quot;, McDowell left and was not replaced (he returned to ELO), and during the recording of the album Bill Hunt also departed and was replaced by Bob Brady (also from Mongrel). Prior to the 1975 recording of the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Main Street&quot; (released 2000), drummer Keith Smart departed the band and was not replaced.

===Chart success and tours===
The band made their live debut at The London Rock and Roll Show at Wembley Stadium on 5 August 1972. Wizzard&#x27;s second appearance was at the Reading Festival later that month. With Wood&#x27;s distinctive warpaint make-up and colourful costume, not to mention regular appearances on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in which members and friends, including Wood&#x27;s girl friend, singer Ayshea Brough, variously appeared in pantomime horses, gorilla costumes or as roller-skating angels, often wielding custard pies for good measure, Wizzard were one of the most picturesque groups of the British glam rock era. In 1973 they scored their first Top 10 hit with &quot;Ball Park Incident&quot;, which made No. 6 for three weeks from 13 January. Their biggest hit was with their second single. &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot;, Wood&#x27;s faithful and affectionate tribute to the Phil Spector-generated &#x27;Wall of Sound&#x27;, made No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. It sold over one million copies globally, and was awarded gold disc status. The follow-up, &quot;Angel Fingers&quot;, also topped the charts for one week. Wizzard&#x27;s songs often included lengthy instrumental improvisations.

The band&#x27;s 1973 Christmas single &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; became an annual fixture on British (and Irish) radio and television. It was reissued in 1981, and a 12&quot; re-recording appeared in 1984.

During 1973 Harvest Records released the Roy Wood solo album &quot;Boulders&quot;, which he had recorded and mixed years before forming Wizzard, and which produced a Top 20 hit in &quot;Dear Elaine&quot;. Wood said he was bored with &quot;Boulders&quot; by the time of its release and he wanted to focus on his new music with Wizzard. The subsequent heavy working schedule and strain led to health problems, and several cancelled or postponed live dates on a spring 1974 tour of the UK. One highlight of 1974 was a return to the Top 10 with &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Winter (Loony&#x27;s Tune)&quot;. Release was delayed for several weeks until the end of March, so the words &#x27;Sorry, the word &#x27;Spring&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t fit. R.W.&#x27; were added on the label after the title. Unusually for the time, this song and the B-side, &quot;Dream of Unwin&quot;, were both recorded and released in mono. The song was dedicated to Wood&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Lynsey de Paul, who repaid the honour by recording a Wizzard-style song, &quot;Ooh I Do&quot;, a few months later.

A tour of the US later that year failed to bring them any commercial success there, but after meeting Brian Wilson some members guested on a Beach Boys session, which resulted in the eventual release of the latter group&#x27;s single &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; in 1976. According to Wood, the record label neglected to make a substantial push to make Wizzard a success in the U.S., preferring to focus promotion on England since the band were already very popular there.

===Financial difficulties===
Wizzard was an expensive band to maintain, both because of the large line-up, in terms of recording costs, and Bill Hunt&#x27;s propensity to smash the pianos of the venues they were playing at. Studio time was an even greater drain on the band&#x27;s finances. According to Price in a radio interview, &quot;When we finished recording &#x27;Angel Fingers&#x27; it was rumoured that we had spent more time in the studio than Paul McCartney had with the whole of the &quot;Band on the Run&quot; album.&quot; Whether it was true or not, this meant that most of the record company&#x27;s money was spent in studio time and that the members of the band had to rely on live touring work for their income. A couple of tours in the UK and one tour of the US were not enough to ensure regular wages for the band. One by one the band members found other, more lucrative, things to occupy their time.

===Disbanding===
By autumn 1975 they had split, leaving a farewell single, &quot;Rattlesnake Roll&quot;, which failed to chart, and a third album, &quot;Main Street&quot;, which their record label did not release as they deemed it insufficiently commercial. Wizzard had initially intended their second album to be a double, with one disc a set of rock and roll pastiches and the other disc jazz-rock. The label heard the rock and roll set and decided to release that as a single album, which appeared in 1974 as &quot;Introducing Eddy &amp; The Falcons&quot;. &quot;Main Street&quot;, the jazz-rock set, languished in the vaults and was for some time presumed lost, but was finally released in 2000.

===Post-Wizzard===
Following the band&#x27;s split in 1975, Wood and Price formed the short-lived Wizzo Band, after which Wood reverted to a solo career in addition to producing records for other acts, notably a 1979 Top 10 cover version of &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; for British doo-wop revivalists Darts.

On 13 November 2014, saxophonist Mike Burney died, aged 76, after a long battle with cancer. Hugh McDowell died on 6 November 2018 following a long illness, at the age of 65. On 17 May 2022, bassist Rick Price died aged 77.

<text>Bank of America Plaza is a 72-story, late-modernist skyscraper located in the Main Street District in the city&#x27;s downtown core in Dallas, Texas, United States. It is the tallest skyscraper in the city, the 3rd tallest in Texas and the 45th tallest in the United States. It contains of office space.

== History ==
The building was designed by JPJ Architects and developed by Bramalea Limited of Brampton, Ontario. Canada. The original owner was a joint venture arrangement including Prudential Insurance, Bramalea Limited, and First National Bank of Dallas under parent company InterFirst Corporation. Construction commenced in 1983 and the tower was completed in 1985.

The development was originally called the Dallas Main Center, but has taken many names over its short history. Upon opening the tower was called InterFirst Bank Plaza and has been renamed several times because of the mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry. In 1986 the tower was renamed First Republic Bank Plaza after InterFirst Corporation&#x27;s merger with Republic Bank Corporation. First Republic Corporation later failed and was sold in 1988 to Charlotte-based North Carolina National Bank by the Resolution Trust Corporation becoming NCNB Texas. The tower was renamed NCNB Plaza. In 1991, in order to reflect its growing national portfolio NCNB rebranded themselves and the tower took the name NationsBank Plaza, and finally the building was renamed Bank of America Plaza in 1998 after NationsBank acquired San Francisco-based Bank of America and taking their name and operating under their charter.

==Design==

===Architecture===

Original plans for the development, initially called Dallas Main Center, called for two 72-story towers, a 600-room hotel, and a parking garage. Original designs for the tower were capped with stepped pyramid crowns and were initially intended to be clad in a silver glazing with gold accent band curtain wall. In order to gain FAA approval to build the tower, the stepped pyramid was removed. Another design change altered the curtain wall materials, which were replaced with blue glazing and grey marble accent bands.

As a result of the collapse of the price for oil, real estate, and banking industry in Texas in the mid-eighties, the twin tower and hotel were never completed. The hotel site remains a surface parking lot, and the site of the second 72-story tower was purchased by the City of Dallas after a 2006 bond election. The surface parking lot was converted into Belo Garden Park.

=== Lighting ===

The building&#x27;s facetted facade was first accented at night by nearly of green argon lighting running primarily at the edges and corners of the tower. The lighting design concept was by Theo Kondos Associates, lighting design firm in New York, NY. Due to the green lighting, the building is often referred to as &quot;The Pickle.&quot; Green was chosen over red or blue because it is more visible from a distance. It has also been reported that the second tower, if built would have been accented with purple lighting (often called “The Eggplant”).

Several months later, many of the argon tubes had burnt out due to a combination of several high voltage phenomena—one of which is referred to as the &quot;corona effect&quot; that discharges high voltage at the ends of the tube connections burning them out. After an intensive study, the developer shut down the entire lighting system and replaced it with a &quot;mid-point grounded&quot; system and larger, 18 mm tubes. Cold temperatures continued to plague the replacement system&#x27;s performance.

In a renovation project that began in May 2013, the original green argon lighting was replaced with multi-colored LED tubes. The renovations were 90 percent complete by November 14, 2013, when the LED outline was showcased at the re-lighting ceremony. This was made possible by Innovative Lighting in Irving, and Turner Construction.

===Art===

Alexander Liberman&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Venture&quot; (1985) was located in the front plaza of the building until April 2013. The tall sculpture is composed of twelve wide steel tubes of approximately 1” thickness cut into various lengths and stacked end-to-end and painted red. The current building owners removed the sculpture to make room for a valet parking entry to the building. The sculpture was donated to the City of Dallas. It was refurbished and installed near Garage C at Dallas Love Field Airport.

During the 2013 renovation of the building&#x27;s lighting, the nearby OMNI Hotel&#x27;s LED system was host to the 2nd edition of the Video Association of Dallas&#x27; EXPANDED CINEMA video exhibition. One work in the program, &quot;Ar City&quot; by Dallas-based artist Michael A. Morris, poetically addressed the transition from the argon lighting to the new LED system, drawing attention to the absence of the green light on the skyline by reproducing the color with the OMNI&#x27;s lights and musing on the uses of liquid argon. Many artists have been exhibited inside OMNI hotel such as Mona Kasra.

=== Broadcast and communications center ===
The top two floors function as a broadcast communications tower using the building itself as a broadcast tower structure. ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and The CW operate television transmission facilities on the 72nd floor and 74th level roof as well as most federal law enforcement agencies. All point-to-point microwave and fixed-service antennas are concealed within a specifically designed glass communications parapet on the top floor. The base of the 73rd floor parapet opens to the 72nd floor data and communications center below allowing for easy and safe access during installation and servicing of wireless devices. It also protects the hardware from weather. The building operates a sophisticated in-building distributed antenna system as well as a shared tenant data center. James Chiles designed this facility in 1985 one year prior to his rooftop antenna design of Renaissance Tower in 1986.

Amateur radio operators also install repeater systems on this building.

===Floor directory===
The 72nd-73rd floors contain mechanical space and telecommunications equipment for the broadcast antennas on the roof. Two rooftop balconies on the 72nd floor are closed to the public and store the building&#x27;s window washing equipment.

The lower level contains retail such as shops and restaurants which connect to the Dallas Pedestrian Network.

==In popular culture==
Exterior shots of the building were used as the home of JRE Industries in Season 11 of the 1980s television series &quot;Dallas&quot;.

<doc id="367585" wikidata="Q240989" url="?curid=367585" title="Amelita Galli-Curci">
<text>Amelita Galli-Curci (18 November 1882 – 26 November 1963) was an Italian lyric coloratura soprano. She was one of the most famous operatic singers of the 20th century and a popular recording artist, with her records selling in large numbers.

==Early life==
She was born as Amelita Galli into an upper-middle-class Italian family of Spanish heritage in Milan, where she studied piano at the Milan Conservatory, winning a gold medal for piano performance, and at the age of 16 was offered a professorship. She was inspired to sing by her grandmother. Operatic composer Pietro Mascagni also encouraged Galli-Curci&#x27;s singing ambitions. By her own choice, Galli-Curci&#x27;s voice was largely self-trained at the beginning of her career. She honed her technique by listening to other sopranos, reading old singing-method books, and doing piano exercises with her voice instead of using a keyboard. During the 1920s and &#x27;30s, she was coached by Estelle Liebling in New York City.

==Career==

Galli-Curci made her operatic debut in 1906 at Trani as Gilda in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and she rapidly became acclaimed throughout Italy for the sweetness and agility of her voice and her captivating musical interpretations. She was seen by many critics as an antidote to the host of squally, verismo-oriented sopranos then populating Italian opera houses.

She toured widely in Europe, Russia and South America. In 1915, she sang two performances of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; with Enrico Caruso in Buenos Aires. These were to be her only operatic appearances with the great tenor, though they later appeared in concert and made a few recordings together. Galli-Curci and Caruso also acted as godparents for the son of the Sicilian tenor Giulio Crimi.

Galli-Curci toured extensively throughout her career, including a 1924 Great Britain concert tour (she never sang in an opera there), where she appeared in 20 cities and a tour of Australia a year later.

===United States===
Galli-Curci first arrived in the United States in the autumn of 1916 as a virtual unknown. Her stay in the US was intended to be brief, but the acclaim she received for her historic American debut as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in Chicago on 18 November 1916 (her 34th birthday) was so wildly enthusiastic that she accepted an offer to extend her association with the Chicago Opera Association, where she appeared until the end of the 1924 season. Also in 1916, Galli-Curci signed a recording contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company and made her first records a few weeks before her American debut. She recorded exclusively for Victor until 1930.

On 14 November 1921, while still under contract with the Chicago Opera, Galli-Curci made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as Violetta in &quot;La Traviata&quot;, opposite tenor Beniamino Gigli as Alfredo. She was one of the few singers of that era who were contracted to both opera companies simultaneously. Galli-Curci remained at the Met until her retirement from the operatic stage nine years later. 

In 1922, Galli-Curci built a country estate in Highmount, New York, which she called &quot;Sul Monte&quot;. She summered there for several years until she sold the property in 1937. A theater erected in the nearby village of Margaretville was named in her honor. She returned the favor by performing there on its opening night. Sul Monte was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

== Vocal decline and retirement from opera==
Weary of opera house politics and convinced that opera was a dying art form, Galli-Curci retired from the operatic stage in January, 1930 to concentrate instead on concert performances. Throat problems and the uncertain pitching of top notes had plagued her for several years, and she underwent surgery in 1935 for the removal of a thyroid goiter. Great care was taken during her surgery, which was performed under local anesthesia; however, it was thought her voice suffered following the surgery, specifically, a nerve to her larynx, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, was thought to have been damaged, resulting in the loss of her ability to sing high pitches. This nerve has since become known as the &quot;nerve of Galli-Curci.&quot;

In 2001, researchers Crookes and Recaberen &quot;examined contemporary press reviews after surgery, conducted interviews with colleagues and relatives of the surgeon, and compared the career of Galli-Curci with that of other singers&quot; and determined that her vocal decline was most likely not caused by a surgical injury.

Other researchers (Marchese-Ragona et al.) have argued that tracheal compression caused by a goiter put an early end to Galli-Curci&#x27;s career as a coloratura soprano, but it was nerve damage caused during surgery that prevented her from prolonging her career as lyric or dramatic soprano.

==Personal life==

In 1908, Amelita Galli wed an Italian nobleman and painter, the Marchese Luigi Curci, attaching his surname to hers. They divorced in 1920. The Marchese Curci petitioned the papal council in Rome for an annulment of the marriage in 1922. In 1921, Galli-Curci married Homer Samuels, her accompanist. Their marriage lasted until Samuels&#x27; death in 1956.

Galli-Curci was a student of the Indian meditation and yoga teacher Paramahansa Yogananda. She wrote the foreword to Yogananda&#x27;s 1929 book &quot;Whispers from Eternity&quot;.

==Return to opera, death and legacy==
On 24 November 1936, Galli-Curci, aged 54, made an ill-advised return to opera, appearing in a single performance as Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot; in Chicago. It was painfully clear that her best singing days were behind her and after another year of recitals she went into complete retirement, living in California. She spent much of her time painting and taught singing privately until shortly before her death from emphysema in La Jolla, California, on 26 November 1963, at the age of 81. Among her students was soprano Jean Fenn.

Galli-Curci&#x27;s voice can still be heard on original 78-rpm records and their LP and CD reissues. Based on her recorded legacy and contemporary assessments of Galli-Curci&#x27;s performances in England and America, the opera commentator Michael Scott, writing in volume 2 of &quot;The Record of Singing&quot; (Duckworth, London, 1979), compares her unfavourably as a vocal technician with coloratura sopranos of an earlier generation, such as Nellie Melba and Luisa Tetrazzini, but he acknowledges the unique beauty of her voice and the ongoing lyrical appeal of her charming singing.

Galli-Curci is honored on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for recording, with a star located at 6121 Hollywood Boulevard.

In Studio Ghibli&#x27;s film &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, her recording of &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; is played at the end.

In the film &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; (1971), Galli-Curci&#x27;s recording of &quot;Caro nome&quot; from &quot;Rigoletto&quot; can be heard playing as &#x27;Doc&#x27; Tydon, portrayed by Donald Pleasence remarks &quot;What a doll... Galli-Curci&quot;.

<text>Carmarthen (, ; , &#x27;Merlin&#x27;s fort&#x27; or possibly &#x27;Sea-town fort&#x27;) is the county town of Carmarthenshire and a community in Wales, lying on the River Towy north of its estuary in Carmarthen Bay. At the 2021 census the community had a population of 14,636, and the built up area had a population of 16,455. It stands on the site of a Roman town, and has a claim to be the oldest town in Wales. In the middle ages it comprised twin settlements: &quot;Old Carmarthen&quot; around Carmarthen Priory and &quot;New Carmarthen&quot; around Carmarthen Castle. The two were merged into one borough in 1546. It was the most populous borough in Wales in the 16th–18th centuries, described by William Camden as &quot;chief citie of the country&quot;. It was overtaken in size by the mid-19th century, following the growth of settlements in the South Wales Coalfield.

==History==
===Early history===


When Britannia was a Roman province, Carmarthen was the civitas capital of the Demetae tribe, known as Moridunum (&quot;Sea Fort&quot;). It is possibly the oldest town in Wales, recorded by Ptolemy and in the Antonine Itinerary. The Roman fort is believed to date from about AD 75. A Roman coin hoard was found nearby in 2006. Near the fort is one of seven surviving Roman amphitheatres in Britain and only two in Roman Wales (the other being at Isca Augusta, Roman Caerleon). Excavated in 1968, the Carmarthen fort has an arena of 50 by 30 yards (about 46 by 27 metres); the cavea (seating area) is 100 by 73 yards (92 by 67 metres). Michael Veprauskas (1998) argued for identifying it as the &quot;Cair Guorthigirn&quot; (&quot;Fort Vortigern&quot;) listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his &quot;History of the Britons&quot;. Evidence of the early Roman town has been investigated for several years, revealing urban sites likely to date from the 2nd century.

During the Middle Ages, the settlement then known as Llanteulyddog (&#x27;St Teulyddog&#x27;s) accounted one of the seven principal sees (Cantrefi) in Dyfed. The strategic importance of Carmarthen caused the Norman William fitz Baldwin to build a castle there, probably about 1094. The current castle site is known to have been occupied since 1105. The castle itself was destroyed by Llywelyn the Great in 1215, but rebuilt in 1223, when permission was given for a town wall and crenellations, making it one of the first medieval walled towns in Wales. In 1405, the town was captured and the castle sacked by Owain Glyndŵr. The Black Book of Carmarthen of about 1250 is associated with the town&#x27;s Priory of SS John the Evangelist and Teulyddog.

The Black Death of 1347–1349 arrived in Carmarthen with the thriving river trade. It destroyed and devastated villages such as Llanllwch. Local historians cite the plague pit for the mass burial of the dead in the graveyard that adjoins the Maes-yr-Ysgol and Llys Model housing at the rear of St Catherine Street.

In 1110, the ancient Clas church of Llandeulyddog, an independent, pre-Norman religious community, became the Benedictine Priory of St Peter, only to be replaced 15 years later by the Augustinian Priory of St John the Evangelist and St Teulyddog. This stood near the river, at what is now Priory Street (, SN418204). The site is now a scheduled monument.

===Grey Friars===
Franciscan Friars (Grey Friars, or Friars minor) became established in the town in the 13th century, and by 1284 had their own Friary buildings in Lammas Street (), on a site now holding a shopping centre. The Franciscan emphasis on poverty and simplicity meant the church was smaller (some &quot;70 to 80 feet long and 30 feet broad&quot; – 21/24 by 9 m) and more austere than the older foundations, but this did not prevent an accumulation of treasures, as it became a sought-after location for burial. In 1456 Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond died of plague in Carmarthen, three months before the birth of his son, the future King Henry VII. Edmund was buried in a prominent tomb in the centre of the choir of the Grey Friars Church. Other notables buried there were Rhys ap Thomas and Tudur Aled.

The Friary was dissolved in 1538, and many unsuccessful plans were made for the building. Even before the friars had left in 1536, William Barlow campaigned to have the cathedral moved into it from St David&#x27;s, where the tomb and remains of Edmund Tudor were moved after the Carmarthen buildings were deconsecrated. There were repeated attempts to turn the buildings into a grammar school. Gradually they became ruined, although the church walls were still recognisable in the mid-18th century. By 1900 all the stonework had been stripped off and there were no traces above ground. The site remained undeveloped until the 1980s and 1990s, after extensive archaeological excavations of first the monastic buildings and then the nave and chancel of the church. These confirmed that the former presence of a church, a chapter house and a large cloister, with a smaller cloister and infirmary added later. Over 200 graves were found in the churchyard and 60 around the friars&#x27; choir.

===Arthurian legend===

Geoffrey of Monmouth, writing in 1188, began the legend that Merlin was born in a cave outside Carmarthen. The town&#x27;s Welsh name, &quot;Caerfyrddin&quot;, is widely claimed to mean &quot;Merlin&#x27;s fort&quot;, but a reverse etymology is also suggested: the name Merlin may have originated from the town&#x27;s name in the anglicised form of &quot;Myrddin&quot;. (See ). An alternative explanation is that &quot;Myrddin&quot; is a corruption of the town&#x27;s Roman name, Moridunum, meaning &quot;sea fort.&quot;

Legend also had it that if a certain tree called Merlin&#x27;s Oak fell, it would bring the downfall of the town. Translated from Welsh, it reads: &quot;When Merlin&#x27;s Oak comes tumbling down/Down shall fall Carmarthen Town.&quot; To obstruct this, the tree was dug up when it died; pieces of it remain in the town museum.

The Black Book of Carmarthen includes poems that refer to Myrddin (&quot;Ymddiddan Myrddin a Thaliesin&quot;, &quot;Conversation of Merlin and Taliesin&quot;) and possibly to Arthur (&quot;Pa ŵr yw&#x27;r Porthor?&quot;, &quot;What man is the porter?&quot;). Interpretation of these is difficult, as the Arthurian legends were known by this time and details of the modern form had been described by Geoffrey of Monmouth before the book was written. Some historians suggest that Vortigern along with his army from Powys may have invaded the Ystrad Tywi in order to gain control of it but had to retreat either due to local rebels fighting back or being defeated by Dyfed, but in the process may have kidnapped a young Merlin from Carmarthen hence why the character is legendary within the town.

===Early modern===

One of the earliest recorded Eisteddfodau took place at Carmarthen in about 1451, presided over by Gruffudd ap Nicolas.

The &quot;Book of Ordinances&quot; (1569–1606) is one of the earliest surviving minute books of a town in Wales. It gives a unique picture of an Elizabethan town.

After the incorporation of Wales into the legal system of England, Carmarthen became judicial headquarters of the Court of Great Sessions for south-west Wales. The town&#x27;s dominant pursuits in the 16th and 17th centuries were still agriculture and related trades, including woollen manufacture.

The Priory and the Friary were abandoned after the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. The chapels of St Catherine and St Barbara were lost. The Church of St Peter&#x27;s survived as the main religious establishment. During the Marian persecutions of the 1550s, Bishop Ferrar of St David&#x27;s was burnt at the stake in the market square – now Nott Square. His life and death as a Protestant martyr are recorded in Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs.

In 1689, John Osborne, 1st Earl of Danby, was created 1st Marquess of Carmarthen by William III. He was then created Duke of Leeds in 1694, and Marquess of Carmarthen became the courtesy title for the Duke&#x27;s heir apparent until the Dukedom became extinct on the death of the 12th Duke in 1964.

===18th century to present===
In the mid-18th century, the Morgan family founded a small ironworks at the east end of the town. In 1786 lead smelting was established to process the ore carried from Lord Cawdor&#x27;s mines at Nantyrmwyn, in the north-east of Carmarthenshire. Neither of these firms survived for long. The lead smelting moved to Llanelli in 1811. The ironworks evolved into a tinplate works that had failed by about 1900. The borough corporation was reformed by a 1764 charter and again by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

In the late 18th century John Spurrell, an auctioneer from Bath, settled in Carmarthen. He was the grandson of Robert Spurrell, a Bath schoolmaster, who printed the city&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Elements of Chronology&quot; in 1730. In 1840, a printing press was set up in Carmarthen by William Spurrell (1813–1889), who wrote a history of the town and compiled and published an 1848 Welsh-English dictionary and an 1850 English–Welsh dictionary. Today&#x27;s Collins Welsh dictionary is known as the &quot;Collins Spurrell&quot;. A local housing authority in Carmarthen is named Heol Spurrell in honour of the family.

The origins of Chartism in Wales can be traced to the foundation in the autumn of 1836 of Carmarthen Working Men&#x27;s Association.

Carmarthen gaol, authorised by the Carmarthen Improvement Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 104) and designed by John Nash, was in use from about the year 1789 until its demolition in 1922. The site is now taken by County Hall, designed by Sir Percy Thomas. The gaol&#x27;s &quot;Felons&#x27; Register&quot; of 1843–1871 contains some of the earliest photographs of criminals in Britain. In 1843, the workhouse in Carmarthen was attacked by the Rebecca Rioters.

The revival of the Eisteddfod as an institution took place in Carmarthen in 1819. The town hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1867, 1911 and 1974, although at least in 1974, the &quot;Maes&quot; was at Abergwili.

Carmarthen Grammar School was founded in 1587 on a site now occupied by the old hospital in Priory Street. The school moved in the 1840s to Priory Row, before relocating to Richmond Terrace. At the turn of the 20th century, a local travelling circus buried one of its elephants that fell sick and died. The grave is under what was the rugby pitch.

The population in 1841 was 9,526.

World War II prisoner-of-war camps were placed in Johnstown (where the Davies Estate now stands) and at Glangwilli — the huts being used as part of the hospital since its inception. To the west of the town was the &quot;Carmarthen Stop Line&quot;, one of a network of defensive lines created in 1940–1941 in case of invasion, with a series of ditches and pill boxes running north and south. Most have since been removed or filled in, but two remain.

The Carmarthen community is bordered by those of Bronwydd, Abergwili, Llangunnor, Llandyfaelog, Llangain, Llangynog and Newchurch and Merthyr, all in Carmarthenshire.

Carmarthen was named as one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Carmarthen, at community (town) and county level: Carmarthen Town Council (Cyngor Tref Caerfyrddin) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council is based at St Peter&#x27;s Civic Hall at 1 Nott Square, a 19th century building which was formerly used as a church hall before being bought by the town council in 1977. The county council is also based in the town, having its headquarters at County Hall on Castle Hill, occupying much of the site of Carmarthen Castle.
===Administrative history===
Carmarthen was an ancient parish, also known as St Peter&#x27;s after its parish church. The parish included rural areas as well as the town itself, particularly to the north and west of the town. A settlement, later known as Old Carmarthen, is known to have existed prior to the construction of the castle and the adjoining Anglo-Norman town of New Carmarthen, which were developed from the early 12th century. New Carmarthen was administered as a borough from at least the 13th century. The borough boundary was tightly drawn around the new town; the castle itself and Old Carmarthen lay outside the borough boundaries. The borough was enlarged to cover the whole parish in 1546, bringing Old Carmarthen into the borough, which was thereafter called Carmarthen.

In 1604, a charter from James I gave the borough the right to appoint its own sheriffs, making it a county corporate, independent from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Carmarthenshire. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. When elected county councils were created in 1889, despite being a county corporate, Carmarthen was not considered large enough to be made a county borough providing its own county-level local government functions. It was therefore included in the administrative county of Carmarthenshire, under the authority of the new Carmarthenshire County Council.

Carmarthen Castle was historically excluded from both the parish and borough of Carmarthen, forming a detached part of the parish of Newchurch. The castle was transferred to the parish of Carmarthen in 1885, and was brought within the borough boundaries in 1898.

The borough of Carmarthen was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Carmarthen was created covering the area of the former borough, with its community council taking the name Carmarthen Town Council. District-level functions passed to the new Carmarthen District Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. The district of Carmarthen and county of Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council. Carmarthen Town Council retains the right to appoint its own sheriff, based on the town&#x27;s former status as a county corporate.

===Constituency===
From 1536 until 1832 the borough formed the Carmarthen parliamentary constituency, electing its own MP to the House of Commons. By the late 18th century, Carmarthen, as one of the largest towns in Wales at the time, was the scene of a succession of hotly contested electoral contests between the Blues (Whigs) and Reds (Tories). These reached a climax in 1831 with the general election fought in the midst of the Reform Crisis. The contest was characterised by riots and disturbances, described as &quot;exceptional because of their intensity and duration&quot;.

From 1832 the constituency was known as the Carmarthen District of Boroughs, or Carmarthen Boroughs, including both Carmarthen and Llanelli; the latter gradually became dominant as its population overtook Carmarthen&#x27;s. The Carmarthen Boroughs constituency was abolished in 1918 and replaced by a county constituency called Carmarthen covering the town and surrounding rural areas. In a by-election in the constituency in 1966, Gwynfor Evans was elected as the first Plaid Cymru MP. In 2024 new constituency boundaries came into effect and it was given the Welsh name Caerfyrddin as its primary name.

==Religion==
===Anglicanism===

The Anglican Church in Wales &quot;(Eglwys yng Nghymru)&quot; has six dioceses. St Peter&#x27;s is the largest parish church in the Diocese of St David&#x27;s and has the longest nave: 200&#x27; (60 metres) from west porch to east window and 50&#x27; (15 metres) across the nave and south aisle. In 1954, St Peter&#x27;s became a Grade I listed building. 
 It consists of a west tower, nave, chancel, south aisle and a Consistory Court, built of local red sandstone and grey shale. The tower contains eight bells, of which the heaviest, tuned to E, weighs 15 cwt 18 lb (783 kg).

By the early 19th century, St Peter&#x27;s was too small to accommodate the congregation, which had grown in line with the town&#x27;s population. After several false starts a new church, St David&#x27;s, was consecrated in 1841. Another church in the same western part of the town, Christ Church, opened in 1869 to serve the English-speaking congregation.

===Catholicism===
St Mary&#x27;s, Carmarthen is part of the Carmarthen Deanery.

===Nonconformity===
Carmarthen has several notable nonconformist chapels, some of which date back to the 18th century or earlier.

A Baptist chapel was founded in Dark Gate in 1762 and then moved in 1812 to Waterloo Terrace under the ministry of Titus Lewis. The new chapel became known as the Tabernacle. Another Baptist chapel, Penuel dates from 1786, with the present building erected in 1872. The English Baptist Church in Lammas Street dates from 1870. All three chapels remained open in 2024.

Lammas Street Chapel is the town&#x27;s oldest Congregational or Independent chapel, traceable back to 1726, with the present building erected a century later. Union Street Chapel, now closed, was formed after a split among the Lammas Street congregation. Priory Chapel in Priory Street, was founded in 1872 as a branch of Ebenezer, Abergwili.

The earliest Calvinistic Methodist Chapel was Water Street Chapel, which is now closed. It had ties with Peter Williams, who produced a celebrated Welsh-language version of the Bible in the 18th century. Bethania Chapel in Priory Street, dating from 1909, closed shortly after celebrating its centenary.

==Landmarks==

===Carmarthen Castle===

Little remains of the medieval castle at Carmarthen, but the old Gatehouse still dominates Nott Square. The motte is also accessible to the public. Castle House, within the old walls, is a museum and Tourist Information Centre.

===Carmarthen Bridge===

The concrete A484 road bridge across the River Tywi designed by the Welsh architect Clough Williams-Ellis was completed in 1937. It was Grade II listed in 2003. The loss of the original medieval bridge that it replaced caused controversy.

===Pont King Morgan===
To create better pedestrian access across the River Tywi from the town&#x27;s railway station to the town centre, a cable-stayed bridge was constructed in 2005 linking to the foot of Blue Street. The cost was £2.8 million. The bridge was commended in 2007 by the British Constructional Steelwork Association&#x27;s Structural Steel Design Awards for its high-quality detailing. Previously, access was across Carmarthen Bridge some to the east.

===Picton&#x27;s monument===
In 1828, a monument was erected at the west end of the town to honour Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton, from Haverfordwest, who had died at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The pillar, which was about , was designed to echo Trajan&#x27;s column in Rome. A statue of Picton, wrapped in a cloak and supported by a baluster above emblems of spears surmounted the column.

Within a few years, the monument became dilapidated. The entire pillar was taken down in 1846. In the 1970s, the replacement sculptures were rediscovered in Johnstown and are now displayed in Carmarthenshire County Museum.

After demolition of the first monument, a new structure honouring Picton was commissioned from the architect Frances Fowler. The foundation stone was laid on Monument Hill in 1847. In 1984, the top section was declared unsafe and taken down. Four years later, the whole monument was rebuilt stone-by-stone on stronger foundations.

A campaign to remove the monument due to Picton&#x27;s treatment of slaves arose in the wake of the removal of the Statue of Edward Colston in Bristol on 6 June 2020.

===The Nott statue and plaque to Ferrar===
A statue of General Nott was erected in 1851. According to the PMSA, &quot;The bronze statue was cast from cannon captured at the battle of Maharajpur. Queen Victoria gave 200 guineas to the memorial fund. The statue occupies the site of the market cross, which was dismantled when the market was resited and Nott Square created in 1846.&quot;

The Market Square was where Bishop Robert Ferrar of St Davids was executed in March 1555. A small plaque below the statue of General Nott commemorates the place where he was burned at the stake during the Marian Persecutions.

==Listed buildings==

The many listed buildings include Carmarthen Guildhall, Capel Heol Awst, Capel Heol Dŵr, Carmarthen Cemetery Chapel, Elim Independent Chapel, English Baptist Church, English Congregational Church, Penuel Baptist Chapel, Christ Church, Eglwys Dewi Sant, Church of St Mary and Eglwys Sant Ioan.

==Amenities==
Dyfed–Powys Police headquarters, Glangwili General Hospital and a campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David are located in Carmarthen.

The former cattle market in the heart of the town became a new shopping centre, which opened in 2010. It includes a multi-screen cinema, a market hall, restaurants and a multi-storey car park. A new market hall opened in 2009.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A40, A48, A484 and A485 converge on Carmarthen. The M4 motorway, which links South Wales with London, terminates at junction 49, the Pont Abraham services; the route continues north-west as the dual carriageway A48 and finishes at its junction with the A40 in Carmarthen.

===Railway===
Carmarthen railway station is a stop on the West Wales Line and opened in 1852. The town has rail links to via to the east and , , , and to the west; these services are operated by Transport for Wales. There are daily direct inter-city trains to London, operated by Great Western Railway.

The area suffered a number of railway line closures in the 1960s under the Beeching Axe: one route to , which was closed in 1963, and one to and in 1965.

===Buses===
Local bus services are operated by several companies, including First Cymru and Morris Travel; routes connect the town with Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Llandeilo and Llanelli.

There is a Park and Ride service running daily from Monday to Saturday from 7.00 to 19.00 between Nantyci, to the west of Carmarthen town, and the town centre.

==Sport==
The town has two rugby union teams: Carmarthen Quins and Carmarthen Athletic. Quins currently plays in the Welsh Premier Division league, after promotion to the Premiership in the 2008/2009 season. CPC Bears, a rugby league club based in Carmarthen and the regional side for Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, plays in the Welsh Premier Division of the Rugby League Conference.

The town&#x27;s semi-professional football team, Carmarthen Town F.C., plays in the Cymru South. Founded in 1948, it plays its home games at Richmond Park. The club colours, reflected in its crest and kit, are gold and black. The town also has a youth football team Carmarthen Stars that plays in the local Carmarthenshire Junior Leagues from the under-12s age group to the under-16s age group.

The town has two golf courses, a leisure centre with an eight-lane, 25-metre swimming pool (where the Carmarthen district swimming club is based), a synthetic athletics track and an outdoor velodrome it also has an athletics team, Carmarthen Harriers. A cycle track opened in about 1900 and remains in use. Motorcycle speedway racing was staged in the early 2000s at a track built on the western outskirts of the town; the team raced in the Conference League.

==Picton Barracks==
Picton Barracks is a military installation, based in the west part of the town, and is used by the Ministry of Defence. Two major units currently reside there:

<doc id="367590" wikidata="Q110996780" url="?curid=367590" title="Teaser trailer">
<text>A teaser trailer (or simply a teaser) is a short trailer and a form of teaser campaign advertising that focuses on film and television programming. It is a videography pre-release film or television show advertisement. Short in length, teaser trailers contain little material from the advertised content to be released.

Frequently, they contain hinted, , curiosity-inducing messages. Methods of this nature are designed to pique audience interest and anticipation, as well as increase the hype of the advertised content before release of its trailer. The length of a teaser trailer is usually only around 20–30 seconds, noticeably shorter than the 2014 National Association of Theatre Owners guideline of two minutes for standard trailers. It is generally created during the shooting of the film or program and released before the completion of shooting.

==For films==

A teaser trailer is a short video segment related to an upcoming film, television program, video game, or similar, that is usually released long in advance of the product, so as to &quot;tease&quot; the audience; an early example of the teaser trailer was the one for the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film by Richard Donner, which was designed to re-invigorate interest on the part of potential movie-goers, for a film whose release had been delayed.

Film teasers are usually made for big-budget and popularly themed movies. Their purpose is less to tell the audience about a movie&#x27;s content than simply to let them know that the movie is coming up in the near future, and to add to the hype of the upcoming release. Teaser trailers are often made while the film is still in production or being edited, and as a result they may feature scenes or alternate versions of scenes that are not in the finished film. Often they contain no dialogue and some — notably Pixar films — have scenes made for use in the trailer only. Some teaser trailers show a quick montage of scenes from the film. The average length of a teaser is less than a minute.
Later examples of major motion picture events that used teaser trailers to gain hype are &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, and the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; teaser trailer was released even before a single frame of the movie had been shot. &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;″s teaser debuted three months before its intended release date, but its delay to July 15, 2009, expanded the gap to a year.

When the first teaser for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was attached to the films &quot;The Siege&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, it was reported that many people had paid for admission to the film just to watch the trailer and subsequently walked out after the trailer had been screened. Similarly, teasers for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; were shown before the Pixar films &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; and &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, respectively. The teaser trailer for &quot;Cloverfield&quot; was first publicly shown attached to the film &quot;Transformers&quot;; at that point, nothing about the former was known, and the one-and-a-half-minute teaser did not include the movie title; only the producer&#x27;s name, J. J. Abrams, and a release date, 1.18.08, were shown. The teaser trailer for another film directed by Abrams, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, was attached to &quot;Cloverfield&quot; itself, depicting the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; being constructed on Earth, and again showing no title, instead just showing the Starfleet Insignia; the &quot;Star Trek&quot; teaser trailer originally announced the release date as Christmas 2008, but the movie was eventually delayed to May 8, 2009, making the wait between the teaser trailer and the movie itself 16 months. Other teasers also do not explicitly display the film&#x27;s title, but reveal it in the URL for the website.

Teasers often create hype in media to such extent that they get leaked. &quot;&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot; and &quot;&quot; prove to be such examples. The teaser (the director&#x27;s version) of &quot;2.0&quot; was released weeks before it was officially released on YouTube.

DVD and Blu-ray releases of movies will usually contain both their teaser and theatrical trailers as special features. One exception to this rule is &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, whose teaser trailer featured an unrelated plot of bank robbers escaping in a helicopter, getting caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net, then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the two towers at the World Trade Center. This teaser was pulled from theaters following the September 11, 2001 attacks, but it can be viewed on YouTube.

<text>Thomas Sutpen is a focal character of William Faulkner&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; Sutpen arrives in Faulkner&#x27;s imaginary Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, in the 1830s and establishes a 64,000-acre (100-square-mile) plantation, Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred, in an attempt to create his own dynasty. It is eventually revealed that Sutpen was born to a poor white family in what became West Virginia before moving to the Tidewater region of Virginia, where he was the first privy to the aristocratic plantation culture of the Antebellum South.

When he was fourteen, running errands for his father, Sutpen was instructed by a black servant to use the back door of the plantation house. This led him to renounce his family and social position. He traveled to the West Indies to build his own plantation and start a lineage, in accordance with his &quot;design&quot;. The discovery that his wife was part black, making his son Charles Bon part black, caused him to leave them behind and relocate to Yoknapatawpha County, where he built a new plantation. The sins of his past and his indiscriminate sexual practices eventually cause the downfall of his empire in the early 20th century.

The short story &quot;Wash&quot;, which was later incorporated into the seventh chapter of &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, focuses on Sutpen&#x27;s death. Sutpen is also referenced in &quot;The Reivers&quot;.

<text>Duane Tolbert Gish (February 17, 1921 – March 5, 2013) was an American biochemist and a prominent member of the creationist movement. A young Earth creationist, Gish was a former vice-president of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) and the author of numerous publications about creation science.

Gish was called &quot;creationism&#x27;s T. H. Huxley&quot; for the way he &quot;relished the confrontations&quot; of formal debates with prominent evolutionary biologists, usually held on university campuses, while abandoning formal debating principles, in a style that came to be known as the Gish gallop. A creationist publication noted in his obituary that &quot;it was perhaps his personal presentation that carried the day. In short, the audiences liked him.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Gish, a twin, was born in White City, Kansas, the youngest of nine children. He served in World War II, attaining the rank of captain, and was awarded the Bronze Star. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from University of California, Los Angeles, in 1949, and he obtained his biochemistry Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953. He worked as an assistant research associate at Berkeley, and as an assistant professor at Cornell University Medical College for eighteen years, joining the Upjohn Company as a research associate in 1960.

==Creationism==
A Methodist from age ten, and later a fundamentalist Baptist, Gish believed that the Genesis creation narrative was historical fact. After reading the booklet &quot;Evolution, &quot;Science Falsely So-called&quot;&quot; in the late 1950s, Gish became persuaded that science had produced falsifiable evidence against evolutionary theory, particularly the origin of life, and that various fields of science offered corroborating evidence in support of the Genesis creation narrative. He joined the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an association of Christian scientists, mistakenly assuming the group supported creationism. Through his affiliation at the ASA, Gish met geneticist and creationist William J. Tinkle, who in 1961 invited Gish to join a newly formed anti-evolution caucus within the ASA.

In 1971, Gish became a member of the faculty at San Diego Christian College, working in its research division before accepting a position at the Institute for Creation Research (independent since 1981). He was the author of several books and articles espousing creationism. His best-known work, &quot;Evolution: The Fossils Say No!&quot;, published in 1972, has been widely accepted by creationists as an authoritative reference. Gish initially &quot;assigned low priority to the question of [the] age [of the Earth]&quot;.

At his death on March 5, 2013, Gish held the position of Senior Vice-President Emeritus at the ICR.

==Debates==

Gish&#x27;s debating opponents said that he used a rapid-fire approach during a debate, presenting arguments and changing topics quickly. Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, dubbed this approach the &quot;Gish gallop&quot;, describing it as &quot;where the creationist is allowed to run on for 45 minutes or an hour, spewing forth torrents of error that the evolutionist hasn&#x27;t a prayer of refuting in the format of a debate&quot;. She also criticized Gish for failing to answer objections raised by his opponents. 

However, Gish said a similar thing about his debate opponents, especially Kenneth Miller. Gish accused Miller of using spread debating, i.e. speaking very fast and bringing up so many points that there was no chance to answer them all.

Gish was also criticized for using a standardized presentation during debates. While undertaking research for a debate with Gish, Michael Shermer noted that Gish re-used similar openings, assumptions about his opponent, slides, and even jokes. For example, during the debate, Gish attempted to prove that Shermer was indeed an atheist and therefore immoral, even though Shermer said he was not an atheist and was willing to accept the existence of a divine creator. Massimo Pigliucci, who debated Gish five times, said that Gish ignored evidence contrary to his religious beliefs. Robert Schadewald accused Gish of stonewalling arguments with fabricated data.

<doc id="367604" wikidata="Q5329438" url="?curid=367604" title="East Street Market">
<text>East Street Market also known locally as &#x27;East Street&#x27;, &#x27;The Lane&#x27;, or &#x27;East Lane&#x27;, is a street market in Walworth in South East London.

==Location==
East Street is in the London Borough of Southwark and is between Walworth Road on the western side and the Old Kent Road on the Eastern side.

The market runs down East Street from the junction with Walworth Road to Dawes Street, passing East Street Baptist Church and a multitude of shops. The main entrance to the market is from Walworth Road. A bus stop on Walworth road serves the market, with buses arriving from Elephant and Castle or Camberwell Green. These include bus numbers 12, 35, 40, 45, 68, 148, 171, 176 and 468.

==History==

There has been street trading in the Walworth area since the 16th Century, when farmers rested their livestock on Walworth Common before continuing to the city. During the Industrial Revolution, stalls lined the whole of the Walworth Road, but the market has only been officially running since 1880.

In the 17th century, the area through which East Street now runs was rural fields and ‘common’ land where people could graze their animals. The area to the north was known as ‘Lock&#x27;s Field’ and, in 1878, was described as little more than ‘a dreary swamp’. Conditions improved and by 1881 it was recorded as a site for gypsies to stay during the winter months. To the south was Walworth Common; a popular point for the farmers of Kent and Surrey to stop overnight before making their journey into the city. People would buy produce directly from these drovers and eventually a market was established. 

Most of the land in the area was owned by the Church, but some was eventually sold or leased. By the 1770s, some land near the junction with Old Kent Road (known then simply as The Kent Road) was cultivated as a flower nursery by the Driver family, who were also responsible for commissioning the grand buildings at nearby Surrey Square. A legal document from 1780 describes the sale of the land which led to the creation of East Street as a public highway, connecting Walworth Road with the Kent Road. By the 1800s London was expanding rapidly. Open fields were built upon and in the 1860s, Walworth Common was developed. The old markets were moved onto the Walworth Road and the vegetable sellers (Costermongers) were joined by an array of other traders. In 1875, the electric tram ran down Walworth Road bringing to an end the market. After heated negotiations with the traders, the market was split up and moved into the side streets of Westmoreland Road, East Lane and Draper Street. Draper Street was built over in the 1960s by the Elephant and Castle development. The construction of the Aylesbury Estate led to the decline of the Westmoreland Road market. 

Unlike the regulated market which serves the shoppers on East Street today, the original traders did not have allocated plots for their stalls. At 8am, a policeman blew a whistle and traders would rush to claim the best pitches, with shop owners on the Lane claiming the patches outside their front doors. This ended in 1927 when the licensing system was introduced. Many local men were called up in the Second World War and the market declined. In 1948 it was described as &quot;a drab, dead thing, infinitely remote from the cockney tradition&quot;. However, the market survived and evolved. As the population of the area has diversified so have the goods on offer and, along with the traditional fruit and vegetables, the market now sells a mix of Caribbean food, ethnic clothing, CDs and household goods.

Recently, the Walworth Society has run an animated East Street tour to share the history of the market.

East Street was likely to have been the birthplace of Charlie Chaplin, although no birth certificate exists. It could therefore also have been the inspiration for his similarly named 1917 seminal short film &quot;Easy Street&quot;, a suggestion made as early as 1928 in the film &quot;The Life Story of Charlie Chaplin&quot; by Harry B. Parkinson and reasserted in David Robinson&#x27;s introduction to the most recent edition of &quot;My Autobiography&quot;, while the famous trousers and boots of Chaplin&#x27;s trademark tramp costume may have been inspired by the every-day clothes Chaplin saw worn in what he called East Lane market.

It also features in the title sequence to the television programme &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.

==Produce==
The market sells inexpensive new and second-hand clothing, jewellery, cosmetics, household products, confectionery, fruit and vegetables, CDs and DVDs, shoes, bags and hats, books, cards, meat and fish. The eclectic mix of fresh food ranges from cassava to courgettes, durian fruit to eel, sheep heads to cow hooves.

==Opening times==
The market is open every day except Monday: Tuesday to Friday 8am–5pm, Saturday 8am–6:30pm, Sunday 8am–2pm (though often is open until late afternoon). Saturday is the busiest day as the market consists of over 250 stalls including the weekly plant market. A small flea market operates on Sundays near Nursery Row Park towards the Old Kent Road side of East Street.

==Politics==
East street forms the boundary between two parliamentary constituencies and is therefore in the unusual position of being represented by two members of parliament. The north side of the street is in the Bermondsey and Old Southwark (before 2010 called North Southwark and Bermondsey) constituency which was represented for 32 years by Simon Hughes of the Liberal Democrats and since 2015 by Neil Coyle of the Labour Party. The south side of East Street is represented by Harriet Harman, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Camberwell and Peckham.

Similarly, East Street forms the boundary line between the wards of East Walworth on the north side and Faraday on the south side, both in the London Borough of Southwark. East Street is therefore represented in Southwark Council by six councillors, all Labour. The East Walworth councillors are Helen Morrissey, Martin Seaton and Darren Merrill. Faraday ward is represented by Dan Garfield, Lorraine Lauder and Abdul Mohammed.

East Street is under the jurisdiction of Walworth Community Council.

==East Street market today==

Southwark has an ethnically diverse and youthful population – and the East Street market venders and shoppers reflect this diversity. Southwark has the highest proportion of residents in the UK who were born in Africa (13%), as well as a significant population from Latin America, with 75% of reception-age (4–5 years old) children from black and minority ethnic groups. Over 120 languages are spoken in Southwark, with 11% of households having no member of the household who has English as a first language.

Some vendors have expressed concern about the implications of the redevelopment of the surrounding area for the market. In 2015, it was the subject of several immigration raids.

<doc id="367616" wikidata="Q167206" url="?curid=367616" title="Pom Poko">
<text>is a 1994 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Isao Takahata, animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Hakuhodo, and distributed by Toho.

The film centers around a colony of Japanese raccoon dogs living in the outskirts of Tokyo as they work to combat the growing deforestation of their home. Takahata&#x27;s third film for Ghibli, &quot;Pom Poko&quot; was released on July 16, 1994, to critical and commercial success. The film was Japan&#x27;s submission to the 67th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Background==
The story features &quot;tanuki&quot;, or Japanese raccoon dogs (incorrectly referred to as &quot;raccoons&quot; in the English dialog). In Japanese folklore, &quot;tanuki&quot; are considered to be bake-danuki (化け狸), magical creatures capable of shape-shifting into people or other objects. They are a highly sociable, mischievous species, too fun-loving and fond of tasty treats to be a real threat — unlike &quot;kitsune&quot; (fox spirits) and other &quot;bake-danuki&quot; shape-shifters.

The phrase &quot;Pom Poko&quot; in the title refers to the sound of &quot;tanuki&quot; drumming their bellies, from a 1919 poem by Ujō Noguchi which became a popular children&#x27;s song when it was set to music in 1925.

Shigeru Sugiura and Hisashi Inoue and Shigeru Mizuki were credited as additional crews, as designs of tanuki and various yokai and parts of the plot were based on their works. A character based on Mizuki also appeared as the commentator in the film.

==Plot==
The story begins in late 1960s Japan. A group of &quot;tanuki&quot; are threatened by a gigantic suburban development project called New Tama, in the Tama Hills on the outskirts of Tokyo. The development is cutting into their forest habitat and dividing their land. The story resumes in early 1990s Japan, during the early years of the Heisei era. With limited living space and food decreasing every year, the &quot;tanuki&quot; begin fighting among themselves for the diminishing resources, but at the urging of the matriarch Oroku, they decide to unify to stop the development.

Several &quot;tanuki&quot; lead the resistance, including the aggressive chief Gonta, the old guru Seizaemon, the wise-woman Oroku, and the young and resourceful Shoukichi. Using their illusion skills (which they must re-learn after having forgotten them), they stage a number of diversions including industrial sabotage. These attacks injure and even kill people, frightening construction workers into quitting, but more workers immediately replace them. In desperation, the &quot;tanuki&quot; send out messengers to seek help from various legendary elders from other regions.

After several years, one of the messengers returns bringing a trio of elders from the distant island of Shikoku, where development is not a problem and the &quot;tanuki&quot; are still worshipped. In an effort at re-establishing respect for the supernatural, the group stages a massive ghost parade to make the humans think the town is haunted. The strain of the massive illusion kills one of the elders and his spirit is lifted up in a &quot;raigō&quot;, and the effort seems wasted when the owner of a nearby theme park takes credit for the parade, claiming it was a publicity stunt.

With this setback, the unity of the &quot;tanuki&quot; finally fails and they break up into smaller groups, each following a different strategy. One group led by Gonta takes the route of eco-terrorism, holding off workers until they are wiped out in a pitched battle with the police, and finally, fused into the form of a &quot;tsurube-otoshi&quot;, killed blocking the path of an oncoming dekotora. Another group desperately attempts to gain media attention through television appearances to plead their case against the habitat&#x27;s destruction. One of the elders becomes senile and starts a Buddhist dancing cult among the &quot;tanuki&quot; who are unable to transform, eventually sailing away with them in a ship that takes them to their deaths, while the other elder investigates joining the human world as the last of the transforming &quot;kitsune&quot; (foxes) have already done.

When all else fails, in a last act of defiance, the remaining &quot;tanuki&quot; stage a grand illusion, temporarily transforming the urbanized land back into its pristine state to remind everyone of what has been lost. Finally, with their strength exhausted, the &quot;tanuki&quot; most trained in illusion follow the example of the &quot;kitsune&quot;: they blend into human society one by one, abandoning those who cannot transform. While the media appeal comes too late to stop the construction, the public responds sympathetically to the &quot;tanuki&quot;, pushing the developers to set aside some areas as parks. However, the parks are too small to accommodate all the non-transforming &quot;tanuki&quot;. Some try to survive there, dodging traffic to rummage through human scraps for food, while others disperse farther out to the countryside to compete with the &quot;tanuki&quot; who are already there.

One day, Shoukichi, who also joined the human world, is coming home from work when he sees a non-transformed &quot;tanuki&quot; leaping into a gap in a wall. Shoukichi crawls into the gap and follows the path, which leads to a grassy clearing where some of his former companions are gathering. He joyfully transforms back into a &quot;tanuki&quot; to join them. Shoukichi&#x27;s friend, Ponkichi, addresses the viewer, asking humans to be more considerate of &quot;tanuki&quot; and other animals less endowed with transformation skills, and not to destroy their living space; as the view pulls out and away, their surroundings are revealed as a golf course within a suburban sprawl.

<doc id="367618" wikidata="Q200666" url="?curid=367618" title="Robert Fortune">
<text>Robert Fortune (16 September 1812 – 13 April 1880) was a Scottish botanist, plant hunter and traveller, best known for introducing around 250 new ornamental plants, mainly from China, but also Japan, into the gardens of Britain, Australia, and North America. He also played a role in the development of the tea industry in India in the 19th century. He also imported Japanese Chestnuts into the United States, which led to the start of the Chestnut Blight 24 years after his death.

==Life==
Fortune was born in 1812 in the small settlement or &quot;fermtoun&quot; of Kelloe in the parish of Edrom, Berwickshire. After completing his apprenticeship, he was then employed at Moredun House, just to the south of Edinburgh, before then moving on to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. In 1840, he and his family moved to London to take up a position at the Horticultural Society of London&#x27;s garden at Chiswick. Following the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, in early 1843, he was commissioned by the Horticultural Society to undertake a three-year plant collection expedition to southern China.

His travels resulted in the introduction to Europe, Australia, and North America of many flowers and plants. His most famous accomplishment was the successful introduction, although it was not the first by any means, of Chinese tea plants (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;), along with skilled tea makers, from China to India in 1848 on behalf of the British East India Company. Robert Fortune worked in China for several years in the period from 1843 to 1861. 

Similar to other European travellers of the period, such as Walter Medhurst, Fortune disguised himself as a Chinese merchant during several, but not all, of his journeys beyond the newly established treaty port areas. Not only was Fortune&#x27;s purchase of tea plants reportedly forbidden by the Chinese government of the time, but his travels were also beyond the allowable day&#x27;s journey from the European treaty ports. Fortune travelled to some areas of China that had seldom been visited by Europeans, including remote areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangsu provinces.

Fortune employed many means to obtain plants and seedlings from local tea growers, although this was some 150 years before international biodiversity laws recognised state ownership of such natural resources. He is also known for his use of Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward&#x27;s portable Wardian cases to sustain the plants. It is also widely reported that he took skilled workers on contract to India who would facilitate the production of tea in the plantations of the East India Company. With the exception of a few plants that survived in established Indian gardens, most of the Chinese tea plants Fortune introduced in the northwestern provinces of India perished. The other reason for the failure in India was that the British preference and fashion was for a strong dark tea brew, which was best made from the local Assam subspecies (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;) and not the selection that Fortune had made in China. The technology and knowledge that was brought over from China was, however, instrumental in the later flourishing of the Indian tea industry in Assam and Sri Lanka.

In subsequent journeys, he visited Formosa (Taiwan) and Japan, and described the culture of the silkworm and the manufacture of rice. He introduced many trees, shrubs, and flowers to the West, including the cumquat, a climbing double yellow rose (&#x27;Fortune&#x27;s Double Yellow&#x27; (syn. Gold of Ophir) which proved a failure in England&#x27;s climate), and many varieties of tree peonies, azaleas and chrysanthemums. A climbing white rose that he brought back from China in 1850, believed to be a natural cross between &quot;Rosa laevigata&quot; and &quot;R. banksiae&quot;, was dubbed &quot;R. fortuniana&quot; (syn. &quot;R. fortuneana&quot;) in his honour. This rose, too, proved a failure in England, preferring warmer climates. Today, both of these roses are still widely grown by antique rose fanciers in mild winter regions. &quot;Rosa fortuniana&quot; also serves as a valuable rootstock in Australia and the southern regions of the United States.

He related his travels in a series of books. He died in London in 1880, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Fortune is credited with the introduction of a large number of plants, shrubs, and trees to Europe from China. In 1913, botanists Rehder and E.H.Wilson named a plant genus from China, with one species, &quot;Fortunearia sinensis&quot;, in his honour.

<doc id="367621" wikidata="Q11703678" url="?curid=367621" title="Section (fiber bundle)">
<text>In the mathematical field of topology, a section (or cross section) of a fiber bundle formula_1 is a continuous right inverse of the projection function formula_2. In other words, if formula_1 is a fiber bundle over a base space, formula_4:
:formula_5
then a section of that fiber bundle is a continuous map,
:formula_6
such that
:formula_7 for all formula_8.

A section is an abstract characterization of what it means to be a graph. The graph of a function formula_9 can be identified with a function taking its values in the Cartesian product formula_10, of formula_11 and formula_12:
:formula_13

Let formula_14 be the projection onto the first factor: formula_15. Then a graph is any function formula_16 for which formula_7.

The language of fibre bundles allows this notion of a section to be generalized to the case when formula_1 is not necessarily a Cartesian product. If formula_14 is a fibre bundle, then a section is a choice of point formula_20 in each of the fibres. The condition formula_7 simply means that the section at a point formula_22 must lie over formula_22. (See image.)

For example, when formula_1 is a vector bundle a section of formula_1 is an element of the vector space formula_26 lying over each point formula_27. In particular, a vector field on a smooth manifold formula_28 is a choice of tangent vector at each point of formula_28: this is a &quot;section&quot; of the tangent bundle of formula_28. Likewise, a 1-form on formula_28 is a section of the cotangent bundle.

Sections, particularly of principal bundles and vector bundles, are also very important tools in differential geometry. In this setting, the base space formula_4 is a smooth manifold formula_28, and formula_1 is assumed to be a smooth fiber bundle over formula_28 (i.e., formula_1 is a smooth manifold and formula_37 is a smooth map). In this case, one considers the space of smooth sections of formula_1 over an open set formula_39, denoted formula_40. It is also useful in geometric analysis to consider spaces of sections with intermediate regularity (e.g., formula_41 sections, or sections with regularity in the sense of Hölder conditions or Sobolev spaces).

== Local and global sections ==

Fiber bundles do not in general have such &quot;global&quot; sections (consider, for example, the fiber bundle over formula_42 with fiber formula_43 obtained by taking the Möbius bundle and removing the zero section), so it is also useful to define sections only locally. A local section of a fiber bundle is a continuous map formula_44 where formula_39 is an open set in formula_4 and formula_47 for all formula_48 in formula_39. If formula_50 is a local trivialization of formula_1, where formula_52 is a homeomorphism from formula_53 to formula_54 (where formula_55 is the fiber), then local sections always exist over formula_39 in bijective correspondence with continuous maps from formula_39 to formula_55. The (local) sections form a sheaf over formula_4 called the sheaf of sections of formula_1.

The space of continuous sections of a fiber bundle formula_1 over formula_39 is sometimes denoted formula_63, while the space of global sections of formula_1 is often denoted formula_65 or formula_66.

=== Extending to global sections ===

Sections are studied in homotopy theory and algebraic topology, where one of the main goals is to account for the existence or non-existence of global sections. An obstruction denies the existence of global sections since the space is too &quot;twisted&quot;. More precisely, obstructions &quot;obstruct&quot; the possibility of extending a local section to a global section due to the space&#x27;s &quot;twistedness&quot;. Obstructions are indicated by particular characteristic classes, which are cohomological classes. For example, a principal bundle has a global section if and only if it is trivial. On the other hand, a vector bundle always has a global section, namely the zero section. However, it only admits a nowhere vanishing section if its Euler class is zero.

==== Generalizations ====

Obstructions to extending local sections may be generalized in the following manner: take a topological space and form a category whose objects are open subsets, and morphisms are inclusions. Thus we use a category to generalize a topological space. We generalize the notion of a &quot;local section&quot; using sheaves of abelian groups, which assigns to each object an abelian group (analogous to local sections).

There is an important distinction here: intuitively, local sections are like &quot;vector fields&quot; on an open subset of a topological space. So at each point, an element of a &quot;fixed&quot; vector space is assigned. However, sheaves can &quot;continuously change&quot; the vector space (or more generally abelian group).

This entire process is really the global section functor, which assigns to each sheaf its global section. Then sheaf cohomology enables us to consider a similar extension problem while &quot;continuously varying&quot; the abelian group. The theory of characteristic classes generalizes the idea of obstructions to our extensions.

<doc id="367623" wikidata="Q465837" url="?curid=367623" title="Skyline">
<text>A skyline is the or shape viewed near the horizon. It can be created by a city&#x27;s overall structure, or by human intervention in a rural setting, or in nature that is formed where the sky meets buildings or the land.

City skylines serve as a pseudo-fingerprint as no two skylines are alike. For this reason, news and sports programs, television shows, and movies often display the skyline of a city to set a location. The term &quot;The Sky Line of New York City&quot; was introduced in 1896, when it was the title of a color lithograph by Charles Graham for the color supplement of the &quot;New York Journal&quot;. Paul D. Spreiregen, FAIA, has called a [city] skyline &quot;a physical representation [of a city&#x27;s] facts of life ... a potential work of art ... its collective vista.&quot;

==Features==
===High-rise buildings===
High-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, are the fundamental feature of urban skylines. Both contours and cladding (brick or glass) make an impact on the overall appearance of a skyline.

===Towers===

Towers from different eras make for contrasting skylines.

San Gimignano, in Tuscany, Italy, has been described as having an &quot;unforgettable skyline&quot; with its competitively built towers.

===Remote locations===

Some remote locations have notably striking skylines, created either by nature or by sparse human settlement in an environment not conducive to housing significant populations.

==Use in media==
Skylines are often used as s and establishing shots in film, television programs, news websites, and in other forms of media.

==Subjective ranking==
Several services rank skylines based on their own subjective criteria. Emporis is one such service, which uses height and other data to give point values to buildings and add them together for skylines. The three cities it ranks highest are Hong Kong, New York City, and Singapore.

<doc id="367630" wikidata="Q4921208" url="?curid=367630" title="Black Madonna Shrine and Grottos">
<text>The Black Madonna Shrine and Grottos is a Catholic Marian shrine complex located in the unincorporated area south of Pacific, Missouri in the United States. It was constructed beginning in 1938 by Brother Bronislaus Luszcz, a Polish immigrant of the Franciscan order.

==History==
In 1927, John J. Glennon, Archbishop of St. Louis requested a group of Franciscans to come from Poland to set up a nursing home in the countryside. A number of Franciscan Missionary Brothers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus emigrated from Poland to the St. Louis area. Among them was Brother Bronislaus Luszcz, age thirty-four. They were given an abandoned convent in the foothills of the Ozarks, and built an infirmary. The brothers had a small farm that produced food for the infirmary and brothers. The Black Madonna Shrine is adjacent to the site of the infirmary which closed in 2008.

In 1937, Brother Bronislaus began clearing the thickly wooded land, built a cedar wood chapel and hung a portrait of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa above the altar. The image is referred as the Black Madonna because of its dark brown skin tones. The chapel soon became a center of religious devotion, with numerous pilgrimages, prayer services and masses being offered. A picnic pavilion is on site.

The Black Madonna Shrine was built out of his devotion to Mary, and dedicated to her as &quot;Queen of Peace and Mercy&quot;. After completing the chapel, Brother Bronislaus began building grottoes, using concrete and native Missouri tiff rock acquired from the nearby mining town of Potosi. The stone and rock structures are made to resemble natural cave formations. The grottos feature statues of Saint Francis, Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Jesus and the disciples at Gethsemane, Our Lady of Sorrows, Mary&#x27;s Assumption, and the Nativity. Each is an intricate mosaic with seashells, costume jewelry, ceramic figurines, and colorful bits brought to him by pilgrims from time to time. Cake pans shaped like lambs and rabbits became molds for the concrete animals that sit at the feet of St. Francis. The altar stone at the Our Lady of Sorrows Grotto is from the original monastery chapel. The Crucifix of the Gethsemane Grotto is used as landmark by local hikers making their way through the nearby woods.

Brother Bronislaus spent twenty three years building the shrine, and died from heat stroke in 1960 at the age of sixty-six, while working on a grotto of Our Lady of Fatima.

The shrine has been subjected to arson and vandalism many times in its history. In 1958 an arsonist set fire to the altar which burned the chapel. An open-air chapel was built in the early 1960s to replace the burned chapel. Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, Primate of Poland, donated a painting to replace one lost in the fire. John Carberry, Cardinal Archbishop of St. Louis donated a glass-encased icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa from the former Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa in St. Louis.

In 2013, a thief broke into shrine gift shop and stole some sterling silver medals, silver plated necklaces, and a donation jar containing change.

<text>Ujiji is the oldest town in western Tanzania and is located in Kigoma-Ujiji District of Kigoma Region. Originally a Swahili settlement and then an Arab slave trading post by the mid-nineteenth century nominally under the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the town is the oldest in western Tanzania. In 1900, the population was estimated at 10,000 and in 1967 about 41,000. The site is a registered National Historic Site.

==History==

Historically the town that is now Ujiji was the home of the Jiji people. The settlement has close connections with the Swahili community of Buyenzi north of Lake Tanganyika in Burundi. 
Ujiji is the place where Richard Burton and John Speke first reached the shore of Lake Tanganyika in 1858. It is the site of the famous meeting on 10 November 1871 when Henry Stanley found Dr. David Livingstone, and reputedly uttered the famous words “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” Livingstone, whom many thought dead as no news had been heard of him for several years and who had only arrived back in Ujiji the day before, wrote “When my spirits were at their lowest ebb, the good Samaritan was close at hand, for one morning [my servant] Susi came running at the top of his speed and gasped out, ‘An Englishman! I see him!’ and off he darted to meet him. The American flag at the head of the caravan told of the nationality of the stranger. Bales of goods, baths of tin, huge kettles, cooking pots, tents, etc., made me think, ‘This must be a luxurious traveller, and not one at his wits’ end like me.’”

A monument known as the &quot;Dr. Livingstone Memorial&quot; was erected in Ujiji to commemorate the meeting. There is also a modest museum. There is a former slave route near the market. In 1878, the London Missionary Society established their first missionary post on the shore of Lake Tanganyika at Ujiji. Some in Burundi claim the location of the famous meeting is a few miles south of the former capital Bujumbura. However, the Livingstone-Stanley Monument in Mugere actually marks a visit the two men made 15 days later on their joint exploration of northern Lake Tanganyika.

Liwaliate of Ujiji or sometimes known as the Sultanate of Ujiji was a vassal state of Omani Empire and then Zanzibar Sultanate in Ujiji town established in 1830s under the auspices of Arab oligarchs of Ujiji town during slave trade.

<text>The following is the order of precedence in England and Wales as of 2025. Separate orders exist for men and women.

Names in italics indicate that these people rank elsewhere—either higher in that table of precedence or in the table for the other sex. Titles in italics indicate the same thing for their holders, or that they are vacant.

Peers and their families make up a large part of these tables. It is possible for a peer to hold more than one title of nobility, and these may belong to different ranks and peerages. A peer derives his precedence from his highest-ranking title; peeresses derive their precedence in the same way, whether they hold their highest-ranking title in their own right or by marriage. The ranks in the tables refer to peers rather than titles: if exceptions are named for a rank, these do not include peers of a higher rank (or any peers at all, in the case of baronets). No exceptions are named for most categories, owing to their large size.

<doc id="367635" wikidata="Q953063" url="?curid=367635" title="Treaty of Westminster (1674)">
<text>The Treaty of Westminster of 1674 was the peace treaty that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Signed by the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, the treaty provided for the return of the colony of New Netherland (now New York) to England and renewed the Treaty of Breda of 1667. The treaty also provided for a mixed commission for the regulation of commerce, particularly in the East Indies.

It was signed on 9 February 1674 Old Style (19 February 1674 New Style) by Charles II of England and ratified by the States General of the Netherlands on 5 March 1674. England was forced to sign the treaty since Parliament would not allow more money to be spent on the war and had become aware of the secret Treaty of Dover in which Charles had promised Louis XIV of France to convert to Catholicism at an opportune moment. The English were dismayed by the unexpected fact that Dutch raiders had managed to capture more English ships than vice versa and that New Amsterdam had been retaken by the Dutch in 1673.

==Background==
In 1672, England and France had jointly attacked the Dutch Republic. France had occupied a large part of the Republic, but the Anglo-French fleet had been heavily damaged by Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. In 1673, sustained efforts by the Royal Navy to defeat the Dutch fleet and to land an army on the Dutch coast had failed. Repairs of the English warships proved to be very costly. English mercantile shipping suffered from frequent attacks by Dutch privateers. Meanwhile, France, the English ally in the war, was forced to a gradual withdrawal of its troops from most of the territory of the United Provinces. France threatened to conquer the Spanish Netherlands, which would harm English strategic interests. The war, more or less a private project of Charles and never popular among the English people, now seemed to most to have become a hopeless undertaking.

The English had also been convinced by Dutch propaganda that the war was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic again. The commander of the Royal Navy, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a devout Protestant, had begun to lead a vociferous movement aimed at breaking the French alliance. In late October, Charles asked Parliament for a sufficient war budget for 1674. Its members were extremely critical and denied that it was still necessary to eliminate the Dutch as commercial rivals because English trade had satisfyingly grown between 1667 and 1672. The proposed marriage of the King&#x27;s brother, the Duke of York, with the Catholic Mary of Modena was lamented. Parliament demanded securities for the defence of the Anglican Church against papism, the disbanding of the standing army (commanded by York) and the removal of pro-French ministers.

When the situation threatened to escalate, Charles, on the advice of the French envoy but against the opinion of the Privy Council, prorogued Parliament. Charles made a last effort to continue the war, even without a war budget. He was promised increased subsidies by King Louis XIV of France. He made plans to capture the regular treasure fleet sailing from the Dutch East Indies. He removed his enemies from office, among them Chancellor Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, the main opponent of York&#x27;s marriage. At the same time, Charles tried to lessen fears by reaffirming anti-Catholic measures such as the suspension of the Royal Declaration of Indulgence and by publicising many of his secret treaties with France.

To his dismay, Parliament became more adversarial, now strongly incited by Shaftesbury. Some called for William III of Orange, the stadtholder of Holland and grandson of Charles I of England, to become king if Charles died by excluding the Duke of York. That came as no surprise to William, who had secret dealings with Shaftesbury and many other English politicians. William had agents working for him in England, such as his secretary, Van Rhede. Spain assisted him by threatening to declare war and meanwhile bribing parliamentarians. The States-General had supported the pro-Dutch peace party of Lord Arlington in a more formal manner by making a peace proposal in October and by regularly distributing manifests and declarations in England that explained the official Dutch position and policy. In 1672, England and France had agreed never to conclude a separate peace, but the States now revealed to Charles that they had recently received a peace offer from Louis.

When in late December, General François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg withdrew the bulk of the French occupation army from Maastricht to Namur, Charles lost faith completely and decided to disentangle himself from the entire affair.

==Procedure==
Charles felt that continuing the alliance with France had become a grave threat to his personal position and expected that Parliament would no longer fund the war. He informed the French ambassador, Colbert de Croissy, that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort. He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno, that his main war aim, to install his noble nephew as stadtholder, having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations if only some minor &quot;indemnities&quot; could be paid. At first, the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles&#x27;s demands. As England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was in their opinion not entitled to any reward. Many members admitted their personal satisfaction in the thought that the British might be kept suffering a bit longer. However, stadtholder William III of Orange convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war against France eventually, which this had to take precedence over petty considerations of retribution that were unworthy of their high office. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.

On 4 January 1674, the States General of the Netherlands drafted a final peace proposal. On 7 January, a Dutch trumpeter arrived in Harwich carrying with him two letters for the Spanish consul. Though the herald was promptly arrested by the town mayor, the letters were sent to Lord Arlington, who hurriedly brought them in person to del Fresno. Arlington was, in turn, on 15 January, impeached by Sir Gilbert Gerard for high treason, as the very act showed him to have had secret dealings with the enemy. On 24 January, the consul handed the letters, containing the peace proposal, to Charles, who pretended to be greatly surprised. That posing was marred somewhat by the fact that he had especially recalled Parliament, prorogued by him in November, for that occasion the very same day. While addressing both Houses, Charles first emphatically denied the existence of any secret provisions of the Treaty of Dover and then produced the peace proposal, to the great satisfaction of the members, who, in turn, had to pretend surprise although Parliament had been informed by the Dutch beforehand of its full content. After some days of debate, the treaty was approved by Parliament.

This news was met with open joy by the populace. Charles sent his own trumpeter to Holland, who was received by the States General on 1 February. In his message, Charles announced the absolute agreement of himself and Parliament on the matter to which institution Charles gladly deferred. On 5 February, a Dutch trumpeter arrived in London, carrying the response of the States General. The very day, Parliament advised the King to conclude a &quot;speedy peace&quot;. A Royal Commission was appointed to make a final draft. The Treaty of Westminster was signed in 1674 by the King on 9 February Old Style (19 February New Style). It was ratified by the Lord Keeper on 10 February by placement of the Great Seal. On 17 February at 10:00 a.m., it was publicly proclaimed at Whitehall. It was approved by the States of Holland and West Friesland on 4 March, (New Style) and ratified by the States General on 5 March. It was proclaimed in The Hague on 6 March. Due to the different calendars in use in the two countries and the complex procedure, when a single date is given the literature is not in agreement.

==Terms==
Most of the initial peace conditions demanded by the English in the Accord of Heeswijk of 1672 were not met, but the Dutch paid two million guilders, from an original demand of ten million, to be paid over a period of three years, basically to compensate for the loss of French subsidies, and again affirmed the English right of salute, their &quot;Dominium Marium&quot;, now extended from &quot;Lands End&quot;, at the Bay of Biscay, northward to &quot;Staten Land&quot;, on the Norwegian coast. Also, it was made explicit that the Dutch had to salute any Royal ship carrying the English flag, no matter how small it was or how numerous the Dutch fleet was in encountering it, a point that had proven to be very contentious: the so-called Merlin Incident had been a pretext for the war. It was qualified by the condition that Dutch fishery would in no way be impeded by that right.

The treaty conditions of 1668 regulating trade and shipping were reconfirmed. Within three months an Anglo-Dutch commission would meet to solve trade conflicts concerning the East Indies. As for territorial disputes, the treaty was a typical &quot;status quo ante&quot; arrangement:

:&quot;That whatsoever countries, islands, towns, ports, castles, or forts have or shall be taken on both sides, since the time the late unhappy war broke out, either in Europe or elsewhere, shall be restored to the former lord or proprietor, in the same condition they shall be in when the peace itself shall be proclaimed.&quot;

The condition implied that New Netherland, which had been retaken by Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest in 1673, would again be an English possession and that Suriname, which had been captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, legalising the status quo of 1667. These issues had been left undecided by the Peace of Breda of that year, an &quot;uti possidetis&quot; agreement. Also, the islands of Tobago, Saba, St Eustatius and Tortola, which had been taken by the English in 1672, were to be returned.

Despite the peace, the brigade of British troops under Charles&#x27;s bastard son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, supporting the French, would not be withdrawn from the French Army and would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War. Charles continued to receive secret subsidies from Louis as long as the brigade fought on the French side.

==Implementation==
As the peace could not be communicated quickly to all parts of the world, different dates had been determined upon which legal hostilities would end. From the Soundings of England, i.e. its southwestern continental shelf edge, to the coast of Norway, fighting should end by 8 March; south to Tangier by 7 April; from there to the Equator, by 5 May; and in the rest of the world, after 24 October 1674.

Due to the slow proliferation of information at the time, conflicts could still occur after the declaration of peace. The Battle of Ronas Voe took place on 14 March 1674, when the VOC East Indiaman &quot;Wapen van Rotterdam&quot; was captured in Ronas Voe, Shetland, by HMS &quot;Newcastle&quot;. It, along with HMS &quot;Cambridge&quot; and HMS &quot;Crown&quot;, were sent instructions to capture the vessel, which had become stranded in Shetland because of poor weather that had caused the ship to lose its masts and rudder. &quot;Wapen van Rotterdam&quot; was taken back to England as a prize of war. A contemporary Dutch newspaper reported that four hundred crew were originally on board &quot;Wapen van Rotterdam&quot;, but only a hundred prisoners were later being transported by &quot;Crown,&quot; which suggested that up to three hundred crew may have been killed although additional prisoners might have been transported on the other English ships.

Eventually, William would force Charles to set off the &quot;indemnities&quot; against the debts that he owed to the House of Orange, which had militarily supported his father, Charles I of England, during the English Civil War and so Charles II actually received very little.

<doc id="367636" wikidata="Q6296220" url="?curid=367636" title="Journalese">
<text>Journalese is the artificial or hyperbolic, and sometimes over-abbreviated, language regarded as characteristic of the news style used in popular media. Joe Grimm, formerly of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, likened journalese to a &quot;stage voice&quot;: &quot;We write journalese out of habit, sometimes from misguided training, and to sound urgent, authoritative and, well, journalistic. But it doesn&#x27;t do any of that.&quot;

==Examples==
As early as the 1880s, people criticized the stilted, cliched language used in journalism as journalese. Journalists, who write many similar stories under time pressure, may fall back on cliched or familiar phrases. Journalese often takes the form of specific turns of phrase, such as &quot;hammered out agreement&quot; or &quot;called for tighter restrictions&quot;. Terms with legal meanings, such as &quot;mayhem&quot;, may be overused to the point that they become meaningless. Journalese can also take the form of specific word choice. This is most obvious with the use of rare or archaic words such as &quot;ink&quot; (as a verb), &quot;nab&quot;, &quot;slated&quot;, &quot;ailing&quot;, &quot;quizzed&quot; (in place of &quot;asked&quot; or &quot;questioned&quot;), &quot;funnyman,&quot; or synonyms of &quot;attack&quot; to mean &quot;criticise&quot;. In some cases, this is due to fossil words that are present in idiomatic journalese statements. Journalese can be a result of a desire to save on page space by using shorter words or phrases. 

Brevity is particularly important in headlines, which have their own idiosyncratic style of writing called headlinese. Headlinese&#x27;s focus on using the smallest possible words has influenced the vocabulary choice of news stories themselves. Anthropomorphization is another form of journalese, such as with the use of the verb &quot;saw&quot; (past tense of &quot;see&quot;) in the phrase &quot;The 1990s saw an increase in crime&quot;, which is used to avoid using the past tense of &quot;increase&quot;, as in &quot;Crime increased in the 1990s&quot;. Other forms include use of onomatopoeia, genitives of place names (&quot;New York&#x27;s Central Park&quot; rather than &quot;Central Park, in New York&quot;), and gap filler articles like bus plunge stories.

Some people regard journalese with amusement, due to its frequent colourful use of language, and some terms can make news reports easier to understand, such as replacing complex jargon with simple and concise phrases. However, one critic says that &quot;lazy writing goes with lazy thought&quot;, and it is often a mark of a weak story with poor evidence or an attempt to dress up something as more significant or interesting. Political correspondent Robert Hutton said, &quot;Journalese is like a poker player&#x27;s tell: it shows that the reporter knows the story is flimsy, and he or she is trying to make it appear more solid.&quot; Other critics fault the use of the passive voice and similar constructions in journalese as a form of weasel wording where the writer chooses &quot;to hide the culprit&quot; of the action that the writer is describing. Newspaper subeditors (copy editors) are often trained to remove journalese, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; has a customised grammar checker that flags egregious journalese examples.

<doc id="367637" wikidata="Q751612" url="?curid=367637" title="Bronx High School of Science">
<text>The Bronx High School of Science is a public specialized high school in The Bronx in New York City. It is operated by the New York City Department of Education. Admission to Bronx Science involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. 

Founded in 1938 in the Bronx, New York City, Bronx Science is located in what is now Kingsbridge Heights, also known as Jerome Park, a neighborhood in the northwest portion of the Bronx. Although originally known for its focus on mathematics and science, Bronx Science also emphasizes the humanities and social sciences. 

Bronx Science has produced the most Nobel laureates in science of any secondary school in the world. Bronx Science alumni have also won three Turing Awards, sometimes unofficially referred to as the Nobel Prize in computer science; six National Medals of Science, the nation&#x27;s highest scientific honor; and nine Pulitzer Prizes.

The Bronx High School of Science is often called Bronx Science, Bronx Sci, BX Sci, and sometimes just Science. It was formerly called Science High and its founder, Morris Meister, is said to have frequently called the school &quot;The High School of Science&quot;.

==History==
===20th century===

Bronx High School of Science was founded in 1938 as a specialized science and math high school for boys, by resolution of the New York City Panel for Educational Policy, with Morris Meister as the first principal of the school. They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street, in the Fordham Road-Grand Concourse area of the Bronx. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935). The initial faculty were composed in part by a contingent from Stuyvesant High School.

Meister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors &quot;green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life.&quot;

From the beginning, the Parents Association and Principal Morris Meister campaigned for a new building. The number of students exceeded the capacity of the building on 184th Street, so the top floor of Public School 85 on Marion Avenue and 187th Street was used as the &quot;Annex&quot;. 

===21st century===
After twenty years, plans were finally completed for a new $8 million building, which was designed by the architectural firm of Emery Roth and Sons. The new building was on 205th Street near Bedford Park Boulevard, in a predominantly institutional area, between DeWitt Clinton High School and its large football field on one side, and Harris Field and Hunter College (now Lehman College) on the other. On March 3, 1959, students and faculty occupied the new building for the first time, solving the problem of how to move the books from the old library to the new in typical Bronx Science manner: on Friday afternoon each student took home five library books from the old building, and on Monday returned them to the new one.

They entered a school equipped with more modern classrooms, laboratories, and technical studio areas. The main lobby entrance featured a , Venetian glass mosaic mural overhead, depicting major figures from the history of science such as Marie Curie and Charles Darwin under the protective hands of a God-like figure representing knowledge, with this quote from John Dewey: &quot;Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.&quot; The mural, &quot;Humanities Protecting Biology, Physics, Chemistry&quot;, is an original work by Frank J. Reilly. Legions of students over the years, bemoaning the lack of swimming facilities, have sarcastically referred to the mural as &quot;the Science swimming pool&quot;, perpetuating the thesis that a choice was made to fund a mural rather than a pool in the new building.

In the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx youth street gangs were coming to the school, and that the Fordham Baldies would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did happen that spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in gym clothes, some students from the neighboring, all-male DeWitt Clinton High School charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors for the remainder of that year.

When Bronx Science celebrated its silver anniversary in June 1963, President John F. Kennedy hailed it as &quot;a significant and pathfinding example of a special program devoted to the development of the student gifted in science and mathematics.&quot; Kennedy had recently selected a 1943 Bronx High School of Science graduate, Harold Brown, as Director of Defense Research and Engineering; Brown would later serve as United States Secretary of Defense under President Jimmy Carter.

==Academics==

Bronx Science students take a college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of science, English, and social studies; three (usually four) years of math; two or three years of foreign language; and a year of fine arts, with required courses and a wide selection of electives, including honors and advanced placement (AP) classes, which allow students to place out of introductory college science courses. Over 100 unique courses are offered. All New York State Regents classes are offered, with the exception of earth science.

In the biological sciences, Bronx Science offers a special honors biology course, in addition to the Regents-level course, which includes additional laboratory exposure and intensive content. If students have already taken the Living Environment regents in 8th grade, they may take Regents-level or honors chemistry in freshman year. All students must take at least one year of a biological lab science at Bronx Science, a requirement that can be satisfied either by freshman biology or, if students took biology in middle school, one of the many advanced electives offered, including AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Psychology; non-AP advanced courses include animal behavior, cell biology, epidemiology, forensic science, microbiology, neuroscience, and nutritional science. Post-AP level classes in evolution, genetics, and psychology are also offered. In the physical science department, AP Chemistry and AP Physics are both offered, and both may be taken alongside introductory Regents-level courses in those respective classes. Electives offered include astronomy and astrophysics, electrical engineering, green design, organic chemistry, and post-AP Physics. In 2022, the school prepared to accept an astronomical observatory.

Freshmen at Bronx Science are required to take one-semester courses in research literacy and engineering, while sophomores take one-semester courses consisting of coding and rhetoric. Collectively, these are referred to as Foundational courses. Sophomore students may satisfy this requirement by instead taking a class in the research program, a three-year long program that culminates in an independent research project and final research paper that is submitted to Regeneron and other prestigious competitions in senior year. The research program is divided into biology, math, physical science/engineering, and social science research.

The mathematics department offers standard AP courses in AB/BC calculus, statistics, and computer science. Students can take precalculus alongside honors algebra 2 and trigonometry in their sophomore year, allowing them to take AP Calculus in their junior year. Post-AP courses in mathematics include multivariable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, ordinary differential equations, video game development, app development, game theory, and a newly introduced course in financial and actuarial math.

Students are required to take four years of English. AP English Language and AP English Literature are offered, along with journalism workshop and yearbook design. In junior year, students have the option to take the unique AP American Studies course, an interdisciplinary course that correlates the AP English Language and AP United States History courses, while in senior year, the AP English Literature course is divided into courses in creative writing and traditional literature. Four years of social studies or history classes are required. AP European History and AP World History are both offered in sophomore year in preparation for the Global History Regents, while juniors can take AP United States History to satisfy the U.S. history requirement. Senior social studies classes consist of several combinations of AP classes in U.S. Government and Politics, Comparative Government and Politics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics. Additional classes in social studies, which must be taken along with these ones, include AP Human Geography, race and gender, and unique classes in Holocaust leadership and speech and debate leadership. A minimum of 2 years of languages are required, if students had previously taken a year of language prior to high school. Bronx Science offers French, Spanish, Latin, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. At one time Hebrew, Russian, Korean, and German were also offered.

Students must also obtain credits from two terms of a class in the fine arts or the equivalent. The fine arts requirement is usually satisfied during Bronx Science&#x27;s Summer Program which offers Drama, Music, and Art. Students usually &quot;double up&quot; on two of these courses to satisfy the fine arts requirement for once and all during the time period of one summer. Students are expected to satisfy the arts requirement by the end of sophomore year. Students can also take art or music electives during the school year to satisfy the fine arts requirement by taking a music elective such as jazz band or an arts elective such as AP Art History or AP Studio Art during the regular school year. Health and physical education courses are also required, and the Health requirement may also be fulfilled during the Bronx Science Summer Program in addition to the two fine arts courses.

==Notes==

16. The scales annexed to the royal warrant of 1905, unfortunately, are not exhaustive of all rights of precedence, and appear to have been drawn up without a proper consideration of the Scots law of precedence. Where a person has been omitted from the scales, but has an undoubted precedence by the law of Scotland (such as barons, ambassadors and Irish peers created prior to 1801), the Lord Lyon, in seeing that the warrant is observed and kept, has a duty to give that person an appropriate place in the order of precedence on the appropriate occasion.

<text>Intra-species recognition is the recognition by a member of a species of a conspecific (another member of the same species). In many species, such recognition is necessary for procreation.

Different species may employ different methods, but all of them are based on one or more senses (after all, this is how the organism gathers information about the environment). The recognition may happen by chemical signature (smell), by having a distinctive shape or color (sight), by emitting certain sounds (hearing), or even by behaviour patterns. Often a combination of these is used.

Among human beings, the sense of sight is usually in charge of recognizing other members of the same species, with maybe the subconscious help of smell. In particular, the human brain has a disproportionate amount of processing power dedicated to finely analyze the features of a human face. This is why most humans are able to distinguish human beings from one other (barring look-alikes), and a human being from a similar species like some anthropomorphic ape, with only a quick glance.

Intra-species recognition systems are often subtle. For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the chiffchaff from the willow warbler by eye, and there is no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different songs of the male. Sometimes, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of frog, the males are commonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.

&quot;Heliconius charithonia&quot; displays intra-species recognition by roosting with conspecifics. They do this with the help of UV rhodopsins in the eye that help them distinguish between ultraviolet yellow pigments and regular yellow pigments. They have also been known to emit chemical cues in order to recognize members of their own species.

<text>Whitefish Bay is a large bay on the eastern end of Lake Superior between Michigan, United States, and Ontario, Canada. It is located between Whitefish Point in Michigan and Whiskey Point along the more rugged, largely wilderness Canadian Shield of Ontario. The international border runs through the bay, which is heavily used by shipping traffic northbound from and southbound to the Soo Locks.

The Whitefish Point Light marks the entry of the bay, Ile Parisienne Light is in the middle of the bay, and Gros Cap Reefs Light lies near the outlet of the bay and the approach to the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.

Whitefish Point Lighthouse is the oldest active light on Lake Superior. Part of the lighthouse station houses the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. It holds artifacts from the shipwrecks listed below and has information on the notable wreck of in 1975, in which all 29 crew were lost.

After the Soo Locks opened in 1855 and ship traffic increased on Lake Superior, Whitefish Bay was the site of numerous shipwrecks, often due to hazardous weather. The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve was established to preserve many of the shipwrecks of Whitefish Bay for sports divers. Known wrecks include the ships , , &quot;Drake&quot;, , , , &quot;Niagara&quot;, , , , and .

<doc id="367644" wikidata="Q7100631" url="?curid=367644" title="Order of precedence in Northern Ireland">
<text>An &quot;unofficial&quot; order of precedence in Northern Ireland, according to &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, 106th Edition, this is not officially authorised by or published with authority (&quot;cum privilegio&quot;) from either Buckingham Palace (the Royal Household) or the College of Arms, or the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice or the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) of His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the United Kingdom, or the Northern Ireland Assembly, or the Northern Ireland Executive.

==History==
The first official &quot;Scale of Local Precedence for Northern Ireland&quot; was made by royal warrant of George V on 30 January 1923 transmitted James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn, who was Governor of Northern Ireland. The Governor ranked next in the scale after the Sovereign. The 1923 scale replaced the order of precedence in Ireland consequent on the partition of Ireland and abolition of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, whose functions the Governor carried out in Northern Ireland. The 1923 scale was drawn up by Nevile Wilkinson, the Ulster King of Arms, who despite partition was based in Dublin and retained all-island jurisdiction until 1943. The scale was replaced on 2 July 1924, and modified subsequently, as for example in 1948 to include the minister and permanent secretary of the Ministry of Health and Local Government (created in 1944) and the Air Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 abolished many offices in the scale and added many new ones, but no updated scale was officially made.

<text>The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU) aims to encourage the study of birds (ornithology) around the world in order to understand their biology and aid their conservation. The BOU was founded in 1858 by Professor Alfred Newton, Henry Baker Tristram and other scientists. Its quarterly journal, &quot;Ibis&quot;, has been published continuously since 1859.

The Records Committee (BOURC) is a committee of the BOU established to maintain the British List, the official list of birds recorded in Great Britain.

BOU is headquartered in Peterborough and is a registered charity in England &amp; Wales and Scotland.

== Objectives and activities ==
* Publishes &quot;Ibis&quot; as a leading international journal of ornithological science. 
* Organizes a program of meetings and conferences.
* Awards grants and bursaries for ornithological research.
* Encourages liaison between those actively engaged in ornithological research.
* Provides a representative body of the scientific community able to provide ornithological information and advice to the government and other policy makers.
* Maintains and publishes the official list of birds recorded in Britain – The British List.

==Records committee==

The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union Records Committee (BOURC) is the recognized national bird records committee for Britain. It maintains a list of birds in Britain. Its findings are published in &quot;Ibis&quot;, the house journal of its parent body, the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU). From time to time, BOURC re-reviews records that it has previously accepted to ensure they are acceptable in light of improved knowledge of the species in question.

The Committee does not assess records of birds from Ireland; that task is carried out by the Irish Rare Birds Committee, which publishes its decisions in &quot;Irish Birds&quot;. For many years, records of IRBC-assessed rarities were included in the BOURC&#x27;s reports, but this ceased in 2002, at the request of IRBC.

BOURC is widely recognized as maintaining the most authoritative list of birds in Britain.

BOURC has a chairman, a secretary and a number of voting members. It previously had a taxonomic subcommittee set up to advise on taxonomic matters, but the disbanding of this subcommittee was announced on 6 November 2015; the BOU now contemplates relying entirely on one of the available global avian taxonomies with a view to adopting a single system for all its activities.

===Committee and taxonomic reports===

The Committee publishes an annual report in &quot;Ibis&quot; (the BOU&#x27;s international journal of avian science). All reports can be accessed via the British List pages of the BOU website.

Previously, the Committee&#x27;s Taxonomic Sub-committee also published regular reports, also in &quot;Ibis&quot;, and these too can be accessed via the British List pages of the BOU website.

===The Druridge Bay curlew===

Following a detailed review by the British Birds Rarities Committee into the controversial identification of a curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, which came to the conclusion that it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer slender-billed curlew, this identification was accepted by BOURC, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. A subsequent review of the record overturned the original decision &quot;Ibis&quot; 156 :236-242.

<doc id="367654" wikidata="Q5528" url="?curid=367654" title="Anyon">
<text>In physics, an anyon is a type of quasiparticle so far observed only in two-dimensional systems. In three-dimensional systems, only two kinds of elementary particles are seen: fermions and bosons. Anyons have statistical properties intermediate between fermions and bosons. In general, the operation of exchanging two identical particles, although it may cause a global phase shift, cannot affect observables. Anyons are generally classified as &quot;abelian&quot; or &quot;non-abelian&quot;. Abelian anyons, detected by two experiments in 2020, play a major role in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

== Introduction ==
The statistical mechanics of large many-body systems obeys laws described by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. Quantum statistics is more complicated because of the different behaviors of two different kinds of particles called fermions and bosons. In two-dimensional systems, however, there is a third type of particle, called an anyon.

In a two-dimensional world, two identical anyons change their wavefunction when they swap places in ways that cannot happen in three-dimensional physics:

This process of exchanging identical particles, or of circling one particle around another, is referred to as &quot;braiding&quot;. Braiding two anyons creates a historical record of the event, as their changed wave functions record the number of braids.

Microsoft has invested in research concerning anyons as a potential basis for topological quantum computing. They may be useful in quantum computing as a form of memory. Anyons circling each other (&quot;braiding&quot;) would encode information in a more robust way than other known potential quantum computing technologies. Most investment in quantum computing, however, is based on methods that do not use anyons.

== History ==
In 1977, two theoretical physicists working at the University of Oslo, Jon Magne Leinaas and Jan Myrheim, showed that the traditional classification of particles as either fermions or bosons would not apply if they were restricted to move in only two dimensions. Hypothetical particles, being neither bosons nor fermions, would be expected to exhibit a diverse range of previously unexpected properties. In 1982, Frank Wilczek published two papers exploring the fractional statistics of quasiparticles in two dimensions, giving them the name &quot;anyons&quot; to indicate that the phase shift upon permutation can take any value.

Daniel Tsui and Horst Störmer discovered the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1982. The mathematics developed by Wilczek proved to be useful to Bertrand Halperin at Harvard University in explaining aspects of it. Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and Robert Schrieffer verified this statement in 1985 with an explicit calculation that predicted that particles existing in these systems are in fact anyons.

== Abelian anyons ==
In quantum mechanics, and some classical stochastic systems, indistinguishable particles have the property that exchanging the states of particle  with particle  (symbolically ) does not lead to a measurably different many-body state.

In a quantum mechanical system, for example, a system with two indistinguishable particles, with particle 1 in state and particle 2 in state , has state in Dirac notation. Now suppose we exchange the states of the two particles, then the state of the system would be . These two states should not have a measurable difference, so they should be the same vector, up to a phase factor:
: formula_1

Here, is the phase factor.
In space of three or more dimensions, the phase factor is or . Thus, elementary particles are either fermions, whose phase factor is , or bosons, whose phase factor is . These two types have different statistical behaviour. Fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, while bosons obey Bose–Einstein statistics. In particular, the phase factor is why fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle: If two fermions are in the same state, then we have
: formula_2

The state vector must be zero, which means it is not normalizable, thus it is unphysical.

In two-dimensional systems, however, quasiparticles can be observed that obey statistics ranging continuously between Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics, as was first shown by Jon Magne Leinaas and Jan Myrheim of the University of Oslo in 1977. In the case of two particles this can be expressed as
: formula_3
where can be other values than just or . It is important to note that there is a slight abuse of notation in this shorthand expression, as in reality this wave function can be and usually is multi-valued. This expression actually means that when particle 1 and particle 2 are interchanged in a process where each of them makes a counterclockwise half-revolution about the other, the two-particle system returns to its original quantum wave function except multiplied by the complex unit-norm phase factor . Conversely, a clockwise half-revolution results in multiplying the wave function by . Such a theory obviously only makes sense in two-dimensions, where clockwise and counterclockwise are clearly defined directions.

In the case we recover the Fermi–Dirac statistics () and in the case (or ) the Bose–Einstein statistics (). In between we have something different. Frank Wilczek in 1982 explored the behavior of such quasiparticles and coined the term &quot;anyon&quot; to describe them, because they can have any phase when particles are interchanged. Unlike bosons and fermions, anyons have the peculiar property that when they are interchanged twice in the same way (e.g. if anyon 1 and anyon 2 were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other to switch places, and then they were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other again to go back to their original places), the wave function is not necessarily the same but rather generally multiplied by some complex phase (by in this example).

We may also use with particle spin quantum number &quot;s&quot;, with &quot;s&quot; being integer for bosons, half-integer for fermions, so that
: formula_4 
or
: formula_5

At an edge, fractional quantum Hall effect anyons are confined to move in one space dimension. Mathematical models of one-dimensional anyons provide a base of the commutation relations shown above.

In a three-dimensional position space, the fermion and boson statistics operators (−1 and +1 respectively) are just 1-dimensional representations of the permutation group (S&quot;N&quot; of &quot;N&quot; indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions. In the same way, in two-dimensional position space, the abelian anyonic statistics operators () are just 1-dimensional representations of the braid group (&quot;BN&quot; of &quot;N&quot; indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions. Non-abelian anyonic statistics are higher-dimensional representations of the braid group. Anyonic statistics must not be confused with parastatistics, which describes statistics of particles whose wavefunctions are higher-dimensional representations of the permutation group.

=== Topological equivalence ===
The fact that the homotopy classes of paths (i.e. notion of equivalence on braids) are relevant hints at a more subtle insight. It arises from the Feynman path integral, in which all paths from an initial to final point in spacetime contribute with an appropriate phase factor. The Feynman path integral can be motivated from expanding the propagator using a method called time-slicing, in which time is discretized.

In non-homotopic paths, one cannot get from any point at one time slice to any other point at the next time slice. This means that we can consider homotopic equivalence class of paths to have different weighting factors.

So it can be seen that the topological notion of equivalence comes from a study of the Feynman path integral.

For a more transparent way of seeing that the homotopic notion of equivalence is the &quot;right&quot; one to use, see Aharonov–Bohm effect.

=== Experiment ===
In 2020, two teams of scientists (one in Paris, the other at Purdue) announced new experimental evidence for the existence of anyons. Both experiments were featured in &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;″s 2020 annual &quot;state of science&quot; issue.

In April, 2020, researchers from the École normale supérieure (Paris) and the Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies (C2N) reported results from a tiny &quot;particle collider&quot; for anyons. They detected properties that matched predictions by theory for anyons.

In July, 2020, scientists at Purdue University detected anyons using a different setup. The team&#x27;s interferometer routes the electrons through a specific maze-like etched nanostructure made of gallium arsenide and aluminium gallium arsenide. &quot;In the case of our anyons the phase generated by braiding was 2π/3&quot;, he said. &quot;That&#x27;s different than what&#x27;s been seen in nature before.&quot;

As of 2023, this remains an active area of research; using a superconducting processor, Google Quantum AI reported on the first braiding of non-Abelian anyon-like particles in an arXiv article by Andersen &quot;et al.&quot; in October 2022, later published in Nature. In an arXiv article released in May 2023, Quantinuum reported on non-abelian braiding using a trapped-ion processor.

== Non-abelian anyons ==

In 1988, Jürg Fröhlich showed that it was valid under the spin–statistics theorem for the particle exchange to be monoidal (non-abelian statistics). In particular, this can be achieved when the system exhibits some degeneracy, so that multiple distinct states of the system have the same configuration of particles. Then an exchange of particles can not only contribute a phase change, but also can send the system into a different state with the same particle configuration. Particle exchange then corresponds to a linear transformation on this subspace of degenerate states. When there is no degeneracy, this subspace is one-dimensional and so all such linear transformations commute (because they are just multiplications by a phase factor). When there is degeneracy and this subspace has higher dimension, then these linear transformations need not commute (just as matrix multiplication does not).

Gregory Moore, Nicholas Read, and Xiao-Gang Wen pointed out that non-Abelian statistics can be realized in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). While at first non-abelian anyons were generally considered a mathematical curiosity, physicists began pushing toward their discovery when Alexei Kitaev showed that non-abelian anyons could be used to construct a topological quantum computer. As of 2012, no experiment has conclusively demonstrated the existence of non-abelian anyons although promising hints are emerging in the study of the ν = 5/2 FQHE state. Experimental evidence of non-abelian anyons, although not yet conclusive and currently contested, was presented in October, 2013. Recent works claim the creation of non-abelian topological order and anyons on a trapped-ion processor and demonstration of non-abelian braiding of graph vertices in a superconducting processor.

== Fusion of anyons ==
In much the same way that two fermions (e.g. both of spin 1/2) can be looked at together as a composite boson (with total spin in a superposition of 0 and 1), two or more anyons together make up a composite anyon (possibly a boson or fermion). The composite anyon is said to be the result of the fusion of its components.

If identical abelian anyons each with individual statistics (that is, the system picks up a phase when two individual anyons undergo adiabatic counterclockwise exchange) all fuse together, they together have statistics . This can be seen by noting that upon counterclockwise rotation of two composite anyons about each other, there are pairs of individual anyons (one in the first composite anyon, one in the second composite anyon) that each contribute a phase . An analogous analysis applies to the fusion of non-identical abelian anyons. The statistics of the composite anyon is uniquely determined by the statistics of its components.

Non-abelian anyons have more complicated fusion relations. As a rule, in a system with non-abelian anyons, there is a composite particle whose statistics label is not uniquely determined by the statistics labels of its components, but rather exists as a quantum superposition (this is completely analogous to how two fermions known to have spin 1/2 are together in quantum superposition of total spin 1 and 0). If the overall statistics of the fusion of all of several anyons is known, there is still ambiguity in the fusion of some subsets of those anyons, and each possibility is a unique quantum state. These multiple states provide a Hilbert space on which quantum computation can be done.

== Topological basis ==

In more than two dimensions, the spin–statistics theorem states that any multiparticle state of indistinguishable particles has to obey either Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac statistics. For any d &gt; 2, the Lie groups SO(d,1) (which generalizes the Lorentz group) and Poincaré(d,1) have Z2 as their first homotopy group. Because the cyclic group Z2 is composed of two elements, only two possibilities remain. (The details are more involved than that, but this is the crucial point.)

The situation changes in two dimensions. Here the first homotopy group of SO(2,1), and also Poincaré(2,1), is Z (infinite cyclic). This means that Spin(2,1) is not the universal cover: it is not simply connected. In detail, there are projective representations of the special orthogonal group SO(2,1) which do not arise from linear representations of SO(2,1), or of its double cover, the spin group Spin(2,1). Anyons are evenly complementary representations of spin polarization by a charged particle.

This concept also applies to nonrelativistic systems. The relevant part here is that the spatial rotation group SO(2) has an infinite first homotopy group.

This fact is also related to the braid groups well known in knot theory. The relation can be understood when one considers the fact that in two dimensions the group of permutations of two particles is no longer the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;2 (with two elements) but rather the braid group &quot;B&quot;2 (with an infinite number of elements). The essential point is that one braid can wind around the other one, an operation that can be performed infinitely often, and clockwise as well as counterclockwise.

A very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem in quantum computing is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on braid theory to form stable quantum logic gates.

== Generalization to higher dimensions ==
Fractionalized excitations as point particles can be bosons, fermions or anyons in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. It is known that point particles can be only either bosons or fermions in 3+1 and higher spacetime dimensions. However, the loop- (or string-) or membrane-like excitations are extended objects that can have fractionalized statistics.

Current research shows that the loop- and string-like excitations exist for topological orders in the 3+1 dimensional spacetime, and their multi-loop/string-braiding statistics are the key signatures for identifying 3+1dimensional topological orders. The multi-loop/string-braiding statistics of 3+1dimensional topological orders can be captured by the link invariants of particular topological quantum field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions. Explained in a colloquial manner, the extended objects (loop, string, or membrane, etc.) can be potentially anyonic in 3+1 and higher spacetime dimensions in the long-range entangled systems.

<doc id="367664" wikidata="Q1137115" url="?curid=367664" title="Göteborg Landvetter Airport">
<text>Göteborg Landvetter Airport also known as Gothenburg Landvetter Airport is an international airport serving the Gothenburg (Swedish: &quot;Göteborg&quot;) region in Sweden. With just over 5.3 million passengers in 2024, it is Sweden&#x27;s second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. Landvetter is also an important freight airport. During 2007, 60.1 thousand tonnes of air cargo passed through Landvetter, about 60% of the capacity of Arlanda.

The airport is named after Landvetter locality, which is in Härryda municipality. It is east-southeast of Gothenburg and west of Borås. It is operated by Swedavia, the national airport company. Since the closure of Göteborg City Airport for commercial operations, it&#x27;s the city&#x27;s only commercial passenger airport.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
The airport was opened by King Carl XVI Gustaf on 3 October 1977. Passenger services, previously at Torslanda Airport, west of Gothenburg, were moved to Landvetter in 1977. In 2001, some budget airlines began serving the former military base in Säve, which was renamed from Säve Flygplats to Gothenburg City Airport. That airport was closed down in winter 2014–2015 because of large reconstruction needs, meaning an increase of traffic on Landvetter of almost a million annual passengers. There has been a tendency that international air travel has increased, especially on tourists, while domestic has declined somewhat (mostly business travel).

In 2013, the international terminal was extended significantly with new shops, and in 2014 the domestic and international terminals were joined into a single terminal.

On 14 April 2015, Swedavia announced a 10-year long contract with DHL Express to build a new 7500 m2 large cargo terminal, replacing the old 1700 m2. The construction will begin in spring 2015 and is underway for one year. This was a step included in plans for Airport City. In 2018-2020 the terminal building will be enlarged, with three new air bridges.
There are also plans to build a shortcut on the railway Gothenburg–Borås with a tunnel and a railway station under the airport. Construction start has previously been decided to 2016, later 2020, but is as of 2021 delayed.

There has been criticism on the choice of location of the airport, which is fairly foggy, located 150 meters above sea level and often affected by low clouds. The runway direction also often means fairly strong crosswinds which can cause landings to scare passengers. In 2015, an instrument landing system CATIIIb was installed which allows landing in fairly dense fog if corresponding system is fitted onboard aircraft. Many but not all aircraft have that (as of 2018).

===Development since 2020===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, most flights were cancelled. During April 2020, only the KLM route to Amsterdam was consistently operated daily. The passenger figures were 99.5% lower in April 2020 than in April 2019.

On 28 April 2023, Landvetter Airport achieved a major milestone when Scandinavian Airlines began its nonstop route to New York-EWR, connecting both cities three times weekly onboard the 157 seater A321neo LR aircraft. Gothenburg previously was linked to New York more than 40 years ago in 1984 and since then lacked proper long haul services, apart from a few charter flights as e.g. to Thailand in winter. Unfortunately the route was cancelled in October 2023 since SAS was moving to SkyTeam, however, there are currently plans to bring the route back, this time to New York-JFK.

A new terminal section, extending the terminal by 200 metres, was inaugurated in 2023.

== Terminal ==
Landvetter Airport traditionally had two terminals, domestic and international, but they have merged into one common terminal. In 2009, all baggage drop was moved to in the international terminal, since all baggage had to be screened with new regulations. In 2014, the two terminals joined into one with all baggage collected at the arrivals hall in the previous international terminal. The transfer area, which has several shops, cafés and a restaurant, is accessible for all passengers since that year.There are eleven air bridges, at gates 12–17 and 19-23. Gates 10–11, 18A–H and 24A–E transport passengers to the aircraft via an airside bus transfer. Traditionally gates 10–15 used to be limited to domestic flights but nowadays 10–19 cater to all flights within the Schengen Area, which are treated as domestic flights.
Gates 22–24 are located in the international transit area, used for flights outside the Schengen Area, and access is only possible after clearing immigration. Gate 20 and 21 are positionable so that, depending on upcoming flights, reaching them may (signed 20B-21B) or may not (signed 20A-21A) require clearing immigration. The freight terminal uses gate numbers below 10.

A new terminal section at the airport added 18,500 square metres and extended the terminal by 200 metres. The expansion, which began in 2017, includes three new regular gates, four bus gates, and additional seating for passengers. The expansion opened in stages with the first bus gates becoming operational in 2020, and was officially inaugurated in 2023. Non-Schengen passengers are now processed within the main terminal. The new bus gates feature weather protection.

The airport has a VIP area, where travellers for a fee can go through a dedicated security check, wait in the VIP lounge and be transported by car to the aircraft, avoiding mix with non VIP paying passengers. The VIP area can also hold wedding ceremonies.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Göteborg:

==Statistics==



==Ground transport==
===Bus===
The airport is served by several shuttle services offered by different private bus companies, such as Flygbussarna (most frequent), Vy bus4you and Flixbus (cheapest). Rides between the airport and the Nils Ericson Terminal, located next to the Central train station take about 30 minutes, while rides connecting with the Korsvägen hub are approximately 20 minutes long.

Västtrafik, Gothenburg&#x27;s public transport agency, also operates the bus line 612 between the airport and the Landvetter village bus station, where further connections to both Gothenburg and Borås can be made.

Flixbus and bus4you also offer the shuttle services, albeit less frequently, between Borås and Jönköping central stations, about 40 and 1h45m away, respectively.

===Road===
The road distance to Gothenburg is and to Borås , both via the Riksväg 40 motorway. There are 7,300 parking spaces at the airport.

The airport is accessible on foot and bicycle too. There is a bike path most of the way from Gothenburg, through the villages Landvetter and Härryda. The forest and hiking trails reach up to the far side of P6 long-term parking area.

=== Future High-Speed Rail Connection ===
The existing Coast-to-Coast railway passes approximately 2 km north of Landvetter Airport, where a rail connection has been discussed but has never been established. 

In 2024, an agreement was reached to construct a high-speed train line connecting Gothenburg Central Station to Landvetter Airport, as part of a larger railway project between Gothenburg and Borås. The total cost of the new railway is estimated at approximately 48.5 billion SEK. This double-track railway will accommodate speeds of up to 250 km/h and include stations in Mölndal, at Landvetter Airport, and in Borås. The Swedish government will provide 43.5 billion SEK for the project, while local municipalities and regions will contribute an additional 4.5 billion SEK. The first trains on this route are expected to begin operation around 2035.

<text>Shaw Nature Reserve, formerly known as Shaw Arboretum, is a private non-profit nature reserve located in Gray Summit, Missouri, that is operated as an extension of the Missouri Botanical Garden.

The first piece of land, , was purchased in 1925 when pollution from coal smoke in St. Louis threatened the Garden&#x27;s live plant collection, especially the orchid collection. The orchids were moved to what was then known as the Gray Summit Extension in 1926. The pollution in St. Louis decreased with the waning use of coal for heat, making it unnecessary to move the rest of the live plant collection. The Garden made five more land purchases between 1926 and 1977 amounting to the Nature Reserve&#x27;s current size of .

Shaw Nature Reserve has several historic homes, including the Joseph H. Bascom House, built in 1879 by Confederate Colonel Thomas Crews. The reserve also contains the Dana Brown Overnight Center, a collection of log and timber buildings from the 1850s that were moved from their original locations and reconstructed on site, and a Sod House built by reserve staff to represent the kind of lodgings that would have been used in the area&#x27;s original prairies. The habitats restored at the reserve include a large tallgrass prairie, glades, woodlands, wetlands and a wetland blind from which herons can be observed. The Nature Reserve is also home to the Whitmire Wildflower Garden, a Missouri native garden with over 500 native plant species, and a children&#x27;s Nature Explore Classroom. Over 17 miles (27 km) of hiking trails run through the Nature Reserve, along with four miles of road. The longest trail in the park is the Rus Goddard River Trail, a 2.5 mile loop that descends to a gravel bar in the Meramec River. The trail is named after a volunteer who spent more than 20 years maintaining trails in the reserve.

Shaw Nature Reserve is open year-round, 7-days a week, but is closed on some major holidays. Regular hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with extended hours throughout spring, summer, and fall. Last-entry is 30-minutes before posted closing time. Daily admission is $5 for adults, free for Missouri Botanical Garden members and children 12 and younger.

<text>The Swedish Civil Aviation Administration () is a Swedish Government agency which regulated and oversaw all aspects of aviation in Sweden until 2005. The regulatory division was called (Civil Aviation Authority).

The Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) () was established as (LFV). The agency had its head office in Norrköping.

In 2005 the regulatory division was separated to a new agency named &quot;Luftfartsstyrelsen&quot;, from 2009 part of &quot;Transportstyrelsen&quot;.

On 1 April 2010, the airport ownership and operation part of the &quot;Luftfartsverket&quot; was transferred to Swedish Airports (Swedavia AB), a newly formed fully state-owned company.

Air navigation services continue as a state enterprise under the name LFV.

<text>A decal (, , ) or transfer is a plastic, cloth, paper, or ceramic substrate that has printed on it a pattern or image that can be moved to another surface upon , usually with the aid of heat or water.

The word is short for &quot;decalcomania&quot;, a decorative technique by which engravings and prints are transferred to pottery or other materials. The technique was invented by Simon François Ravenet, an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process he called &quot;décalquer&quot; (which means &quot;to copy by tracing&quot;); it became widespread during the decal craze or mania of the late 19th century.

==Properties==
The term &quot;decal&quot; refers to the mass-produced art transfer in two different states:

1. As manufactured, which consists of the artwork printed on the upper side of a paper or film label stock, temporarily affixed by a typically water or heat soluble adhesive to the upper side of a silicone- or other release agent-coated paper or film backing stock. Decals are produced, shipped, and stored in this composite state.

2. As applied, where only the adhesive-backed artwork remains, affixed to its desired (and appropriate) substrate, temporarily or permanently as designed.

Two variations include the traditional &quot;water-slide&quot; or &quot;water-dip&quot;, with the artwork screen-printed on water-resistant paper coated with a layer of water-soluble adhesive, and a dry &quot;peel-and-stick&quot; format using a standard adhesive - which technically is not a decal, as there is no &quot;art transfer&quot;, rather an adhesive-backed label known as a sticker. When manufactured out of vinyl the latter is known as a &quot;vinyl-cut-decal&quot;.

== Modern production process ==
Mass-production of vinyl decals starts with large rolls of vinyl sheet. Vinyl is fed through a cutting plotter or large-format printer/cutter which prints the desired image and cuts out the desired shapes. Designs are typically created using specialized computer software and sent to the machines electronically. After the patterns are cut, excess vinyl on the sheet is removed in a process called &quot;weeding&quot;. Finally, a paper pre-mask can be applied to the top of the vinyl design allowing easy application of multiple letters and shapes.

A recent innovation involves the inclusion of a radio frequency identification (RFID) circuit (chip and antenna) in the paper or film facestock.

==Applications==

Decals were popularly associated from the mid-20th century on with hot rod automobiles and plastic models. Along with stickers they are used to &quot;personalize&quot; items, such as musical instruments or sports gear.

Government agencies (and some private-public partnerships) use permanent peel-and-stick stickers on vehicles for identification. These &quot;decals&quot; are referred to as fleet markings and are required by law on all fire and law enforcement vehicles in the US. Most fleet markings are created from reflective vinyl with an adhesive backing that is applied in a peel-and-stick manner.

<text>The British Ornithologists&#x27; Club (BOC) aims to promote discussion between members and others interested in ornithology, and to facilitate the dissemination of scientific information concerned with ornithology. The BOC has a special interest in avian systematics, taxonomy and distribution.

The BOC was founded at a meeting of 15 members of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union held in Covent Garden, London on 5 October 1892. This was at a time when individuals and expeditions were exploring remote parts of the world, discovering many new species of birds in the process and the BOC was formed to enable members to meet regularly to present papers, exhibit specimens and engage in discussion on wider ornithological matters. The BOC has continued to meet regularly in London (with occasional meetings elsewhere) and, as at June 2012, has held 970 meetings. Meetings now take the form of a talk followed by discussion, with refreshments available afterwards. Meetings are free and are open to members and non-members alike.

The BOC has published &quot;Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club&quot; (&quot;The Bulletin&quot;, or &quot;Bull. B.O.C.&quot;) since its formation. The &quot;Bulletin&quot;, which is published four times a year, focuses in particular on avian systematics, taxonomy, nomenclature and distribution worldwide. It regularly contains papers:

* describing new species and subspecies of birds;
* giving an account of the rediscovery of a species not seen for many years;
* describing for the first time the nest and/or breeding behaviour of a little-studied species;
* giving an account of an expedition to a rarely visited part of the world, listing the species found (sometimes extending their known range) and commenting on the absence of species which previous expeditions had recorded,
* suggesting the actual location where poorly documented museum specimens may have been taken and uncovering cases where specimens have been mislabelled.

The BOC has a membership of around 370 (2011) almost half of whom live outside the United Kingdom. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in ornithology. Members formerly received printed copies of The Bulletin, but from March 2017 (Vol. 137 No. 1), it became an online-only, open access, journal.

The BOC is a registered Charitable Incorporated Organization in England and Wales (no. 1169733).

<text>EMERGCON (emergency condition) is a state of readiness that is separate from DEFCON, or defense readiness condition used by the United States, in that it incorporates civilian measures in addition to the DEFCON military measures.

==Overview==
Generally, EMERGCONs are a state of readiness following an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) attack. Other forces go to DEFCON 1 during EMERGCONs. There are two types of EMERGCONs:

* Defense Emergency: A major hostile attack on United States and/or allied forces overseas, and/or an overt action made against the United States. This must be confirmed by a unified commander or higher authority.
* Air Defense Emergency: A major hostile attack by aircraft or missiles seems probable, is imminent, or is taking place on the continental United States, Canada, or Greenland. This declaration is made by the Commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

Although the United States military has gone into defense readiness at various times (such as the Cuban Missile Crisis), it has never had a major EMERGCON.

<doc id="367698" wikidata="Q7084672" url="?curid=367698" title="Old Order German Baptist Brethren">
<text>The Old Order German Baptist Brethren, also called Petitioners, are a small group of very conservative Schwarzenau Brethren.

== History ==

The history of the Old Order German Baptist Brethren dates back to 1708, when the Schwarzenau Brethren were formed in Berleburg under the leadership of Alexander Mack. Soon they moved to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution in Europe. In the 19th century many of them moved west with the frontier, to Ohio, Indiana and beyond.

In 1860s and 1870s the traditionalists among the Brethren opposed the adoption of innovations such as revival meetings, Sunday schools, and foreign missionary work. Stressing church discipline, Annual Meeting authority, and the preservation of the &quot;old order&quot; of church ordinances, worship, and dress, they formed the Old German Baptist Brethren in 1881.

The Old Order German Baptist Brethren split from the Old German Baptist Brethren in 1921, when members of the latter began to adopt automobiles. Though similar to the Old German Baptist Brethren in faith and practice, the Old Order German Baptist Brethren represent those who desired to maintain a strict adherence to tradition, such as the use of horse and buggy for transportation. They also do not use electricity nor telephones but do allow tractors for field work.

== Beliefs and practices ==

The Beliefs of the Old Order German Baptists are in many ways similar to the Old German Baptist Brethren, the group from which they emerged.

The Old Order German Baptists use tractors and other motorized equipment in their farming, while the Old Brethren German Baptists, a similar horse and buggy group, farm with horses.

Men wear suspenders, dark denim and workshirts. Beards are encouraged but not required. Women wear long dresses with the Brethren style cape (Triangular, loose in front and back), aprons and tied white head coverings.

In spite of the name, Old Order German Baptist Brethren do not use the German language anymore, neither a German dialect in everyday life nor Standard German for Bible and church as Old Order Amish and many Old Order Mennonites do, because they had already given up the use of the German language when the first split of conservatives from the main body occurred in the early 1880s.

== Demographics and congregations ==

In the early 1970s there were only about 20 families left in the Old Order German Baptist Brethren church, according to some estimates.

As of 2000 the group had 125 members and a total population of 281 in 3 congregations in Ohio. These Congregations are found in the area of Covington, Gettysburg and Arcanum. They have meeting houses south east of Covington, near Versailles and west of Pleasant Hill. Some members far from the meeting houses meet in private homes, like the Amish.

== Name of the group ==

Since their formation in 1881 and until the early 1900s the Old German Baptist Brethren were often referred to as Old Order German Baptist Brethren. Since the formation of the Old Order German Baptist Brethren in 1921 this then misleading name fell mostly out of usage, but in some few cases it persists until today. The Old Order German Baptist Brethren should also not be confused with the Old Brethren German Baptists, a similar horse and buggy group that split off from the Old German Baptist Brethren and formed in 1939.

<text>Benjamin Ernest Linder (July 7, 1959 – April 28, 1987), was an American engineer. While working on a small hydroelectric dam in rural northern Nicaragua, Linder was killed with two of his colleagues by the Contras, a loose confederation of rebel groups funded by the U.S. government. 

The autopsy report stated that Linder had gunshot wounds to the back of the legs (indicating he had his back to the killers), while on the ground he suffered multiple wounds to his face (the coroner noted as from an ice pick) and died from a close range gunshot to the head. The other two men were also executed in the same way. It is unknown if they were similarly tortured first. There was no mention in Linder’s autopsy report of grenade fragments. 

Coming at a time when U.S. support for the Contras was already highly controversial, Linder&#x27;s death made front-page headlines around the world and further polarized opinion in the United States.

==Biography==
The California-born Linder was raised in a secular Jewish family in San Francisco and later Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Adams High School in Portland, Oregon in 1977. While in college at the University of Washington, Linder enjoyed juggling and was often seen around Seattle riding a unicycle. He graduated in 1983, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He left his Oregon home that summer and moved to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua.

Linder felt inspired by the 1979 Sandinista revolution, and wanted to support its efforts to improve the lives of the country&#x27;s poorest people. The Reagan administration, however, was determined to cripple the revolution. Beginning in 1981, the Central Intelligence Agency secretly trained, armed and supplied thousands of Contra rebels. A major element of the Contras&#x27; strategy was to launch attacks on government cooperatives, health clinics and power stations—the things that most exemplified the improvements that had been brought about by the revolution.

In 1986, Linder moved from Managua to El Cuá, a village in the Nicaraguan war zone, where he helped form a team to build a hydroelectric plant to bring electricity to the town. While living in El Cuá, he participated in vaccination campaigns, using his talents as a clown, juggler, and unicyclist to entertain the local children, for whom he expressed great affection and concern.

On April 28, 1987, Linder and two Nicaraguans were killed in a Contra ambush while traveling through the forest to scout out a construction site for a new dam for the nearby village of San José de Bocay. The autopsy showed that Linder had been wounded by a grenade, then shot at point-blank range in the head. The two Nicaraguans—Sergio Hernández and Pablo Rosales—were also killed at close range. Linder was posthumously awarded the Courage of Conscience award on September 26, 1992.

==Controversy==
Linder&#x27;s death quickly inflamed the already-polarized debate inside the United States, with opponents of U.S. policy decrying the use of taxpayers&#x27; dollars to finance the killing of an American citizen as well as thousands of Nicaraguan civilians.

The administration fought back, with White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying that U.S. citizens working in Nicaragua had &quot;put themselves in harm&#x27;s way&quot;. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, an ardent proponent of the Contra War, echoed that view, saying that Linder should have known better than to be in a combat zone.

Linder&#x27;s mother Elisabeth, in Nicaragua for her son&#x27;s funeral, said, 
My son was brutally murdered for bringing electricity to a few poor people in northern Nicaragua. He was murdered because he had a dream and because he had the courage to make that dream come true. ... Ben told me the first year that he was here, and this is a quote, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling to work in a country where the government&#x27;s first concern is for its people, for all of its people.&quot;

During a Congressional hearing in May 1987, some defenders of U.S. policy in Nicaragua responded, launching personal attacks on Linder&#x27;s family and other witnesses. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; reported one exchange between Republican Congressman Connie Mack of Florida and Elisabeth Linder, who had just given emotional testimony about her son&#x27;s work and motivations. Mack accused Mrs. Linder of using her grief &quot;to politicize this situation&quot;, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be tough on you, but I really feel you have asked for it.&quot;

The death of Linder, coming as Congressional hearings investigated the Iran-Contra Affair, fueled the debate in the U.S. over the covert war in Nicaragua. The next year, Congress refused to renew aid to the Contras. But the civil war, conscription into the army, the collapse of the economy, and the curtailment of civil liberties in the mid-1980s all combined to cause the defeat of the FSLN government in February 1990 elections.

In July 1996, American journalist Paul Berman published an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; featuring an interview with a man who claimed to have killed Linder. Linder&#x27;s parents and their lawyers publicly denounced the article and disputed the veracity of the man Berman interviewed. In 2001 journalist Joan Kruckewitt, who lived in Nicaragua from 1983 to 1991 and covered the war between the Sandinistas and the Contras for ABC Radio, wrote a book entitled &quot;The Death of Ben Linder&quot; giving a more sympathetic portrait of Linder&#x27;s life, work, and death.

The song &quot;Fragile&quot; on Sting&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot;, is a tribute to Ben Linder. In 1989 American artist Mike Alewitz painted a mural in Linder&#x27;s memory in Esteli, Nicaragua. Singer-songwriter Dean Stevens wrote and recorded &quot;The Children Knew Ben&quot; on his 1989 CD, &quot;Seeds&quot;, for Volcano Records. The 1990 book &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; by Barbara Kingsolver is also dedicated to his memory, as was the (now closed) Ben Linder Cafe in Leon, Nicaragua, which was adorned with his photo and memories of his life&#x27;s work. A week after Ben&#x27;s death, a group of Jugglers for Peace toured Nicaragua performing shows in schools, military camps, co-operatives, villages and on the streets celebrating his life and work. They were invited to join in a peace march with other activists to the town where Linder worked and made a video documentary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzKfn7ZwkU&amp;t=1243s

<text>Juhani Aho, originally Johannes Brofeldt (11 September 1861 – 8 August 1921), was a Finnish author and journalist. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twelve times.

==Early life==

Juhani Aho was born at Lapinlahti in 1861. His parents were Henrik Gustaf Theodor Brofeldt and Karolina Fredrika Emelie &quot;Emma&quot; Brofeldt (née Snellman). The Brofeldts were a priestly family: Theodor was a relatively well-known revivalist preacher whose sermons were published in 1917 as &quot;Rovasti H. G. Th. Brofeldtin saarnoja&quot; (&quot;Reverend H. G. Th. Brofeldt&#x27;s Sermons&quot;) and his father had been a chaplain and his grandfather a vicar. Juhani had two younger brothers Kaarlo Kustaa Brofeldt (1865–1936) and Petter Fredrik Brofeldt (1864–1945) who, following Juhani&#x27;s example, adopted the Finnish names Kalle and Pekka as well as the surname Aho. 

From 1872 to 1880 Juhani Aho attended the Kuopion Lyseo, one of the few upper secondary schools offering education in Finnish. During his time at the school he adopted the pen name Juhani Aho for many of his school works. In the 1880s he studied at the University of Helsinki and was associated with political radicals. His literary pursuits were aided by Elisabeth Järnefelt and her circle, the &quot;Järnefelt school&quot;, who were pioneers of Finnish realism.

==Career==

Aho&#x27;s literary output is wide-ranging since he pursued different styles as time passed.

He started as a realist and his first novel &quot;Rautatie&quot; (&quot;Railroad&quot;, 1884), which is considered one of his main works, is from this period. Later he moved towards neoromanticism with novels &quot;Panu&quot; and &quot;Kevät ja takatalvi&quot; as well as &quot;Juha&quot;. The last one is one of his most famous works and has been twice as adapted an opera, by Aarre Merikanto and by Leevi Madetoja, and to film four times, most recently in 1999 by Aki Kaurismäki.

His novel &quot;Yksin&quot; (Alone), published in 1890, controversially bold by the standards of Finnish literature in that epoch, is a roman à clef. Its tale of unrequited love is the autobiographical novel of Aho&#x27;s passion for Aino Järnefelt who, at that time, was engaged to Jean Sibelius, whom she would later marry. The initial feelings of anger and jealousy that reading the novel provoked in Sibelius were soon forgotten and, in later life, Aho and Sibelius were close friends as well as neighbours in Järvenpää, where the composer had a villa christened &quot;Ainola&quot; (the Place of Aino). Aho married Venny Soldan-Brofeldt in 1891.

In addition to his novels, Aho wrote a number of short stories of distinct style, called &quot;splinters&quot; (&quot;lastuja&quot; in Finnish). Their topics could vary from political allegories to depictions of everyday life.

The first and most famous of the short stories is &quot;Siihen aikaan kun isä lampun osti&quot; (&quot;When Father Brought Home the Lamp&quot;), depicting the effect of the innovation on people living in the countryside. Nowadays the title is a Finnish saying used when something related to new technology is introduced.

Aho was one of the founders of &quot;Päivälehti&quot;, the predecessor of the biggest newspaper in Finland today, &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;. He was also one of the active contributors of a cultural magazine, &quot;Valvoja&quot;.

Aho loved fly fishing. In 1906 he got to know Huopanankoski rapids in Viitasaari. After that he went there every spring and autumn for 14 years. He also went summers in Laukkoski, Pornainen.

Aho died in Helsinki in 1921. The photographer Claire Aho is his granddaughter.

<text>Henry Highland Garnet (December 23, 1815 – February 13, 1882) was an American abolitionist, minister, educator, orator, and diplomat. Having escaped as a child from slavery in Maryland with his family, he grew up in New York City. He was educated at the African Free School and other institutions, and became an advocate of militant abolitionism. He became a minister and based his drive for abolitionism in religion.

Garnet was a prominent member of the movement that led beyond moral suasion toward more political action. Renowned for his skills as a public speaker, he urged black Americans to take action and claim their own destinies. (&quot;He saw little hope for freeing the slaves except by their own efforts.&quot;) For a period, he supported emigration of American free blacks to Mexico, Liberia, or the West Indies, but the American Civil War ended that effort. In 1841, he married abolitionist Julia Ward Williams and they had a family. Stella (Mary Jane) Weems, a runaway slave from Maryland, lived with the Garnets. She may have been adopted by them or employed as their governess. When Henry preached against slavery, he brought her up to talk about her own experiences and about her family still enslaved in Maryland. On one such trip in England, Garnet was hired by a Scottish church as a missionary. The family moved to Jamaica in 1852, and soon caught yellow fever. Stella died and was buried there. The rest, while sickened, boarded a ship for America. After the war, the couple worked in Washington, D.C.

On Sunday, February 12, 1865, he delivered a sermon in the U.S. House of Representatives while it was not in session, becoming the first African American to speak in that chamber, on the occasion of Congress&#x27;s passage on January 31 of the Thirteenth Amendment, ending slavery.

==Early life and education==

Henry Garnet was born into slavery in Chesterville (then New Market), Kent County, Maryland, on December 23, 1815. &quot;[H]is grandfather was an African chief and warrior, and in a tribal fight he was captured and sold to slave-traders who brought him to this continent where he was owned by Colonel William Spencer.&quot; According to James McCune Smith, Garnet&#x27;s father was George Trusty and his enslaved mother was &quot;a woman of extraordinary energy.&quot; 

In 1824, the family, which included a total of 11 members, secured permission to attend a funeral, and from there they all escaped in a covered wagon, via Wilmington, Delaware, where they were helped by the Quaker and Underground Railroad stationmaster Thomas Garrett.

When Garnet was ten years old, his family reunited and moved to New York City, where from 1826 through 1831, Garnet attended the African Free School. His education there was interrupted in 1828 when Garnet had to find employment, twice making the sea route to Cuba as a cabin boy and once as a cook and steward on a schooner running between New York City and Alexandria, Virginia. It was when he returned from the latter voyage in 1829 that he found that his family had been located by slave hunters. His sister, Eliza (born Mary), was arrested, but was able to free herself by proving residence in the free state of New York. His father jumped off of the roof of a two-story building to escape the slave catchers. Garnet, likely with his mother in mind, who had escaped by running to a corner store, took a knife and walked onto Broadway, waiting to be found and confronted by the slave catchers. His friends found him instead and took him out of the city to Jericho, Long Island, where he stayed under the protection of Quaker Thomas Willis. He then became an indentured servant to Captain Epenetus Smith of Smithtown, Long Island, but suffered an injury to his right leg and managed to be released from his indentures later in 1829, whereupon he returned to the African Free School for a year.

While in school, Garnet began his career in abolitionism. His classmates at the African Free School included Charles L. Reason, George T. Downing, and Ira Aldridge. From 1831, he continued his studies at the Phoenix High School for Colored Youth. While a student there he began to attend a Sunday school at the First Colored Presbyterian Church, also known as Shiloh Presbyterian Church, The first African American Presbyterian Church in New York City, and was baptized as a Christian by Reverend Theodore Sedgwick Wright, with whom he was friends for the remainder of Wright&#x27;s life.

In 1834, Garnet, William H. Day, and David Ruggles established the all-male Garrison Literary and Benevolent Association; &quot;Garrison&quot; is a reference to the famous abolitionist Wm. Lloyd Garrison, and indicates the character of the association. It garnered mass support among whites, but the club ultimately had to move due to racist feelings.
In 1835, Garnet enrolled at the new Noyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire, but anti-abolitionists soon destroyed the school building and forced the Negro students out of town. He completed his education at the Oneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York, which had recently begun admitting all races. Here he was acclaimed for his wit, brilliance, and rhetorical skills. The year after graduation in 1839, he injured his knee playing sports. It never fully healed, and his lower leg had to be amputated in 1840 or 1841.

==Julia Williams==
In 1841, Garnet married Julia Ward Williams, whom he had met as a fellow student at the Noyes Academy. She had also completed her education at the Oneida Institute. Together they had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood.

==Ministry==

In 1839, Garnet moved with his family to Troy, New York, where he taught school and studied theology. In 1842, Garnet became pastor of the Liberty Street Presbyterian church, a position he held for six years. With his friend William G. Allen, also an Oneida alumnus, he published the &quot;National Watchman&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper. Closely identifying with the church, Garnet supported the temperance movement and became a strong advocate of abolishing slavery. 

Garnet sheltered fugitive slaves in his Liberty Street church, and philanthropist Gerrit Smith announced in his church his plan for giving grants of land to disenfranchised Black men (see Timbuctoo, New York).

He later returned to New York City, where he joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and frequently spoke at abolitionist conferences and became pastor of the First Colored Presbyterian Church, also known as Shiloh Presbyterian Church. One of his most famous speeches, &quot;Call to Rebellion&quot;, was delivered to the 1843 National Convention of Colored Citizens, in Buffalo, New York. &quot;Upon the conclusion of the Negro national convention of 1843, Garnet led a state convention of Negroes assembled in Rochester&quot;.

These conventions by black activists were called to work for abolition and equal rights. Garnet said that slaves should act for themselves to achieve total emancipation. He promoted an armed rebellion as the most effective way to end slavery. Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, along with many other abolitionists both black and white, thought that Garnet&#x27;s ideas were too radical and could damage the cause by arousing too much fear and resistance among whites.

In 1848 Garnet relocated from Troy to Peterboro, New York, home of the great abolition activist Gerrit Smith. Garnet supported Smith&#x27;s Liberty Party, a reform party that was eventually absorbed into the Republican Party.

==Anti-slavery role==
Women&#x27;s participation in the abolitionist movement was controversial and resulted in a split in the American Anti-Slavery Society. Arthur Tappan, Lewis Tappan, &quot;and a group of Black ministers, including Henry Highland Garnet&quot; founded the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (AFAS). It &quot;was committed to political abolitionism and to male leadership at the top levels.&quot;

On August 17, 1843, at the 1843 National Convention of Colored Citizens in Buffalo, New York, Garnet proposed that the meeting issue an address directly to enslaved people in the south, encouraging them that it would be better to rise up against their oppressors than to accept bondage. Though controversial and never adopted by the meeting, the address marked what historian Stanley Harrold called the rise of a new more &quot;aggressive&quot; form of abolitionism.

By 1849, Garnet began to support emigration of blacks to Mexico, Liberia, or Haiti, where he thought they would have more opportunities. In support of this, he founded the African Civilization Society. Similar to the British African Aid Society, it sought to establish a West African colony in Yorubaland (part of present-day Nigeria). Garnet advocated a kind of Black nationalism in the United States, which included establishing Black colonies in the sparsely-inhabited Western territories. Other prominent members of this movement included minister Daniel Payne, J. Sella Martin, Rufus L. Perry, Henry M. Wilson, and Amos Noë Freeman.

In 1850, Garnet went to Great Britain at the invitation of Anna Richardson of the free produce movement, which opposed slavery by rejecting the use of products produced by slave labor. He was a popular lecturer, and spent two and a half years lecturing. At first, the work separated Garnet from his family, who remained back in New York State. While Garnet was abroad, his seven-year-old son, James Crummell Garnet, died on March 1, 1851. His wife Julia, his young son Henry, and their adopted daughter Stella Weims joined Garnet in Great Britain later that year.

In 1852, Garnet was sent to Kingston, Jamaica, as a missionary. He and his family spent three years there; his wife Julia Garnet led an industrial school for girls. Garnet had health problems that led to the family returning to the United States.

After John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, Garnet in a sermon &quot;declared [it] to be the duty of every man who loved the cause of freedom to declare that the Harper&#x27;s Ferry movement was right, and that any one who would not say so boldly had much better say nothing at all.&quot; He was described as &quot;friend and admirer&quot; of &quot;the heroic John Brown&quot;.

In 1859 Garnet was president of the African Civilization Society, whose declared goal was &quot;to engage in the great work of christianizing and civilizing Africa&quot;. When the Civil War started, Garnet&#x27;s hopes ended for emigration as a solution for American Blacks. In the three-day New York draft riots of July 1863, mobs attacked Blacks and Black-owned buildings. Garnet and his family escaped attack because his daughter quickly chopped their nameplate off their door before the mobs found them. He organized a committee for sick soldiers and served as almoner to the New York Benevolent Society for victims of the mob.

In 1861, Garnet secured a U.S. passport from Secretary of State William H. Seward that declared Garnet &quot;a citizen of the United States,&quot; a precedent that advanced claims for equal citizenship during the Civil War and Reconstruction.

When the federal government approved creating Black units, Garnet helped with recruiting United States Colored Troops. He moved with his family to Washington, DC, so that he could support the black soldiers and the war effort. He preached to many of them while serving as pastor of the prominent Liberty (Fifteenth) Street Presbyterian Church from 1864 until 1866. During this time, Garnet was the first Black minister to preach to the US House of Representatives, addressing them on February 12, 1865, about the end of slavery, on occasion of the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.

==Later life==
After the war in 1868, Garnet was appointed president of Avery College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Later he returned to New York City as a pastor at the Shiloh Presbyterian Church (formerly the First Colored Presbyterian Church, and now St. James Presbyterian Church in Harlem).

He remained politically active upon his return to New York, and was known to provide support to the Cuban independence movement. In 1878, while living at 102 West 3rd Street, in a neighborhood often referred to as Little Africa, Garnet hosted a reception for Cuban revolutionary leader Antonio Maceo.

His first wife Julia Williams died at their home in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, on January 7, 1870. In 1875, Garnet married Sarah Smith Tompkins, who was a New York teacher and school principal, suffragist, and community organizer.

==Ambassador to Liberia==
Garnet&#x27;s last wish was to go, even for a few weeks, to Liberia, where his daughter Mary Garnet Barboza was, and to die there. He was appointed as the U.S. Minister (ambassador) to Liberia, where he arrived on December 28, 1881, and died February 13 of malaria. Garnet was given a state funeral by the Liberian government. As described by Alexander Crummell:

He was buried at Palm Grove Cemetery in Monrovia.

Frederick Douglass, who had not been on speaking terms with Garnet for many years because of their differences, still mourned Garnet&#x27;s passing and noted his achievements.

==Legacy and honors==
* 1952, Garnet&#x27;s portrait was included among those in &quot;Civil Rights Bill Passes, 1866&quot;, a mural painted in the Hall of Capitols, the Cox Corridors of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. It was painted by Allyn Cox.
* P.S. 175 or the Henry Highland Garnet School for Success in Harlem, as well as the Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School in Chestertown, Maryland, are named for him.
* In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Henry Highland Garnet on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.
* The Garnet School at 10th Street and U Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C., was named in his honor in 1880. It was merged with the Patterson school in a new building erected in 1929 and renamed Shaw Middle School at Garnet-Patterson. It was closed in 2013.
* Garnet High School, Charleston, West Virginia, was named for him from 1900 until 1956 when it closed with desegregation. The building served as John Adams Junior High until 1969 when a new John Adams school was built. Garnet&#x27;s name was restored as the Garnet Adult Education Center and is now Garnet Career Center.
* Garnet is included on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 246) commemorating Noyes Academy in Canaan.

<text>A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.

Charitable donations of goods or services are also called &quot;gifts in kind&quot;.

==Donating statistics==


In the United States, in 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that American households in the lowest fifth in terms of wealth, gave on average a higher percentage of their incomes to charitable organizations than those households in the highest fifth. Charity Navigator writes that, according to Giving USA, Americans gave $298 billion in 2011 (about 2% of GDP). The majority of donations were from individuals (73%), then from bequests (about 12%), foundations (2%) and less than 1% from corporations. The largest sector to receive donations was religious organizations (32%), then education (13%). Giving has increased in 3 out of 4 years since 1971 (with the occasional declines occurring around recession years).

Blackbaud reports that, in the US, online giving in 2012 grew by 11% on a year-over-year basis. The percentage of total fundraising that comes from online giving was about 7% in 2012. This was an increase from 6% in 2011 and is nearing the record level of 8% from 2010 when online giving spiked in response to Haitian earthquake relief efforts. Steve MacLaughlin notes in the report that &quot;the Internet has now become the first-response channel of choice for donors during disasters and other emergency events.&quot;

Blackbaud&#x27;s 2015 Charitable Giving report revealed a 9% increase in online donations compared to 2014. In addition, online giving represented 7% of overall fundraising, with 14% of all online donations made on mobile devices. Donations made on the international online giving day #GivingTuesday were up 52% from the previous year.

In Australia, donation statistics are made available annually by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), in the form of detailed tables breaking down the items in the individual tax return by gender, age, income, and state/territory. In Australia, individuals submit an income tax return based on their personal income levels and source(s). Unlike in other Western jurisdictions, income tax returns cannot be submitted as a couple or household, and standard deductions are not available for donations.

The most recent year of available data is 2021–2022. Analysis of the ATO data showed that the total amount donated and claimed as tax-deductible donations in 2021–22 was $4.55 billion (compared to $4.39 billion for the previous income year). This constitutes an increase of 3.66 per cent or $160.58 million. The average tax-deductible donation made to DGRs and claimed by Australian taxpayers in 2021–22 was $1,067.17 (compared to $1,047.27 in the previous income year). This is a slight increase of 1.90 per cent. 
The ATO data in no way represents all gifts, being limited to giving by individual taxpayers to DGRs. Furthermore, not all gifts will be claimed, either due to forgetfulness or a conscious decision not to claim.  Broadly speaking, those whose income is derived from their superannuation (personal retirement savings) are not required to pay tax or submit a return, so their gifts are not included. Additionally, the data does not include giving from trusts or companies or giving by persons overseas who are not Australian taxpayers.  The ATO dataset also does not examine other forms of giving such as time (volunteering) or goods under $5,000 in value.

==Legal aspects==
Donations are given without return consideration. This lack of return consideration means that, in common law, an agreement to make a donation is an &quot;imperfect contract void for want of consideration.&quot; Only when the donation is made does it acquire legal status as a transfer or property.

In politics, the law of some countries may prohibit or restrict the extent to which politicians may accept gifts or donations of large sums of money, especially from business or lobby groups (see campaign finance). Donations of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations are also usually tax deductible. Because this reduces the state&#x27;s tax income, calls have been raised that the state (and the public in general) should pay more attention towards ensuring that charities use this &#x27;tax money&#x27; in suitable ways.

There have been discussions on whether also a donation of time should be tax deductible.

The person or institution giving a gift is called the donor, and the person or institution getting the gift is called the donee.

==Donating in the name of others==
It is possible to donate in the name of a third party, making a gift in honor or memory of someone or something. Gifts in honor or memory of a third party are made for various reasons, such as holiday gifts, wedding gifts, in memory of somebody who has died, in memory of pets or in the name of groups or associations that no longer exist. Memorial gifts are sometimes requested by their survivors (e.g. &quot;in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to ABC Charity&quot;), usually directing donations to a charitable organization for which the deceased was a donor or volunteer, or for a cause befitting the deceased&#x27;s priorities in life or manner of death. Memorial donations are also sometimes given by people unable to attend the ceremony.

==Donating anonymously==
There are also circumstances when people like to donate funds to their preferred causes by not revealing their names. Many donors such as public figures or philanthropists like to stay anonymous while making generous donations for various reasons such as to not be asked for money from other organisations or their religious beliefs. Many donors like to stay anonymous because of their religious beliefs or simply don&#x27;t want any notoriety from giving.

<text>The broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) is a medium-sized hawk of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;. During the summer, some subspecies are distributed over eastern North America, as far west as British Columbia and Texas; they then migrate south to winter in the Neotropics from Mexico south to southern Brazil. Other subspecies are all-year residents on Caribbean islands. As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged hawks&#x27; wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered, somewhat pointed appearance. The two types of coloration are a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. Although the broad-winged hawk&#x27;s numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation.

==Description==

The broad-winged hawk is a relatively small &quot;Buteo&quot;, with a body size from in length and weighing . The tail is relatively short, measuring in length. The tarsus measures from . As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged hawks have relatively short and broad wings, pointed at the end, which have a tapered appearance unique to the species. The wingspan can range from , with the extended wing bone (standard measurement) measuring .

An adult&#x27;s body is a dark brown with a white belly and chest containing horizontal barring. Its tail can be a dark grey-black with white lines along the middle, base, and tip. The young hawks have a slightly different coloring with more white and longitudinal barring instead of horizontal barring. The two types of coloration are a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. The light morph of this bird is most likely to be confused with the red-shouldered hawk, which has a longer, more heavily barred tail and wings with a solid rufous color in the adult, which are usually distinctive. Rare dark morphs are a darker brown on both upperparts and underparts. Dark-morph short-tailed hawks are similar, but are whitish under the tail with a single subterminal band.

==Taxonomy==
This species, &quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;, is in the family Accipitridae, which is placed in the order Falconiformes (or Accipitriformes). Currently, the species is split into six subspecies; each is named for its distribution,
* &quot;B. p. platypterus&quot; – : The northern broad-winged hawk occurs throughout much of continental eastern North America.
* &quot;B. p. brunnescens&quot; – : The Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk occurs in the karst forests of Puerto Rico.
* &quot;B. p. cubanensis&quot; – : The Cuban broad-winged hawk occurs on Cuba.
* &quot;B. p. insulicola&quot; – : The Antigua broad-winged hawk occurs on Antigua.
* &quot;B. p. rivierei&quot; – : The Dominican broad-winged hawk occurs on Dominica, Martinique, and St. Lucia.
* &quot;B. p. antillarum&quot; – : The Antillean broad-winged hawk occurs in the Lesser Antilles from Saint Vincent and Grenada to Tobago, excluding Antigua.

==Habitat and distribution==
Broad-winged hawks have a wide range in North America and South America, from southern Canada to southern Brazil. Their breeding range is in the northern and eastern parts of North America, and some migrate in the winter to Florida, southern Mexico, and northern South America. Five subspecies are endemic to the Caribbean and do not migrate. Those subspecies that do migrate fly in flocks of more than 40 up to several thousand at heights from . They soar using thermals to carry them through their journey of . Fall migration lasts for 70 days as birds migrate about per day from North America, through Central America to South America without crossing salt water. The enormous flocks of soaring broad-winged hawks are termed kettles and are characteristic of many hawk migration spectacles in North America, such as at Hawk Cliff in Ontario, Hawk Ridge in Minnesota, Hawk Mountain in Pennsylvania, and the River of Raptors in Veracruz.

Broad-winged hawks stay in areas up to an elevation around . They breed in deciduous forests good for nesting and forage primarily in wetlands and meadows. While some birds have acclimatized themselves to living near humans, even those birds avoid human settlements and interactions. In the winter, the migrating subspecies of the hawks seek out similar conditions to their overwintering home, so they settle in deciduous and mixed forests.

Although it is declining in some areas because of forest fragmentation, its numbers are relatively stable and is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Behavior==

===Vocalization===
These hawks use vocalizations for communication with their mates and offspring, and in territorial displays towards intruders such as red-tailed hawks or other threatening animals. Their call sounds like a very high-pitched &quot;kee-ee&quot;, almost like a whistle. Fledglings learn to emit the call by the time they are one month old. When confronted with a threat, broad-winged hawks emit an alarm call consisting of stuttered and squealing whistles.

===Diet===
Broad-winged hawks are carnivores. The types of food they eat depends on the time of year and consists of whichever insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals (ranging from mice to small rabbits), and birds (up to the size of grouse and New World quails) are available at any given time. During the summer or nesting season the parents and ultimately their chicks eat small animals such as chipmunks, shrews, and voles, frogs, lizards, and sometimes even other nesting birds like cardinals, as well as sick or injured birds. In the winter, they have been observed feeding on insects (such as grasshoppers, dragonflies, and saturniid moth caterpillars), frogs, lizards, snakes, crabs, earthworms, and small mammals. To catch their prey, broad-winged hawks watch from low branches, hiding in the foliage, until a target is spotted. From their roost they do a short, fast glide to capture the prey. They give special attention to preparing their food for consumption, skinning frogs and snakes and plucking prey birds&#x27; feathers. Most small mammals, though, are eaten whole. They rarely drink water and are able to survive solely with the water present in their prey.

===Reproduction===
These birds have only one mate during the breeding season, possibly because the male also helps a small amount with the rearing of the chicks. They breed between April and August, starting when they reach sexual maturity at about two years old.

To attract and court females, the males perform a courtship display flight including cartwheels, dives, and other aerial acrobatics. Birds meet in the air, hook their feet together and spiral down together. They also compete and fight with other males for the chance to mate with a female. If one of the males is successful, the mating pair has only one brood that season, consisting of one to four eggs.

Both the male and female build the nest out of sticks and twigs in a deciduous tree. Once laid, the brown-spotted eggs are typically and weigh about . The female then develops a brood patch and incubates the eggs for 28 days or longer before they hatch.

The hatchlings will appear semialtricial, incapable of any complex coordination, but have open eyes and are covered in down feathers. Chicks have rapid body growth until they are almost at adult body size, when they are capable of walking, flying, and eating without parental help. While in the nest, the female gives most of the parental care, protecting and providing food for the chicks. The male may provide some food for the female and offspring, but his visits are short lived.

Once a prey item is obtained for the nest, the female tears off pieces and feeds the chicks until they are able to rip meat off on their own. Often, the chicks fight for possession of the offered morsel, the younger ones usually losing and not getting enough.

Broad-winged hawks protect their nests in a show of aggression (i.e. diving and chasing) towards any suspected threat, but they generally do not make physical contact. Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, crows, porcupines, and American black bears. Adults have been known to fall to red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bald eagles, and golden eagles. The hatchlings need 5–6 weeks before they are able to leave the nest. Some young, even after that time, remain in the area of the nest for several weeks more.

<text>In computer science, group coded recording or group code recording (GCR) refers to several distinct but related encoding methods for representing data on magnetic media. The first, used in magnetic tape since 1973, is an error-correcting code combined with a run-length limited (RLL) encoding scheme, belonging into the group of modulation codes. The others are similar encoding methods used in mainframe hard disks or microcomputer floppy disks until the late 1980s. GCR is a modified form of a NRZI code, but necessarily with a higher transition density.

== Magnetic tape ==
Group coded recording was first used for magnetic-tape data storage on 9-track reel-to-reel tape. The term was coined during the development of the IBM 3420 Model 4/6/8 Magnetic Tape Unit and the corresponding 3803 Model 2 Tape Control Unit, both introduced in 1973. IBM referred to the error correcting code itself as &quot;group coded recording&quot;. However, GCR has come to refer to the recording format of (250 bits/mm) tape as a whole, and later to formats which use similar RLL codes without the error correction code.

In order to reliably read and write to magnetic tape, several constraints on the signal to be written must be followed. The first is that two adjacent flux reversals must be separated by a certain distance on the media, defined by the magnetic properties of the media itself. The second is that there must be a reversal often enough to keep the reader&#x27;s clock in phase with the written signal; that is, the signal must be self-clocking and most importantly to keep the playback output high enough as this is proportional to the density of flux transitions. Prior to tapes, tapes satisfied these constraints using a technique called phase encoding (PE), which was only 50% efficient. For GCR tapes, a (0, 2) RLL code is used, or more specifically a  (0, 2) block code sometimes also referred to as &quot;GCR (4B-5B)&quot; encoding. This code requires five bits to be written for every four bits of data. The code is structured so that no more than two zero bits (which are represented by lack of a flux reversal) can occur in a row, either within a code or between codes, no matter what the data was. This RLL code is applied independently to the data going to each of the nine tracks.

Of the 32 five-bit patterns, eight begin with two consecutive zero bits, six others end with two consecutive zero bits, and one more (10001) contains three consecutive zero bits. Removing the all-ones pattern (11111) from the remainder leaves 16 suitable code words.

The GCR RLL code:

11 of the nibbles (other than xx00 and 0001) have their code formed by prepending the complement of the most significant bit; i.e. abcd is encoded as abcd. The other five values are assigned codes beginning with 11. Nibbles of the form ab00 have codes 11ba, i.e. the bit reverse of the code for ab11. The code 0001 is assigned the remaining value 11011.

Because the all-ones code is not used in normal data, at most 8 one-bits can appear in a row. Sequences of 9 or more one-bits (in practice 14 all-ones codes, or 70 one-bits, were used) are used as a synchronization pattern.

Because of the extremely high density (for the time) of tape, the RLL code is not sufficient to ensure reliable data storage. On top of the RLL code, an error-correcting code called the Optimal Rectangular Code (ORC) is applied. This code is a combination of a parity track and polynomial code similar to a CRC, but structured for error correction rather than error detection. For every seven bytes written to the tape (before RLL encoding), an eighth check byte is calculated and written to the tape. When reading, the parity is calculated on each byte and exclusive-ORed with the contents of the parity track, and the polynomial check code calculated and exclusive-ORed with the received check code, resulting in two 8-bit syndrome words. If these are both zero, the data is error free. Otherwise, error-correction logic in the tape controller corrects the data before it is forwarded to the host. The error correcting code is able to correct any number of errors in any single track, or in any two tracks if the erroneous tracks can be identified by other means.

In newer IBM half-inch 18-track tape drives recording at ,  (0, 2) GCR was replaced by a more efficient  (0, 3) modulation code, mapping eight bits to nine bits.

== Hard disks ==
In the mid-1970s, Sperry Univac, ISS Division was working on large hard drives for the mainframe business using group coding.

== Floppy disks ==
Like magnetic tape drives, floppy disk drives have physical limits on the spacing of flux reversals (also called transitions, represented by one-bits).

=== Micropolis ===
Offering GCR-compatible diskette drives and floppy disk controllers (like the 100163-51-8 and 100163-52-6), Micropolis endorsed data encoding with group coded recording on 5¼-inch 100 tpi 77-track diskette drives to store twelve 512-byte sectors per track since 1977 or 1978.

=== Micro Peripherals ===
Micro Peripherals, Inc. (MPI) marketed double-density 5¼-inch disk drives (like the single-sided B51 and double-sided B52 drives) and a controller solution implementing GCR since early 1978.

=== Durango ===
The Durango Systems F-85 (introduced in September 1978) used single-sided 5¼-inch 100 tpi diskette drives providing 480 KB utilizing a proprietary high-density 4/5 group coded encoding. The machine was using a Western Digital FD1781 floppy disk controller, designed by a former Sperry ISS engineer, with 77-track Micropolis drives. In later models such as the Durango 800 series this was expanded to a double-sided option for 960 KB (946 KB formatted) per diskette.

=== Apple ===
For the Apple II floppy drive, Steve Wozniak invented a floppy controller which (along with the Disk II drive itself) imposed two constraints:
* Between any two one bits, there may be a maximum of one zero bit.
* Each 8-bit byte must start with a one bit.

The simplest scheme to ensure compliance with these limits is to record an extra &quot;clock&quot; transition before each data bit according to differential Manchester encoding or (digital) FM (frequency modulation). Known as 4-and-4 encoding, the resulting Apple implementation allowed only ten 256-byte sectors per track to be recorded on a single-density 5¼-inch floppy. It uses two bytes for each byte.

|+4-and-4 encoding table



Close to a month prior to the shipment of the disk drive in spring 1978, Wozniak realized that a more complex encoding scheme would allow each eight-bit byte on disk to hold five bits of useful data rather than four bits. This is because there are 34 bytes which have the top bit set and no two zero bits in a row. This encoding scheme became known as 5-and-3 encoding, and allowed 13 sectors per track; it was used for Apple DOS 3.1, 3.2, and 3.2.1, as well as for the earliest version of :

Reserved GCR-codes: 0xAA and 0xD5.

Wozniak called the system &quot;my most incredible experience at Apple and the finest job I did&quot;.

Later, the design of the floppy drive controller was modified to allow a byte on disk to contain up to one pair of zero bits in a row. This allowed each eight-bit byte to hold six bits of useful data, and allowed 16 sectors per track. This scheme is known as 6-and-2 encoding, and was used on Apple Pascal, Apple DOS 3.3 and ProDOS, and later with Apple FileWare drives in the Apple Lisa and the 400K and 800K 3½-inch disks on the Macintosh and Apple II. Apple did not originally call this scheme &quot;GCR&quot;, but the term was later applied to it to distinguish it from IBM PC floppies which used the MFM encoding scheme.

Reserved GCR-codes: 0xAA and 0xD5.

=== Commodore ===
Independently, Commodore Business Machines (CBM) created a group coded recording scheme for their Commodore 2040 floppy disk drive (launched in the spring of 1979). The relevant constraints on the 2040 drive were that no more than two zero bits could occur in a row; the drive imposed no special constraint on the first bit in a byte. This allowed the use of a scheme similar to that used in tape drives. Every four bits of data are translated into five bits on disk, using the same 5-bit codes as IBM to ensure there are never more than two zero bits in a row, but in a different order:

Like the IBM code, at most eight one bits in a row are possible, so Commodore used sequences of ten or more one bits in a row as a synchronization sequence.

This more efficient GCR scheme, combined with an approach at constant bit-density recording by gradually increasing the clock rate (zone constant angular velocity, ZCAV) and storing more physical sectors on the outer tracks than on the inner ones (zone bit recording, ZBR), enabled Commodore to fit on a standard single-sided single-density 5.25-inch floppy, where Apple fit (with 6-and-2 encoding) or (with 5-and-3 encoding) and an FM-encoded floppy held only .

=== Sirius/Victor ===
Similar, the 5.25-inch floppy drives of the Victor 9000 aka Sirius 1, designed by Chuck Peddle in 1981/1982, used a combination of GCR and zone bit recording by gradually decreasing a drive&#x27;s rotational speed for the outer tracks in nine zones while increasing the number of sectors per track to achieve formatted capacities of (single sided) / (double-sided) on 96 tpi media. The GCR code is identical to the Commodore one.

=== Brother ===
Starting around 1985, Brother introduced a family of dedicated word processor typewriters with integrated 3.5-inch 38-track diskette drive. Early models of the WP and used a Brother-specific group-coded recording scheme with twelve 256-byte sectors to store up to 120 KB on single-sided and up to 240 KB on double-sided double-density (DD) diskettes. Reportedly, prototypes were already shown at the Internationale Funkausstellung 1979 (IFA) in Berlin.

=== Sharp ===
In 1986, Sharp introduced a turnable 2.5-inch pocket disk drive solution (drives: CE-1600F, CE-140F; internally based on the FDU-250 chassis; media: CE-1650F) for their series of pocket computers with a formatted capacity of bytes per side (2× 64 kB nominal, 16 tracks, 8 sectors/track, 512 bytes per sector, 48 tpi, 250 kbit/s, 270 rpm) with GCR (4/5) recording.

== Other uses ==
GCR was also evaluated for a possible use in bar code encoding schemes (packing efficiency, timing tolerances, amount of storage bytes for timing information, and DC output level).

<text>Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca (; 5 August 1827 – 23 August 1892) was a Brazilian politician and military officer who served as the first president of Brazil. He was born in Alagoas in a military family, followed a military career, and became a national figure. Fonseca took office as provisional president after heading a military coup that deposed Emperor Pedro II and established the First Brazilian Republic in 1889, disestablishing the Empire. After his election in 1891, he stepped down the same year under great political pressure when he dissolved the National Congress. He died less than a year later.

==Early life==
Fonseca was born the third child of a large military family on 5 August 1827 in Alagoas da Lagoa do Sul, Alagoas, a town that now bears his name as Marechal Deodoro, in Northeast Brazil. He was the son of Manuel Mendes da Fonseca Galvão (1785–1859) and his wife, Rosa Maria Paulina de Barros Cavalcanti (1802–1873). During the Brazilian Empire, his older brother, Severino Martins da Fonseca, was nominated the first Baron of Alagoas. Another notable relative was the Portuguese humanist Francisco de Holanda (d. 1585), his remote uncle. Fonseca pursued a military career that was notable for his suppression of the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco in 1848, Brazil&#x27;s response to that year&#x27;s revolutions in Europe. He also saw action during the Paraguayan War (1864–1870), attaining the rank of captain. In 1884 he was promoted to the rank of field marshal, and he later achieved the rank of full marshal. His personal courage, military competence, and manly personal style made him a national figure.

==Political career==
As Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, Fonseca was courted by republican intellectuals such as Benjamin Constant and Ruy Barbosa in the café society of São Paulo. In 1886, alerted that the imperial government was ordering the arrest of prominent republicans, Fonseca went to Rio de Janeiro and assumed leadership of the army faction that supported the abolition of slavery in Brazil.

Emperor Pedro II had advocated the abolition of slavery for decades, freeing his own slaves in 1840, but he believed slavery should be done away with slowly to avoid damaging the Brazilian economy. The government, nominally headed by his daughter, Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolished slavery entirely in 1888, during her third regency while her father was away from the country. Enraged oligarchs played a role in the subsequent coup d&#x27;état. Fonseca&#x27;s prestige placed him at the head of the military coup that deposed the emperor on 15 November 1889, and he was briefly the head of the provisional government that called a Constituent Congress to draft a new constitution for a republic. Soon, however, he was in conflict with the civilian republican leaders. His election as president on 25 February 1891, by a narrow plurality, was backed with military pressure on Congress.

==Presidency==
The Fonseca administration, divided by political and personal animosity between Fonseca and Vice President Floriano Peixoto, encountered strong opposition within Congress, which chose a policy of obstruction. During the first months of his presidency, he permitted his ministers almost unrestricted control of their ministries. Arbitrary presidential decrees, such as the concession of the port of Torres to a private company and Decree 528, which opened the country to further immigration except by Africans, as well as the disastrous conduct of economic policy during the bubble of the Encilhamento, strengthened the resistance in Congress, which coalesced around Peixoto and soured public opinion. That also caused republicans in the South to withdraw their support from the marshal and provisional government. The situation reached a crisis stage when Fonseca dissolved the National Congress and declared a &quot;state of emergency&quot; on 3 November 1891. A group of deputies opposed the decision and found support among the high-ranking officers of the Navy, including Admiral Custódio José de Melo. The marshal found himself on the brink of a civil war. On 23 November 1891, he signed a resignation to no one in particular and turned over the presidency to Peixoto.

== Death ==
He died in Rio de Janeiro on 23 August 1892. He was stricken with perilous bouts of dyspnea, popularly referred to as &quot;shortness of breath&quot;, and was buried in a family grave in the Caju Cemetery. However, in 1937, his remains were unearthed and transferred to a monument in Praça Paris, Rio de Janeiro.

== Gallery ==
== In popular culture ==
Fonseca has been portrayed twice by Brazilian actor and voice actor in the miniseries &quot;Abolição&quot; (1988) and &quot;República&quot; (1989) respectively.

<text>The Kroger Company, or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates (either directly or through its subsidiaries) supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States.

Founded by Bernard Kroger in 1883 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Kroger operates 2,719 grocery retail stores under its various banners and divisions in 35 states (mostly in the South, Midwest and West) and the District of Columbia. Its store formats include 134 multi-department stores, 2,273 combo stores, 191 marketplace stores, and 121 price-impact warehouse stores. Kroger operates 33 manufacturing plants, 1,642 supermarket fuel centers, 2,254 pharmacies, 225 The Little Clinic in-store medical clinics, and 127 jewelry stores (782 convenience stores were sold to EG Group in 2018). Kroger&#x27;s headquarters are located in downtown Cincinnati.

The Kroger Company is the largest supermarket operator in the U.S. by revenue and the country&#x27;s fifth-largest general retailer. The company is one of the largest American-owned private employers in the United States. Additionally, Kroger is ranked No. 25 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. It is frequently listed as being a good dividend stock for investors in 2024.

About two-thirds of Kroger&#x27;s employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements, with most being represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).

==History==

=== Early history (1883 to 1950s) ===
In 1883, 23-year-old Bernard Kroger, the fifth of ten children of German immigrants, invested his life savings of $372 () to open a grocery store at 66 Pearl Street in downtown Cincinnati. The son of a merchant, he ran his business with a simple motto: &quot;Be particular. Never sell anything you would not want yourself.&quot; He experimented with marketing products his company had produced so that his customers would not need to patronize separate stores and farms.

In 1884, Kroger opened his second store. By 1902, Kroger Grocery and Baking Company had been incorporated. By this time, the company had grown to forty stores and sold $1.75 million worth of merchandise each year. In addition, Kroger became the first grocery chain to have its own bakery.

In 1916, Kroger company began using self-service shopping. Before this, all articles were kept behind counters. Customers would ask for them, then clerks would deliver them to customers.

In 1929, it was rumored that Safeway would merge with Kroger. It took nearly a century before this rumor became reality, when Kroger announced in 2022 that it would acquire Safeway&#x27;s parent company, Albertsons.

In the 1930s, Kroger Grocery and Baking Company became the first grocery chain to monitor product quality and to test foods offered to customers. It also became the first company with a store surrounded on all four sides by parking lots. In 1932, the company tested a pilot project after it opened a grocery store in Indianapolis. The facility, which was surrounded by a 75-car parking space, allowed the company to determine the close relationship between parking facilities and gross sales.

===1950s and 1960s ===

Beginning in 1955, Kroger began acquiring supermarket chains, expanding into new markets. In May, Kroger entered the Houston, Texas, market by acquiring the Houston-based 26-store chain Henke &amp; Pillot. In June, Kroger acquired the Krambo Food Stores, Inc. of Appleton, Wisconsin. In July, it purchased Child&#x27;s Food Stores, Inc. of Jacksonville, Texas, and operated 25 supermarkets in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.

In January 1956, the company bought out Big Chain Stores, Inc., a chain of seven stores based in Shreveport, Louisiana, later combining it with the Childs group. All of these chains adopted the Kroger banner in 1966.

During all the acquisitions, in September 1957, Kroger sold off its Wichita, Kansas, store division, which consisted of 16 stores, to J. S. Dillon and Sons Stores Company, then headed by Ray S. Dillon, son of the company founder.

In October 1963, Kroger acquired the 56-store chain Market Basket, providing them with a foothold in the lucrative southern California market. Prior to this time, Kroger had no stores west of Kansas. Kroger, however, failed to make significant headway, only managing a 5 percent market share. By 1982, it withdrew from the California market.

Kroger opened stores in Florida under the SupeRx and Florida Choice banners from the 1960s until 1988, when the chain decided to exit the state and sold all of its stores; Kash n&#x27; Karry bought the largest share.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Kroger became the first grocer in the United States to test an electronic scanner and the first to formalize consumer research.

Although Kroger has long operated stores in the Huntsville-Decatur area of northern Alabama (as a southern extension of its Nashville, Tennessee, region), it has not operated in the state&#x27;s largest market, Birmingham, since the early 1970s, when it exited as a result of intense competition from Winn-Dixie and local chains Bruno&#x27;s Supermarkets and Western Supermarkets.

Kroger built an ultra-modern dairy plant (Crossroad Farms Dairy) in Indianapolis in 1972. At the time, it was considered the largest dairy plant in the world.

Kroger exited the Chicago market in 1970, selling its distribution warehouse in Northlake, Il. and 24 stores to the Dominick&#x27;s Finer Foods grocery chain.

Kroger exited the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area in 1970, selling 16 stores to Quality Foods, which rebranded the stores to Piggly Wiggly.

Kroger exited Milwaukee in 1972, selling a few stores to Jewel. Kroger would later return in 2015 upon its acquisition of Roundy&#x27;s.

Kroger entered the Charlotte market in 1977 and expanded rapidly throughout the 1980s when it bought some stores from BI-LO. However, most stores were in less desirable neighborhoods and did not fit in with Kroger&#x27;s upscale image. Less than three months after BI-LO pulled out, that company decided to re-enter the Charlotte market, and in 1988, Kroger announced it was pulling out of the Charlotte market and put its stores up for sale. Ahold bought Kroger&#x27;s remaining stores in the Charlotte area and converted them to BI-LO.

In 1978, sixteen retail members of Parkview Markets Inc., filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Kroger.

===1980s===
Kroger had a number of stores in the Western Pennsylvania region, encompassing Pittsburgh and surrounding areas from 1928 until 1984 when the U.S. began experiencing a severe economic recession. The recession had two significant and related effects on Kroger&#x27;s operations in the region. One of them was that the highly cyclical manufacturing-based economy of the region declined in greater proportion than the rest of the U.S., which undercut demand for the higher-end products and services offered by Kroger. 

Kroger sought wage rollbacks in several areas during this time period including in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, the West Virginia Panhandle and Michigan. The second effect of the economic recession was to worsen labor-management relations, causing a protracted labor strike in 1983 and 1984. During the strike, Kroger withdrew all of its stores from the Western Pennsylvania market, including some recently opened &quot;superstores&quot; and &quot;greenhouses&quot;, selling these stores to Wetterau (now part of SuperValu), who promptly flipped the stores to independent owners while continuing to supply them under the FoodLand and Shop &#x27;n Save brands. Kroger&#x27;s exit ceded the market to lower-cost, locally owned rivals, most notably Giant Eagle and the SuperValu-supplied grocers. (Kroger purchased Eagle Grocery company, whose founders went on to create Giant Eagle.) Kroger still maintains a presence in the nearby Morgantown, West Virginia, Wheeling, West Virginia, and Weirton, West Virginia/Steubenville, Ohio, areas where Giant Eagle has a much smaller presence and the SuperValu-supplied stores are virtually nonexistent, though in all of these cases, Walmart remains a major competitor and Aldi is the only other supermarket with any market overlap.

Kroger entered the competitive San Antonio, Texas, market in 1980 but pulled out in mid-1993. On June 15, 1993, the company announced the closure of its 15 area stores. From 1984 to 1986, Kroger exited the Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Akron, and St. Louis markets. The company cited that higher wages for union employees made it unable to compete.

The chain closed several stores around Flint, Michigan, in 1981, which were converted by local businessman Al Kessel to a new chain called Kessel Food Markets. Kroger bought most of these stores back in 1999 and began reverting them. Several other Michigan stores were sold to another Flint-based chain, Hamady Brothers, in 1980. The Hamady acquisition was short-lived.

In 1982, Kroger sold the 65-store Market Basket chain it had operated for several years in southern California. The stores were reverted to the Boys Markets branding, after acquiring the chain. Boys Markets was acquired by the Yucaipa Companies in 1989. When Yucaipa acquired Ralphs, the Boys brand disappeared.

In 1983, The Kroger Company acquired Dillon Companies grocery chain in Kansas along with its subsidiaries (King Soopers, City Market, Fry&#x27;s and Gerbes) and the convenience store chain Kwik Shop. David Dillon, a fourth-generation descendant of J. S. Dillon, the founder of Dillon Companies, became the CEO of Kroger.

In northeastern Ohio, Kroger had a plant in Solon, Ohio, until the mid-1980s. When that plant shut down, Kroger closed its northeastern Ohio stores in the Cleveland, Akron, and Youngstown areas. Some of those former Kroger stores were taken over by stores like Acme Fresh Markets, Giant Eagle, and Heinens.

Kroger opened and had about 50 stores in St. Louis until it left the market in 1986, saying that its stores were unprofitable. Most of its stores were bought by National, Schnucks, and Shop &#x27;n Save. Most of the remaining Kroger stores in eastern Missouri and west-central Illinois became a western extension of the Central Division (headquartered in Indianapolis).

Kroger also experienced a similar withdrawal from Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1989. Many of these stores were sold to the local grocery chain Red Food, which was in turn bought by BI-LO in 1994. Today, Chattanooga is the only metropolitan market in Tennessee in which Kroger does not operate with the nearest location being Dalton, Georgia, with 2 stores (Walnut Avenue and Cleveland Highway).

===1990s===
In the 1990s, Kroger acquired Great Scott (Detroit), Pay Less Food Markets, Owen&#x27;s Market, JayC Food Stores, and Hilander Foods. Additionally, the Houston market was strengthened when Kroger bought several stores from AppleTree Markets, which were former Safeway stores in early 1994.

In 1998, Kroger merged with the then fifth-largest grocery company Fred Meyer, along with its subsidiaries, Ralphs, QFC, and Smith&#x27;s.

In the late 1990s, it acquired many stores from A&amp;P as it exited many markets in the South.

Kroger also swapped all ten of its Greensboro, North Carolina-area stores in 1999 to Matthews, North Carolina-based Harris Teeter, for 11 of that company&#x27;s stores in central and western Virginia. Kroger in turn would acquire Harris Teeter 15 years later.

===2000s===
Long the dominant grocer in western Virginia, Kroger entered the Richmond, Virginia, market in 2000, where it competes against market leaders Martin&#x27;s (including former Ukrop&#x27;s stores) and Food Lion. Kroger entered the market by purchasing Hannaford stores that either already existed or were being built in Richmond. Hannaford purchases also included the competitive Hampton Roads market, where it now competes with Farm Fresh, Harris Teeter (which is owned by Kroger), and Food Lion. The Hannaford locations in these markets were purchased from Delhaize by Kroger as a condition of Delhaize&#x27;s 2000 acquisition of the Hannaford chain, which had previously competed against Food Lion, also owned by Delhaize. Walmart Supercenters are also major competitors in both markets, and the chain briefly competed against Winn-Dixie, which has now exited Virginia.

In 2001, Kroger acquired Baker&#x27;s Supermarkets from Fleming Companies, Inc.

Albertsons exited the San Antonio and Houston markets in early 2002, selling many of the Houston stores to Kroger.

In 2004, Kroger bought most of the old Thriftway stores in Cincinnati, Ohio, when Winn-Dixie left the area. These stores were reopened as Kroger stores.

In 2007, Kroger acquired Scott&#x27;s Food &amp; Pharmacy from SuperValu Inc., and in the same year, also acquired 20 former Michigan Farmer Jack locations from A&amp;P when A&amp;P exited the Michigan Market.

In 2008, Kroger began a partnership with Murray&#x27;s Cheese of New York City. Murray&#x27;s Cheese counters within Kroger stores sell various artisanal cheese from all parts of the world.

===2010s===
On July 9, 2013, Kroger announced that it would acquire the 212 stores of Charlotte-based Harris Teeter in a deal valued at $2.5 billion and that it would assume $100 million in the company&#x27;s outstanding debt. Harris Teeter&#x27;s stores are in eight Southern states, with a major portion of them in its headquarters state of North Carolina. Doing so, Kroger acquired Harris Teeter&#x27;s click-and-collect program, which allows online ordering of groceries. Some industry experts saw this as a competitive move against online grocers such as AmazonFresh. The Harris Teeter acquisition marked Kroger&#x27;s return to the Charlotte market after a 25-year absence. It also allowed Kroger to enter Asheville for the first time. Charlotte and Asheville had been the only large markets in North Carolina where Kroger had no presence.

In 2013, Kroger announced that the spouses of the company&#x27;s unionized workers would no longer be covered by the company&#x27;s insurance plan. The company cited the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as a prime reason for the move. The benefit cut affected roughly 11,000 workers in Indiana. The company announced in April 2013 that full-time employees would maintain their health insurance benefits. In 2013, Kroger was noted for carrying 17 out of 22 Red List species, four of which are in the top list of said species.

On March 3, 2015, Kroger announced it would enter Hawaii, having registered with the state as a new business in February 2015. Kroger was planning to expand to Hawaii in 2006 but withdrew after it had already submitted registration. Kroger, which is in the process of looking for locations to open its first store, will face competition from Honolulu-based rivals Foodland and Times; major retailers Safeway, Walmart, and Costco; Japanese-owned Don Quixote; and Department of Defense-owned DeCA Commissaries.

On May 1, 2015, Kroger announced the acquisition of the seven-store Hiller&#x27;s Market chain in Southeast Michigan, and that it would operate all but one of those stores under the Kroger banner.

In June 2015, Kroger eliminated the Harris Teeter brand from the crowded Nashville, Tennessee, market, where its growth had been stunted by aggressive competition since it entered with six stores in the early 2000s. Kroger has traditionally had a market-leading presence in Nashville and initially promised to keep the five remaining Harris Teeter stores open when it acquired the chain, but the market &quot;did not support Harris Teeter&#x27;s future business plans&quot;. Two Harris Teeter stores were closed outright, and three closed temporarily while being converted to the Kroger brand (one of these would undergo a major remodeling and replace a neighboring Kroger store).

On November 11, 2015, Kroger and Roundy&#x27;s announced a definitive merger, bringing Roundy&#x27;s chain&#x27;s 166 primarily Wisconsin-based chains under Kroger ownership. The merger is valued at $800 million, including debt. The acquisition, which brought Kroger back to Wisconsin after a 43-year absence, will retain the Roundy&#x27;s, Pick &#x27;n Save, Mariano&#x27;s, Metro Market and Copps names, along with its Milwaukee operations. (Within a year-and-a-half, however, Kroger had rebranded all Copps locations to the Pick &#x27;n Save banner.)

In April 2016, Kroger announced that it had made a &quot;meaningful investment&quot; in the Boulder, Colorado-based Lucky&#x27;s Market, an organic foods supermarket chain that operated 17 stores in 13 states throughout the Midwest and Southeast United States.

In February 2017, Kroger withstood large community protests after announcing the closing of two smaller-sized Louisville-area stores.
Despite high store volumes and high population densities, the Old Louisville (lease expiration) and Southland Terrace stores closed.

On February 7, 2017, it was announced that Kroger Co. had purchased Murray&#x27;s Cheese.

, Kroger is no longer offering a discount to senior citizens 59 and up.

On May 1, 2017, Kroger, along with the University of Kentucky and UK Athletics, sports and campus marketing partner JMI Sports, announced a 12-year, $1.85 million per year campus marketing agreement. Included in the agreement is the naming rights to Commonwealth Stadium, the university&#x27;s football stadium, which will be renamed Kroger Field. This agreement makes the University of Kentucky the first school in the Southeastern Conference to enter into a corporate partnership for the naming rights to their football stadium.

On May 10, 2017, Kroger opened its first convenience store in Blacklick, Ohio, labeled &quot;Fresh Eats MKT&quot;. The new prototype stores will have about of space, and will be very similar to the Walmart Neighborhood Market project, as these stores only sell food. These stores have a Starbucks, and a Kroger Pharmacy. On June 1, 2017, Kroger opened their second Fresh Eats. Kroger is also going to convert some Turkey Hill stores into the concept store. The CFO, Mike Schlotman, has called these stores a &quot;small test.&quot; Local reaction to this new concept has been positive. The concept was discontinued in March 2020.

In February 2018, Kroger announced that it will be selling its 762 convenience stores to EG Group, a British service station operator, for $2.15 billion. They operate under the &quot;Turkey Hill&quot;, &quot;Loaf &#x27;N Jug&quot;, &quot;Kwik Shop&quot;, &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; and &quot;Quik Stop&quot; banners. Kroger will retain just over 20 convenience stores. Kroger&#x27;s supermarket fuel centers are not included in the sale. The sale was closed on April 20, 2018.

On April 10, 2018, Kroger announced plans to hire an estimated 11,000 new employees. An estimated 2,000 managerial positions will be filled by the new hires. With the addition of these new hires, the total number of people employed by the company is close to half a million.

On May 17, 2018, Kroger announced a partnership with Ocado, a UK-based online supermarket. The partnership is designed to improve Kroger&#x27;s ecommerce program, including online ordering, automated fulfillment, and home delivery via the construction of 20 new, automated fulfillment centers. The first of these fulfillment centers, located in Monroe, Ohio, opened in April 2021. , eight total fulfillment center locations have been constructed and opened, with additional locations in Groveland, Florida, Forest Park, Georgia, Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, Dallas, Texas, Romulus, Michigan, Aurora, Colorado, and Frederick, Maryland. Each fulfillment center also operate in conjunction with several &quot;spoke&quot; facilities, which assist to further extend the capable range of delivery. , the latest &quot;spoke&quot; facility to be opened is located in Johnstown, Colorado. Kroger has taken advantage of its investment in online shopping capability to grow rapidly during the pandemic. In 2020, Kroger&#x27;s online sales grew by 116%, to over $10B annually.

On May 24, 2018, Kroger announced they were acquiring Home Chef for $200 million with an additional $500 million in incentives if certain targets are met by Home Chef.

On June 13, 2018, Kroger Mid-Atlantic announced the Kroger branding will be leaving the Raleigh-Durham area by eliminating all 14 Kroger-branded stores, eight of which will transition to Harris Teeter (also owned by Kroger). One will become a Crunch Fitness and another will become a Food Lion. The fate for the remaining four stores is unclear.

In July 2018, Kroger officials backed off a Net 90 payment plan to the produce industry.

In October 2018, Kroger announced online wine delivery to 14 states in partnership with DRINKS. Customers can select assorted wines in 6-bottle or 12-bottle packs.

On December 4, 2018, Kroger announced a deal to sell food inside drugstore Walgreens. Kroger Express will offer meal kits and other meal solutions.

In the light of increased self-checkout usage via kiosk or smartphone app in 2019, Kroger is gradually shifting towards creating more self-checkout smartphone apps and lanes than cashier lanes. The company has been investing millions of dollars, in replacing many cashier stations with automation by 2023. As many other supermarkets (such as Walmart and Target) are also shifting towards automation, and displacing cashiers in the near future.

In March 2019, Kroger announced it was expanding its service with robotics company Nuro to Houston, Texas, with Nuro&#x27;s autonomous Priuses.

In August 2019, Kroger began charging customers between $0.50 and $3.50 for receiving cash back while making purchases with debit cards. The new fees were first test marketed in March at Kansas area Dillons stores, a Kroger-owned supermarket chain, before the new fees were rolled out to other Kroger-owned supermarket banners in the rest of the nation.

In September 2019, Kroger announced a partnership with the Plant Based Food Association (PFBA) to test a plant-based meat retail concept in 60 stores in Denver, and parts of Indiana and Illinois.

In November 2019, Kroger unveiled an updated logo for their stores and company, with the &#x27;&quot;Fresh For Everyone&quot; tagline and the &quot;Krojis&quot;. The company also announced an expansion of its online wine delivery program into Arizona. In partnership with DRINKS, the service is now available in 19 states plus Washington D.C.

In December 2019, Kroger was named the second-largest grocer in the nation with $110 billion in 2016 sales. The same month, &quot;USA Today&quot; listed Kroger—and its brands—as the top supermarket (based on Google searches, Yelp data, and 24/7 Tempo&#x27;s research) in Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.

===2020s===

According to a &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; February 13, 2021 broadcast, during the pandemic, Kroger provided their essential workers with a hazard pay, which the company called &quot;hero pay.&quot; The hero pay consisted of a raise of US$2 an hour from the end of March 2020 until May 2020, when the hero pay ended. In January 2021, the Long Beach City Council in California passed an ordinance making it mandatory for some large grocery stores—like Kroger—to provide their essential workers with a hazard pay increase of US$4 an hour &quot;effective immediately for 120 days&quot;. The ordinance affected companies with &quot;more than 300 workers nationwide and more than 15 employees per store&quot;.

Seattle and Washington passed similar ordinances. In response, in early February, Kroger announced the closure and permanent termination of the entire operations of some of their stores—including a Ralphs and a Food4Less in Long Beach—&quot;for economic reasons including the economic cost mandated by the Long Beach ordinance requiring an increase in employee wages, four dollars an hour&quot;. Kroger closed two Seattle QFC stores in April 2021 blaming that City&#x27;s Covid Related Hazard Pay Law. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), with members whose jobs had been terminated, viewed the closures as a &quot;warning to other cities considering hazard pay mandates&quot;.

Andrea Zinder, president of the UFCW Local 324 that represents employees at the two Long Beach stores—Ralphs and a Food4Less—said that compared to the same time period in 2019 both stores saw an increase of about 30% in sales. In 2020, during the pandemic, Kroger&#x27;s earnings increased by 87.7%. Kroger&#x27;s quarterly revenues as reported by November 20, 2020, were US$29.72 billion, and the corporation&#x27;s per-share earnings and dividends grew at a rapid rate in 2020. Its dividend increase was about 14% annually.

Starting in early 2020, Berkshire Hathaway began buying shares of Kroger, and by August 2021 became a top ten shareholder.

In July 2021, a wrongful-death lawsuit was filed against Kroger by the family of worker Evan Seyfried. Seyfried committed suicide after allegedly enduring abuse at the Kroger location in Milford, Ohio, where he had worked for 19 years. According to the lawsuit, Seyfried was bullied for wearing a mask in the early days of the pandemic and taunted for his political views. Also on the receiving end of alleged workplace sabotage, one of Seyfried&#x27;s co-workers called the company&#x27;s ethics helpline and reported that she and Seyfried were being bullied. However, no action was taken. In December 2021, Kroger Co. announced the elimination of some COVID-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees.

In 2021, the company was reported to have been breached by a third-party hack which compromised the pharmacy records of Kroger owned Fred Meyer and QFC stores&#x27; customers.

In April 2021, Kroger sold what were previously Fred Meyer properties located in Shoreline, Puyallup and Tacoma to Benderson Development Company for a combined $98.7 million. In May 2021, Benderson Development bought an additional twenty-eight Fred Meyer properties (as part of a &quot;sale-leaseback investment&quot;) for an estimated $500 million as part of a sale totaling 380 acres and 4.5 million square feet of retail space.

On August 2, 2021, Kroger announced that it had elected Elaine Chao to its board of directors. Chao was formerly Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump. The news was met with backlash from a small number of Kroger customers on Twitter, with calls for a boycott trending nationally due to her ties to the Trump administration and to her husband, Mitch McConnell.

On September 23, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a Kroger location in Collierville, Tennessee. One person was killed and 13 others were injured before the gunman, identified as 29-year-old Uk Thang, committed suicide by gunshot. Thang was working at the store as a third-party vendor. In the aftermath of the shooting, Kroger offered counseling services for its employees and closed down the store until November 10.

In September 2021, Kroger tweaked its logo to add the &quot;Fresh Cart&quot; symbol. The symbol is an abstract shopping cart with the basket represented as citrus slices.

In October 2021, Kroger announced an expansion into South Florida with its online delivery service, Kroger Delivery. To do this, Kroger will build two new automated fulfilment centers assisted and facilitated by the UK-based technology company Ocado Group. Kroger Delivery is also set to launch in the Northeast of the US and expand its operations in California, to be followed by sites in Texas, Georgia, Maryland, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and North Carolina. The company launched its online delivery services in Central Florida earlier in 2021.

On April 5, 2022, Kroger launched Kroger Restaurant Supply in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, a new business distributing food and related supplies to restaurants, bakeries, and catering companies. For Kroger, this move into foodservice distribution represents an expansion beyond its core retail grocery operations.

On October 14, 2022, Kroger announced a merger with Albertsons in a deal worth $24.6billion, combining both companies into one entity but divesting some stores to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers to secure regulatory approval. However, in January 2024, Washington state sued to block the proposed $25 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons, warning that if approved it could raise prices and harm consumers. In February 2024, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser also filed a lawsuit, saying consumers told him they feared it &quot;would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.” In February 2024, the FTC sued to block the acquisition stating that the deal would negatively impact consumer prices and workers&#x27; wages.

A 2022 Economic Roundtable survey of 10,000 Kroger&#x27;s workers in Colorado, Southern California, Washington found that wages have declined over the last several years while over the same period executive pay has increased. The survey found that over 75% of workers experience food insecurity, over 66% struggle to meet basic needs and 14% experience homelessness, while CEO Rodney McMullen made over $22 million in 2020, compared to $12 million for the year 2018. According to Peter Dreier, who participated in the project: &quot;There are workers sleeping in RVs or couch surfing or living in parks somewhere. Americans go to their local supermarket every week and smile at the person cashing them out, not aware that the person they&#x27;re talking to is going to sleep in a car after they clock out.&quot; About two-thirds of Kroger employees are part-time workers, whose schedules often change making it difficult to take a second job.

On July 9, 2024, Kroger released the complete list of 579 stores that would be divested in order to satisfy anti-trust concerns from the Federal Trade Commission. Within the list of stores being proposed for divestment, the Dallas market would be the most affected, with 26 Albertsons locations being sold which includes the Tom Thumb chain and six Market Street locations. Following the announcement, the United Food and Commercial Workers made a statement saying that they will continue to oppose the merger and that Kroger&#x27;s announcement &quot;changes nothing&quot;. In December, 2024, a U.S. district judge ruled against the proposed merger, stating that it would be bad for consumers and employees.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2020, Kroger reported earnings of US$1.907 billion, with an annual revenue of US$122.286 billion, an increase of 0.4% over the previous fiscal cycle. Kroger&#x27;s shares traded at over $32 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$25.9 billion in April 2020.

==Chains==
==Kroger Marketplace==
Kroger Marketplace is a chain of big-box stores. The brand was introduced in 2004 in the Columbus, Ohio, area, which lost the Big Bear and Big Bear Plus chains in Penn Traffic&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Kroger Marketplace format is based on the Fry&#x27;s Marketplace stores that the Arizona division of Kroger is currently operating. There are currently a total of 188 marketplaces.

Similar to rival chains Meijer, Kmart, Target, Walmart, and Albertsons; the stores are modeled after Kroger-owned Fred Meyer which house multiple departments. In addition to the grocery department, stores typically include a Fred Meyer Jewelers, Starbucks, Donatos Pizza, an in-store bank, and sections for toys, appliances, home furnishings as well as bed and bath; a format Big Bear had in their stores in the Columbus area.

The store in Liberty Township opened in July 2006. On October 5, 2006, a new Kroger Marketplace opened in Gahanna. With the Gahanna opening, the number of Kroger Marketplace stores grew to six, four in the Columbus area and two in the Cincinnati area.

==Manufacturing and distribution==
===Distribution and logistics===
Food distribution and buying takes place under various subsidiaries and divisions. These include:
* Kroger Group Cooperative, Inc.
* Kroger Group, Inc.
* Peytons
* WESCO
* Inter-American Products

Kroger operates its own fleet of trucks and trailers to distribute products to its various stores, in addition to contracts with various trucking companies. In June 2018, Kroger announced testing driverless cars for delivering groceries. For this, Kroger is partnering with autonomous car company Nuro.

In addition to stocking a variety of regional brand products, The Kroger Company also employs one of the largest networks of private label manufacturing in the country. Thirty-three plants (either wholly owned or used with operating agreements) in seventeen states create about 40% of Kroger&#x27;s private label products. Similar to most major supermarket retailers, Kroger uses a three-tiered private label marketing strategy. One private brand emphasizes no-frills products at the lowest possible price, another is intended to be comparable to leading national brands but a better value and the third is a premium (often organic) brand.

==Private label brands==
Kroger offers a collection of its own branded products, referred to by the retailer as &quot;Our Brands&quot;. The products are produced and sold in quality tiers, and account for over 30% of the retailer&#x27;s unit sales.

===Banner Brand===
Banner Brand items are goods that bear the name of Kroger or its subsidiaries (i.e., Ralphs, King Soopers, etc.) or make reference to them (i.e., Big K), and are offered exclusively within Kroger-owned stores. These products are marketed to customers as budget-friendly, and account for over $13 billion in annual sales. Many of Kroger&#x27;s health and beauty goods, one of the company&#x27;s fastest-growing private label categories, are manufactured by third-party providers; these products include goods like ibuprofen and contact lens solution.

===Private Selection===

Products marked &quot;Private Selection&quot; are offered to compare with gourmet brands or regional brands that may be considered more upscale than the standard Kroger brand products.

===Simple Truth===
&quot;Simple Truth&quot; is Kroger&#x27;s flagship natural and organic brand, and has grown quickly since its launch in 2012. The brand&#x27;s launch marked the first time Kroger had delved into making its own gluten-free products, including flour mixes, bread, etc. The Simple Truth brand became the first Kroger offering to be introduced in China, on Alibaba&#x27;s Tmall platform. Simple Truth reached $2 billion in annual sales in 2018.

===Other private label brands===
In addition to its core brands, Kroger&#x27;s manufacturing creates a variety department-specific brands. These are featured especially in Fred Meyer stores, where more than half the goods sold are non-food, or in the smaller Fred Meyer-based Marketplace stores. The brands listed below may be found in various Kroger-owned stores.

* Abound – natural pet food
* Bakery Fresh Goodness – fresh-baked foods
* Bloom Haus – floral arrangements
* Comforts – baby products
* Dip – fast fashion brand designed by Joe Mimran
* Everyday Living – home goods
* HD Designs – upscale home goods
* HemisFares – imported foods
* Home Chef – meal kit and food delivery company acquired in 2018
* Luvsome – pet food
* Murray&#x27;s Cheese – artisanal cheese shop founded in Greenwich Village in 1940
* OfficeWorks – stationery and office supplies
* Pet Pride – pet food

==Other operations==
===Pharmacy Group===
Kroger previously owned and operated the SupeRx drug store chain. In 1985, Kroger outbid Rite Aid for the Hook&#x27;s Drug Stores chain, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, and combined it with SupeRx to become Hook&#x27;s-SupeRx. In 1994, Kroger decided to exit the stand-alone drugstore business and sold its Hook&#x27;s and SupeRx stores to Revco, which later was sold to CVS.

Today, Kroger operates 2,252 pharmacies, most of which are located inside its supermarkets. The Kroger Pharmacies continue as a profitable portion of the business and have been expanding to now include pharmacies in City Market, Dillons, Fred Meyer, Fry&#x27;s, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs, Harris Teeter, Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug, and Kroger Supermarkets.

===Supermarket Petroleum Group===
Since 1998, Kroger has added fuel centers in the parking lots of its supermarkets. More recently, the company has begun opening standalone fuel centers, often near stores whose parking lots could not accommodate a fuel center. As of Q2 2022, Kroger operated 1,629 supermarket fuel centers.

In 2006, Kroger introduced a new common logo for all of its convenience store chains that is now also used at the fuel centers of all of its supermarket chains—a rhombus with a white, stylized image of the continental United States in the center bordered by four colored areas: dark blue representing the Pacific Ocean, red representing Canada, green representing the Atlantic Ocean, and yellow representing the Gulf of Mexico. This logo is also still used at the convenience stores that were sold to EG Group in 2018.

===Kroger Personal Finance===
Kroger Personal Finance was introduced in 2007 to offer branded Visa cards, mortgages, home equity loans, pet, renter&#x27;s and home insurance, identity theft protection, and wireless services. In 2017, MasterCard became the network for Kroger&#x27;s newly branded 1-2-3 REWARDS credit card issued by U.S. Bank. In 2019, Kroger banned the use of Visa credit cards (but not debit cards) at two of its subsidiary chains: Foods Co. Supermarkets and Smiths, citing rising costs from premium cards.

=== Kroger Wireless ===

Kroger Wireless, formerly known as i-wireless, is a national private label wireless service provider sold in over 2,200 retail locations within the Kroger family of stores across 31 states. Kroger Wireless service functions over the nationwide T-Mobile network. Customers can choose from &quot;Unlimited&quot; rate plans including unlimited talk/text and with data allotments up to and including unlimited data. Kroger Wireless allows customers to purchase phones at select Kroger store locations, via their website, or by bringing their eligible T-Mobile device for activation.

=== 84.51° ===
84.51° is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kroger engaged in data science and consumer insights, created in April 2015, as a result of Kroger purchasing the remaining half of its then-joint venture Dunnhumby USA from Tesco.

<text>John Eric Ensign (born March 25, 1958) is an American veterinarian and former politician who served as a United States Senator from Nevada from 2001 until his resignation in 2011 amid a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his attempts to hide an extramarital affair. A member of the Republican Party, Ensign previously represented Nevada&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. Following his resignation from the Senate, Ensign returned to Nevada and resumed his career as a veterinarian.

== Early life, education, and veterinary career ==
Ensign was born in 1958 in Roseville, California, to Sharon Lee Cipriani (whose father was Italian) and a father whose surname was Mueller. Ensign&#x27;s parents, married too young, separated when Ensign was four years of age; Ensign then moved with Cipriani to Nevada. Cipriani later married Michael S. Ensign, a gaming industry executive; he formally adopted young John, who considers him his &quot;real father.&quot; The senior Ensign later became chairman of the board of directors of Mandalay Resort Group.

John Ensign attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, becoming a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1981. He received his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Colorado State University in 1985 and entered veterinary practice soon after. Ensign became a successful businessman, opening a 24-hour animal hospital in Las Vegas. He owned two animal hospitals before entering politics.

In political campaigns, Ensign frequently referred to his ancestry, noting that he is one-eighth (1/8) Filipino. As of 2008, Ensign had never met his Philippine-born paternal grandfather, who is of Filipino-German ancestry. Ensign did not learn of this grandfather&#x27;s ancestry until about 1994. The Senator was conferred the Order of the Knights of Rizal with the rank of Knight Grand Cross of Rizal by Filipino dignitaries in 1997.

After resigning from the U.S. Senate in 2011, Ensign returned to Las Vegas with his family. Ensign then renewed his practice as a veterinarian and opened Boca Park Animal Hospital.

== Political career ==
=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1994, Ensign won the Republican nomination for Nevada&#x27;s 1st congressional district, based in Las Vegas. He trailed four-term incumbent Democrat James Bilbray by a wide margin for most of the campaign. However, Ensign gained considerable momentum after reports surfaced that a Bilbray aide stood to make a huge profit from lands legislation sponsored by Bilbray. Ensign won the election by 1,400 votes and was reelected in 1996 by seven points, although Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton carried the district by a large margin that year.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1998, Ensign ran for the Senate but was defeated by the Democratic incumbent, future Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, by 401 votes.

Ensign won a Senate seat on his second try in 2000, defeating Democratic opponent Ed Bernstein by a 55%–40% margin, to succeed the retiring Democratic incumbent, Richard H. Bryan. Ensign was reelected in 2006; he defeated businessman Jack Carter.

Ensign and Reid developed a fairly good relationship, despite their bruising 1998 contest. They frequently worked together on Nevada issues.

In April 2009, Ensign was planning a June 1 trip to Iowa, the first in his career, causing speculation that he was mulling a presidential campaign in 2012. Given the disclosure of his extramarital affair and cover-up in mid-June of that year, his presidential aspirations were put in limbo. Ensign resigned his position as chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee on June 17, 2009, in the wake of a Senate Ethics Committee investigation. On July 14, 2009, Ensign announced his plan to run for re-election to his Nevada Senate seat in 2012, even though his polling numbers had recently decreased.

For Sharron Angle&#x27;s debate with Harry Reid on October 14, 2010, Ensign played Reid during one day of her debate preparation at the Trump Plaza in Las Vegas. The &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; speculated in November 2010 that this might hurt his relationship with Reid, who could &quot;man up&quot; and oppose Ensign&#x27;s re-election. The &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; noted in November 2010 that Ensign had multiple &quot;hurdles&quot; to re-election.

==== Chairmanship of National Republican Senatorial Committee ====
Ensign was elected Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). As chairman of the NRSC, Ensign was charged with assembling a staff to win back the U.S. Senate for Republicans in the 2008 elections. Ensign chose Mike Slanker and Lindsey Slanker of Nevada-based political consulting firm November Inc. to be the Political Director and Finance Director of the NRSC. In the 2008 elections, Democrats gained 8 seats, and after the party switch of Arlen Specter in 2009, the Democrats gained a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.

==== Electronic fund-raising reports ====
In September 2007, it was discovered that Ensign had used the secret hold rule to prevent a bill requiring senators to file fund-raising reports electronically from being voted on. He required that they first vote on his amendment to strengthen disclosure rules. (The &quot;secret hold&quot; is a parliamentary procedure within the Standing Rules of the Senate that allows one or more Senators to prevent a motion from reaching a vote on the Senate floor.) Ensign insisted that, before a vote on the disclosure bill could be held, the committee would first vote on an amendment that &quot;would force groups petitioning the Senate Ethics Committee to disclose the identity of donors giving more than $5,000&quot;, which watchdog groups charged was intended to prevent passage of the bill.

==== 2006 re-election campaign ====

Ensign faced Democrat Jack Carter, son of former President Jimmy Carter, in the November general election. Both he and Carter defeated token opposition in their August 15, 2006 primaries. Ensign defeated Carter in the general election on November 7, 2006, 55.36% to 40.99%.

==== Resignation ====
On March 7, 2011, in the midst of a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, Ensign said he would not seek re-election in 2012 because he wanted to spare his family from an &quot;exceptionally ugly&quot; campaign. &quot;At this point in my life, I have to put my family first,&quot; Ensign told reporters at a news conference in Las Vegas. The announcement was welcomed by national Republicans, who suggested he would not have survived a primary election. The Senate Ethics Committee conducted a 22-month investigation of Ensign&#x27;s activities. Before they released their report, on April 21, 2011, Ensign announced his resignation from office effective May 3. He said that he &quot;will not continue to subject my family, my constituents, or the Senate to any further rounds of investigation, depositions, drawn out proceedings, or especially public hearings.&quot; The Committee gave its report to the Department of Justice for investigation of alleged serious violations of law.

Ensign became the first United States Senator from Nevada to resign, besides Alan Bible, who resigned seventeen days before the end of his term to give his successor an advantage in seniority.

==== Senate committee assignments ====
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
** Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security
** Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security
* Committee on Finance
** Subcommittee on Health Care
** Subcommittee on Taxation, IRS Oversight, and Long-Term Growth
** Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs

=== Political positions ===
==== Abortion ====
The National Right to Life Committee and NARAL Pro-Choice America certify his anti-abortion voting record. Ensign authored the Child Custody Protection Act in 2003, which prohibits taking minors across State lines to circumvent laws in certain jurisdictions that require parents to be involved in abortion decisions by minors.

==== Animal advocacy ====
Ensign was considered one of the Humane Society&#x27;s biggest allies in Congress. Along with Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Arlen Specter (D-PA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Senator Ensign—a veterinarian—was a lead sponsor of the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, which transformed into a felony the transport of animals across state lines for the purpose of fighting. According to a press release from Ensign&#x27;s office, &quot;Fifty states currently have laws against dog fighting and forty-nine have laws against cockfighting. This bill complements these state laws.&quot;

==== Cuba ====
Senator Ensign was a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus.

==== &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy ====
On December 18, 2010, Ensign voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 to allow gay and lesbian people to serve openly in the armed forces.

==== Eminent domain ====
Ensign had been a leading voice against the &quot;Kelo v. New London&quot; Supreme Court ruling, and introduced a bill that would blunt the effects of the ruling. In &quot;Kelo&quot;, the Court ruled that local governments could use eminent domain not just for public use but for any project that involves a public purpose. Specifically, the Court permitted the City of New London, Connecticut, to force a homeowner to sell her home for new development. The decision that eminent domain could be used to issue a condemnation order on a property for a private purpose caused a backlash.

==== Fiscal issues ====
The conservative fiscal watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste awarded Ensign a 92% lifetime rating—the fourth highest Senator after Jim DeMint, Tom Coburn and Jon Kyl—as of 2007.

In 2005, Ensign introduced legislation to the Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. The commission would compile a list of what its members consider unnecessary, outdated, wasteful, or duplicative discretionary programs, and require Congress to vote up-or-down to eliminate all programs on the list. The proposal was similar to the process Congress uses for Base Realignment and Closure to assess military bases. It was not passed.

==== Health care reform ====
Ensign opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

==== Marriage ====
In 1998, after President Bill Clinton admitted to having committed adultery with Monica Lewinsky, Ensign called on him to resign. Ensign said, &quot;He has no credibility left.&quot;

In 2004, Ensign spoke on the Senate floor in favor of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have barred states from recognizing same-sex marriage. Ensign said:

Marriage is the cornerstone on which our society was founded. For those who say that the Constitution is so sacred that we cannot or should not adopt the Federal Marriage Amendment, I would simply point out that marriage, and the sanctity of that institution, predates the American Constitution and the founding of our nation.

==== Prison reform ====
In 2011, Ensign introduced legislation that would have required all low-security prisoners to work 50 hours per week.

==== Veterans ====
In April 2008 Ensign voted against a measure to expand federal benefits to Filipino veterans in the Philippines, then a U.S. Commonwealth, against Japan during World War II. He said he thought benefits should be used for veterans in the United States. The measure passed Congress.

==== Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ====
Ensign voted in support of authorizing the President to use the United States Armed Forces to &quot;deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States.&quot; This is the authorizing legislation for the invasion of Afghanistan and removing the Taliban from power.

Ensign also voted in support of the President to use the United States Armed Forces &quot;as he determines to be necessary and appropriate&quot; in order to &quot;defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.&quot; Ensign supported the counterinsurgency policy in Iraq in 2007 and opposed withdrawing troops from Iraq in 2007 and 2008.

== Personal life ==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, during college at Colorado State, Ensign became a born-again Christian. He and his now ex-wife, Darlene, were active in the Promise Keepers, an evangelical group. He and his ex-wife have three children. In 2019, the couple were reported to have divorced after 31 years of marriage. 

Ensign is a member of the Pentecostal International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. During his Senate tenure, he was the only Pentecostal in the Senate. While working in Washington, DC, he resided at the C Street Center, a religious house in the capital. Ensign moved out of the C Street house in November 2009, after disclosure of an extramarital affair and reports that he influenced others to keep quiet about it.

When in Las Vegas he attends a northwest Foursquare church. He is a member of the religious and political organization The Fellowship, described by evangelical Christians as one of the most politically well-connected fundamentalist organizations in the United States.

=== Affair and corruption scandal ===

Between 2007 and 2008, Senator Ensign had an affair with Cynthia Hampton, who worked for a PAC supporting his campaigns. Her husband, Doug Hampton, was a close friend of Ensign and worked as a top administrative staffer in his Washington, DC office. Sen. Tom Coburn, with Timothy and David Coe, leaders of The Fellowship, attempted to intervene to end Ensign&#x27;s affair in February 2008 by convincing Ensign to write a letter to Hampton&#x27;s wife breaking off the affair. Ensign was chaperoned by Coburn and other members from C Street, where Ensign lived with Coburn, to a FedEx office to post the letter. Ensign called Hampton&#x27;s wife hours later to tell her to ignore the letter and flew out to spend the weekend with her in Nevada.

The disclosure of the affair—together with Ensign&#x27;s efforts to keep it quiet, including finding work for Doug Hampton as a lobbyist—resulted in investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Election Commission, and the Senate. The alleged misconduct included a $96,000 payment from Ensign&#x27;s parents, which Doug Hampton claimed was an unreported severance payment; Hampton obtaining a job as a lobbyist at Ensign&#x27;s behest; Ensign helping Hampton in his role as a lobbyist in violation of a one-year lobbying ban on ex-Senate staffers; and Hampton&#x27;s additional charge that Ensign sexually harassed his wife.

On March 7, 2011, Ensign announced that he would not seek re-election to the Senate the following year because he wished to shield his family from the consequences of his past behavior. In late April 2011, Ensign announced that he would resign his position as Senator on May 3. In May 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee referred its report to the Department of Justice for investigation of possible violations of law. The Department of Justice found evidence of potential criminality but decided against prosecuting Ensign.

In 2019, John Ensign and his wife were reported to have divorced after 31 years of marriage. 

== Electoral history ==


*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, Independent American candidate Ernie Berghof received 2,540 votes; Citizens First candidate Bill Grutzmacher received 1,579 votes; No Vote Cast received 457 votes; and Over Vote received 69 votes.

** Nevada law since 1975 allows dissatisfied voters to vote for &quot;None of These Candidates.&quot;

<text>Harry Mason Reid Jr. (; December 2, 1939 – December 28, 2021) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from Nevada from 1987 to 2017. He led the Senate Democratic Caucus from 2005 to 2017 and was the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015.

After earning an undergraduate degree from Utah State University and a Juris Doctor degree from George Washington University, Reid began his public career as the city attorney for Henderson, Nevada, before being elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1968. Gubernatorial candidate Mike O&#x27;Callaghan, Reid&#x27;s former boxing coach, chose Reid as his running mate in 1970; following their victory Reid served as the 25th lieutenant governor of Nevada from 1971 to 1975. After being defeated in races for the United States Senate and mayor of Las Vegas, Reid served as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. From 1983 to 1987, Reid represented Nevada&#x27;s 1st district in the United States House of Representatives.

Reid was elected to the United States Senate in 1986 and served in the Senate from 1987 to 2017. He served as the Senate Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005 before succeeding Tom Daschle as Senate Minority Leader. The Democrats won control of the Senate after the 2006 United States Senate elections, and Reid became the Senate Majority Leader in 2007. He held that position for the final two years of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency and for the first six years of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency. As majority leader, Reid helped pass major legislation of the Obama administration, such as the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Act, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In 2013, under Reid&#x27;s leadership, the Senate Democratic majority controversially invoked the &quot;nuclear option&quot; to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for presidential nominations, other than nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court. Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 United States Senate elections, and Reid served as Senate Minority Leader from 2015 until his retirement in 2017. Reid is Nevada&#x27;s longest-serving senator, surpassing John P. Jones&#x27;s record by two days.

Reid was succeeded as the Senate Democratic leader by Chuck Schumer, whose leadership bid had been endorsed by Reid. Along with Alben W. Barkley and Mike Mansfield, Reid was one of only three senators to have served at least eight years as majority leader. Harry Reid International Airport, which serves the Las Vegas Valley, was named after Reid on December 14, 2021, two weeks before his death from cancer. The airport was previously named after Pat McCarran, one of Reid&#x27;s Senate predecessors.

==Early life and early career==
Harry Mason Reid Jr. was born on December 2, 1939, in Searchlight, Nevada, the third of four sons of Harry Reid, a rock miner, and Inez Orena (Jaynes) Reid, a laundress for local brothels. At that time, Searchlight was a small, impoverished town. His father died of suicide in 1972, at the age of 58, when Harry was 32 years old. His paternal grandmother was an English immigrant from Darlaston, Staffordshire. Reid&#x27;s boyhood home was a shack with no indoor toilet, hot water or telephone.

Since Searchlight had no high school, Reid boarded with relatives away, in Henderson, so that he could attend Basic High School, where he played football and was an amateur boxer. While at Basic High, he met future Nevada governor Mike O&#x27;Callaghan, who was a teacher there and served as Reid&#x27;s boxing coach. Reid attended Southern Utah University and graduated from Utah State University in 1961, where he double-majored in political science and history. He also minored in economics at Utah State&#x27;s School of Commerce and Business Administration. He then attended George Washington University Law School while working as a police officer for the United States Capitol Police, and he earned his Juris Doctor in 1964.

==Early political career==
===State politics===
Reid returned to Nevada after law school and served as Henderson city attorney before being elected to the Nevada Assembly for the multi-member fourth district of Clark County in 1968. In 1970, at age 30, Reid was chosen by O&#x27;Callaghan as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. Reid and O&#x27;Callaghan won their respective races, and Reid served as lieutenant governor from 1971 until 1974, when he ran for the U.S. Senate seat that was being vacated by Alan Bible. He lost by fewer than 700 votes to former governor Paul Laxalt. In 1975, Reid ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost to Bill Briare.

Reid served as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. When Jack Gordon offered Reid a $12,000 bribe to get approval of new games for casinos, Reid brought in the FBI to tape Gordon&#x27;s bribery attempt and arrest him. After FBI agents interrupted the transaction, as prearranged, Reid lost his temper and attempted to choke Gordon, saying &quot;You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!&quot; before agents stopped him. Gordon was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to six months in prison. Reid presided over the 1979 hearing that refused to issue a gaming license to casino operator Frank Rosenthal because of his ties to organized crime groups such as the Chicago Outfit and particularly his close personal association with mobster Anthony Spilotro. Reid later stated that &quot;Rosenthal was the only person that I was ever afraid of.&quot; Rosenthal loudly and publicly confronted Reid after the hearing, telling gathered reporters that he had performed many personal favors for Reid. Reid conceded under heated interrogation from Rosenthal that the two men had met for lunch at his Stardust Resort and Casino and that he had asked Rosenthal to cover up undesirable news stories. FBI wiretaps captured mobsters claiming that Reid was under their control, causing governor Robert List to feel pressure to ask Reid to resign. However, List believed Reid&#x27;s assertions that the accusations were baseless. In 1981, Reid&#x27;s wife found a bomb attached to the family station wagon; Reid suspected it was placed by Rosenthal or Gordon, although this has never been proven in court.

===Member of the U.S. House of Representatives===
Before the 1980 Census, Nevada had only a single at-large member of the United States House of Representatives, but population growth in the 1970s resulted in the state picking up a second district. Reid won the Democratic nomination for the 1st district, based in Las Vegas, in 1982, and easily won the general election. He was re-elected in 1984.

Reid was instrumental in the establishment of Great Basin National Park, sponsoring the bill creating it in 1986 and ensuring the protection of Wheeler Peak and groves of bristlecone pine.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

In 1986, Reid won the Democratic nomination for the seat of retiring two-term incumbent Republican Senator Paul Laxalt. Reid defeated former at-large U.S. Representative Jim Santini, a Democrat who had turned Republican, in the November election. Reid ran for reelection in 1992 which he won by a double-digit margin. In 1998 he narrowly defeated U.S. Representative John Ensign in the midst of a statewide Republican sweep. In 2004, Reid won reelection with 61 percent of the vote, defeating Richard Ziser.

Ensign was elected to Nevada&#x27;s other Senate seat in 2000. Ensign and Reid had a very good relationship despite their bitter contest in 1998. The two frequently worked together on Nevada issues until Ensign resigned his Senate seat in 2011 due to an ethics scandal.

In 2010, Reid won the Democratic nomination with 75% of the vote in the June 8 primary. He then faced a very competitive race for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in the 2010 general election. Reid engaged in a $1 million media campaign to &quot;reintroduce himself&quot; to the state&#x27;s voters. He defeated Republican challenger Sharron Angle in the November election, 50.3% to 44.6%.

In January 2015, Reid suffered severe injuries in an exercise accident. On March 27, 2015, Reid uploaded a video to his YouTube account announcing that he would not seek reelection in November 2016. Reid endorsed Senator Chuck Schumer from New York to succeed him as Minority Leader. Former Nevada Attorney General and fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto was elected to succeed Reid as a U.S. senator from Nevada.

On January 1, 2017, two days before the end of his term, Reid surpassed Senator John P. Jones to become the longest-serving U.S. Senator from Nevada.

===Leadership===
From 1999 to 2005, Reid served as Senate Democratic Whip, as minority whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005. Reid was majority whip from 2001 to 2003, except for a brief period from January to June 2001. He was the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in from January to June 2001 (succeeding Max Baucus) before relinquishing the position to allow Jim Jeffords to switch parties and become chair, having given Democrats the majority. From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Reid succeeded Tom Daschle as Minority Leader in 2005; he became Majority Leader after the 2006 election until 2015. He was again Minority Leader until his retirement in 2017 and was succeeded by Chuck Schumer.

Liberal critics argued that Reid allowed Senate Republicans to create a 60-vote bar for passage of bills without a Democratic filibuster. Conservatives criticized Reid for his extensive use of the procedural tactic known as &quot;Filling the tree&quot; to prevent amendments on important bills.

====UFOs====
In 2007, while he was the Senate Majority Leader, Reid initiated the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program to study unidentified flying objects at the urging of Reid&#x27;s friend, Nevada billionaire and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow, and with support from the late senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii). The program began in the DIA in 2007 and was budgeted $22 million over its five years of operation.

The United States Air Force facility Homey Airport, commonly known as Area 51, is located on Groom Lake in Reid&#x27;s home state of Nevada, and has been rumored to house materials allegedly retrieved from the 1947 Roswell UFO incident.

When interviewed in the aftermath of publicity surrounding the AATIP, Reid expressed pride in his accomplishment, and was quoted as saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I&#x27;ve done something that no one has done before.&quot; Reid explained the reasoning behind his sponsorship of the program by saying &quot;I&#x27;m interested in science, and in helping the American public understand what the hell is going on&quot; and stated that &quot;hundreds and hundreds of papers&quot; have been available since the program was completed and that &quot;Most all of it, 80 percent at least, is public&quot; adding &quot;I wanted it public, it was made public, and you guys have not even looked at it.&quot;

A 2009 letter by Reid was published by KLAS-TV investigative journalists George Knapp and Matt Adams, where the Senator states that AATIP has made &quot;much progress&quot; with the &quot;identification of several highly sensitive, unconventional aerospace-related findings&quot; that will &quot;likely lead to technology advancements&quot; and recommends the creation of a special access program for specific parts of AATIP.

====Nuclear option====
On November 21, 2013, under Reid&#x27;s tenure as Majority Leader, the Democratic majority Senate voted 52–48 to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster against all executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the U.S. Supreme Court. A 3/5 supermajority was still required to end filibusters unrelated to those nominees, such as for legislation and Supreme Court nominees. The Democrats&#x27; stated motivation for the &quot;nuclear option&quot; was expansion of filibustering by Republicans during the Obama administration, in particular blocking three nominations to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Reid&#x27;s invocation of the nuclear option on judicial nominations was controversial as, on April 6, 2017, Senate Republicans similarly invoked the nuclear option to remove the Supreme Court exception created in 2013, allowing the Trump administration to appoint Justices on party lines. This was after Senate Democrats filibustered the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States and after the Senate Republicans had previously refused to take up Merrick Garland&#x27;s nomination by President Obama in 2016.

===Ethics controversies===
Reid was criticized during his tenure for several potentially self-enriching tactics. In 2005, Reid earmarked a spending bill to provide for building a bridge between Nevada and Arizona that would make land he owned more valuable. Reid called funding for the construction of a bridge over the Colorado River, among other projects, &quot;incredibly good news for Nevada&quot; in a news release after the passage of the 2006 transportation bill. He owned of land several miles from the proposed bridge site in Arizona. The bridge could add value to his real estate investment. A year later it was reported that Reid had used campaign donations to pay for $3,300 in Christmas gifts to the staff at the condominium where he resided; federal election law prohibits candidates from using political donations for personal use. Reid&#x27;s staff stated that his campaign attorneys had approved this use of the funds, but that Reid would personally reimburse his campaign for the expenses. Citizens United filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission to investigate the matter.

A series of investigative reports in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; suggested that Reid had introduced legislation and imposed pressure on regulatory agencies to advance the business interests of his close friend Harvey Whittemore, a Nevada attorney-lobbyist who contributed heavily to Reid&#x27;s campaigns and leadership fund and who employed Reid&#x27;s son Leif as his personal attorney. With Reid&#x27;s help, Whittemore was able to proceed with construction of a $30 billion planned golf course development, Coyote Springs, a project heavily criticized by environmental groups for reasons including its projected effects on several endangered species. Whittemore served a two-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2013 of funneling $133,400 in illegal contributions to Reid&#x27;s reelection campaign.

===Committee assignments===
* Select Committee on Intelligence (&quot;Ex officio&quot;) 
* Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies from 2001 to 2003 he served as the chair of the Senate ethics committee.

==Political positions==

Reid scored a lifetime conservative rating of 19% from the American Conservative Union (ACU), and a 2008 liberal rating of 70% from the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). Other independent ratings include a 29% rating in 2003 from NARAL, the abortion rights lobbyists, an 85% rating from Planned Parenthood in 2013, and a &quot;B&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.
Reid spearheaded several initiatives while in Congress. In 2006, Reid co-sponsored the Prevention First Amendment with Hillary Clinton, which would fund abortion prevention efforts such as giving women broader access to contraception. The bill faced Republican opposition and failed. In January 2007, Reid brought a Senate ethics reform bill to a vote to bar congressional members from accepting gifts, meals, and trips from lobbyists and organizations employing lobbyists, to bar Senators from borrowing corporate jets for travel, and to compel Senators to disclose names of sponsors, or authors, of bills and projects. The bill passed 96–2. In the 111th Congress, Reid shepherded the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) through the Senate.

Reid was initially a centrist Democrat, and he held anti-abortion views and supported gun rights and opposed illegal immigration. He was considered fiscally liberal and socially conservative. He believed that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; should be overturned, and in 1999, voted against an amendment that supported &quot;Roe&quot;. In 1998, he stated that he believed in a restricted right to abortion, stating that &quot;abortions should be legal only when the pregnancy resulted from incest, rape, or when the life of the woman is endangered&quot;. He voted several times to ban the intact dilation and evacuation, or &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; procedure. Reid supported embryonic stem cell research. Over the time, Reid shifted his support towards more progressive views.

Regarding same-sex marriage, Reid initially believed that &quot;marriage should be between a man and a woman&quot;, but abandoned that position in favor of same-sex marriage in 2012.

In regard to local issues, Reid firmly opposed construction of the proposed Yucca Mountain federal nuclear waste repository in Nevada. Reid initially opposed the legalization of online poker, but in 2010 it was reported his position had evolved – a move some argued was influenced by &quot;the hundreds of thousands of dollars Las Vegas casinos contributed to his re-election campaign&quot;.

Reid called immigration reform one of his priorities at the 110th Congress. He supported the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act), which would give certain high school graduates who had arrived in the U.S. illegally, conditional legal status so they could attend college or enlist in the military. They could then obtain permanent legal residency after completing two years of military service or two years of college.

Reid supported use of force in the Middle East, but in September 2007, called for a drastic change in strategy. In January 1991, Reid voted to authorize the first Gulf War, quoting John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 State of the Union speech on the Senate floor, saying &quot;the mere absence of war is not peace.&quot; He also voted in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In March 2007, he voted in favor of &quot;redeploying U.S. troops out of Iraq by March 2008&quot;, and later that year, said, &quot;As long as we follow [President Bush&#x27;s] path in Iraq, the war is lost.&quot;

Reid was a strong advocate of recognizing the Armenian genocide.

Reid was a staunch defender of Obamacare both online and in speeches. He advocated outlawing prostitution in Nevada.

On May 15, 2013, Reid revealed to reporters that his niece is a lesbian as he spoke about his hope that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act would be signed into law.

=== Conservation legacy ===

Reid supported land conservation in Nevada. He successfully secured the designation of about of U.S. federal land in Nevada as protected land, shielding them from development. Among these were the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, the Basin and Range National Monument, and the Gold Butte National Monument.

Reid was also the champion of the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, 1998 legislation that has redirected more than $4 billion in proceeds from the sale of public lands in Nevada to conservation initiatives, environmentally sensitive land acquisitions, new parks and trails, and capital projects for federal land management agencies.

Reid was criticized as one of the main culprits for the failure of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, as the Democrats&#x27; majority in Congress during that time had not been used to enact climate-protection legislation prior to the conference.

In 2015, Reid received a lifetime achievement award from the League of Conservation Voters, and the following year he was honored by the Conservation Lands Foundation for &quot;historic contributions to conservation.&quot;

===Criticism of Mitt Romney===
During the summer of 2012, Reid said in an interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that he had received information from an unidentified investor in Bain Capital that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney did not pay any taxes for 10 years. He repeated the accusation on the Senate floor on August 2, 2012. According to CBS News, Romney stated, &quot;Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year – and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong.&quot; PolitiFact.com&#x27;s Truth-O-Meter rated the accusation as &quot;Pants on Fire!&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Fact Checker gave it &quot;Four Pinnocchios&quot;. CBS reported that Romney had submitted 23 years of tax returns to the John McCain campaign in 2008, when he was being vetted for the vice-presidential nomination. McCain said, &quot;[n]othing in these tax returns showed that he did not pay taxes.&quot; In a 2015 interview on the subject, Reid said &quot;Romney didn&#x27;t win, did he?&quot; The following year, Reid called the attack &quot;one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done,&quot; while reiterating that Romney had not released his tax returns. In 2021, Reid stated in an interview that after the 2012 election he and Mitt Romney and their wives met privately and reconciled, with Reid concluding that &quot;I admire Mitt Romney. I think he&#x27;s a very very fine human being.&quot;

==Cultural and political image==

Part of Reid&#x27;s confrontation with Frank Rosenthal while chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission is reenacted in the 1995 movie &quot;Casino&quot;. Reid had a role in the movie &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), in which he played himself. He appeared, with Senators Sam Brownback and Barack Obama, in the 2007 documentary film &quot;Sand and Sorrow&quot;, which details the genocide in Sudan.

Reid was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2013, adviser Jim Margolis said of Reid, &quot;He is unique in this city. And you see it in so many different ways. Is he the best TV talking head? No. He&#x27;d be the first to tell you that. Should he smile more? Yes. Should he say goodbye on the phone when he&#x27;s done talking to you? Probably. But those are things you&#x27;d assume are part and parcel of a polished figure in Washington. That is not Harry Reid.&quot;

Reid was known for his skills in political organizing and getting out the vote, and his voter coalition known as the &quot;Reid Machine&quot; was credited with being the driving force behind several statewide Democratic wins, including Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election in Nevada and Catherine Cortez Masto&#x27;s election to succeed Reid in the concurrent Senate election. A veteran of the Reid political machine, Megan K. Jones, has gone on to be a senior advisor to vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

Harry Reid (formerly McCarran) International Airport, which serves the Las Vegas Valley, was named after Senator Reid on December 14, 2021, just two weeks prior to his death.

== Personal life ==
Reid met his wife, Landra Gould, in high school. Gould was from a Jewish family and her parents objected to the relationship because Reid was not Jewish. The two eloped in 1959 when they were in college. The Reids had five children; a daughter and four sons. Their eldest son, Rory, was an elected commissioner for Clark County, Nevada, of which he became chairman, and 2010 Democratic nominee in the election for Governor of Nevada. Another son, Josh Reid, unsuccessfully sought municipal office in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. In 2014 financial disclosure reports, Reid reported a net worth of between $2.9 million and $9.3 million. Most of Reid&#x27;s net worth was in municipal securities and in land and mineral rights in southern Nevada and Arizona; a blind trust managed the liquid assets of Reid and his wife.

Reid lived in the Anthem area of Henderson, Nevada. Reid (who was raised agnostic) and his wife (who was born to Jewish immigrant parents and grew up in Henderson) converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints while he was a college student. In a 2001 interview he said, &quot;I think it is much easier to be a good member of the Church and a Democrat than a good member of the Church and a Republican.&quot; He went on to say that the Democrats&#x27; emphasis on helping others, as opposed to what he considered Republican dogma to the contrary, is the reason he was a Democrat. He delivered a speech at Brigham Young University to about 4,000 students on October 9, 2007, in which he expressed his opinion that Democratic values mirror Mormon values. Several Republican Mormons in Utah contested his faith because of his politics, such as his statements that the church&#x27;s backing of California&#x27;s Proposition 8 wasted resources.

Reid was the co-chairman of the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. In April 2015, Reid confirmed former U.S. Senator Larry Pressler as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Health and death==
=== Injury ===
On January 1, 2015, Reid was injured while exercising in his home—he said a piece of equipment he was using broke (later &quot;slipped&quot;), causing him to fall. As a result, he suffered broken ribs and broken facial bones, and was at risk of permanent vision loss in his right eye. On January 26, 2015, he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from his right eye and repair facial bones. He later sued a company he claimed manufactured the device, alleging the device was defective. In 2019, a jury rejected his claim for lack of evidence.

=== Pancreatic cancer ===
On May 14, 2018, Reid had surgery for pancreatic cancer at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center after a tumor was found on his pancreas during a routine screening. In a January 2019 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was revealed that he was confined to a desk at his home and was unable to move without the aid of a walker. Upon his diagnosis, he said: &quot;As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you&#x27;re dead.&quot; On February 25, 2019, he announced that due to early detection and chemotherapy, his cancer was in remission.

=== Death ===
Reid died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Henderson on December 28, 2021, at the age of 82. Following the news of his death, President Joe Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gave tributes to Reid. Several of his former Senate colleagues also gave tributes, including Chuck Schumer, Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley and Mike Lee as well as Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. He lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on January 12.

Funeral

Reid&#x27;s funeral was broadcast live on CNN and MSNBC with tributes by President Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and performances by Brandon Flowers and Carole King. He was interred in his family plot in Searchlight.

<text>Alsager ( ) is a town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. It is located to the north-west of Stoke-on-Trent and east of Crewe. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 13,389 and the built up area population was 15,505.

The civil parish is bordered by the parishes of Betchton to the north, Church Lawton to the north-east and east, Kidsgrove to the south-east, Audley Rural to the south, Barthomley to the south-west, Haslington to the west, and Hassall to the north-west.

Alsager has hosted an annual summer carnival since 1998; it was located in Milton Park until June 2009 and moved temporarily to the Alsager School playing fields to increase capacity, before returning in 2017. In 2008, Alsager was awarded Fairtrade Town status by the Fairtrade Foundation.

==History==

In the village of Church Lawton are the Church Lawton Barrows, which form part of a significant Bronze Age site near the town.

The town&#x27;s name means &#x27;the arable land of a person named Ælle (Old English: &quot;Ælles æċer&quot;).

Alsager was recorded as &#x27;Eleacier&#x27; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was a small farming village until the 19th century when, due to its rail connections and rural character, it became a home of choice for pottery works managers from the nearby Federation of Six Towns which later became the city of Stoke-on-Trent.

During the Second World War, a large armaments factory was built outside Alsager at Radway Green, and the town expanded dramatically to house the influx of factory workers. Also during the war a camp was constructed for the training of Royal Marines. This bore the name of HMS &quot;Excalibur&quot; and was situated at the top of Fields Road by the side of the Stoke to Crewe railway line. In 1948 it became a displaced persons camp for refugees from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the former Polish Ukraine, countries which had been forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. Many men from these countries had fought on the side of the Germans to try to regain independence, and they were afraid to return to their countries of origin, as many who had returned were executed by the Russians. A school was set up for the education of their children whose only common language when they arrived was German. The school continued to exist for many years in the same set of wooden huts under the name &quot;Excalibur School&quot;. The first Roman Catholic church in Alsager was one of the wooden huts and was attended mainly by the Lithuanians, most of whom were Roman Catholic. The Anglican churches are Christ Church (1789), and St Mary Magdalene (1898).

Alsager previously had three Methodist churches at Hassall Road (Wesleyan), Wesley Place (Wesleyan) and Crewe Road (Primitive Methodist). By December 2009 two Methodist churches remained, but today there is just one.

The Roman Catholic community is served from St Gabriel&#x27;s Church. The parish is located in the Diocese of Shrewsbury (Central Cheshire Region – Local Pastoral Area 9).&#x27;

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Alsager, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Alsager Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council meets at Alsager Civic on Lawton Road.

===Administrative history===
Alsager was historically a township within the ancient parish of Barthomley, which formed part of the Nantwich hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Barthomley, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Alsager became a civil parish. Alsager subsequently also became a separate ecclesiastical parish from Barthomley in 1898 following the completion of St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church. (The earlier Christ Church at Alsager had been a chapel of ease to St Bertoline&#x27;s at Barthomley.)

In 1894, Alsager was made a local government district. Later that year, local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Alsager Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A successor parish called Alsager was established covering area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Alsager Town Council. District-level functions passed to Congleton Borough Council. In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

==Culture==
The town is home to Alsager Community Theatre (ACT), an amateur drama group founded in 1973. ACT puts on its productions at Alsager Civic Centre and at nearby Little Moreton Hall.

Alsager Arts Centre, formerly housed on Manchester Metropolitan University&#x27;s Alsager campus, had a public programme of touring new performances and visual art work presented in two seasons (September–November and January–March). The centre moved to the university&#x27;s Crewe campus when the Alsager campus closed under the title of the Axis Arts Centre but it was closed in spring 2019 because of the planned withdrawal of the university from Crewe. The Arts Centre hosted performance companies such as Forced Entertainment and artists such as Bobby Baker.

Alsager hosts the annual Alsager Music Festival which takes place in Milton Gardens. In August 2010, Alsager hosted the first annual Alsager Arts Festival.

==Education==

===Schools===
Public education, at primary and secondary school level, is managed by Cheshire East Council and the Alsager Community Trust. The Alsager Community Trust is a co-operative trust, in which all the schools in the town are members. Secondary education is provided by Alsager School, an Academy school, that is situated opposite the former Manchester Metropolitan University campus. It is attended by over 1,300 pupils between the ages of 11 and 18. Alsager School is a Business and Enterprise College.

Six primary schools feed into Alsager School: Alsager Highfields, Cranberry Academy, Excalibur Primary School, Pikemere School, Rode Heath School and St Gabriel&#x27;s R.C. Primary School.

===Former Manchester Metropolitan University===

During the Second World War a hostel built of wooden army huts was constructed on the site of the MMU to house workers at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Radway Green, and was called &quot;Heathside&quot;. In 1945 it became &quot;Alsager Training College&quot; for the training of teachers which were in short supply at that time. The wooden huts were still in use for housing of students until the early 1960s.
The MMU Alsager was home to the Contemporary Arts and Sports Science Departments of the Manchester Metropolitan University. The University absorbed the former Crewe &amp; Alsager College of Higher Education, forming the Crewe and Alsager Faculty, subsequently renamed MMU Cheshire. The Alsager Arts Centre was also on campus, and promoted touring contemporary dance, music, theatre, live art, performance writing and visual art events to the public as well as members of the University community.

In 2006 the university started transferring staff and departments from Alsager to the Crewe campus, as part of plans for closure of the Alsager site. The Arts Centre also moved to the MMU campus in Crewe, and was renamed the Axis Arts Centre. As of 2012 the entire Alsager campus had long since closed and fallen into disrepair.

In 2015 the former campus on Hassall Road was earmarked for a total of 408 new houses. By early 2018 all of the campus buildings had been demolished and the site cleared. Soon afterwards, construction of a new housing estate named &quot;Scholar&#x27;s Place&quot; commenced on the site of the former Alsager campus.

==Transport==
Alsager is close to junction 16 of the M6 motorway.

The town is served by Alsager railway station, with East Midlands Railway services on the Crewe to Derby line and West Midlands Trains services from Crewe to Stafford; both operate hourly during weekday off-peak times. 

Local bus services are provided by First Potteries and D&amp;G Bus. Key routes include:
* 103 to Crewe and Hanley every 30 minutes. 
* 317 to Rode Heath, Sandbach and Leighton Hospital hourly
* 318 to Rode Heath and Congleton once every two hours.

The Trent and Mersey Canal runs just to the north-east to the town, forming part of the Cheshire Ring canal walk and the South Cheshire Way footpath. The canal&#x27;s towpath and the nearby &quot;Salt Line&quot; are also routes of the National Cycle Network.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, HitMix Radio, and Silk 106.9. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Alsager Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.

==Economy==
Alsager town centre is characterised by independent and charity shops. The only national chain supermarkets in the town are a medium-sized Asda supermarket and Sainsbury&#x27;s Local.

There is a BAE Systems Global Combat Systems factory in the nearby village of Radway Green, producing small arms ammunition for the British armed forces.

===Developments===

Between 2012 and 2021 Alsager town centre has been redeveloped somewhat:The Co-operative Food store was rebuilt and enlarged in 2012, but it was sold off and converted to an Asda supermarket in 2015. A Town Square has been created, Fairview park has been rebuilt and capacity at Fairview Car park has been increased. In April 2014 Cheshire East Council gave planning permission for the development of a new Sainsbury&#x27;s store on the former Twyfords site off Lawton Road. Sainsbury&#x27;s are currently reviewing their plans for a large store in the town due to changing patterns in the way people shop, which is currently away from large stores to online shopping and top up shopping at smaller stores. The company along with its rivals have scrapped many major new store schemes throughout the UK.

There were proposals to build 1267 new build houses, a new supermarket and petrol station in Alsager.

==Sport==

Alsager is home to Alsager Town F.C. The club competes in the North West Counties Football League and plays its home matches at Wood Park. AFC Alsager is a more recent addition to the town&#x27;s sporting teams. Established in 2012, the club has over 26 different teams, including a first team at Step 7 in the FA Pyramid System. The Alsager Football Group is a community sports group. Its purpose is to provide local residents with the opportunity to play casual football matches. Alsager is also home to Alsager Old Boys FC and Linley Tavern FC.

Alsager also has Alsager Cricket Club, the Alsager Golf and Country Club, the Alsager Institute Bowling Club, the Alsager Company of Archers, Triton Hockey Club, Alsager Lawn Tennis Club, The Wood Park Wulruds, a pool league and a swimming club.

There is a leisure centre in Alsager, managed by Cheshire East Council. On 25 October 2019, the new Alsager Sports Hub opened on the former MMU campus on Dunnocksfold Road. The hub contains a pavilion, five grass football pitches, a 3G football pitch and a 2G hockey pitch. It is home to Triton Hockey Club and AFC Alsager.

Alsager hosts the UK&#x27;s biggest 5-mile road race, each year in February. The event attracts many of the UK&#x27;s top endurance athletes.

==Parks==
Alsager has several parks. The town&#x27;s main park is Milton Garden, which has an ornamental sunken garden, a skatepark, a small children&#x27;s football pitch and a play area.

==Pastimes and leisure pursuits==

There is a strong tradition of allotment holding in the town, administered by the Alsager Gardens Association.

Alsager is home to Borrow Pit Meadows, a local beauty spot situated in the north of the town, which leads on to the Salt Line. 

The town has woodlands leading to Church Lawton.

<text>SMERSH () was an umbrella organization for three independent counter-intelligence agencies in the Red Army formed in late 1942 or even earlier, but officially announced only on 14 April 1943. The name SMERSH was coined by Joseph Stalin. The formal justification for its creation was to subvert the attempts by Nazi German forces to infiltrate the Red Army on the Eastern Front.

The official statute of SMERSH listed the following tasks to be performed by the organisation: counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism, preventing any other activity of foreign intelligence in the Red Army; fighting &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; in the Red Army; protection of the front lines against penetration by spies and &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;; investigating traitors, deserters, and self-inflicted wounds in the Red Army; and checking military and civil personnel returning from captivity.

The organisation was officially in existence until 4 May 1946, when its duties were transferred back to the MGB. The head of the agency throughout its existence was Viktor Abakumov, who rose to become Minister of State Security in the postwar years.

== Name ==
Joseph Stalin coined the name (SMERSH) as a portmanteau of the Russian-language phrase (, &quot;Death to spies&quot;). Originally focused on combating German spies infiltrating the Soviet military, the organization quickly expanded its mandate: to find and eliminate any subversive elements—hence Stalin&#x27;s inclusive name for it.

==History==
Until 3 February 1941, the 4th Department (Special Section, OO) of the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB)—the most important security body within the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD)—was responsible for the Soviet Armed Forces&#x27; military counter-intelligence. On that date, the Special Section&#x27;s 12 Sections and one Investigation Unit were separated from GUGB NKVD. The official liquidation of OO GUGB within NKVD was announced on 12 February by a joint order № 00151/003 of NKVD and NKGB USSR. The rest of GUGB was abolished and staff was moved to newly created People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security (NKGB). Departments of former GUGB were renamed Directorates. For example, former Foreign Department (INO) became Foreign Directorate (INU); political police represented by Secret Political Department (SPO) became Secret Political Directorate (SPU), and so on. The former GUGB 4th Department (OO) was split into three sections. One section, which handled military counter-intelligence in NKVD troops (former 11th Section of GUGB 4th Department OO) became 3rd NKVD Department or OKR (Otdel KontrRazvedki), the chief of OKR NKVD was Aleksander Belyanov, Commissar State Security 3rd rank. On 25 February 1941, Viktor Abakumov became NKVD deputy Commissar in charge of supervising this and several other departments.

The second and most significant part went to the Defense Commissariat Soviet Armed Forces (the NKO) becoming its 3rd Directorate or (3 Upravlenie). The 3rd NKO Directorate took over most of the 4th GUGB Department Sections and was headed by division commissar Anatolii Mikheev, the former and last OO GUGB NKVD chief. The third part of former OO (the 10 Section) became the Navy Commissariat (the Red Fleet) 3rd Directorate. The head of navy KI was Andrei Petrov, a state security captain.

===Operation Barbarossa===

After the 22 June 1941 German invasion of the USSR, Stalin on 17 July, as Chairman of State Defense Committee, signed special decree №187 / ss, by which military counterintelligence was returned to the NKVD as a Directorate of Special Departments or UOO, with Viktor Abakumov as chief. UOO on every level was given much more power and a freer hand in decision making than at any time since the creation of Cheka. Also on 19 July, by the order of NKVD №00940, the UOO was moved from Moscow to the city of Kuibyshev. Navy 3rd Directorate was still under Navy control, till 11 January 1942 when it was incorporated into Directorate of Special Departments.

On 2 July 1941, NKGB USSR was incorporated back into the NKVD structure. NKGB did not return as GUGB, but as separate units. The NKVD structure organisation from 31 July 1941 shows that there are independent Directorates as in the 1st: foreign intelligence, 2nd: domestic KI, and so on. There is no GUGB within NKVD after its official liquidation in the beginning of February 1941.

After the situation on the Russian fronts (known as Eastern front) became more stable, on 14 April 1943, the State Defense Committee (GKO), chaired by Stalin, ordered another split of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD USSR) into three organisations: 
By decision of the Politburo of the CPSU [then VKP(b)] nr. P 40/91People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security or (NKGB) was created for the second time. It was based on NKVD&#x27;s Directorates. The most important of them were: 1st INU (foreign intelligence), 2nd KRU (domestic counterespionage, fighting anti-Soviet organizations, protection of state economy, house searches, and arrests) NKVD 2nd Department (government and party officials protection) was transferred as NKGB 6th Directorate, NKVD Transportation Directorate was absorbed as NKGB 3rd Directorate and NKVD 4th Directorate was moved to NKGB with the same number. For detailed organization see NKGB. &quot;Regulations of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of State Security&quot; were approved by SNK in order № 621-191ss from 2 June 1943.
After losing most of the operational units to the NKGB, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) was still a very powerful government apparatus. It was responsible for public order in USSR by using heavily armed police in each corner of the country, running the largest penal labour camps under the Gulag Directorate, POWs camps and NKVD troops with loyal and well-equipped soldiers, that by the end of the war the numbers of NKVD troops were 1½ million strong with their own air force, armored and cavalry units.

Resolution No. 414-138 ss ordered the NKVD&#x27;s Directorate of Special Departments to be split into three separate military counterintelligence units, within the NKO, Navy Commissariat and NKVD, respectively, as has been done in early 1941. The same order that created GUKR SMERSH within the NKO created a parallel organisation within the Navy Commissariat, the NKVMF. This organization was known as the Navy &quot;UKR SMERSH&quot; and headed by Peter Gladkov and his two deputies Aleksei Lebedev and Sergei Dukhovich. In reality, Gladkov reported to Abakumov, by then deputy Commissar of the NKO, and Stalin&#x27;s deputy. Formally Gladkov was subordinate to his superior People&#x27;s Commissar Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, head of Navy.

OKR SMERSH (Counterintelligence Department) of the NKVD USSR was subordinate to Lavrentiy Beria, People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs. The NKVD OKR SMERSH was headed by Semion Yukhimovich and later V. Smirnov.

===Duties===

The GKO officially created SMERSH to ensure the Soviet Union&#x27;s security from internal political threats and foreign espionage, although it carried out a wide variety of other tasks between 1943 and 1946 as well. SMERSH&#x27;s counterintelligence operations included seeking and destroying counter revolutionaries, finding and interrogating enemy agents, hunting Soviet agents who had not returned by the appointed date, and evaluating the usefulness of captured enemy documents. SMERSH also took an active role in the affairs of the Red Army by ensuring the good quality of Red Army facilities, improving discipline, eliminating poor leaders, and preventing desertion, self-inflicted wounds, panic, sabotage and poor discipline. Other SMERSH activities included: exposing collaborators in areas recently captured by the Red Army; exposing and punishing economic crimes such as black market activity; protecting secret material and headquarters from enemy agents and saboteurs; and determining the &quot;patriotism&quot; of those captured, encircled, and those who had returned from foreign countries. SMERSH operatives also controlled partisan operations behind German lines and evaluated the partisans&#x27; loyalty to the Soviet Union. SMERSH would then arrest and neutralise anti-Soviet partisans, saboteurs, spies, conspirators, mutineers, deserters, and people designated as traitors and criminal elements at the combat front.
The strategic directorate focused on counter-espionage wet operations and counter-insurgency pacification operations that answered directly to Stalin. In March 1946, SMERSH Chief Directorate was resubordinated to the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Military Forces (Наркомат Вооруженных Сил, NKVS). The NKVS was later reorganized into the Ministry of Military Forces (МVS) soon thereafter, and SMERSH was officially discontinued 4 May 1946.

===Other activities===
SMERSH activities included &quot;filtering&quot; the soldiers and forced labourers recovered from captivity. SMERSH was actively involved in the capture of Soviet citizens who had been active in anti-communist armed groups fighting on the side of Nazi Germany such as the Russian Liberation Army, the Cossack Corps of Pyotr Krasnov, and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.

As the war concluded, SMERSH was given the assignment of finding Adolf Hitler and, if possible, capturing him alive or recovering his body. Red Army officers and SMERSH agents reportedly found Hitler&#x27;s partially burned corpse near the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; after his suicide and conducted an investigation to confirm his death and identify the remains that were secretly buried at SMERSH headquarters in Magdeburg until April 1970, when they were exhumed, completely cremated, and dumped.

SMERSH fought the Armia Krajowa and post-war organisations participating e.g. in the Augustów roundup.

==GUKR SMERSH HQ Organization==
A separate attachment to GKO decision No. 3222-ss/ov detailed the organisation of SMERSH and its branches in the Army:

*Defense Commissariat – headed by (at the time of taking post) Defence Commissar Marshal of the Soviet Union – Joseph Stalin
* Main Counterintelligence Directorate headed by (at the time of taking post) Commissar of State Security 2nd rank Viktor Abakumov. 
** first deputy: (at the time of taking post) Commissar of State Security 2nd rank – Nikolai Selivanovsky

*2nd Department – CI Operations within foreign POWs, and also &quot;filtering&quot; of Soviet armed forces officers and servicemen who had been POWs. Those investigations were result of Order No. 270 and Order No. 227. Also collection of intelligence information from areas immediately behind enemy lines headed by (at the time of taking post) State Security Colonel Sergei Kartashov Apr 29, 1943 – May 1946
* 3rd Department – was in charge both of identifying German agents working behind the Red Army front, and of radio games. In the field, officers or branches of the 3rd Dep. were assigned to all military units from the corps and higher. Also cooperation with 2nd dep&#x27;s of UKRs of fronts and the 4th Sections of OKRs of the armies, (at the time of taking post) State Security Colonel Georgii Utekhin Apr/Sep 1943 
*4th Department – Counterintelligence behind enemy lines. Taking measures like finding the channels of penetration of enemy agents into the units and institutions of the Red Army. Sending qualified counterintelligence operatives and turned German agents (double agents) to the occupied German territory to penetrate their intelligence organizations, and German administration. 4th GUKR Dep frequently cooperated with NKGB Directorates like 1st (foreign intelligence, headed by Pavel Fitin), 2nd (domestic counterintelligence ) run by Pyotr Fedotov and especially with 4th Directorate run by famous penetrator of Manhattan Project, Pavel Sudoplatov. Headed by (at the time of taking post) State Security Colonel Pyotr Timofeev Apr/Sep 1943

Investigators of 6th Dep worked very closely with 2nd GUKR Dep officers. In charge of (6th Dep) was (at the time of taking post) State Security Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Leonov. (Leonov and at the time his deputy Mikhail Likhachev, played important roles in interrogations of German POWs of highest level.) Likhachev headed SMERSH group at the Nuremberg Trials. Also cases prepared by the 6th Department were tried by the Military Collegium or the OSO of the NKVD USSR.
* 7th Department – in charge of statistics and archival data. Also responsible for surveillance of high level military personnel in the Central Committee and the Defense and the Navy Commissariats, as well as those involved in secret work who were sent abroad. Dep 7th was head by (at the time of taking post) State Security Colonel Aleksandr Sidorov

At the end of the Second World War, American forces examining captured German intelligence sources determined that SMERSH was composed of six directorates, six departments, and three other branches. Directorates conducted operations involving agents on the &quot;frontline&quot; of the intelligence war whereas departments received and interpreted the information coming in from agents and enemy intercepts. SMERSH also ran three other groups: the Komendatura, which guarded and managed SMERSH installations and prisoners; the Troika, which acted as a military court and could administer punishment without defense from the accused; and the Administrative Bureau and Secretariat, which acted as the personal staff of the SMERSH commander.

Below is the organization of SMERSH based on German Intelligence. The second chart shows another way SMERSH may have been organized.
== UKR SMERSH units at the front ==
GUKR SMERSH directed the work of field directorates, assigned to the fronts. These field organs were referred to as UKR SMERSH (Upravlenie Kontrrazvedki) or Counterintelligence Directorates. The naming distinguished them from the GUKR (HQ) SMERSH headquarters. The difference between GUKR and UKR or OKR was in the status hierarchy in the Red Army Military CI (the same structures were applied in February 1941 to NKO, NKMF and NKVD military counterintelligence units). They were ranked according to their authority. In the case of SMERSH the system of organization was: Main (or Chief) Directorate or &quot;GUKR SMERSH&quot;, Directorate of Counterintelligence or &quot;UKR SMERSH&quot;, and Department of Counterintelligence or &quot;OKR SMERSH&quot;.

GUKR in Moscow consisted of 11 operational and 3 non-operational departments, a total of 646 men. For comparison, GUKR SMERSH&#x27;s predecessor, UOO NKVD Directorate of Special Departments within the NKVD () consisted of 225 men in 1942. Not all departments corresponded to their UOO NKVD predecessors. With the new focus on the Germans and other enemies, two departments, the 3rd and 4th, transferred from the NKVD/NKGB.[p. 257]

The 3rd Department had the task of capturing German spies in the rear and organizing &quot;radio games&quot; with their help, and the 4th Department headed counter-intelligence measures behind the front line.
Five of the departments, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th. were involved directly in investigation.

The UKR SMERSH (Counterintelligence Directorate) of the front, directed the OKRs Counterintelligence Departments (Otdiel Kontrrazvedki) within the armies and units. There SMERSH officers were attached to each rifle corps. The OKR at the division level consisted of 21 men, including a head, his deputy, a ciphering officer, investigators, commandant, and a platoon of guards. The OKR of each army included 57 men, while the size of the front UKR depended on how many armies composed the front. If the front consisted of five armies, its UKR included 130 officers, if there were fewer armies, the UKR had 112 officers.

Military Districts had a different structure. For example, the Moscow Military District, the biggest one at the time, had between 109 and 193 officers; they went through special training for filtering POWs. SMERSH units at the fronts were supported by NKVD internal troops for guarding prisoners, for operational work UKR and OKR SMERSH units were supported by regular Red Army servicemen. SMERSH front directorates were provided with a battalion, SMERSH army departments with a company, and SMERSH departments at the regiment, division, or brigade level, a platoon.

==Methods==
In its counter-espionage and counter-intelligence roles, SMERSH appears to have been extremely successful throughout World War II. SMERSH actions resulted in numerous captures, desertions, and defections of German intelligence officers and agents, some of whom SMERSH turned into double agents. Indeed, the Germans began to consider missions where their losses were less than ninety percent &quot;satisfactory&quot;. According to German sources, the Soviets rendered approximately 39,500 German agents useless by the end of the war.

SMERSH utilized a number of different counterintelligence tactics: informants, security troops, radio games, and the passing of disinformation, ensuring both the reliability of the military and the civilian population. SMERSH set up a system of informants by sending a SMERSH officer to each battalion composed of between 1,000 and 1,500 men. Each SMERSH officer would enlist a number of &quot;residents&quot; who recruited their own &quot;reserve resident&quot; and between six and eight informants. Informants reported those sympathetic to the Germans, desertion, unpatriotic attitudes, and low morale and were authorized to take &quot;immediate corrective action&quot; if the need arose. SMERSH recruited between 1,540,000 and 3,400,000 informants, or about twelve percent of the entire Red Army. However, SMERSH coerced up to half of all of its informants to work for them.

In order to secure the Red Army&#x27;s rear, SMERSH evacuated civilians and set up checkpoints so as to assert physical control. Next, agents sought and arrested &quot;suspicious persons&quot; who might be German agents. Finally, SMERSH interrogated those arrested.

Compared to its predecessor (Directorate of Special Departments – UOO), SMERSH was mostly focused on enemies spies, although Red Army servicemen were still under suspicion.
Abakumov kept Stalin updated on all high-ranking commanders, and on the behavior of a number of leading military officers.
#The arrest of a private or junior officer should be approved by a prosecutor;
#The arrest of a mid-level commander should be approved by the commander and prosecutor of military unit.
#The arrest of a high-level commander should be approved by the Military Council of the [front] and a prosecutor.
#The arrest of a commander of the highest level should be authorized by the People&#x27;s Commissar of Defense [Stalin].

To confuse German intelligence with disinformation, SMERSH utilized radio playbacks and played over 183 radio games over the course of the war. Operation &quot;Opyt&#x27;&quot; serves as a good example of the effectiveness of these radio games. Between May and June 1943, SMERSH used three German agents to spread disinformation about the Kursk counteroffensive by suggesting the Red Army had begun to dig in rather than prepare for an attack, thus contributing to the success of the Red Army&#x27;s surprise attack. Before Operation Bagration, the largest Allied operation of the Second World War, SMERSH caught and &quot;doubled&quot; a number of German agents who tricked the German military into underestimating the number of Soviet troops by 1.2 million men.

SMERSH played a major role in creating and controlling partisan operations behind German lines. After capturing German-held territory and reuniting with the Red Army, SMERSH interviewed partisans in order to determine the partisans&#x27; loyalty to the regime.

== In popular culture ==
===In the West===
SMERSH has been popularized due to the organization&#x27;s prominence as one of the common antagonists in Ian Fleming&#x27;s early James Bond novels; however, Fleming&#x27;s portrayal has been generally criticized as quite inaccurate by historians. In later works Fleming abandoned the use of SMERSH as his chosen antagonists, introducing the purely fictional villainous organization SPECTRE.

In all Bond films based on Fleming&#x27;s works that featured SMERSH, the agency was either changed to SPECTRE or omitted altogether. However, SMERSH is mentioned in &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;. Also, an operation &#x27;smiert shpionam&#x27; (&#x27;death to spies&#x27;) forms part of the plot of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, but this was organized by a Russian General acting without approval of the Soviet Government.

In 1968 L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, began writing that all of the world&#x27;s governments had been taken over by SMERSH and that the organization was controlling the world through psychiatry, which the Church opposes. Hubbard proposed to defeat the alleged SMERSH infiltration by smuggling Sea Organization members into Switzerland, taking over the World Federation of Mental Health in Geneva, and then discrediting psychiatry by using the front organization to promote eugenics and mass euthanization to the United Nations. Hubbard abandoned the plan after the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health took notice of the Sea Org&#x27;s plan.
===In Russia===
Intelligence and counter-intelligence work always was one of the most interesting topics in Russia. With millions of veterans after the war many of them later became writers and directors. The Committee for State Security had a special &quot;KGB Award in the field of literature and art&quot; honoring depictions of an intelligence work. In modern Russia there a successor — &quot;FSB Award&quot;. Spy books were printed in editions numbering in the millions in the Soviet Union with a spy as a one of a sacred figures in mind. Even today there are regular re-publications of soviet novels and documentaries under the &quot;Counterintelligence Library&quot; collection. Spy movies also were released every year with 1968 being a special one: in that year &quot;The Shield and the Sword&quot;, &quot;Dead Season&quot; and &quot;The Secret Agent&#x27;s Blunder&quot; were released, and all three later became classic.

Literature
*The Moment of Truth (In August of 1944) — a 1973 novel by Vladimir Bogomolov set in 1944. It is one of the finnest examples of spy literature because Bogomolov was a GRU officer at that time who also had an approval and consultations from Ivan Ilyichev — the Head of GRU — and used real war-time documents (orders, reports, summaries, reports, orientations, government telegrams and other official documents). In 2001 a Russian-Belarusian film was made.
*On Thin Ice — a 1960 novel by Georgy Bryantsev, a writer who during the war was a partisan and an intelligence officer who reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was the first book that provided the first authoritative public description of SMERSH counterintelligence group. In 1966 a film of the same name was shot and became the highest-grossing movie that year with 42.5 million tickets being sold.

Movies
*The Shield and the Sword — a four-part spy epic based on Vadim Kozhevnikov&#x27;s novel and directed by Vladimir Basov. It was one of the first movies that depicted a true-to-life intelligence work. The release was both critical and box-office success with 68 million viewers (top 8 in all of Soviet history). The main song became a classic and the movie itself became one of the best in Soviet cinematography.
*Dead Season — a film directed by Savva Kulish. It was the first soviet spy film set during Cold War era. Vladimir Vajnshtok wrote the scrypt based on the newest declassified documents at that time by the KGB. It also was the first movie that worked with real recent former spies: Rudolf Abel had an opening scene with an appeal to the audience; and Konon Molody worked as a consultant under a Panfilov pseudonym.
*The Secret Agent&#x27;s Blunder — a film directed by Veniamin Dorman. It is the first part of a tetralogy about Mikhail Tulyev. Set in the 60s it depicts a theme of a soviet nuclear arsenal. This film was described as &quot;a psychological detective where emotions hits harder than action&quot;.

TV Series
*Seventeen Moments of Spring — a 1973 twelve-part television series, directed by Tatyana Lioznova and based on the novel of the same title by Yulian Semyonov. The series was a huge success among the soviet viewers with an audience of 80 million. At once Stierlitz became a folk hero, music theme became a cult classic, Tatyana Lioznova was awarded with Order of the October Revolution and Vyacheslav Tikhonov became a Hero of Socialist Labour for his role. Time magazine&#x27;s reporter John Kohan defined Stierlitz as &quot;the Soviet James Bond&quot;.
*TASS Is Authorized to Declare... — a 1984 ten-part series also based on Yulian Semyonov&#x27;s novel. This time it is set during Cold War era and a clash between soviet and american intelligences.

Video games
*Death to Spies trilogy:
**Death to Spies — released in 2007 by Haggard Games exclusively on PC. It is a stealth-action set in Second World War. Mechanically it is close to a Hitman series with an importance of disguise and camouflage.
**Death to Spies: Moment of Truth — released in 2008 it is a stand-alone DLC that does not requires the original Death to Spies.
**Alekhine&#x27;s Gun — released in 2016 it is the first game of the studio that was made for the 8th gen consoles. Troubles with funding and porting had a negative impact for the end product which received mostly negative reviews.
