<text>The Chess Federation of Russia (), known until 2018 as the Russian Chess Federation, () is the governing body for chess in Russia, and the officially recognized arm of the FIDE in Russia. It was founded on 15 February 1992, following the dissolution of the USSR Chess Federation. Its headquarters are in Moscow. The president is Andrey Filatov, who was elected in 2014. The structure of the Russian Chess Federation consists of three governing bodies: the Congress, the supervisory board, and the board of management.

==History==
The Chess Federation of Russia (CFR) is the successor of the supreme chess governing body of USSR. The first congress of CFR took place in February 1992, electing the president of CFR between Economist Leonid Abalkin and politician Arkady Murashov, the latter of whom held the position of the head of the Moscow City Police and a member of the Democratic Party of Russia together with World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov. Kasparov supported Murashov&#x27;s candidacy, and Murashov won the election.

As the aftermath of the election USSR grandmasters Anatoly Karpov, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, and Mikhail Tal founded an alternative chess organization, the Association of Chess Federations, which included almost all former Soviet chess federations, excluding Russian. At the end of the 30th Chess Olympiad in 1992, a member of the Presidium of the CFR, Yevgeny Bebchuk, initiated an extraordinary congress, where he was elected as the next president of the CFR. Bebchuk got support from Kasparov&#x27;s opposition, including Karpov and Botvinnik. In April 1994, as a result of another conflict, the Congress elected a new Bureau and a new president—Andrey Makarov, a lawyer and deputy of the State Duma.

Since 2010, the federation abolished the presidential position and introduced a board of management and a supervisory board, headed by a chairman. In 2014, the XII Federation Congress restored the post of President, as a substitution of the chairman of the supervisory board, and established the board of trustees, inviting renown Russian political figures and businessmen, including Arkady Dvorkovich, Sergei Shoigu, Sergey Sobyanin, Mintimer Shaimiev. Andrey Filatov was elected to the post of President of the CFR and re-elected in 2022. Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the Russian President, became chairman of the board of trustees.

On 25 September 2014, a chess museum opened in the Russian Chess Federation&#x27;s mansion.

In the 2021 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi, Nepomniachtchi competed under the Chess Federation of Russia flag. Nepomniachtchi is Russian, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a ban on Russia competing at World Championships, and it is implemented by WADA in response to the state-sponsored doping program of Russian athletes.

In 23 February 2023, with the approval from FIDE, Chess Federation of Russia has switched its regional affiliation from European Chess Union to Asian Chess Federation.

==Administration==
The Congress is the supreme legislative body of the CFR, held at least once every five years. The Congress elects the federation&#x27;s the supervisory board, which ensures control over the statutory and economic activities, and reports to the Congress.

The board of management is an elected collegial body that determines the priority areas of the CFR&#x27;s activities. CFR President leads the board of management: organizes its work, monitors the implementation of the resolutions of the supervisory board and carries out general management of the activities of the CFR. President represents the public interests of the CFR and signs official documents of CFR.

<doc id="366694" wikidata="Q2740101" url="?curid=366694" title="Chapultepec Peace Accords">
<text>The Chapultepec Peace Accords were a set of peace agreements signed on January 16, 1992, the day in which the Salvadoran Civil War ended. The treaty established peace between the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). It was signed in Chapultepec Castle, Mexico.

The treaty was negotiated by representatives of the Salvadoran government, the rebel movement FMLN, and political parties, with observers from the Roman Catholic Church and United Nations. The peace talks were mediated by Álvaro de Soto, the special representative of the UN Secretary-General.

The final agreement was divided into 9 chapters that covered 5 fundamental areas: 
*Modification of the Armed Forces and demobilization of all armed FMLN units;
*Replacement of the National Guard with the National Civil Police;
*Modifications to the judicial system and the defense of human rights;
*Modification to the electoral system;
*The adoption of measures affecting the economic and social fields. 
Compliance with the agreements took place under the supervision of a special mission of the United Nations, which gave a settlement after 3 years of management. On December 31, 1991, the government and the FMLN initialed a preliminary peace agreement under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. The final agreement was signed in Mexico City on January 16, 1992, at Chapultepec Castle.

A nine-month ceasefire took effect on February 1, 1992, and it has never been broken.

== Civil War ==

The Salvadoran Civil War began on October 15, 1979, with the 1979 Salvadoran coup d&#x27;état which overthrew President Carlos Humberto Romero. The coup had covert support from the United States, who wished to prevent Romero&#x27;s government from falling to left-wing militant groups in the country, the same fate as did the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua.

The coup of 1979 allowed for the rise of militant left-wing groups in the country. The five largest groups, Farabundo Martí People&#x27;s Forces of Liberation (FPL), Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES), National Resistance (RN), People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), and the Revolutionary Party of the Central American Workers – El Salvador (PRTC) joined forces on October 10, 1980, nearly one year after the coup, to form the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), the most prominent opposition force to the Salvadoran government throughout the Salvadoran Civil War. The group was named after Farabundo Martí, the leader of the Communist Party during an uprising in 1932 which resulted in the massacre of 10,000 to 40,000 peasants under the rule of Maximiliano Hernández Martínez.

The resulting civil war killed anywhere from 70,000 to 80,000 people and lasted twelve years from 1979 to 1992. After 10 years of war, more than one million people had been displaced out of a population of 5,389,000. 40% of the homes of newly displaced people were completely destroyed and another 25% were in need of major repairs. Death squad activities further escalated in 1990, despite a U.N. Agreement on Human Rights signed July 26 by the Cristiani government and the FMLN.

== Previous peace process ==

The Peace Accords were the result of a long negotiation process between the Government and the FMLN that had begun in the mid-1980s. The first meetings took place in Chalatenango on October 15, 1984, exactly 5 years after the start of the civil war. Further negotiations occurred in La Libertad on November 30, 1984. A third round of negotiations occurred in San Miguel on September 19, 1986. The last negotiations occurred in San Salvador on October 4, 1987, between President José Napoleón Duarte and government officials with delegates of the FMLN&#x27;s leadership. Despite the attempts to establish peace and end the war, none of them succeeded and the war dragged on.

=== Chalatenango ===

On October 16, 1984, the first round of negotiations occurred in La Palma, Chalatenango. The meeting resulted in the &quot;La Palma Joint Communiqué.&quot; The Government delegation was made up of the President, José Napoleón Duarte, while the guerrilla delegation was headed by Dr. Guillermo Ungo, a former member of the Revolutionary Government Junta, with Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, Archbishop of San Salvador, acting as a mediator. The statement was brief and vague; without firm agreements and with the sole achievement of constituting a political rapprochement.

=== La Libertad ===

On November 30, 1984, the second round of negotiations occurred in Ayagualo, La Libertad. The negotiations were headed by government representative Abraham Rodríguez with Rubén Zamora representing the guerrillas. Rivera y Damas, Giacomo Otonello, and Gregorio Rosa Chávez acted as mediators. At the meeting, the &quot;Ayagualo Joint Communiqué&quot; was drafted.

=== San Miguel ===

On September 19, 1986, the third round of negotiations took place in Sesori, San Miguel. Rodolfo Antonio Castillo Claramount represented the government and Jorge Villacorta represented the guerillas with Monsignor Rivera y Damas acting as mediator. The terms of the negotiations were not carried out however due to a breakdown in the negotiations. It was not until several months later that the process was resumed in a private meeting in Panama.

=== San Salvador ===

From October 4 to 5, 1987, the final round of negotiations occurred in San Salvador. Fidel Chávez Mena represented the government with Salvador Samayoa representing the guerillas and Monsignor Rivera y Damas as mediator. At that meeting, the &quot;Joint Communiqué of the Third Dialogue Meeting&quot; was issued which stated the government and guerrillas will to seek a ceasefire and to support the decisions made by the Contadora Group which was seeking peace in Central America.

== International intervention ==

In 1989, the government of President Alfredo Cristiani called for a dialogue meeting which was held on September 15 of that year in Mexico City. There, a joint request for mediation was addressed to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. It was agreed to and Álvaro de Soto was appointed as special representative. On November 11, 1989, the FMLN launched a general offensive to demonstrate its military strength. The offensive was contained by the Armed Forces. After the offensive concluded in a stalemate with 2,500 dead, many analysts considered the impossibility of military victory for either side in the conflict.

On April 4, 1990, a dialogue meeting was held in Geneva, Switzerland, where an agreement was signed that established the set of rules to be followed in the negotiation process and established the will of both parties to reach a negotiated and political solution to end the war. The objectives of the negotiation were set:

*End the armed conflict through political means;
*Promote the democratization of the country;
*Guarantee the unrestricted respect for human rights;
*Reunify Salvadoran society

On May 21, 1990, at a new meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, the general agenda for negotiations was established and the issues that would be submitted for discussion. Two negotiating delegations were created: the government under David Escobar Galindo, Abelardo Rodríguez, Oscar Santamaría, and Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, and the FMLN under Schafik Hándal, Joaquín Villalobos, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, José Eduardo Sancho Castañeda, Francisco Jovel, Salvador Samayoa, Nidia Díaz, Juan Ramón Medrano, Ana Guadalupe Martínez, and Roberto Reeds.

== Accords ==
On January 16, 1992, the full text of the agreements was signed in the Castle of Chapultepec in a solemn act, with the assistance of Heads of State from friendly countries, as well as official negotiating delegations.

=== Chapter I ===

Chapter I handled with the Armed Forces of El Salvador which accepted the following terms:

*Modify the doctrinal principles of the Armed Forces so that it could comply with the agreements made, establishing that the sole objective of the institution is &quot;the defense of the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of the territory, it is a permanent institution at the service of the nation&quot; and clarifying that the institution &quot;is obedient, professional, apolitical and non-deliberative.&quot;
*Reform the educational system of the Armed Forces.
*Create the Ad Hoc Commission to purge officers implicated in Human Rights violations.
*Reduce the number of troops of the Armed Forces.
*Overcome impunity with the creation of the Truth Commission that would investigate the most serious acts of violence in the civil war.
*Dissolve the 3 public security bodies that depended on the Armed Forces: the National Guard, National Police, and Treasury Police.
*Dissolve the military intelligence services (National Security Agency of El Salvador, ANSESAL) and create a civil intelligence service: the State Intelligence Agency (AEI).
*Dissolve the Immediate Reaction Infantry Battalions (BIRI).
*Reform the Constitution to clearly define the subordination of the Armed Forces to the civil authority.
*Suppress paramilitary entities (Civil Defense Patrols).
*Suspend forced recruitment activities.

=== Chapter II ===

Chapter II handled with the police force of the nation to which the government complied with the following terms:

*Create the National Civil Police as a new police force that will replace the old security forces with a civil and democratic doctrine.
*Establish quotas for the personnel of the new police force, in which demobilized elements of the FMLN, former agents of the National Police, and people without militancy on both sides would participate. It was agreed that it should be 20% for each side and 60% for neutral participants.
*Create the National Academy of Public Security to train the agents of the National Civil Police, emphasizing training to respect Human Rights.

=== Chapter III ===

Chapter III handled with human rights and the judiciary to which the government complied with the following terms:

*Create the Judicial Training School to train judges and magistrates adjusted to the new reality of the country.
*Reform the structure of the National Council of the Judiciary (the body that appoints and evaluates judges) to give it greater independence.
*Reform the election process and terms of the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice.
*Create the Procurator for the Defense of Human Rights (PDDH), an autonomous institution, which must supervise respect for human rights by the other state institutions.

=== Chapter IV ===

Chapter IV handled the civil and political rights of citizens which both sides agreed to:

*Create institutional reforms.
*Create the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the highest administrative and jurisdictional authority on the matter of elections.
*The right of political parties to monitor the preparation, organization, publication, and updating of the electoral register.
*At the political level, the measures adopted sought to guarantee the FMLN leaders and their members the full exercise of their civil and political rights within a framework of absolute legality, through their incorporation into the civil, political and institutional life of the country. The FMLN pledged to demobilize its guerrilla forces, under the supervision of ONUSAL. The government promised to pass the legislation necessary for the FMLN to become a legal political party and to participate in the general elections of 1994.

=== Chapter V ===

Chapter V handled economic and social fields to which the government agreed to:

*Create the Economic and Social Agreement Forum, a body where trade unions, business associations, and the State would have representation to discuss the country&#x27;s economic policy.
*Distribute land in conflict zones among demobilized ex-combatants.
*The lands that exceeded 245 hectares, as well as those properties of the State that were not a natural reserve, had to be distributed among peasants and small farmers who lacked arable land.

== Compliance ==

The definitive cessation of the fighting occurred on February 1, 1992, under the supervision of COPAZ and the notable presence of former FMLN commanders and their former enemies. In order for such a meeting to take place, the Legislative Assembly approved a National Reconciliation Law on January 23, by means of which El Salvador refused to open legal cases against the war fighters, opening a national amnesty. The Massive and gradual loss of troops from the Armed Forces took place while ex-guerrilla combatants were deployed from the occupied zones to fifteen areas that had previously been established for that purpose. Guerrilla weapons were deposited in containers controlled by ONUSAL, except those small arms intended for personal defense.

Police agents from various countries accompanied the National Police on patrol tasks, which had ceased to depend on the Ministry of National Defense; said support was given until the creation of the National Civil Police.

The distribution of land to ex-combatants took longer than expected, as did the establishment of the National Academy of Public Security and the legalization of the FMLN as a political party. The delays began to create tension among the political forces which led COPAZ to call for a rescheduling which was carried out on June 12, 1992. Said schedule was repeatedly modified to adjust to the actual deadlines that set the pace of progress in the process. Several months later than planned, on December 15, 1992, the definitive end of the armed conflict was officially celebrated.

== Conclusion of accords ==

In 1997, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations, ended the peace process in El Salvador, noting that although it was true that not all the agreements had been fully complied with, the degree of compliance was acceptable.

== Monuments ==

The Monument to Peace is a sculpture designed by the sculptor Rubén Martínez that was unveiled in the municipality of San Marcos, El Salvador.

The figure of the &quot;Christ of Peace&quot;, which was made with bullet casings, brass and cast bronze, and stands with outstretched arms as a symbol of reconciliation between the political ideologies of the right and the left. The figure of a dove in his left hand in flight position.

In 2017, on the 25th anniversary of the signing of the peace accords in the, President Salvador Sánchez Cerén, an ex-FMLN commander, celebrated with the inauguration of the Monument to the Reconciliation. In January 2024, the monument was demolished to make way for a new peace walk.

<doc id="366696" wikidata="Q192137" url="?curid=366696" title="Sukhoi Su-25">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-25 &quot;Grach&quot; ( (&quot;rook&quot;); NATO reporting name: Frogfoot) is a subsonic, single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by Sukhoi. It was designed to provide close air support for Soviet Ground Forces. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 22 February 1975. After testing, the aircraft went into series production in 1978 in Tbilisi in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Early variants included the Su-25UB two-seat trainer, the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for export customers. Some aircraft were upgraded to the Su-25SM standard in 2012. The Su-25T and the Su-25TM (also known as the Su-39) were further developments, not produced in significant numbers. The Su-25, and the Su-34, were the only armoured, fixed-wing aircraft in production in 2007. Su-25s are in service with Russia, other CIS members, and export customers. Production of the Su-25 ended in 2010 in Georgia. Attempts continue to be made to restart production in Georgia using partially completed airframes, but as of June 2022 no new deliveries have been reported.

Since entering service more than , the Su-25 has seen combat in several conflicts. The type was heavily involved in the Soviet–Afghan War, flying counter-insurgency missions against the Afghan Mujahideen. The Iraqi Air Force employed it against Iran during the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War. Most Iraqi examples were later destroyed or flown to Iran in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The Georgian Air Force used Su-25s during the Abkhazian war from 1992 to 1993. The Macedonian Air Force used Su-25s against Albanian insurgents in the 2001 Macedonian conflict and, in 2008, Georgia and Russia both used Su-25s in the Russo-Georgian War. African states, including the Ivory Coast, Chad, and Sudan have used the Su-25 in local insurgencies and civil wars. Recently, the Su-25 has seen service in the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, the clashes of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, and on both sides in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
==Development==
In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence decided to develop a specialised &quot;shturmovik&quot; armoured assault aircraft in order to provide close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (&quot;shturmovaya&quot;) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.

In March 1969, a competition was announced by the Soviet Air Force that called for designs for a new battlefield close-support aircraft. Participants in the competition were the Sukhoi design bureau and the design bureaus of Yakovlev, Ilyushin and Mikoyan. Sukhoi finalised its &quot;T-8&quot; design in late 1968, and began work on the first two prototypes (T8-1 and T8-2) in January 1972. The T8-1, the first airframe to be assembled, was completed on 9 May 1974. Another source says November 1974. However, it did not make its first flight until 22 February 1975, after a long series of test flights by Vladimir Ilyushin. The Su-25 surpassed its main competitor in the Soviet Air Force competition, the Ilyushin Il-102, and series production was announced by the Ministry of Defence.

During flight-testing phases of the T8-1 and T8-2 prototypes&#x27; development, the Sukhoi Design Bureau&#x27;s management proposed that the series production of the Su-25 should start at Factory No. 31 in Tbilisi, Soviet Republic of Georgia, which at that time was the major manufacturing base for the MiG-21UM &quot;Mongol-B&quot; trainer. After negotiations and completion of all stages of the state trials, the Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised manufacture of the Su-25 at Tbilisi, allowing series production to start in 1978.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several Su-25 variants appeared, including modernised versions, and variants for specialised roles. The most significant designs were the Su-25UB dual-seat trainer, the Su-25BM target-towing variant, and the Su-25T for antitank missions. In addition, an prototype was developed by Georgia in co-operation with Israeli company Elbit Systems in 2001, but so far this variant has not achieved much commercial success. , the Su-25 was the only armoured aircraft still in production.

The Russian Aerospace Forces, which operates the largest number of Su-25s, planned to upgrade older aircraft to the Su-25SM variant, but funding shortfalls had slowed the progress; by early 2007 only seven aircraft had been modified.

== Design ==
The Su-25 has a conventional aerodynamic layout with a shoulder-mounted trapezoidal wing and a traditional tailplane and rudder. Several metals are used in the construction of the airframe: 60% aluminium, 19% steel, 13.5% titanium, 2% magnesium alloy and 5.5% other materials.
All versions of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings at the tip of each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.

The flaps are mounted by steel sliders and rollers, attached to brackets on the rear spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane is attached to the load-bearing frame at two mounting points.

Early versions of the Su-25 were equipped with two R-95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments on either side of the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.
The autocannon is in a compartment beneath the cockpit, mounted on a load-bearing beam attached to the cockpit floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.

=== Cockpit ===

The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a centre stick and left hand throttles. The pilot sits on a Zvezda K-36 ejection seat (similar to the Sukhoi Su-27) and has standard flight instruments. At the rear of the cockpit is a steel headrest, mounted on the rear bulkhead. The cockpit has a bathtub-shaped armoured enclosure of welded titanium sheets, with transit ports in the walls. Guide rails for the ejection seat are mounted on the rear wall of the cockpit.

The canopy hinges open to the right and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, protected by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor and a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.

A folding ladder built into the left fuselage provides access to the cockpit as well as to the top of the aircraft.

===Avionics===
The base model Su-25 incorporates a number of key avionics systems. It has no TV guidance but includes a distinctive nose-mounted laser rangefinder that is thought to provide for laser-based target finding. A DISS-7 doppler radar is used for navigation; the Su-25 can fly at night, in visual and instrument meteorological conditions.

The Su-25 often has radios installed for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, including an SO-69 identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) transponder. The aircraft&#x27;s self-defence suite includes various measures, such as flare and chaff dispensers capable of launching up to 250 flares and dipole chaff. Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.

An airtight avionics compartment is behind the cockpit and in front of the forward fuel tank.

The newer Su-25TM and Su-25SM models have an upgraded avionics and weapons suite, resulting in improved survivability and combat capability.

==Operational history==
===Soviet–Afghan War===

The first Soviet Air Force Su-25 unit was the 80th Assault Aviation Regiment, formed in February 1981 based at Sitalcay air base in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The first eleven aircraft arrived at Sitalchay in May 1981. The 200th Independent Assault Aviation Squadron was then formed within the regiment to go to Afghanistan.

On 19 July 1981, the 200th Independent Attack Squadron was reassigned to Shindand Airbase in western Afghanistan, becoming the first Su-25 unit deployed to that country. Its main task was to conduct air strikes against mountain military positions and structures controlled by the Afghan rebels. Another Soviet Su-25 unit was the 368th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was formed on 12 July 1984, at Zhovtneve in Ukraine. It was soon also moved east to conduct operations over Afghanistan.

Over the course of the Soviet–Afghan War, Su-25s launched 139 guided missiles of all types against Mujahideen positions. On average, each aircraft performed 360 sorties a year, a total considerably higher than that of any other combat aircraft in Afghanistan. By the end of the war, nearly 50 Su-25s were deployed at Afghan airbases, carrying out a total of 60,000 sorties. Between the first deployment in 1981 and the end of the war in 1989, 21–23 aircraft were lost in combat operations, with up to nine destroyed on the ground while parked.

===Iran–Iraq War===
The Su-25 also saw combat during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–88. The first Su-25s were commissioned by the Iraqi Air Force in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties towards the end of the war, carrying out the bulk of Iraqi air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, Iraqi Su-25s performed up to 15 sorties per day, each. In one recorded incident, an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian, Hawk surface-to-air missile, but the pilot managed to eject. This was the only confirmed, successful Iranian shootdown of an Iraqi Su-25. After the war, Saddam Hussein decorated all of the Iraqi Air Force&#x27;s Su-25 pilots with the country&#x27;s highest military decoration.

===Gulf War===
During the Gulf War of 1991, the air superiority of the coalition forces was so great that the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.

On the evening of 6 February 1991, two US Air Force F-15C Eagle fighters of the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, operating from Al Kharj Air Base in Saudi Arabia, intercepted a pair of Iraqi MiG-21s and a pair of Su-25s. All four Iraqi aircraft were shot down, with both Su-25s coming down in the desert not far from the Iraqi border with Iran. This was the Iraqi Su-25s&#x27; only air combat of the war.

===Abkhazian War===
The Georgian government used Su-25s in 1992–93 against Abkhaz separatists during the First Abkhazian War. A Georgian Air Force Su-25 was shot down over Nizhnaya Eshera on 4 July 1993 by an 9K34 Strela-3 MANPADS. Another Georgian Su-25 was shot down on 13 July 1993 with a 9K32 Strela-2 MANPADS, while another Su-25 was downed by friendly fire by a ZU-23-2 on 4 July. The Russian Air Force also lost an Su-25 during war, the aircraft crashed due to a pilot&#x27;s mistake while providing CAS for Abkhaz forces.

===First Chechen War===
Russian Su-25s were employed during the First Chechen War. Together with other Russian Air Force air assets, they achieved air supremacy for Russian Forces. On 29 November 1994, attacking all four Chechen military bases, Russian Su-25 from the 368th Assault Aviation Regiment (OShAP) destroyed up to 266 Chechen aircraft on the ground, mostly not airworthy. The Air Force&#x27;s deployed assets performed around 9,000 air sorties, with around 5,300 being strike sorties during the Chechen campaign between 1994 and 1996. The Russian 4th Air Army had 140 Sukhoi Su-17Ms, Su-24s and Su-25s in the war zone supported by an A-50 AWACS aircraft. The employed munitions were generally unguided S-5, S-8, and S-24 rockets, as well as FAB-250 and FAB-500 bombs, while only 2.3% of the strikes used precision-guided Kh-25ML missiles, KAB-500L and KAB-500KR smart bombs when weather conditions were suitable. Russian forces were not able to properly take advantage of the air supremacy due to obsolete air tactics that focused the Air Force on useless tasks in this type of war such as Combat Air Patrols. The Russian air losses were low since no integrated air defense was fielded by the Chechens.

On 4 February 1995, a Russian Su-25 was shot down by ZSU-23-4 Shilka antiaircraft fire over Belgatoi Gekhi, five kilometers southeast of Grozny. The pilot, Maj. Nikolay Bairov, ejected but died impacting the ground as his parachute did not deploy on time. Another Su-25 piloted by Lt. Col. Evgeny Derkulsky was damaged by ground fire on the same day, but managed to land at Mozdok air base, where the aircraft was repaired. On 5 May 1995, another Russian Su-25 was downed near Serzhen-Yurt by 12.7 mm fire while on a low-altitude patrol. The pilot, Col. Vladimir Sarabeyev, was killed.

On 4 April 1996, another Su-25 fell either to ZU-23-2 fire while either making a reconnaissance flight or attacking the village of Goiskoye. The pilot, Maj. Alexander Matvienko, ejected and was recovered by a friendly helicopter returning to the airbase in Khankala, Grozny. On 5 May 1996, a two-seat Su-25UB was downed with an 9K34 Strela-3 MANPADS near the village of Mairtup while on reconnaissance. Both pilots, Col. Igor Sviryidov and Maj. Oleg Isayev, were killed in the crash. It was the fourth Su-25 shot down and fifth Russian fixed wing aircraft lost, since the start of the war in December 1994.

===Second Chechen War===
Russian Air Force Su-25s were extensively used during the Second Chechen War in particular during the first phase when Russian forces were invading the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Up to seven Russian Su-25s were lost, one to hostile fire: on 4 October 1999, a Su-25 was shot down by a MANPADS during a reconnaissance mission over the village of Tolstoy-Yurt killing its pilot. The wings of the aircraft were put on a pedestal in the central square in Grozny.

===Ethiopian–Eritrean War===
Su-25 attack aircraft were used by the Ethiopian Air Force to strike Eritrean targets. On 15 May 2000, An Ethiopian Su-25 was shot down by an Eritrean Air Force MiG-29, killing the pilot.

===2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia===
Su-25s were used by the Macedonian Air Force but flown by Ukrainian pilots during the conflict against Albanian separatists. Beginning on 24 June 2001, the aircraft made multiple attack runs against separatist positions. The Su-25s were only used during the Battle of Raduša on the last day.

===War in Darfur===
Sudan has used Su-25s in attacks on rebel targets and possibly civilians in Darfur.

===Ivorian-French clashes===
During the Ivorian Civil War, Su-25s were used by government forces to attack rebel targets. On 6 November 2004, at least one Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 attacked a unit of France&#x27;s Unicorn peacekeeping forces stationed in Bouaké, killing nine soldiers, a U.S. development worker and wounding 37 soldiers. Shortly afterwards, the French military retaliated by attacking the air base in Yamoussoukro and destroyed the Ivorian air force, heavily damaging the two Su-25s responsible for the attack.

===2008 Russia–Georgia war===

In August 2008, Su-25s were used by both Georgia and Russia during the 2008 Russia–Georgia war. Su-25s of the Georgian Air Force participated in providing air support for troops during Battle of Tskhinvali and launched bombing raids on targets in South Ossetia. Russian military Su-25s struck Georgian forces in South Ossetia, and undertook air raids on targets in Georgia. The Russian military officially confirmed the loss of three Su-25 aircraft to the Georgian air defense, though the &quot;Moscow Defense Brief&quot; suggests four. The three Russian aircraft were reportedly downed by Georgian Buk-M1 air defence units. Georgian Su-25s were able to operate at night. In early August 2008, Russian Su-25s attacked the Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing plant, where the Su-25 is produced, dropping bombs on the factory&#x27;s airfield.

===Iran===
On 1 November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator drone off the Iranian coast. The Iranian government has claimed that the drone violated its airspace.

===War in Donbas===
Ukrainian armed forces deployed aircraft over insurgent Eastern regions starting in spring 2014. On 26 May 2014, Ukrainian Su-25s supported Mi-24 helicopters during a military operation to regain control over the airport in Donetsk, during which the Su-25s fired air to ground rockets. On 2 July 2014, one Ukrainian Su-25 crashed due to a technical fault.

On 16 July 2014, an Su-25 was shot down, with Ukrainian officials stating that a Russian MiG-29 shot it down using a R-27T missile. Russia denied these allegations.

On 23 July 2014, two Su-25s were shot down in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. A spokesperson for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said the aircraft were shot down by missiles fired from Russia.

On 29 August 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 was shot down by pro-Russian rebels. The Ukrainian authorities said the downing was due to a Russian missile without clarifying if they mean Russian made or fired by Russian forces. The pilot managed to eject safely. On the same day, pro-Russian rebels claimed the downing of up to four Su-25s.

On 9 February 2015, the pro-Russian forces indirectly acknowledged, for the first time, with a reference to a Ukrainian media source, their use of Su-25 against Ukrainian forces during the fighting near Debaltsevo.

===2014 Northern Iraq offensive===
On 29 June 2014, it was reported that Iraq claimed to have received the first batch of second hand Su-25s ordered from Russia in order to fight the Islamic State forces. An Iraqi defense ministry source claimed the aircraft would be in service &quot;within three to four days&quot;, despite the fact that the Iraqis require technical help and parts to make them operational, and the fact that the Russian made aircraft are incompatible with the Iraqi Air force&#x27;s inventory of American made Hellfire missiles.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Air Force delivered seven Su-25s on 1 July 2014, the majority of which were ex-Iraqi aircraft from the Gulf War. They were quickly pushed into combat, performing air raids as early as the beginning of August 2014 and later expanding their area of operation.

Iraqi Su-25s flew the bulk of the sorties against the Islamic State, with 3562 missions between June 2014 and December 2017, by which time ISIS had lost control of all the territory it formerly controlled in Iraq. That compares to 514 sorties flown by the Iraqi fleet of F-16IQ fighters.

===Russian military intervention in Syria===
In September 2015, it was reported that at least a dozen Su-25 were deployed by Russia to an airfield near Latakia, Syria, to support the Russian forces there who were taking part in the Syrian offensive against ISIL. On 2 October 2015, Russian Su-24M and Su-25 attack aircraft destroyed an ISIL command post in the Idlib province, while Su-34 and Su-25 aircraft eliminated an ISIL fortified bunker in the Hama province. By 15 March 2016, with the scaling down of Russian presence in Syria, Russian Su-25s had performed over 1,600 sorties in Syria while dropping 6,000 bombs.

On 3 February 2018 a Russian Su-25 was shot down over Idlib by rebel fighters who used a MANPADS. A Syrian militant said that the pilot, Roman Filipov, ejected safely but killed himself with a grenade to avoid capture.

===2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War===
On 29 September 2020, Armenian Defense Ministry claimed that an Armenian Air Force Su-25 was shot down by a Turkish Air Force F-16, killing the pilot. However Turkey denied the allegation.

On 4 October 2020, an Azerbaijani Air force Su-25 aircraft was shot down, by Armenian forces, probably with a 9K33 Osa while targeting Armenian positions in Fuzuli. The pilot, Col. Zaur Nudiraliyev died in the crash. Azerbaijani officials acknowledged the loss in December 2020, while disclosing a major role of crewed aviation being hidden during the active phase of the conflict with more than 600 airstrikes by crewed aviation from 27 September 2020 to 9 November 2020, with the Su-25 fleet, tasked with the critical role of suppression and destruction of the enemy air defense among others.

===2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
====Russian service====
On 24 February 2022, Russia reported the loss of an Su-25 due to &quot;pilot error.&quot; On 1 March, a Russian Su-25SM was lost over Ukraine. The next day, another Russian Su-25SM, registration number &quot;RF-91961&quot; - Red 07, was shot down in Makariv, Ukraine. On 4 March, two Russian Su-25SMs, the first with registration number &quot;RF-93026&quot;, were lost over Volnovakha, Ukraine. The second, with callsign &quot;Red 04&quot;, was lost along with its pilot. Images of the aircraft wrecks were displayed on social media. On 7 March, an Su-25 was lost during a combat mission in Ukraine. On 10 March, one Su-25 with registration number &quot;RF-91969&quot; was shot down near Kyiv and the pilot killed. On 14 March, a Russian Su-25 was damaged by enemy fire, likely MANPADs, but managed to return to its base. On 24 May Ukraine claimed to have shot down retired Major General Kanamat Botashev flying an Su-25 using a Stinger missile. It was unknown if he was in service, or a private military contractor.

On 22 October 2023, Ukraine claimed to have shot down five Russian Su-25s, over the preceding ten days, during fighting in Donetsk.

In late April 2024, Su-25s were flying unimpeded over Chasiv Yar, which, according to military analyst Rob Lee, indicated “a clear sign of a lack of Ukrainian air defense ammunition.”

On 4 May 2024, the 110th Mechanized Brigade (Ukraine) claimed to have shot down a Su-25 over Donetsk Oblast.

As of February, 6 2025, Russia has been visually confirmed to have lost at least 38 Su-25s (35 destroyed, 2 damaged). 

====Ukrainian service====
The Ukrainian Air force also operates Su-25s. On 26 February 2022 three Su-25s from the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade were lost. &quot;Blue 19&quot; and &quot;Blue 30&quot; were shot down over the Kherson region. The pilots were presumed dead. Photos of the wrecks of the two Ukrainian aircraft were published. A third aircraft from the 299th was lost, but the pilot was captured by Russian forces. Ukrainian media acknowledged that the pilot was Ukrainian. The next day another Su-25, &quot;Blue 39&quot;, was shot down near Hlibivka Vyshgorod, Kyiv region. On 2 March, one Su-25 from 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade piloted by Oleksandr Korpan was lost over Starokostiantyniv, Khmelnytskyi Oblast. On 10 March one Su-25, &quot;Blue 31&quot; was shot down near Nova Kakhovka, Kherson. On 14 March another Su-25 was shot down by Russian forces in Volnovakha, Donbas region. The pilot was captured by Russian forces and later released on 24 April, in a Russo-Ukrainian prisoner swap. On 22 March, a Ukrainian Su-25, heavily damaged in combat was recorded in video. On 15 April, a Ukrainian Su-25 was reportedly shot down by Russian forces in Izyum. The downing of the aircraft was recorded by a military camera in thermographic mode. The pilot, Captain Yegor Seredyuk, was reported as being killed near Izyum on 15 April. Seredyuk was awarded the Hero of Ukraine order. On 14 May a Su-25 from 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade was shot down in Huliaipole, Zaporizhzhia Oblast and the pilot killed.

On 14 March 2023, the Minister of Defense of North Macedonia, Slavjanka Petrovska, confirmed the transfer of four non-airworthy Su-25s to Ukraine.

On 2 January 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Ukraine apparently managed to overhaul its remaining Su-25s to carry Western glide bombs such as the French AASM Hammer in 2024, allowing them to operate outside of Russian air defenses range.

==Variants==
===Su-25===
The basic version of the aircraft was produced at Factory 31, at Tbilisi, in the Soviet Republic of Georgia. Between 1978 and 1989, 582 single-seat Su-25s were produced in Georgia, not including aircraft produced under the Su-25K export program. This variant of the aircraft represents the backbone of the Russian Aerospace Forces&#x27; Su-25 fleet, currently the largest in the world. The aircraft experienced a number of accidents in operational service caused by system failures attributed to salvo firing of weapons. In the wake of these incidents, use of its main armament, the 240 mm S-24 rocket, was prohibited. In its place, the FAB-500 general-purpose high-explosive bomb became the primary armament.

====Su-25K====

The basic Su-25 model was used as the basis for a commercial export variant, known as the Su-25K (&quot;Komercheskiy&quot;). This model was also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi, Georgia. The aircraft differed from the Soviet Air Force version in certain minor details concerning internal equipment. A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built between 1984 and 1989.

===Su-25UB===
The Su-25UB trainer (&quot;Uchebno-Boyevoy&quot;) was drawn up in 1977. The first prototype, called &quot;T-8UB-1&quot;, was rolled out in July 1985 and its maiden flight was carried out at the Ulan-Ude factory airfield on 12 August of that year. By the end of 1986, 25 Su-25UBs had been produced at Ulan-Ude before the twin-seater completed its State trials and officially cleared for service with the Soviet Air Force.

It was intended for training and evaluation flights of active-duty pilots, and for training pilot cadets at Soviet Air Force flying schools. The performance did not differ substantially from that of the single-seater. The navigation, attack, sighting devices and weapons-control systems of the two-seater enabled it to be used for both routine training and weapons-training missions.

====Su-25UBK====
From 1986 to 1989, in parallel with the construction of the main Su-25UB combat training variant, the Ulan-Ude plant produced the so-called &quot;commercial&quot; Su-25UBK, intended for export to countries that bought the Su-25K, and with similar modifications to that aircraft.

====Su-25UBM====
The Su-25UBM is a twin seat variant that can be used as an operational trainer, but also has attack capabilities, and can be used for reconnaissance, target designation and airborne control. Its first flight was on 6 December 2008 and it was certified in December 2010. It will enter operational use with the Russian Aerospace Forces later. The variant has a Phazotron NIIR Kopyo radar and Bars-2 equipment on board. Su-25UBM&#x27;s range is believed to be and it may have protection against infra-red guided missiles (IRGM), a minimal requirement on today&#x27;s battle fields where IRGMs proliferate.

====Su-25UTG====
The Su-25UTG (&quot;Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy s Gakom&quot;) is a variant of the Su-25UB designed to train pilots in takeoff and landing on a land-based simulated carrier deck, with a sloping ski-jump section and arrester wires. The first one flew in September 1988, and approximately 10 were produced. About half remained in Russian service after 1991; they were used on Russia&#x27;s sole aircraft carrier, . This small number of aircraft were insufficient to meet the training needs of Russia&#x27;s carrier air group, so a number of Su-25UBs were converted into Su-25UTGs. These aircraft being distinguished by the alternative designation &quot;Su-25UBP&quot; (&quot;Uchebno-Boyevoy Palubny&quot;)—the adjective &quot;palubnyy&quot; meaning &quot;deck&quot;, indicating that these aircraft have a naval function. As of 2007, approximately 10 of these aircraft were operational in the Russian Navy as part of the 279th Naval Aviation Regiment of the Northern Fleet. In 2021, Su-25 aircraft were also reported deployed with the 100th Independent Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment of the same fleet.

===Su-25BM===
The Su-25BM (&quot;Buksirovshchik Misheney&quot;) is a target-towing variant of the Su-25 whose development began in 1986. The prototype, designated T-8BM1, successfully flew for the first time on 22 March 1990, at Tbilisi. After completion of the test phase, the aircraft was put into production.

The Su-25BM target-tower was designed to provide towed target facilities for training ground forces and naval personnel in ground-to-air or naval surface-to-air missile systems. It is powered by R-195 engines and equipped with an RSDN-10 long-range navigation system, an analogue of the Western LORAN system.

===Su-25T===
The Su-25T (&quot;Tankovy&quot;) is a dedicated antitank version, which has been combat-tested with notable success in Chechnya. The design of the aircraft is similar to the Su-25UB. The variant was converted to one-seater, with the rear seat replaced by additional avionics. It has all-weather and night attack capability. In addition to the full arsenal of weapons of the standard Su-25, the Su-25T can employ the KAB-500Kr TV-guided bomb and the semi-active laser-guided Kh-25ML. Its enlarged nosecone houses the &quot;Shkval&quot; optical TV and aiming system with the &quot;Prichal&quot; laser rangefinder and target designator. It can also carry &quot;Vikhr&quot; laser-guided, tube-launched missiles, which is its main antitank armament. For night operations, the low-light TV &quot;Merkuriy&quot; pod system can be carried under the fuselage. Three Su-25Ts prototypes were built in 1983–86 and 8 production aircraft were built in 1990. With the introduction of a definitive Russian Air Force Su-25 upgrade programme, in the form of &quot;Stroyevoy Modernizirovannyi&quot;, the Su-25T programme was officially canceled in 2000.

===Su-25TM (Su-39)===
A second-generation Su-25T, the &quot;Su-25TM&quot; (also designated &quot;Su-39&quot;), has been developed with improved navigation and attack systems, and better survivability. While retaining the built-in &quot;Shkval&quot; of Su-25T, it may carry &quot;Kopyo&quot; (rus. &quot;Spear&quot;) radar in an under fuselage container, which is used for engaging air targets (with RVV-AE/R-77 missiles) as well as ships (with Kh-31 and Kh-35 antiship missiles). The Russian Air Force has received 8 aircraft as of 2008. Some of the improved avionics systems designed for T and TM variants have been included in the &quot;Su-25SM&quot;, an interim upgrade of the operational Russian Air Force Su-25, for improved survivability and combat capability. The Su-25TM, as an all-inclusive upgrade programme has been replaced with the &quot;affordable&quot; Su-25SM programme.

===Su-25SM===
The Su-25SM (&quot;Stroyevoy Modernizirovannyi&quot;) is an &quot;affordable&quot; upgrade programme for the Su-25, conceived by the Russian Air Force in 2000. The programme stems from the attempted Su-25T and Su-25TM upgrades, which were evaluated and labeled as over-sophisticated and expensive. The SM upgrade incorporates avionics enhancements and airframe refurbishment to extend the Frogfoot&#x27;s service life by up to 500 flight hours or 5 years.

The Su-25SM&#x27;s all-new PRnK-25SM &quot;Bars&quot; navigation/attack suite is built around the BTsVM-90 digital computer system, originally planned for the Su-25TM upgrade programme. Navigation and attack precision provided by the new suite is three times better of the baseline Su-25 and is reported to be within using satellite correction and without it.

A new KA1-1-01 Head-Up Display (HUD) was added providing, among other things, double the field of view of the original ASP-17BTs-8 electro-optical sight. Other systems and components incorporated during the upgrade include a Multi-Function Display (MFD), RSBN-85 Short Range Aid to Navigation (SHORAN), ARK-35-1 Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), A-737-01 GPS/GLONASS Receiver, Karat-B-25 Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Berkut-1 Video Recording System (VRS), Banker-2 UHF/VHF communication radio, SO-96 Transponder and a L150 &quot;Pastel&quot; Radar Warning Receiver (RWR).

The R-95sh engines have been overhauled and modified with an anti-surge system installed. The system is designed to improve the resistance of the engine to ingested powders and gases during gun and rocket salvo firing.

The combination of reconditioned and new equipment, with increased automation and self-test capability has allowed for a reduction of pre- and post-flight maintenance by some 25 to 30%. Overall weight savings are around .

Su-25SM weapon suite has been expanded with the addition of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cueing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130 mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 autocannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 rounds per minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.

The eventual procurement programme is expected to include between 100 and 130 kits, covering 60 to 70 percent of the Russian Air Force active single-seat fleet, as operated in the early 2000s. On 2012, the Russian Aerospace Forces had over 30 Su-25SMs in service with plans to modernize about 80 Su-25s to the improved standard. By March 2013, over 60 aircraft are to be upgraded. In February 2013, ten new Su-25SMs were delivered to the Air Force southern base, where operational training is being conducted. During the period 2005–2015, more than 80 aircraft were upgraded.

Since early 2014, the 368th Assault Aviation Regiment of the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army at Budyonnovsk has received advanced Su-25SMs (probably 16 aircraft). Nine more were delivered in 2018, eight more in early 2019 and four more in early 2020 plus one more in early 2021.

Since 2018, the Aerospace Forces [VKS] have been receiving Su-25SM3s, and a total of 25 aircraft have already been delivered as of June 2019. Unlike the baseline Su-25 and its incrementally upgraded variant, the Su-25SM, both of which have a rather outdated Klen-PS laser target designator in the nose, the Su-25SM3 has been upgraded with the new SOLT-25 electro-optics nose module. The SOLT-25 provides 16× zoom and features a laser range finder and target designator, thermal imager, TV channels, and the ability to track moving targets in all weather up to 8 km away. In addition, the Su-25SM3 comes with the Vitebsk-25 protection suite, which integrates a set of Zakhvat forward and rearward facing missile approach warning ultraviolet sensors, the L-150-16M Pastel radar homing and warning system, two UV-26M 50 mm chaff dispensers, and a pair of wing-mounted L-370-3S radar jamming pods. Furthermore, the Su-25SM3 has been upgraded with the new PrNK-25SM-1 Bars targeting-and-navigation system and the KSS-25 communication system with Banker-8-TM-1 antenna.

As a result from combat experience in Syria the Su-25SM3 has been equipped with SVP-24 navigation and bombing aids that improve the accuracy of unguided bombs.

===Su-25KM===
The (&quot;Komercheski, Modernized&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Scorpion&quot;, is an Su-25 upgrade programme announced in early 2001 by the original manufacturer, Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing in Georgia, in partnership with Elbit Systems of Israel. The prototype aircraft made its maiden flight on 18 April 2001 at Tbilisi in full Georgian Air Force markings.
The aircraft uses a standard Su-25 airframe, enhanced with advanced avionics including a glass cockpit, digital map generator, helmet-mounted display, computerised weapons system, complete mission pre-plan capability, and fully redundant backup modes. Performance enhancements include a highly accurate navigation system, pinpoint weapon delivery systems, all-weather and day/night performance, NATO compatibility, state-of-the art safety and survivability features, and advanced onboard debriefing capabilities complying with international requirements. It has the ability to use Israeli Opher infrared-guided bombs and Lizard laser-guided bombs, as well as the Vympel R-73 infrared-guided missile.

===Su-28===

The Sukhoi Su-28 (also designated &quot;Su-25UT&quot; – &quot;Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy&quot;) is an advanced basic jet trainer, built on the basis of the Su-25UB as a private initiative by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Su-28 is a light aircraft designed to replace the Czechoslovak Aero L-39 Albatros. Unlike the basic Su-25UB, it lacks a weapons-control system, built-in cannon, weapons hardpoints, and engine armour.

=== Other ===

He was Secretary of State for War between 1905 and 1912 during which time the &quot;Haldane Reforms&quot; of the British Army were implemented. As Secretary of State of War, he was instrumental in founding MI5, MI6, the Territorial Army, the British Expeditionary Force, and the Royal Air Force. Beyond his military contributions, Haldane was a significant figure in education, contributing to the founding of institutions such as Imperial College London and the London School of Economics. His efforts have left a lasting impact on both the UK&#x27;s defense and educational landscapes. 

As an intellectual he was fascinated with German thought. That led to his role in seeking detente with Germany in 1912 in the Haldane Mission. The mission was a failure and tensions with Berlin forced London to work more closely with Paris. 

Raised to the peerage as Viscount Haldane in 1911, he was Lord Chancellor between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1914.

==Background and education==
Haldane was born at 17 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist James Alexander Haldane, the brother of respiratory physiologist John Scott Haldane, Sir William Haldane and author Elizabeth Haldane, and the uncle of J. B. S. Haldane, Robert Haldane Makgill and Naomi Mitchison.

He received his first education at the Edinburgh Academy, and then at the University of Göttingen. He gained a first and MA at University of Edinburgh where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and was Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar.

After studying law in London, he was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1879, and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by Horace Davey in 1882 as the junior. Haldane&#x27;s practice was a specialism in conveyancing; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the Privy Council and House of Lords. By 1890 he had become a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. By 1905 he was earning £20,000 per annum at the Bar (equivalent to £ million in ). He became a bencher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1893. Amongst his early friends was Edmund Gosse, the librarian of the House of Lords library.

Haldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician. During his stay at Göttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenhauer and Hegel. He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, T. H. Green, he dedicated his &quot;Essays in Philosophical Criticism&quot; to him.

==Early political career==
A cousin, the Whig politician Lord Camperdown encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the General Election of 1880. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the Eighty Club, a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met H. H. Asquith, and they soon became firm friends often meeting at the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Albert Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.

In November 1885, Haldane was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Haddingtonshire, a seat he held until 1911. The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;. In October 1888, &quot;The Liberal Creed&quot; was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism. In the 1890 article &quot;The Eight Hours Question&quot; Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day. In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, Ronald Munro-Ferguson; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel &quot;Betsy&quot; in 1892. Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey. At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist, Walter Hepburne-Scott, Master of Polwarth. Beatrice Webb, the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world. Haldane added the preface to Leonard Hobhouse&#x27;s &quot;The Labour Movement&quot; in 1893. Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897. Webb remarked, &quot;He had pathos in his personality, a successful lawyer tinged with socialism.&quot;

===Liberal Imperialist===
Focusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness. Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and Grey in the Liberal Imperialist wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane&#x27;s intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894. Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. Asquith wryly remarked &quot;A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.&quot; Haldane was sounded out for the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. 

At a meeting with Beatrice Webb Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: &quot;Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party&quot;. The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. &quot;Although Asquith, Grey and I&quot;, wrote Haldane, &quot;stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch&quot;. When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March. However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he &quot;was the leader of a revolution in our party&quot;.

On 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the Privy Council, following an announcement of the King&#x27;s intention to make the appointment in the 1902 Coronation Honours list, published in June that year. The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like The Souls together in consensual amity. Balfour&#x27;s administration leant on Haldane&#x27;s philosophy for educational reforms.

After the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and Grey would refuse to serve unless Henry Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to &#x27;kick CB upstairs&#x27;. However, the plot (called &quot;The Relugas Compact&quot; after Grey&#x27;s Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Campbell-Bannerman.

Haldane wrote, &quot;One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action&quot;.

On 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War, but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary. (Grey became Foreign Secretary). Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party&#x27;s history in the 1906 general election.

==Secretary of State for War==
As early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans. However, Haldane&#x27;s first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by £2.6m to £28 million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment. By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary&#x27;s 6.1%. Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the Boer War, army expenditure was £86.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to £27.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to £29.4m. In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and £1m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907–8, and £2m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).

In October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1 am to talk with the Emperor over whisky on arms reduction principles. But the import was the Berlin–Baghdad railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval. A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing &#x27;like a bear with a sore head&#x27; that he had won a great deal. Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909. But the Kaiser, refusing to converse with a mere secretary, arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.

Despite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the army for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the British Expeditionary Force of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division. The Official Historian Brigadier James Edmonds later wrote that &quot;in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores&quot;


==Army reforms==

Haldane set up the Imperial General Staff. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. Esher had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905. Haldane&#x27;s reforms also created the Territorial Force of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home, the Officer Training Corps and the Special Reserve.

In all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with Major-General Haig. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. J. A. Spender later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.

Usually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane&#x27;s interest in philosophy, declaring: &quot;I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough&quot;. In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the Territorial Army in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.

Haldane was also instrumental in the creation the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).

==Philosopher-politician==
Throughout his long career and association with the modernisers or &#x27;Limps&#x27; Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy. A radical liberal, Haldane was also, according to historian Martin Pugh, one of the &quot;best supporters&quot; of David Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Budget.&quot; During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909–11, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane&#x27;s own bad health was similar to King Edward&#x27;s declining fortunes.
Two elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Haldane, of Cloan in the County of Perth. He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On Lord Loreburn&#x27;s retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as Lord Chancellor, making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.

==Haldane Mission of 1912 to Berlin ==

1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the Haldane Mission, an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of their escalating naval arms race. The mission was a failure because the Germans would agree to slow the tempo of its warship construction only if Britain promised to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where &quot;Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.&quot; Above all Berlin wanted Britain to remain neutral in a war between Germany and France. That carried an unacceptable risk encouraging Germany to go to war with France or Russia and taking control of the continent.

==First World War==
In March 1914 Haldane&#x27;s successor at the War Office, Jack Seely, resigned following the Curragh incident. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August. With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint Field Marshal Kitchener.

Following the outbreak of the First World War Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting Albert Ballin, a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed and were even echoed in a popular music hall song (&quot;All dressed up and nowhere to go&quot;) in the revue &quot;Mr Manhattan&quot;. He was harried in particular by Beaverbrook&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot;, which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said &quot;Germany was his spiritual home&quot;. He had in fact said that about Professor Hermann Lotze&#x27;s classroom at Göttingen at a dinner party given by Mrs Humphry Ward in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.

In 1915 Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members. He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King&#x27;s Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.

==Dismissal from office==

Following the shell crisis and the resignation of Lord Fisher, in May 1915 the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of Bonar Law, insisted on the removal of Winston Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane. Haldane&#x27;s removal was on account of the popularity of the press&#x27;s campaign relating to Haldane&#x27;s alleged pro-German sympathies. Neither the former prime minister Arthur Balfour, Haldane&#x27;s closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane&#x27;s closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law&#x27;s demands. Roy Jenkins in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot; and Max Egremont describes Balfour as &quot;knowing the injustice behind the charges&quot; and &quot;being privately indignant&quot;.

To the detriment of their relationship, Asquith gave no personal expression to Haldane. Jenkins describes the omission as &quot;the most uncharacteristic fault of Asquith&#x27;s whole career&quot; attributing it to Asquith suffering the &quot;indescribable blow&quot; of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, Venetia Stanley, to one of his government ministers, Edwin Montagu.

Following his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General Aylmer Haldane, but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet. Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a &quot;Memorandum of Events, 1906–15&quot;, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George&#x27;s new government, formed in December 1916, &quot;very low class&quot;. Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, &quot;Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want.&quot;

As the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the Irish War of Independence broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.

== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==

As Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor. He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the Canadian Constitution, particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act 1867. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government. For instance, in the case of &quot;In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act&quot;, he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature. In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; power of the federal government, as well as the federal criminal law power. Similarly, in &quot;Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider&quot;, Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right. The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court of Canada, but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.

Haldane&#x27;s approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as F. R. Scott and Chief Justice Bora Laskin, as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues. More recently, one major study has characterised him as &quot;the wicked stepfather&quot; of the Canadian Constitution.

==Influence on education==
In 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the London School of Economics. A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898. The philosophy of &#x27;national efficiency&#x27; was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenhauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist&#x27;s perspective. His moral centrism sought to unify &quot;The New Liberalism&quot;, as he published it in Contemporary Review. From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism. He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour&#x27;s Education Act 1902. He told Rosebery &quot;a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.&quot; He was also involved in the founding of Imperial College in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, which now forms part of the main library collection.

Haldane was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb. He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade. Unlike Joseph Chamberlain he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity. He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.

In 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club&#x27;s annual dinner, addressing &quot;The dedicated life&quot; to a group of students on 10 January 1907. He also served as second Chancellor of the University of Bristol where he made an important address titled &quot;The Civic University&quot; outlining his educational philosophy in 1911. At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the University of St Andrews in June 1928. Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.

==Writings==
Haldane co-translated the first English edition of Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is &quot;The Reign of Relativity&quot; (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity. Haldane published &quot;The Pathway to Reality&quot;,
based on the Gifford Lectures which he had delivered at the University of St Andrews. Some of his public addresses have also been published, including &quot;&quot; (1918).

==Personal life==

Haldane had health problems all his life. He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. &quot;The latter is a large, fat man&quot; was Haig&#x27;s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour. Yet, added Haig, &quot;One seems to like the man at once.&quot; Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded &quot;a most clear headed and practical man––very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.&quot; Osbert Sitwell described him as &quot;entering a room with the air of a whole procession&quot;. Leo Amery said he looked like &quot;the old-fashioned family butler&quot;. Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane&#x27;s advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick. From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the Aristotelian Society.

Haldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fiancée, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in Auchterarder, Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72. The viscountcy became extinct on his death.

==Later years==
In December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of &#x27;The Machinery of Government&#x27; committee. However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.

At the time of the Paisley by-election of January 1920 Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from Margot Asquith, whom Haldane thought &quot;tiresome because she is ignorant&quot;, to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith&#x27;s election on a personal level.

Being a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to Albert Einstein, when he visited London in 1921. As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. &quot;The Reign of Relativity&quot; combined Haldane&#x27;s love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex. Haldane admired the fact that Germans were &quot;trained to obey&quot;. Hegel&#x27;s aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart. The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel&#x27;s philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.

Haldane refused to join the platform for Asquith&#x27;s speech at Westminster Central Hall in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party. It was not until the general election of 1923 that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of Labour candidates. When the Labour government was formed by Ramsay MacDonald in early 1924, Haldane served once again as Lord Chancellor. He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with Lord Parmoor. Haldane was a vital member of the Cabinet as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.

Haldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston. He made some famous speeches at Toynbee Hall for the Annual American Seminar.

==Legacy==
In November 1923 Lord Birkenhead, the Conservative politician, praised Haldane&#x27;s contribution to Britain&#x27;s preparedness for the First World War:

On Haldane&#x27;s death &quot;The Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most powerful, subtle and encyclopaedic intellects ever devoted to the public service of his country&quot;.

The military historian Correlli Barnett claimed that Haldane had &quot;all-round personal talents far exceeding those of his predecessors&quot; as Secretary of State for War and that he was &quot;a man of first-class intellect and wide education&quot;. Walter Reid believed Haldane to be the greatest of the Secretaries for War.

<text>Richard Marsden Pankhurst (1834 – 5 July 1898) was an English barrister and socialist who was a strong supporter of women&#x27;s rights. He was married to suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst.

==Early life==
Richard Pankhurst was the son of Henry Francis Pankhurst (1806–1873) and Margaret Marsden (1803–1879). Pankhurst was born in Stoke but spent most of his life in Manchester and London. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Owens College of Manchester. In 1858 he graduated B.A. from the University of London and in 1859 was awarded LL.B. with Honours. In 1863 he graduated LL.D. with gold medal.

==Career==
He was called to the Bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1867 and joined the Northern Assizes circuit. He was also a member of the Bar of the County Palatine of Lancaster Court.

Following qualification he was a founder member of the Manchester Liberal Association, although he was subsequently to fall out with the Liberals. He campaigned for multiple causes, including free speech, universal free secular education, republicanism, home rule for the Irish, independence for India, nationalisation of land, the disestablishment of the Church of England and the abolition of the House of Lords. He established a National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, drafted the Women&#x27;s Disabilities Removal Bill (the first women&#x27;s suffrage bill in England) and was the original author of the bill which became the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 which gave wives absolute control over their property and earnings.

He married Emmeline Goulden, better known as Emmeline Pankhurst, who was some 24 years younger than he was, in 1878. With her, he was instrumental in establishing a branch of the Independent Labour Party. Together they formed the Women&#x27;s Franchise League in 1889. They were part of a political circle which included Keir Hardie, Annie Besant, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw. They were present at the Bloody Sunday riot in Trafalgar Square.

Known as the &quot;Red Doctor&quot;, he stood for Parliament in 1883 as candidate for Manchester, in 1885 for Rotherhithe, Surrey, and in 1895 in Manchester Gorton, in all cases unsuccessfully. His controversial views did not win him many clients, but did afford him a place of great respect in the Independent Labour Party, even long after his sudden death, from stomach ulcers, at the age of 64.

He was buried alongside his parents in Brooklands Cemetery, Sale, Cheshire, where there is a headstone bearing their names.

==Personal life==
With his wife Emmeline, he was father to five children: Christabel Pankhurst (1880–1958), Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960), Francis Henry (1884–1888), Adela Pankhurst (1885–1961), and Henry Francis (1889–1910). His daughters all became suffragettes. Through his daughter Sylvia, he is the great-grandfather of Helen Pankhurst and grandfather of Richard Pankhurst, who shares his name.

==In popular culture==
Pankhurst appears as a character in the 1974 BBC television drama &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot;. He is played by Michael Gough.

==Sayings==
*&quot;Life is nothing without enthusiasms&quot;
*&quot;Every struggling cause shall be ours&quot;
*[The House of Lords is] &quot;a public abattoir butchering the liberties of the people&quot;
*[The clergy of the Church of England are] &quot;a portentious [sic?] beadledom&quot;

<doc id="366710" wikidata="Q245931" url="?curid=366710" title="Music of Cyprus">
<text>The music of Cyprus includes a variety of traditional, Western classical and Western popular genres. Cypriot traditional music is similar to the traditional music of Greece, it is most similar to Nisiotika the songs and dances of the Aegean islands, and includes dances like sousta, syrtos, ballos, tatsia, antikristos, arabiye, karotseris, sinalik, çifteli, zeimbekiko and the mandra dance.
==History==
===Medieval music===
Cyprus changed hands numerous times prior to the medieval era, and was an important outpost of Christianity and Western European civilization during the Crusades. The island&#x27;s peak as a cultural capital of Europe occurred from 1359 to 1432. During that peak, Pierre I de Lusignan made a three-year tour on Europe, bringing with him an entourage of musicians that impressed Charles V in Rheims so much that he donated 80 francs in gold to them. On his return to Cyprus, Pierre I brought with him the French Ars Nova and, later, the Ars Subtilior. French musicians became well established in Cyprus, and the city of Nicosia became a capital of the Ars Subtilior style. Janus I de Lusignan saw Cypriot music evolve into its own variety of music. His daughter, Anne de Lusignan, brought a manuscript after her marriage to Louis, Count of Geneva, which contained 159 folios with over two hundred polyphonic compositions, both sacred and secular. The manuscript is now a part of the collection of the National Library of Turin.

===Renaissance music===
A key-figure of that era was Ieronimos o Tragodistis (Greek: Ιερώνυμος Τραγωδιστής, Hieronymus the Cantor), a Cypriot student of Gioseffo Zarlino, who flourished around 1550-1560 and, among others, proposed a system that enabled medieval Byzantine chant to correspond to the current contrapuntal practices via the cantus. One of his manuscripts is located in the library of Saint Ignatios Monastery in Lesbos.

===Byzantine music===
The music of the island is influenced also by the Byzantine music. Athanasios Demetriadis, also known as Kasavetis, was a Cypriot deacon in Constantinople when Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople was his uncle Yerasimos (1794–1797). A secular song lamenting Death&#x27;s preference for the young, written and set to music by him survives in a collection by Nikiforos Naftouniaris. Chrysanthos of Madytos, Gregory the Protopsaltes, and Chourmouzios the Archivist were responsible for a reform of the notation of Greek ecclesiastical music. Essentially, this work consisted of a simplification of the Byzantine musical symbols which, by the early 19th century, had become so complex and technical that only highly skilled chanters were able to interpret them correctly.

==Recent and current music scenes==

===Traditional music===

Traditional music on Cyprus is similar to the traditional music of Greece and includes dances like the tatsia, sousta, syrtos, ballos, zeibekiko, karotseris, sinalik, chiftetteli, arabkyes, mandra dance and the karsilama suites. Note that unlike Greece and Turkey, there are suites of five karsilama dances, different for men and women some of them other than the standard 9/8 rhythm. The fifth karsilama dance is also known as ballos for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s suites. Traditional Cypriot music – similar to Greek and Turkish traditional music – is modal, based on the musical systems of the Byzantine echos / Turkish makam. Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots use the violin as the main solo instrument, accompanied by the lute. The &quot;tamboutsia&quot; and the &quot;pithkiavlin&quot; are also used. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the davul and the zurna (daouli and zournes in Greek) were used by both communities (although mostly by Turkish Cypriots) in village festivals and weddings, but these instruments were later excluded from the Greek Cypriot soundscape. Another instrument that was played earlier in Cyprus was tambouras, which is known in Greece as &#x27;pandoura&#x27; or &#x27;trichordo&#x27; (a three-stringed instrument). Notable performers of Greek Cypriot folk music include singers Theodoulos Kallinikos, Michalis Tterlikkas, Christos Sikkis, Michalis Hadjimichail and Ilias Kouloumis. The &quot;chiatistá&quot; (Cypriot Greek: τσιαττιστά, &quot;spite [song]&quot;) is improvised antiphonal singing akin to the Cretan mantinada, to express a range of themes be it satire, love, mourning etc. Greek-Cypriot folk music is most closely related to the Nisiotika (the folk music of the Aegean Islands) and especially so to the music of the Dodecanese. The traditional music of Cyprus is also greatly influenced from the music of the Greeks of Asia Minor.

Attempts to either popularize or fuse traditional music with other genres have taken place since the 1970s. For example, the famous singer and composer, in Cyprus and Greece, of traditional Cypriot and popular music is Mihalis Violaris.

====Rock and heavy metal music====

=====First era: 1970s to 1990s=====

The history of Cyprus&#x27; rock and heavy metal music begins a few years after the war of 1974, during the late 1970s. This period is known as the &quot;First Rock Era of Cyprus&quot;. One of the pioneers of the rock/metal scene in Cyprus is Kim Nicolaou founder of the band known as &quot;Kimstyle TR&quot; (TR standing for Teenage Revolution). This band was the first to bring and introduce live rock shows to the Island. The band&#x27;s first pop/rock single was called &quot;The Lady &amp; The Parrot&quot; which was so ahead of its time, for the standards of Greece and Cyprus, that the lyrics were found offensive; therefore, it was banned by CyBC TV and copies of the single were burnt by the customs authorities. This spawned many teenagers to start forming bands &amp; that brought competitions amongst them in the movie theatres. &quot;Kimstyle&quot; and &quot;Kim Nicolaou&#x27;s Rock &amp; Reggae show&quot; (first of its kind broadcast by CyBC), who later influenced the group &quot;Armageddon&quot; in the mid-1980s, with their traditional heavy metal sound are considered to have taken rock music on the Island one step further. The longest-running band to date, they have managed to be synonymous to the Cyprus metal scene throughout the years, with quality releases and a few visits abroad. Nowadays, they have moved more into the progressive side of metal.

In the early 1990s, &quot;Godblood&quot; started the local Black metal scene, acting firstly as a school-band, and later on continuing with their small record label &#x27;Throne Productions&#x27;. They have disbanded and only some can recall some shows they had in Cyprus with bands from the &quot;Greek scene&quot; like &quot;Rotting Christ&quot; and an international festival in Israel in the late 1990s. In Heavy/Power metal there were bands of great quality such as &quot;Diphtheria&quot; and later &quot;Arryan Path&quot; leading the genre.

There were also a couple of active Thrash metal bands during that era giving great live shows such as &quot;Regicide&quot; (supporting &quot;Epidemic&quot;) and then &quot;Scotoma&quot;. Eventually, the 1990s were a very active period for the scene in general.

=====After 2000=====
Some popular rock bands in Cyprus were &quot;Akoustikoi Epivates (founded by lead singer Vyronas Potsos), lopodytes, savvas isovitis(solo singer/guitar), by accident, Katadotes (Καταδότες), Full Volume, Quadraphonic, Johnny &amp; the Liars (Punk/Alternative rock), Maenads, Forty Plus, Triple Jam and Krokes (both are Greek rock bands), Ophiochus (Instrumental Funk/Rock), Isaac&#x27;s Cello (Psychedelic/experimental)&quot;.

Active bands, with releases and/or live shows of the 2000s (some appeared also in magazines and websites around the globe):
*Arkhon
*BLACK ANIS
*Blynd
*Methysos
*Quadrophonic
*Sonik Death Monkey
*Stormcast
*Winter&#x27;s Verge
During this decade, there was an uprising of concerts of different sizes and musical directions across the island. This led to number of greek metal bands like Rotting Christ, SepticFlesh, Crossover, Nightfall, Ravencult, and W.E.B., as well as international acts like Anathema and Sepultura visiting and performing in Cyprus.

==== World musics ====
One of the most successful and recognised world music groups in Cyprus is Monsieur Doumani. The group was formed in Nicosia in 2012 and has released two albums, Grippy Grappa (2013) and Sikoses (2015). The band focuses upon the unique character of Cypriot folkloric music, enriching traditional songs with new arrangements, melodies, rhythms and sounds and crafting a style distinctively their own. The band&#x27;s music is a blend of the traditional element with modern genres. Their repertoire also includes their own compositions in the Cypriot Greek dialect, which are inspired by contemporary Cypriot society, as for example the recent financial crisis that hit the island and the corrupted political system. 
Monsieur Doumani was nominated for &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; in Songlines Music Awards 2014 and participated in acclaimed festivals around the globe such as WOMAD Charlton Park 2014, Sommarscen Malmö, Songlines Encounters Festival etc.

====Electronic/world music====
In 2008 the electronic/world music group Mikros Kosmos (&quot;small world&quot;) arrived in Cyprus and recorded their first album in Nicosia. Their first performances presented live remixes for laptop and voice of classic Greek rebetika, with performances at &quot;New York City&#x27;s Golden Festival&quot; and elsewhere in the United States. Mikros Kosmos&#x27;s full-length original album moves away from the classic rebetika with an affection for minimal arrangements and a lyrical abstraction which is uncommon in the history of Greek music.

===Festivals===
* Kypria Festival 
* Pafos Aphrodite Festival (an international opera festival in Pafos) 
*International Music Festival at the Kourion Amphitheatre. 
* During the spring months of April and May Bellapais Abbey (a 13th Century Lusignan Monastery in Kyrenia) hosts celebrated musicians from all over the world. 
* Salamis in Famagusta is another such Cyprus historic site used for concerts.
*Reggae Sunjam festival with local and international artists (taking place once a year during the summer)..

<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Henry William Stisted (5 June 1817 – 10 December 1875), served as the first Lieutenant Governor of Ontario after Confederation, from 1867 to 1868.

==Biography==
Born 1817, at St-Omer, France, to Lt.-Colonel Charles Stisted (1786–1842) of the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars, by his wife Eliza Maria (b.1787 Bengal, India) d. 1822 Ipswich, UK,) daughter of Major-General William Burn (c1745–1814) of Exeter, Devon.

After being educated at Sandhurst, he entered the army as an ensign in the 2nd foot on 4 December 1835, and served with his regiment in Afghanistan and Beloochistan, taking part in the storming of Ghuznee, where he was wounded at the gateway, the capture of Khelat, and the occupation of Kabul, for which he received a medal. On 19 April 1850 he was gazetted lieutenant-colonel of the 78th foot, and in the Persian war of 1856 and 1857 commanded a brigade in the night attack and battle of Kooshat, and took charge of his own regiment at the bombardment of Mohamrah, after which he received the thanks of the governor-general as well as a medal and clasps. He commanded the advanced guard of Havelock&#x27;s force at the relief of Lucknow, 25 September 1857, when, upon the death in battle of Brigadier-general James George Smith Neill, he was appointed to command the first brigade. That post he held until the close of the operations, when on 1 January 1858 he was nominated C.B. In that year he served also in Rohilcund and commanded the second brigade at the battle of Bareilly on 7 May.

He became lieutenant-colonel of the 93rd foot on 30 September 1859 and served with the field force against the mountain tribes on the north-west frontier of India in December 1863. He was appointed Major General in 1864 and divisional commander of British forces in Canada in 1866 and appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in June 1867. He was instrumental in opening up the northern part of the province for development. For his services in this capacity he received the thanks of the governor-general of Canada and was nominated a K.C.B. on 20 May 1871. On 5 February 1873, he was appointed a lieutenant-general and was nominated colonel of the 93rd foot on 28 September 1873.

He died at Wood House, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 10 December 1875. In 1845, at Florence, he had married Maria Katherine Eliza Burton (1823–1894), sister of explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. Their daughter, Georgiana Martha Stisted (1846–1903), published &quot;The True Life of Captain Sir Richard Burton&quot;.

He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery, London, and is the only Lieutenant Governor of Ontario not buried in Canada.

<text>Sir William Pearce Howland, (29 May 1811 – 1 January 1907) served as the second Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, from 1868 to 1873. As a member of the Executive Council of the Province of Canada from November 1864 to 1867, he was one of the Fathers of Confederation who attended the London Conference of 1866.

==Biography==
Born in 1811 in Pawling, New York, William Howland was educated at Kinderhook Academy. In 1830 he settled in Cooksville, Upper Canada, and became a naturalised British subject in 1841. He operated Lambton Mills and later a grocery business in Toronto. In 1852 he acquired a grist mill, sawmill, and general store in Kleinburg, whose operations he left to his brother Henry Stark Howland. In 1857, Howland became a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and later served in the cabinet as Minister of Finance, Receiver General, and Postmaster General. He became a Member of Parliament in 1867 and was Minister of Inland Revenue from 1867 to 1868. He was created a CB in 1867. Howland was appointed Ontario&#x27;s second Lieutenant Governor in 1868 and served until 1873. He was created a KCMG in 1879.

He was knighted in 1879 and died in Toronto in 1907. He is buried in Toronto&#x27;s St. James Cemetery. Toronto in 1907. In 1906, at the request of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada, Howland prepared an autobiography that included extensive appendices about politics in the 1860s.

===Personal life===
On 12 July 1843, Sir William Pearce Howland married Mary Ann (or Marianne) Blyth, the widow of David Webb, a ship&#x27;s captain. Mary Anne and William had three children: William, Oliver and Florence. Their sons, William Holmes Howland and Oliver Aiken Howland, served as mayors of Toronto. Mary died in 1860.

William Pearce Howland, then a Minister of the Crown in Canada married Susannah Julia, daughter of Shrewsbury, Esquire, on 21 November 1865. She was born in London, England, 4, 1 May 1830, and educated there. She was a widow, who had accompanied her first husband (1850) Philip Hunt, of the Military Store Department, to the Mauritius, and thence to Canada.

Mrs. Howland was presented to Queen Victoria in 1866, on the occasion of the London Conference on Confederation. In 1875, she presented her step-daughter, Miss Howland (later Mrs. R. M. Merritt) to Her Majesty. On leaving Government House, Howland was presented with an address from citizens of Toronto, and Lady Howland was given a gold bracelet, with her initials set in diamonds, and containing a locket with miniature portraits of herself and husband. Lady Howland died in Toronto, 21 February 1886, and was buried in St. James&#x27;s Cemetery.

<text>Applied probability is the application of probability theory to statistical problems and other scientific and engineering domains.

==Scope==
Much research involving probability is done under the auspices of applied probability. However, while such research is motivated (to some degree) by applied problems, it is usually the mathematical aspects of the problems that are of most interest to researchers (as is typical of applied mathematics in general).

Applied probabilists are particularly concerned with the application of stochastic processes, and probability more generally, to the natural, applied and social sciences, including biology, physics (including astronomy), chemistry, medicine, computer science and information technology, and economics.

Another area of interest is in engineering: particularly in areas of uncertainty, risk management, probabilistic design, and Quality assurance.

==History==
Having initially been defined at a symposium of the American Mathematical Society in the later 1950s, the term &quot;applied probability&quot; was popularized by Maurice Bartlett through the name of a Methuen monograph series he edited, &quot;Applied Probability and Statistics&quot;. The area did not have an established outlet until 1964, when the Journal of Applied Probability came into existence through the efforts of Joe Gani.

<text>Indeterminate form is a mathematical expression that can obtain any value depending on circumstances. In calculus, it is usually possible to compute the limit of the sum, difference, product, quotient or power of two functions by taking the corresponding combination of the separate limits of each respective function. For example,

formula_1

and likewise for other arithmetic operations; this is sometimes called the algebraic limit theorem. However, certain combinations of particular limiting values cannot be computed in this way, and knowing the limit of each function separately does not suffice to determine the limit of the combination. In these particular situations, the limit is said to take an indeterminate form, described by one of the informal expressions

formula_2

among a wide variety of uncommon others, where each expression stands for the limit of a function constructed by an arithmetical combination of two functions whose limits respectively tend to or as indicated.

A limit taking one of these indeterminate forms might tend to zero, might tend to any finite value, might tend to infinity, or might diverge, depending on the specific functions involved. A limit which unambiguously tends to infinity, for instance formula_3 is not considered indeterminate. The term was originally introduced by Cauchy&#x27;s student Moigno in the middle of the 19th century.

The most common example of an indeterminate form is the quotient of two functions each of which converges to zero. This indeterminate form is denoted by formula_4. For example, as formula_5 approaches formula_6 the ratios formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 go to formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 respectively. In each case, if the limits of the numerator and denominator are substituted, the resulting expression is formula_4, which is indeterminate. In this sense, formula_4 can take on the values formula_12, formula_11, or formula_10, by appropriate choices of functions to put in the numerator and denominator. A pair of functions for which the limit is any particular given value may in fact be found. Even more surprising, perhaps, the quotient of the two functions may in fact diverge, and not merely diverge to infinity. For example, formula_18.

So the fact that two functions formula_19 and formula_20 converge to formula_12 as formula_5 approaches some limit point formula_23 is insufficient to determinate the limit

An expression that arises by ways other than applying the algebraic limit theorem may have the same form of an indeterminate form. However it is not appropriate to call an expression &quot;indeterminate form&quot; if the expression is made outside the context of determining limits.
An example is the expression formula_24. Whether this expression is left undefined, or is defined to equal formula_11, depends on the field of application and may vary between authors. For more, see the article Zero to the power of zero. Note that formula_26 and other expressions involving infinity are not indeterminate forms.

== Some examples and non-examples ==
=== Indeterminate form 0/0 ===
The indeterminate form formula_4 is particularly common in calculus, because it often arises in the evaluation of derivatives using their definition in terms of limit.

As mentioned above,

while
{x} = 0, \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig. 2)}}
This is enough to show that formula_4 is an indeterminate form. Other examples with this indeterminate form include

and

Direct substitution of the number that &quot;formula_5&quot; approaches into any of these expressions shows that these are examples correspond to the indeterminate form formula_4, but these limits can assume many different values. Any desired value formula_31 can be obtained for this indeterminate form as follows:

The value formula_10 can also be obtained (in the sense of divergence to infinity):
===Indeterminate form 00 ===
The following limits illustrate that the expression formula_24 is an indeterminate form:
formula_34

Thus, in general, knowing that formula_35 and formula_36 is not sufficient to evaluate the limit
formula_37

If the functions formula_38 and formula_39 are analytic at formula_23, and formula_38 is positive for formula_5 sufficiently close (but not equal) to formula_23, then the limit of formula_44 will be formula_11. Otherwise, use the transformation in the table below to evaluate the limit.

=== Expressions that are not indeterminate forms ===

The expression formula_46 is not commonly regarded as an indeterminate form, because if the limit of formula_47 exists then there is no ambiguity as to its value, as it always diverges. Specifically, if formula_38 approaches formula_11 and formula_39 approaches formula_6 then formula_38 and formula_39 may be chosen so that:

# formula_47 approaches formula_55
# formula_47 approaches formula_57
# The limit fails to exist.

In each case the absolute value formula_58 approaches formula_55, and so the quotient formula_47 must diverge, in the sense of the extended real numbers (in the framework of the projectively extended real line, the limit is the unsigned infinity formula_10 in all three cases). Similarly, any expression of the form formula_62 with formula_63 (including formula_64 and formula_65) is not an indeterminate form, since a quotient giving rise to such an expression will always diverge.

The expression formula_26 is not an indeterminate form. The expression formula_67 obtained from considering formula_68 gives the limit formula_6 provided that formula_19 remains nonnegative as formula_5 approaches formula_23. The expression formula_73 is similarly equivalent to formula_46; if formula_75 as formula_5 approaches formula_23, the limit comes out as formula_55.

To see why, let formula_79 where formula_80 and formula_81 By taking the natural logarithm of both sides and using formula_82 we get that formula_83 which means that formula_84

== Evaluating indeterminate forms ==

The adjective &quot;indeterminate&quot; does &quot;not&quot; imply that the limit does not exist, as many of the examples above show. In many cases, algebraic elimination, L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule, or other methods can be used to manipulate the expression so that the limit can be evaluated.

===Equivalent infinitesimal===
When two variables formula_85 and formula_86 converge to zero at the same limit point and formula_87, they are called &quot;equivalent infinitesimal&quot; (equiv. formula_88).

Moreover, if variables formula_89 and formula_90 are such that formula_91 and formula_92, then:
Here is a brief proof:

Suppose there are two equivalent infinitesimals formula_91 and formula_92.

formula_95

For the evaluation of the indeterminate form formula_4, one can make use of the following facts about equivalent infinitesimals (e.g., formula_97 if &quot;x&quot; becomes closer to zero):





For example:

formula_98

In the 2nd equality, formula_99 where formula_100 as &quot;y&quot; become closer to 0 is used, and formula_101 where formula_102
|formula_24
|formula_104
|formula_105
|formula_106
|formula_107
|formula_108
|formula_106
|formula_105
|formula_111
|formula_112
|formula_105
|formula_106

<text>The European Social Forum (ESF) was a recurring conference held by members of the alter-globalization movement (also known as the Global Justice Movement). In the first few years after it started in 2002 the conference was held every year, but later it became biannual due to difficulties with finding host countries. The conference was last held in 2010. It aims to allow social movements, trade unions, NGOs, refugees, peace and anti-imperial groups, anti-racist movements, environmental movements, networks of the excluded and community campaigns from Europe and the world to come together and discuss themes linked to major European and global issues, in order to coordinate campaigns, share ideas and refine organizing strategies. It emerged from the World Social Forum and follows its Charter of Principles.

==First ESF==
The first forum was held in Florence in November 2002. The slogan was &quot;Against war, racism and neo-liberalism,&quot; with specific reference to US president George W. Bush&#x27;s plan for regime change in Iraq. The Assembly of Social Movements held directly after the ESF launched a call for a Europe-wide day of action against the incipient Iraq War. The call was echoed by the Assembly of Social Movements held after the World Social Forum a few months later and eventually led to the &quot;largest protest event in human history&quot;, the 15 February Global day of action against the war.

Before its opening the ESF created a large political debate between different Tuscan local personages. The President of the Region, Claudio Martini, although criticised on some points by no-global activists, had been a supporter of the movement since the time of the Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest on one side and the right-wing Italian government on the other. People feared that the ESF could provoke riots and accidents such as those of the Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest, from 18 July to 22 July 2001. Florentine individuals, such as the controversial journalist Oriana Fallaci, intervened in the debate. Fallaci invited the people of Florence to shut up every shop and stay in their houses. She also compared the ESF to the nazi occupation of Florence. Other opponents of the ESF included the political scientist Giovanni Sartori, a liberal critic of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government but an admirer of the United States, and the filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli, whose right-wing political views were already well-known. Another group of intellectuals from various political strands defended the ESF and signed an appeal favourable to the meeting. Among these were the journalist Tiziano Terzani and the organizers of the &quot;professors&#x27; movement&quot; (a group of university professors that had organized both a demonstration and discussion groups against Berlusconi&#x27;s policies).

In fact, the European Social Forum, which occupied the historical Fortezza da Basso and other conference buildings with its 60.000 delegates, did not provoke any incidents. It ended with a huge demonstration against the war, which the organizers claimed included the participation of 1,000,000 people. The debate on peace and pacifism considered the most important debate ion the session, although the program of the Forum included a large spectrum of issues: (immigration, European Union&#x27;s constitution, the Tobin Tax and many others). Gino Strada, president of &quot;Emergency&quot;, the Italian association that helps civil victims of armed conflicts, and a leader of the pacifist movement, was one of the most popular orators. Some large NGOs such as Amnesty International joined the ESF, together with more radical groups such as ATTAC and the left-wing parliamentarians. At the end of the meeting, even pro-globalists such as the then president of the European Commission Romano Prodi showed sympathy for the moderation of the movement and for its pacifist stance.

A network of volunteer translators, Babels, was set up to interpret the event into the various languages of the people attending.

==Second ESF==
The second European Social Forum was held in Paris in November 2003.

Organizers claim that over 50,000 people attended and that around 150,000 marched in the demonstration held on the last day.

In France there has been some criticism of the organization for not being open enough. The participation of the French Socialist Party, the Parti Socialiste, also generated a lot of criticism, because the party was a proponents of market liberalization in the 1990s, but the most prominent group at the event was the Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire.

Some anarchist groups organised a rival event in the city at the same time, while a women&#x27;s forum was held in the days preceding the social forum, in order to counteract the perceived under-representation of women at the first ESF. It is claimed that over 3,000 women attended.

==Third ESF==

The third European Social Forum was held in London, mostly at Alexandra Palace but also with events throughout the Bloomsbury area of London on the 15–17 October 2004.

The organisers claimed that approximately 25,000 people took part in 500 plenaries, seminars, workshops, and cultural events, which were addressed by over 2,500 speakers. Participants came from across the continent and even from beyond the boundaries of European Union.

This forum showed a marked increased in participation from minority groups such as black, Asian, Muslim, and refugee networks. More women were represented on the speaker platforms than in previous forums. The forum also included for the first time a three-day cultural programme organised through open submission through the ESF website.

Well known participants and speakers included Ahmed Ben Bella, the leader of the Algerian resistance to French rule, Dr Aleida Guevara, daughter of Che, George Galloway, a leading figure in the UK anti-war movement, and Dr Mustafa Barghouti from Palestine. Activist writers such as Susan George, John Pilger and George Monbiot were prominent, and Gerry Adams was one of many Irish figures speaking. The Forum opened with a rally in Southwark Cathedral.

Unlike the Paris forum, in London there was initially no money provided to pay for events. Funding eventually came from the Greater London Authority and the Mayor&#x27;s office (Ken Livingstone and his officers, many of whom are in Socialist Action), several Trade Unions such as NATFHE (the college lecturer&#x27;s union), AMICUS (a largely technical and industrial union), the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G) and UNISON (the UK&#x27;s largest public sector union), which provided funds, office space, subsidised tickets for unemployed and asylum seeker attendees and paid for some of the meeting space at Alexandra Palace.

The British Socialist Workers Party, Globalise Resistance, the Tobin Tax Network and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament were central to bringing the event to London.

Other groups, for instance the London Social Forum, felt that the main organizing approach was too top-down and instead set up &quot;horizontally&quot; organised fringe events. These were known as the &#x27;autonomous&#x27; or &#x27;beyond&#x27; ESF events. Participants ranged from non-governmental organisations, to political parties such as the Green Party, to unaligned anarchists and socialists.

The Millennium Dome was turned into a giant hostel for over 5,000 participants to sleep in during the course of the event.

Subhi al Mashadani, the leader of the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions, was due to speak in a meeting on the Iraq war, but never got to speak. He was shouted down by some members of the audience who felt he was collaborating with the occupation and who surged towards the stage when he attempted to address the 2,000 strong audience. The ESF&#x27;s security took no chances and dragged a furious Mashadani from the stage for his own protection. The &quot;End the Occupation&quot; session was stopped, a first in the history of the ESF.

Later in the day an intervention was made by some of those who had been involved with the autonomous spaces during a meeting on anti-fascism. They intended to invade the stage during the speech of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone (who opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003 but is a member of the Labour Party which supported it). In fact, Ken Livingstone had already decided not to speak at the event. His decision has been attributed by the National Assembly Against Racism to threats from anarchists but the intervention went ahead. The SWP&#x27;s Weyman Bennett, a steering member of Unite Against Fascism and chair of the meeting, claimed that he was assaulted by an anarchist. A banner was hung up stating &quot;Ken&#x27;s Party - War Party&quot; and the stage was turned into an open-microphone event with speeches against the &#x27;vertical&#x27; organisation of the ESF, the war in Iraq, and recent attacks on freedom of speech by the FBI (such as taking Indymedia servers down with international articles). After the intervention, the originally planned meeting about anti-fascism went ahead but with a reduced audience. These events echoed the attempts by anarchists to attack French Socialist Party speakers in the Paris forum, an attack that was stopped by security.

The end of the forum saw a massive international demonstration through central London and a rally at Trafalgar Square. However, the Metropolitan Police arrested a number of anarchists on their way to this event. Javier Ruis was arrested at the Rally itself. He subsequently claimed that the West Essex Zapatista were responsible for the threats against Ken Livingstone, claiming that this was an example of Neoist Invisible Theatre. The size of the rally was seen as a sign of its success as an event, though many European critics noted that all of the speakers were British and chosen by the British organisers. Estimations of the numbers present ranged from 70,000 to 100,000 people. Speakers called for an end to war, racism and privatisation. They advocated peace and social justice for Europe.

==Fourth ESF==

The fourth European Social Forum was held in Athens, Greece on 4–7 May 2006. According to the organizers, more than 35,000 registered. The demonstration on 7 May, Saturday afternoon, was announced by the media to have a participation of 80,000 demonstrators, a record in Athens since the anti-war mobilisation on February 15, 2003.

==Fifth ESF==
The fifth European Social Forum was held in Malmö, Sweden on 17–21 September 2008. Approximately 20,000 people were expected to participate in the forum.

==Sixth ESF==
The sixth European Social Forum was held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 1–4 July 2010.
==Criticism==
As a major political event that brings together highly diverse social movements from across Europe, the ESF has been praised and criticized by various actors, both inside and outside the Forum. While outsiders, especially the mainstream media, tend to focus on &quot;scandalous&quot; singular events, groups, or persons and interpret them as representative for the ESF as a whole, insiders have mainly criticized various aspects of the ESF organizing process.

===Criticism in relation to the fifth ESF (Malmö)===
In the demonstration after the European Social Forum 2008 in Malmö, controversial political figures such as Abdullah Öcalan and Fidel Castro were praised by some demonstrators. 300 of the demonstrators were masked, although it was forbidden. Some demonstrators attempted to break a bank window and threw bottles and stones.

The liberal Swedish daily &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; considered it &quot;disgusting&quot; that the ESF 2008 hosted a panel discussion on how ”imperialism and zionism” use list of terrorist organizations to weaken &quot;freedom movements, leftist organizations and solidarity groups&quot; in &quot;Palestina, Basque, Colombia, Greekland, Turkey, Belgium and Denmark&quot;. These lists contain Basquean ETA, Colombian FARC, Kurdish PKK and previously also Palestinian PLO and PLFP. The seminar was organized by Mikael ”micro” Cromsjö, whose blogs host &quot;unholy alliances of right and left extremism&quot;. According to the seminar summary, a secret elite alliance has been pursuing Global Order with a single money, government and army, for hundreds if not thousands of years.

===Criticism in relation to anti-capitalist positions===
According to &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot;, the countries that have permitted &quot;free trade and liberal politics&quot;, &quot;have seen poverty and need decline, in some cases dramatically&quot;. &quot;As the NGOs of rich countries oppose globalization by signs, slogans and stone storms in the name of poor countries, Africans and Asians call for more free trade, capitalism and globalization.&quot; According to a study by the &quot;respected Pew Research Center&quot; of 40,000 people, almost everywhere, particularly in Africa and Asia, a majority of people has a positive attitude on globalization&quot;.

<doc id="366726" wikidata="Q626989" url="?curid=366726" title="The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)">
<text>The Three Doctors is the first serial of the tenth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 30 December 1972 to 20 January 1973.

In the serial, the solar engineer Omega (Stephen Thorne), the creator of the experiments that allowed the Time Lords to travel in time, seeks revenge on the Time Lords after he was left for dead in a universe made of antimatter. The Time Lords recruit the time travellers the First Doctor (William Hartnell), the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton), and the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) for help when Omega drains power throughout the universe, threatening all of existence.

The serial opened the tenth anniversary year of the series, and features the first three Doctors all appearing in the same serial. This makes it the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story in which an earlier incarnation of the Doctor returns to the show. It was also Hartnell&#x27;s last appearance as the First Doctor prior to his death in 1975. 

==Plot==
A superluminal signal is sent to Earth, carrying with it an energy blob that seems intent on capturing the Doctor, but has already mysteriously abducted two individuals; a local game warden, and scientific researcher Dr. Tyler. The homeworld of the Time Lords is also under siege; they are trapped themselves, with universal energy being drained through a black hole, threatening to unravel the fabric of time and space. Desperate to send help, the Time Lords break the First Law of Time by recruiting a previous incarnation of the Doctor from his own past. As the Second Doctor and the present Third Doctor cannot cope with each other&#x27;s personalities, the Time Lords attempt to retrieve the First Doctor to &quot;keep them in order&quot;, but he is trapped in a &quot;time eddy&quot;, unable to fully materialise, communicating through a viewscreen. The Doctors investigate, while UNIT headquarters faces an attack by shapeless lumpy-globule-like creatures. The First Doctor assists both Doctors by correctly surmising that the previously-sent energy blob is a bridge to another universe. The Third Doctor attempts to go alone, but Jo is abruptly abducted with him. The Second Doctor later allows the TARDIS with himself, the Brigadier, and Benton inside, to be taken by the blob, although this causes UNIT HQ to be stolen as well. 

Jo, the Third Doctor, and Dr. Tyler, whom they discover there, assess their situation in this new mystery universe of antimatter, inside the black hole. The Third Doctor also deduces that a conversion has taken place for their assailants and themselves to somehow exist in each other&#x27;s universes without annihilation. Before they can do any more, though, they are accosted by the shapeless creatures and taken to an unfamiliar location. When they arrive, they meet the legendary Time Lord Omega, who created the supernova method that powers Time Lord civilisation, but which also supposedly killed him. Omega seeks revenge on the Time Lords, whom he assumes left him stranded alone for centuries in his universe, of which he explains that he willed into existence. Assuming he has been deceived once again by the Time Lords after discovering the Second Doctor and correctly deducing his identity, Omega imprisons both Doctors, Jo, Benton, and Tyler. After the two Doctors help everyone escape through both of their own willpowers, Omega discovers the getaway, and challenges the Third Doctor to a battle of minds, nearly killing him.

The Second Doctor convinces Omega to stop, appealing to his desire to escape. Now calmer, Omega explains further to the two that he shaped this reality within the black hole both with his willpower and the power of its singularity. However, due to this, his will is the only support keeping this reality stable. He cannot freely leave without releasing control, but releasing control would collapse the antimatter universe instantly, annihilating everything in it; and so Omega&#x27;s intention is for the Doctors to take his place maintaining it. As he prepares to leave with the Doctors&#x27; help, they are stunned to find that the extremely prolonged exposure to the singularity has destroyed Omega&#x27;s physical body; his willpower now also maintains his essence, and he will cease to exist if he leaves. Suffering a nervous breakdown from the shock, Omega now seeks to destroy all creation.

Taking advantage of his neurosis, the two Doctors escape back to the TARDIS with all of the abductees. With the First Doctor, the two devise a way to defeat Omega, and also discover the Second Doctor&#x27;s previously-lost recorder within the TARDIS&#x27; force field generator. The two meet with Omega again, claiming they can give him his freedom. Omega, though, retorts that he cannot be freed, and demands that they share his exile. The Doctors agree, on the condition that all of his abductees are sent safely back to Earth. Once done, the two present him with the generator. Omega knocks it over in rage at the paltry offer and the recorder falls out, annihilating everything it meets in the antimatter universe in a flash (having fallen into the force field during the abduction, it was protected from conversion, remaining as normal matter), creating a new universal source of energy, and ejecting the Doctors in the TARDIS, UNIT HQ, and all of its stolen structures and objects, back to their proper places in the normal universe. With the Time Lords&#x27; power restored, they return the First and Second Doctors to their respective time periods. 

Forlorn, the Third Doctor implies to Jo that death was the only freedom anyone could offer Omega. Out of forgiveness, the Time Lords then send the Doctor a new dematerialisation circuit for the TARDIS and restore his knowledge of how to travel through space and time, lifting his exile.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. The script was originally supposed to feature all three Doctors equally, but William Hartnell was too ill to be able to play the full role as envisioned. He was, therefore, reduced to a pre-recorded cameo role, appearing only on the TARDIS&#x27;s scanner and the space-time viewer of the Time Lords. It would be the last time he played the Doctor and his last acting role before his death in 1975. Hartnell&#x27;s scenes were filmed at BBC&#x27;s Ealing Studios. 

The only time that all three Doctors appeared together was in promotional photos for the story. One session of these took place in October 1972 at a photo studio in Battersea - this produced the image that was used for the cover of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine to promote the story.

The production team also planned for Frazer Hines to reprise his role of Jamie McCrimmon alongside the Second Doctor; however, Hines was not available, due to his work on the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;. Much of the role originally intended for Jamie was reassigned to Sergeant Benton.

===Casting notes===
The Chancellor is portrayed by Clyde Pollitt, who had also played one of the Time Lords who tried and exiled the Second Doctor. Barry Letts states in the DVD commentary that this was intentional, as he meant for this to be the same character. Similarly, Graham Leaman reappears as a Time Lord, having been seen in the same role in &quot;Colony in Space&quot; (1971) discussing the Master&#x27;s activities and the Time Lords&#x27; use of the exiled Doctor as an agent. The same DVD commentary and the on-screen production captions note that the unavailability of actor Richard Franklin led to a shifting of the roles by the UNIT supporting cast. Sergeant Benton took on the majority of the role written for Captain Yates and a new character, Corporal Palmer, took on most of the lines originally written for Benton.

==Reception==

Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; &quot;may not be the greatest story ever told&quot; but it ended the Doctor&#x27;s exile on Earth and brought back Troughton, though unfortunately Hartnell was not able to do much. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn summarised that the serial &quot;has some good ideas in it, but they&#x27;re treated with such an unambitious lack of imagination that there&#x27;s not enough actually happening here for the story to be offensively bad—just boring&quot;. He felt the &quot;most enjoyable part&quot; was the &quot;comic squabbling&quot; between Pertwee and Troughton, and also called the Brigadier a &quot;saving grace&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Ian Jane gave the serial three out of five stars, noting that it was &quot;slightly silly&quot; and the production designs and special effects were &quot;definitely not the best that the series has had to offer&quot;. He also felt that the story was wrapped up too quickly and was &quot;fairly predictable&quot;. However, he praised Pertwee and Troughton&#x27;s interplay, the fact that Jo was given more to do, and Stephen Thorne&#x27;s performance as Omega. Alisdair Wilkins of io9 picked &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; as the worst &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story of the classic series, feeling that the Second Doctor and the Brigadier were written as too comical, the story had too much padding, and that Omega was a &quot;shouting, one-dimensional villain&quot;.

===Broadcast===

The serial was repeated on BBC2 in November 1981, daily (Monday–Thursday) (23 November 1981 to 26 November 1981) at 17:40 as part of &quot;The Five Faces of Doctor Who&quot;. The four episodes achieved ratings of 5.0, 4.5, 5.7 and 5.8 million viewers respectively.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1975.

The novelisation provides a rationale for Omega&#x27;s realm to be a quarry: Over the millennia, Omega has become weary of the mental effort required to generate a verdant landscape and now makes do with rock and soil. The Second Doctor is referred to throughout as Doctor Two. In the book, Mr Ollis is renamed Mr Hollis. It is stated that Omega is only the second Time Lord that the Doctor has come up against as an adversary, the first being The Master.

===Home media===
&quot;The Three Doctors&quot; was released twice on VHS, first in August 1991 and thereafter remastered and re-released in 2002 as part of the WHSmith&#x27;s &quot;The Time Lord Collection&quot; boxed set. It was released on DVD in the UK in November 2003 as part of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 40th Anniversary Celebration releases, representing the Jon Pertwee years. Some copies came in a box set housing a limited edition Corgi model of &quot;Bessie&quot;, the Third Doctor&#x27;s vintage roadster. A special edition of the DVD, with new bonus features, was released in the UK on 13 February 2012 in the third of the ongoing &quot;Revisitations&quot; DVD box sets with additional bonus features.
In 2019, &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; was released as part of the Season Ten Boxed Set Blu-Ray collection. The story and its special features occupy one disc in the set, and include features from previous releases and specially-made content.

===&quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;===
A special edition of the episode aired on BBC iPlayer on 1 November 2023, in the spin-off &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

<text>OpenGL++ was a graphics library written in C++ that supported object-oriented data structures on top of the OpenGL 3D graphics system. The project started as the result of a partnership between SGI, IBM and Intel, and later, Digital Equipment Corporation. It was intended to provide a higher level API than the &quot;bare metal&quot; support of OpenGL, as well as being an implementation for Java3D. Work on OpenGL++ ended when SGI decided to partner with Microsoft instead, leading to the Fahrenheit project, which also died.

==Background==
The vast majority of applications using 3D systems describe the objects in their &quot;world&quot; in a data structure known as a scene graph. A scene graph is normally organized as some sort of a tree data structure, with the nodes representing objects, and the edges their relationship to other objects in the world. For instance, a table might be represented by a single &quot;table&quot; object with several edges connecting its parts together, the table top, legs, etc.

Key to high performance in 3D applications is deciding what objects in the world are actually visible given the current camera position and direction. For instance, objects behind the camera do not have to be drawn. Quick traversal of the scene graph is essential to making this &quot;culling&quot; operation occur quickly.

Scene graphs were generally left to the developer to implement, and it was all too common to see poor examples that led to poor performance. SGI had worked on a number of projects that were intended to help the developer produce a high-quality scene graph, but none of these had become widely used for a variety of reasons. Open Inventor was one such example, and was intended to simplify building the scene graph, but the results were not necessarily very high performance. OpenGL Performer was a similar project that was intended to produce high-speed scenes and support very large numbers of objects in the &quot;world&quot;, but was not particularly easy to use.

==Cosmo3D==
The Inventor and Performer teams had already realized that there was no particular reason the two systems could not be combined into one, offering both ease-of-development and high-performance. This led to the Cosmo3D system, basically, a standardized high-performance scene graph that sat on top of OpenGL. Cosmo3D introduced a new file format that could be used to store entire scenes and all the data needed to reconstruct them, the VRML format that is still in use.

SGI produced a number of products that used Cosmo3D. Among these were a variety of VRML tools, and a large model visualization system for CAD purposes called OpenGL Optimizer. Oddly, Cosmo Code, a VRML authoring tool, was produced by a different division and did not use the Cosmo scene graph at all.

Cosmo&#x27;s scene graph was by no means a unique solution at the time, and a number of other graphics companies were working on similar ideas at about this time.

==OpenGL++==
At the 20–21 August 1996 meeting of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB), SGI floated the idea of a new standardized scene graph similar to Cosmo3D but with the express intent of being based on &quot;standard&quot; OpenGL. There was some interest in the concept, so at the 9–10 December 1996 meeting the group presented the first draft of the OpenGL++ concept. A follow-up meeting during 17–19 February 1997 demonstrated that there was considerable interest from most parties, with the exception of Microsoft and Sun, although there were concerns as to whether or not the ARB was the right body to support such an effort without diluting their primary job of supporting OpenGL. Development continued throughout 1997 including several distributions of the API. However, the ARB notes &quot;There&#x27;s been lots of work, but relatively little communication.&quot;

While the work on OpenGL++ continued, Sun and SGI had also been working on a 3D standard suitable for Java. These efforts eventually broke down, and Sun went on to release Java3D. SGI suggested their Cosmo work was a sample Java3D implementation, and as this work evolved into OpenGL++ these plans moved with it. During the definition of OpenGL++, Sun stated that they were not interested in working on the effort as they were focussed on their Java3D work. Comparatively, Java3D spans two layers of the 3D stack, the scene graph and the visual interface and its widgets.

By late 1997 SGI appeared to be fully committed to the OGL++ effort. They had stated that the existing Cosmo work would be abandoned and that Open Inventor, Performer and OpenGL Optimizer would be re-written to be hosted on top of OGL++. As OGL++ was intended to be a cleaned up and more flexible version of Cosmo3D, most of the Cosmo3D team started work on OGL++ and a lot of the effort was aimed at a specification and implementation that could deliver on the promise of a truly powerful yet generic scene graph.

==At the end==
At the March 1998 ARB meeting, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, SGI presented Fahrenheit, an entirely new project. The ARB notes from that meeting note &quot;SGI felt it was critical to work together with Microsoft, which had not been moving in compatible directions, to be able to build value-added products in the Windows environment. Fahrenheit is a large step in that direction.&quot; OpenGL++ was abandoned.

The project appears to have been a victim of SGI&#x27;s shifting priorities through this period, changing directions in order to partner with larger companies. When these companies exited the 3D space to focus on other product niches, SGI was left as the only supporter of the project, exactly what they were trying to avoid. Eventually, the only other company with a 3D focus was Microsoft, and the Fahrenheit project started and ended shortly after the OpenGL++ efforts.

Today, no such standardized scene graph exists, and SGI has all but exited the API world. SGI has released the earlier Open Inventor code into open source, but the source to OGL++ was never completed to any satisfactory degree. No finalized specification exists and, as with OpenGL, the spec and idea behind such an open platform would have been what lent it its lasting value, not a single implementation of a scene graph idea.

<text>HMS &quot;Nottingham&quot; was a batch two Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy, named after the city of Nottingham, England. She was launched on 18 February 1980, and commissioned on 8 April 1983 as the sixth warship to bear the name.

Her commanding officer at commissioning was Commander Nigel Essenhigh (in his first major command role) who went on to become First Sea Lord.

On her first cruise to Oporto, Portugal and then Gibraltar the destroyer lost two sailors to a drowning incident while on shore leave visiting a beach in Oporto.

In November 2000, &quot;Nottingham&quot; completed a major refit, which was intended to extend her operational life to 2012, although she was later placed in reserve and decommissioned on 11 February 2010.

== Service history ==
===2002 grounding===

On 7 July 2002, &quot;Nottingham&quot; ran aground on the submerged but well-charted Wolf Rock near Lord Howe Island, off the coast of Australia causing £26 million worth of damage. A hole was torn down the side of the vessel from bow to bridge, flooding five of her compartments and nearly causing her to sink. HMNZS &quot;Te Mana&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Endeavour&quot; provided relief for the crew for approximately 2–3 weeks.

The accident happened in poor weather after a set of manoeuvres to allow a sailor with an emergency medical condition to be evacuated to Lord Howe Island. The captain, Commander Richard Farrington, had been ashore having dinner with the island&#x27;s marine services manager thanking him for the assistance rendered to his crewman. Farrington had just returned and at the time of the incident the Executive Officer (XO), Lt Commander John Lea, was in-charge of the vessel. &quot;Nottingham&quot; ran aground on Wolf Rock owing to a navigational error and the vessel immediately went into damage control mode. Commander Farrington returned to the bridge whereby he took command and controlled the breached compartments.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) salvage department (SALMO) was contacted and assisted with logistics through local marine expert Graeme Mackenzie. The SALMO team, assisted by &quot;Nottingham&#x27;s&quot; crew, stabilized her at sea making her ready for the journey into Newcastle.

On 6 August, &quot;Nottingham&quot; set out on her journey to the port of Newcastle, north of Sydney, towed stern-first because of the damage to her bow. In Newcastle, her Sea Dart missiles were removed and further repairs were carried out. Royal Navy personnel, Operations Manager Mr Graeme Mackenzie, RN Commander Anthony Holberry and SALMO Mr James Ward took charge of the shore-side recovery programme without incident.

It was not clear whether it was economic to repair her, but &quot;Nottingham&quot; had recently undergone major modifications to her radar and other electronics, and it was determined that it would be less expensive to return her to the UK and repair her than to bring another Type 42 destroyer up to her new specification.

After arriving in Sydney on 15 October, the damaged ship was lifted on board the heavy lifting vessel and welded to her deck for transport. On 28 October, &quot;Nottingham&quot; left Sydney harbour on board MV &quot;Swan&quot; for the journey back to the UK. By 9 December, she had arrived at Portsmouth Harbour for repairs at Fleet Support Limited. The destroyer was temporarily reactivated to cover for &quot;Nottingham&quot; while she was being repaired.

On 7 July 2003, the anniversary of the collision, &quot;Nottingham&quot; was refloated. In April 2004 she sailed again following the £39m repair and refit. The ship returned to duty in July 2004.

On 23 August 2004, &quot;Nottingham&quot; met , a of the South African Navy at the site where the troopship was sunk during the First World War. The crew laid wreaths in remembrance to those who died in service for their country.

==Disposal==
In April 2008, she was placed in a state of &quot;extended readiness&quot; at Portsmouth. With her crew dispersed, she did not sail again before being decommissioned on 11 February 2010. She was put up for auction on 28 March 2011, which resulted in her sale for scrap to Leyal Ship Recycling. She was towed out of Portsmouth en route to Turkey on 19 October 2011.

<doc id="366732" wikidata="Q1552100" url="?curid=366732" title="Kanjut Sar">
<text>Kanjut Sar (), or Kunjudh Sar as pronounced in Wakhi, is a mountain located between Shimshal Valley, and Hisper valley part of the Karakoram mountain range. The name &quot;Kunjudh Sar&quot; in Wakhi means &quot;that which overlooks Kunjudh&quot;, or &quot;above Kunjudh&quot;, while Khujudh is the Wakhi name for Central Hunza. It is the 28th-highest mountain in the world. According to many residents of Shimshal, Kanjut Sar is the name of the adjacent peak Yukshin Gardan Sar, and vice versa. In Shimshal village, the original namings are widely accepted and used, as opposed to what is recognised internationally.

Kanjut Sar consists of two peaks:
* Kanjut Sar I at .
* Kanjut Sar II, to the southeast of I, at .

Kanjut Sar I was first climbed in 1959 by Camillo Pellissier, member of an Italian expedition directed by Guido Monzino. Between 4 and 6 August 1981, seven Japanese climbers of the same expedition climbed to the top. In 2010, a Russian–American expedition attempted to climb on the Eastern Ridge of Kanjut Sar and reached 7450 m, but turned back in bad weather.

The first ascent of Kanjut Sar II was achieved by a Swiss team in 1985. Expedition leader Toni Spirig, Ueli Stahel and Richie Ott finally carried it out in alpine style after several attempts . The climbers reached the summit on July 10. The ascent route led over the north-west side.

On July 29, 1990, a Dutch expedition made the second ascent of Kanjut Sar II in alpine style via the south face. Expedition members were Peter Kok, Frank Schmidt, Franck van den Barselaer, Hendrik Freie and Pieter de Kam.

<text>Dimensions in Time is a charity special crossover between the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the soap opera &quot;EastEnders.&quot; The special was broadcast in two parts on 26 and 27 November 1993 and was filmed on location at Greenwich and the &quot;EastEnders&quot; Albert Square set. 

&quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; featured all of the surviving actors to have played the Doctor as well as many of the character&#x27;s companions and several of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; stars of the time. The special was produced for &quot;Children in Need&quot; following &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s cancellation in 1989 and was the only original story broadcast in celebration of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Plot==

The Rani has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor&#x27;s timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor&#x27;s lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her plan is to capture all of the Doctor&#x27;s selves in a time loop, trapping him in the East End of London; she has already captured the First and Second Doctors. This causes the Fourth Doctor to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani&#x27;s plan:

The Seventh Doctor and Ace are confused when the TARDIS lands in Greenwich, near the Cutty Sark, thanks to the Rani&#x27;s attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in Albert Square in 1993 with the Sixth Doctor. Local resident Sanjay tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife Gita tells the Sixth Doctor that the clothing is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.

The Third Doctor and Mel Bush appear from the time jump, and question an older Pauline Fowler and Kathy Beale on &quot;when&quot; they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of John F. Kennedy, while Kathy tells off a young Ian Beale. The Sixth Doctor and Susan Foreman appear, but she wonders what has happened to the First Doctor and her other companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright.

After another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into Sarah Jane Smith and after chatting to Sharon Watts she meets up with the Doctor who changed from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani releases her menagerie of specimens, including a Cyberman, Fifi, a Sea Devil, an Ogron and a Time Lord from Gallifrey in the next time jump. In 1993, the Fifth Doctor, Nyssa and Peri are attacked by the Rani&#x27;s menagerie, and after trying to warn Pat Butcher of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the Queen Vic.

In 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changes to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, along with Nyssa and Peri changing into Liz Shaw, the Rani takes control of Liz&#x27;s mind. As Mandy Salter tries to stop the Rani, Captain Mike Yates of UNIT arrives in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and take him to the Brigadier who is waiting for them.

After another time jump, the Doctor changes to the Sixth Doctor and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again. In 1993, at the Arches, Phil and Grant Mitchell find Romana looking for the Doctor, but they point her to Dr Legg. As Romana walks past the Queen Vic, the Rani captures her in front of Frank Butcher.

Back in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to Victoria who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.

After the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, Leela escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional Time Lord brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and K9 the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors&#x27; other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes &quot;Certainly, I – I mean, we – are difficult to get rid of.&quot;

===Cast notes===
*This was the final official appearance of Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor; Pertwee died three years later. 
*Tom Baker returned to the role of the Fourth Doctor on television for the first time since leaving 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete &quot;Shada&quot; the year before. Baker would later return to the series in 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; in which he appears as &quot;The Curator&quot;.
*This special marks the first time that Peter Davison returned as the Fifth Doctor. He would later reprise the role in the 2007 mini-episode broadcast for Children in Need, &quot;Time Crash&quot;, alongside his future son-in-law David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor; in 2022 as a &quot;Guardian of the Edge&quot; in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;; and in 2023 in &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; alongside Janet Fielding as Tegan.
*This was the final appearance of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor until 2022, when he appeared as a “Guardian of the Edge” to the Thirteenth Doctor alongside the First, Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Doctors, and in 2023 in &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; alongside Nicola Bryant as Peri Brown. 
*This is the last appearance on television of Caroline John as Liz Shaw (John died in 2012) and Deborah Watling as Victoria Waterfield (Watling died in 2017).
*In February 1993, Sophie Aldred had guest-starred in a two-episode arc on &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Suzi. She appears in &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; as Ace, her character from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the final companion of the classic era. The character would not appear on television again until 2022 in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; as the Thirteenth Doctor&#x27;s companion alongside former companion Tegan, although Ace would appear in a YouTube video on the official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; YouTube channel made to promote the Blu-ray re-release of Season 26. Aldred later reprised her role as Ace in Tales of the TARDIS in 2023 alongside Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor.
*This marked the only time that the Brigadier appeared with the Sixth Doctor on-screen; they also met in the Big Finish audio drama &quot;The Spectre of Lanyon Moor&quot;.
*This marks the most recent on-screen appearances of Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman, Sarah Sutton as Nyssa, Lalla Ward as Romana and Louise Jameson as Leela.
*This marked the final appearance of Kate O&#x27;Mara as The Rani. O&#x27;Mara died in 2014.
*Samuel West would later play the renegade Time Lord &quot;Morbius&quot; in the Big Finish audio drama &quot;The Vengeance of Morbius&quot;
*&quot;The Dimensions of Time&quot; and &quot;3-Dimensions of Time&quot; were the working titles for this story. David Roden convinced producer John Nathan-Turner not to use either title, and instead settled on &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. 
*This was David Roden&#x27;s first professional script. Roden&#x27;s original draft featured the Seventh Doctor meeting the Brigadier on route to a UNIT reunion – and becoming involved in a battle with a crashed spacecraft full of Cybermen. The script was entitled &quot;Destination: Holocaust&quot;, and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier trapped in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a crossover with &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.
* Allegedly, Anthony Ainley was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing. Michael Gough was later approached to reprise the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O&#x27;Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani – a request to which she agreed. O&#x27;Mara was joined by Samuel West, who played her companion Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir Ian McKellen).
*The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the Pulfrich effect. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.
*The Daleks were supposed to appear, but the segment was scrapped after a disagreement with Dalek creator Terry Nation over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen Peter Davison facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.
*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; would never be repeated or sold on home video for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will be released on DVD or appear as an extra on home video.

==Broadcast==
* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 Children in Need telethon. It was introduced by Noel Edmonds in a short live sketch with Jon Pertwee, in character as the Third Doctor.
* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which &quot;EastEnders&quot; character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring Mandy and the non-speaking character Sylvia Weng-Chung and the other featuring Big Ron. The £101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.
* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; has received almost universally negative reviews and is often highlighted as a particular low point of the Wilderness Years: the period between &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s&quot; 1989 cancellation and the 2005 revival. Criticism has been aimed towards the gimmicky nature of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; crossover and the 3D effects; Tom Baker&#x27;s limited involvement; the low-budget nature of the overall production; and the special&#x27;s confusing relationship with the show&#x27;s main continuity. &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; holds an average fan rating of 4.3/10 on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ratings aggregator TheTimeScales.com. Licensed reference book &quot;Doctor Who The Handbook: The Second Doctor&quot; gave the special a 0/10 and referred to it as &quot;&quot;a dreadful travesty of a Doctor Who story&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; has been likened to the similarly-maligned &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, due to both productions being low-budget TV specials with questionable canonicity in relation to their main series, and due to similar perceptions of overall extremely poor quality.

==Ratings==
&quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of &quot;City of Death&quot;, at 16.1 million viewers.

<text>Haramosh Peak (), also known as Haramosh or Peak 58, is a Karakoram range mountain located in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. The 7,409-meter Haramosh Peak is situated roughly 65 kilometers (40 miles) to the east of Gilgit, within the south-central part of the Rakaposhi-Haramosh Mountains, which is a subrange of the Karakoram range. This mountain rises steeply above the north bank of the Indus River, just upstream from its confluence with the Gilgit River.

The Haramosh massif consists of two main summits: Haramosh Peak and Haramosh Kutwal Laila Peak. The Haramosh Peak was first successfully climbed in 1958 by an Austrian team comprising Heini Roiss, Stephan Pauer, and Dr. Franz Mandl.

==Climbing history==
Haramosh was first reconnoitered in 1947 when a Swiss team explored the area. Subsequently, in 1955, a German team investigated a potential northeastern route to the mountain. However, it was in 1957 that Haramosh became the site of an ill-fated expedition. A team from Oxford University, consisting of Tony Streather, John Emery, Bernard Jillot, and Rae Culbert, attempted to conquer the peak but faced a series of mishaps and misfortunes during their ascent. This expedition led to the loss of Bernard Jillot and Rae Culbert&#x27;s lives, while Tony Streather and John Emery survived. Emery, however, endured severe frostbite and lost all of his fingers and toes as a result of the ordeal.
The epic tale of this expedition is told in Ralph Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Last Blue Mountain&quot;.

Haramosh was first climbed on 4 August 1958 by three Austrian mountaineers: Heinrich Roiss, Stefan Pauer and Franz Mandl, via the Haramosh La (a saddle to the northeast) and the East Ridge, roughly the route of the 1957 tragedy.

According to the Himalayan Index, there have been only three more ascents, in 1978 (Japanese, West Ridge), 1979 (unknown party/route), and 1988 (Polish, Southwest Face).

<doc id="366737" wikidata="Q66316" url="?curid=366737" title="Bassam Tibi">
<text>Bassam Tibi (), is a Syrian-born German political scientist and professor of international relations specializing in Islamic studies and Middle Eastern studies. He was born in 1944 in Damascus, Syria to an aristocratic family, and moved to West Germany in 1962, where he later became a naturalized citizen in 1976.

He is known for his analysis of international relations and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization. Tibi is known for introducing the controversial concept of European &quot;Leitkultur&quot;, as well as the concept of &quot;Euroislam&quot; to discussions about integration of Muslim immigrants in European countries. Tibi has done research in Asian and African countries. He publishes in English, German, and Arabic.

== Academic career ==
He studied in Frankfurt am Main under Max Horkheimer, obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1971, and later habilitated in Hamburg, Germany. From 1973 until his retirement in 2009, he was Professor for International Relations at Göttingen University. Parallel to this appointment he was, from 1982 to 2000, at Harvard University in a variety of affiliations, the latest being a 1998 to 2000 stint as The Bosch Fellow. Currently, he is an A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. Tibi had eighteen visiting professorships in all continents including fellowships in Princeton University, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and most recently (2010) at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, Washington D.C. Tibi was also a visiting senior fellow at Yale University. After his retirement in 2009, he published &quot;Islam&#x27;s Predicament with Modernity&quot;, a book embodying his life&#x27;s work.

==Views==
Bassam Tibi&#x27;s views can be accurately stated by a quote from the German distinguished Professor Walter Reese-Schäfer. This scholar writes on Tibi &quot;Unlike other authors Bassam Tibi bases his views as a scholarly observer on his participation in the matter he deals with&quot;, that is he writes as an insider. The views of Bassam Tibi can be best referred to by quoting from his twelve books written and published in English. In his book on Arab Spring &quot;The Shari&#x27;a State&quot; (2013) he enlists himself among the other Muslims identified as &quot;enlightened Arab thinkers who are clear about the need for the introduction of democracy into the Arab world&quot;. Thus, Bassam Tibi subscribes to the &quot;enlightened Muslim thought&quot;. This is a contemporary school of thought in Islamic civilization. In another book on &quot;Islamism and Islam&quot; published by Yale University Press (2010) Bassam Tibi discards the Islamist rejection of democracy (chapter 4) and concludes in the final chapter 9 with a commitment to &quot;civil Islam as an alternative to Islamism&quot;.

===On Islam===
Tibi is a Muslim, but criticizes Islamism and advocates &quot;reforming&quot; Islam. Tibi also suggests that Muslim immigrants should refrain from engaging in religious missionary activities, &quot;Dawa&quot;.

===On Europe===
When it comes to Europe, Tibi distinguishes positive and negative elements of European culture. The positive ones are, according to Tibi, enlightenment, pluralism, civil rights and secularization. Tibi argues that there is a need for Europe to defend these values, especially in times of globalization and migration from Muslim countries. On the other hand, Tibi argues that racism is a European invention, and that Europeans must overcome what he calls &quot;Euro-arrogance&quot; and xenophobia to integrate immigrants.

He criticizes European imperialism, arguing that it disrupted and deformed other cultures. Acknowledging that Muslim conquerors also did wrongs, Tibi argues that, unlike the European conquests, Muslim conquests were not driven by any kind of racism.

=== On Germany ===
He has criticised the left-green dominated German media for stifling debate about Islam in Germany, leading to ordinary people being afraid to state their opinions. As an example he gives Uwe Tellkamp, who expressed criticism against the German policy of migration and was attacked in mainstream media and painted as a right-extremist. He has also criticised authorities in Germany for not standing up to the large organised Islamic community organisations like the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs and for not supporting liberal Muslims like Seyran Ateş and Necla Kelek.

===On Israel===
Bassam Tibi has criticized the Likud party of Israel as blocking the peace process. He states that in the 1990s, the Likud adopted the &quot;Three Nos&quot; policy:
&quot;No to the Palestinian State, no to dividing Jerusalem, no to returning Golan Heights to Syria.

According to Tibi, the Likud government of 1996 engaged in provoking Arabs by constructing Har Homa in Arab Jerusalem, and digging a tunnel under the Temple Mount, and thereby exposing Israel to terrorism.

== Awards ==

In 1995 he was decorated by the President of Germany, Roman Herzog, with the Bundesverdienstkreuz, cross of merits first class. In 2003, the Swiss Foundation for European Awareness granted him in Zurich with the annual prize.

<text>Joseph Buford Cox (1905 – August 10, 2002), was an American inventor and businessman. He invented what is now known as the chipper type chain for chain saws. He based his design on the C-shaped jaws of the larva of the timberman beetle. Cox watched the destructive larvae of the timber beetle (Ergates spiculatus) for many hours. The beetle&#x27;s cutting action was left and right, side to side, rather than scratching or burrowing straight ahead. Cox adapted this concept to a new chain saw of his own design put into production during the late 1940s.

Joseph and his wife, Alice, founded &quot;The Oregon Saw Chain Co.&quot; in 1947. Cox later started a small casting company called OMARK, now known as &quot;Omark Industries&quot;. In time, Oregon Saw Chain became a subsidiary of Omark Industries which was in turn acquired in 1985 by Blount, Inc., of Montgomery, Alabama. Blount merged in 1999 with Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners and became known as Blount International, Inc. Today the company is known as Oregon Tool, Inc. Most chainsaws, with the exception of some Stihl saws, use an Oregon chain based on the invention of Joseph Buford Cox.

Joseph Buford Cox only reached the fifth grade in his formal education.

They had no children. Alice Erikson Cox left her fortune to be used by the Willmar Community Area Foundation on behalf of the people of Kandyohi County and Lake Lillian in central Minnesota.

<doc id="366741" wikidata="Q782496" url="?curid=366741" title="Distaghil Sar">
<text>Disteghil Sar or Distaghil Sar () is the highest mountain in the Baltin Bar Nallah Shishkat Hunza, part of the Karakoram mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the 19th-highest mountain on Earth, the 7th-highest in Pakistan, and the first of the high peaks after Shishapangma to be the tallest independent summit of its own subrange. &quot;Disteghil sar&quot; is a Wakhi language word suggested by the Wakhi people of meaning &quot;above the inner ranch.&quot; The mountain has a top ridge above 7,400 meters elevation, with three distinct summits: Northwest, 7,885 m; Central, 7,760 m; and Southeast, 7,696m or 7,535m.

==Climbing history==
The first attempt to climb Distaghil Sar was made in 1957 by an English expedition led by Alf Gregory. That team attempted to climb the mountain from the south and the west, they reached but were defeated by bad weather. Unfavourable weather also foiled a 1959 Swiss attempt over the southeast ridge led by Raymond Lambert.

The first successful ascent was made in 1960 by Günther Stärker and who were part of an Austrian expedition led by Wolfgang Stefan. The expedition climbed the western part of the south face and continued over the southwest ridge to reach the highest summit on 9th June.

The eastern summit is independent of the main, western, summit and about 100m lower; it was first climbed over the east face in 1980 by a Polish expedition which included Tadeusz Piotrowski. All participants of the expedition reached the summit. It was reascended in 1983.

It was more than 20 years before a second successful ascent of the highest, western summit. The Himalayan Index lists another ascent of the peak in 1980 and a Spanish team made an ascent in 1982 by following a route close to the one taken in 1960. 

Two attempts over the daunting north face, in 1988 and 1998, were unsuccessful. 

An attempt on the north ridge in 2008 was abandoned soon after the party arrived because dramatic changes to the terrain, which had occurred over the previous ten years or so, had resulted in conditions becoming extremely dangerous.

<doc id="366757" wikidata="Q381025" url="?curid=366757" title="Hokuriku region">
<text>The is located in the northwestern part of Honshu, the main island of Japan. It lies along the Sea of Japan and is part of the larger Chūbu region. It is almost equivalent to the former Koshi Province and Hokurikudō area in pre-modern Japan.

From the Heian period until the Edo period, the region was a core recipient of population, and grew to be proportionately much larger than it is today, despite the rural character; in modern times, its population has remained consistent, with most urban growth in the 20th century instead taking place in Kanto, Chūkyō, and Kansai. The Hokuriku region is also known for traditional culture that originated from elsewhere that has been long lost along the Taiheiyō Belt.

The Hokuriku region includes the four prefectures of Ishikawa, Fukui, Niigata and Toyama, although Niigata is sometimes included as an addition rather than being one of the core prefectures. It is similar to the following region definitions:

* : includes both the Hokuriku and Shin&#x27;etsu regions
* : includes Niigata, Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures
* : includes Niigata and Nagano prefectures

==Major cities==
The major population centers of Hokuriku are:

*Jōetsu, Nagaoka (special cities)
*Kanazawa, Toyama, Fukui (core cities)
*Niigata (designated city)
Of these, Niigata is the largest with a population of over 800,000.
==Industries==
The main industries in the Hokuriku area include chemicals, medicine, tourism, textiles and textile machinery, heavy machinery, farming, and fishing. Koshihikari, a popular variety of rice is a special product of Hokuriku subregion.

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, Hokuriku subregion has had negative population growth since year 2000.

==Climate==
The Hokuriku region has the highest volume of snowfall of any inhabited and arable region in the world. This is because dry Siberian air masses, which develop high humidity over the Sea of Japan, are forced upwards when they encounter the mountains of Honshū, causing the humidity to condense as snow.

The long winters and deep snow of this region are depicted in &quot;Hokuetsu Seppu&quot;, an encyclopedic work of the late Edo period which describes life in the Uonuma district of Niigata Prefecture.

The Hokuriku region is also the setting for Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Country&quot;.

==Tourism==
In 2014 the Hokuriku region was listed among the Top 10 Regions by travel media Lonely Planet. The region has seen an influx of tourists since 2015 as the Hokuriku Shinkansen (formerly Nagano Shinkansen) extended its services from Nagano to Kanazawa, enabling direct bullet train services to the Hokuriku region from Tokyo. When services commenced in March 2015, the travel time from Tokyo to Toyama was reduced to about 2 hours, with Kanazawa an additional 30 minutes away.

<doc id="366765" wikidata="Q33070" url="?curid=366765" title="Balinese language">
<text>Balinese is an Austronesian language spoken on the Indonesian island of Bali, as well as Northern Nusa Penida, Western Lombok, Southern Sumatra, and Sulawesi. Most Balinese speakers also use Indonesian. The 2000 national census recorded 3.3 million people speakers of Balinese, however the Bali Cultural Agency estimated in 2011 that the number of people still using the Balinese language in their daily lives is under 1 million. The language has been classified as &quot;not endangered&quot; by &quot;Glottolog&quot;.

The higher registers of the language borrow extensively from Javanese: an old form of classical Javanese, Kawi, is used in Bali as a religious and ceremonial language.

== Classification ==
Balinese is an Austronesian language belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the family. Within Malayo-Polynesian, it is part of the Bali–Sasak–Sumbawa subgroup. Internally, Balinese has three distinct varieties; Highland Bali, Lowland Bali, and Nusa Penida Balinese.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2000 census, the Balinese language is spoken by 3.3 million people in Indonesia, mainly concentrated on the island of Bali and the surrounding areas.

In 2011, the Bali Cultural Agency estimated that the number of people still using the Balinese language in their daily lives on Bali Island does not exceed 1 million, as in urban areas their parents only introduce the Indonesian language or even English as a foreign language, while daily conversations in the institutions and the mass media have disappeared. The written form of the Balinese language is increasingly unfamiliar and most Balinese people use the Balinese language only as a means of oral communication, often mixing it with Indonesian in their daily speech. However, in the transmigration areas outside Bali Island, the Balinese language is extensively used and believed to play an important role in the survival of the language.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The official spelling denotes both and final by . However, is usually pronounced when it ends a word, and occurs also in prefixes &quot;ma-&quot;, &quot;pa-&quot; and &quot;da-&quot;. In non-final positions, is denoted by ⟨e⟩.

===Consonants===

Depending on dialect, the phoneme is realized as a voiceless alveolar or retroflex stop. This is in contrast with most other languages in western Indonesia (including Standard Indonesian), which have a dental patterning with an otherwise alveolar phoneme series.

===Stress===
Stress falls on the last syllable.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Registers ===
Even though most basic vocabulary in Balinese and Indonesian originates from Austronesian and Sanskrit, many cognates sound quite different between languages. Balinese has four different registers: low (), middle (), and high (), the uses of which depend on the relationship and status of those speaking and those being spoken about. High Balinese is not commonly used except to speak to pedandas, so few are fluent in it. The common mutations in inherited Balinese words are:

* r &gt; h / #_, r &gt; h / V_V, and r &gt; h / _#. That is, r mutates into h at the beginning of every word, the end of every word, and between any two vowels.
* h &gt; ø / !_#. The phoneme h is lost everywhere except at the ends of words.

However, these mutations are not expressed in High Balinese, indicating that High Balinese contains many loanwords from Sanskrit and (Old) Javanese. These loanwords are identical in sound to their modern Javanese cognates, but reflect fifteenth-century usages from Old Javanese.
=== Numerals ===

Balinese has a decimal numeral system, but this is complicated by numerous words for intermediate quantities such as 45, 175, and 1600.

=== Pronouns ===
Kinship terms can be used as pronouns. If these pronouns are used as agents, they refer to either the speaker or the listener, depending on context. Though first and second person pronouns need no antecedent to be understood, third person pronouns do.

=== Time ===
Instead of grammatical tense, Balinese uses temporal adverbs to talk about time.
For present tense, the adverb &quot;jani&quot; (&quot;now&quot;) can be either definite or indefinite depending on context. Its more emphatic form, &quot;jani san&quot; (&quot;right now&quot;), is definite. The indefinite word &quot;ajanian&quot; (&quot;up to now&quot;) refers to any time before or during the utterance.
The word &quot;buin/bin&quot; (&quot;again&quot;) is obligatory for &quot;puan&quot; and &quot;telun&quot; to clarify that they are not being used for their past tense meanings. &quot;Mani,&quot; &quot;manian,&quot; and &quot;puan&quot; can all be prefixed with &quot;mani&quot; to refer to the future.

== Grammar ==

Balinese is agglutinative. Verb and noun inflectional morphology is similarly minimal to Indonesian, but derivational morphology is extensive.

=== Affixes ===
Of the two dative suffixes, &quot;-ang&quot; and &quot;-in&quot;, the latter should be used if the object is animate. The suffix &quot;-né / -é&quot; marks nouns for both definiteness and possession.

=== Nouns &amp; modifiers ===
Nouns come before their modifiers, and are often marked with a deictic word, &quot;ento&quot; &#x27;that&#x27; or &quot;ené&quot; &#x27;this,&#x27;&quot; to show that any modifiers act as modifiers instead of as verbs. The definite marker can also be attached to modifiers, especially any which conveys &quot;an inherent property of its referent.&quot; Adjectives following possessive (and therefore definite) nouns function as predicative, while adjectives following unmarked nouns function as attributive.

=== Verbs ===
Two types of serial verb constructions occur in Balinese. Both verbs are always fully inflected, but in the first type, the verbs have the same agent, whereas in the second, the object of the first verb is the subject of the second.

=== Word order &amp; voices ===
The word order is similar to that of Indonesian, and verb and noun inflectional morphology is similarly minimal. However, derivational morphology is extensive, and suffixes are applied to indicate definite or indefinite articles, and optionally to indicate possession.

The default, unmarked word order of Balinese is Patient Verb Agent. If the agent is a third person pronoun, it is attached to the verb as the clitic suffix &quot;-a.&quot;

This default word order can be reversed (Agent Verb Patient) with a nasal prefix on the verb. The nasal-marked word order cannot be an active construction, because it is marked, nor can it be antipassive, because the patient can&#x27;t be omitted. It is considered a second type of transitive voice.

There is a true passive voice (Patient Verb Agent) borrowed from Javanese and marked by the verbal prefix &quot;ka-.&quot; It is used mostly in high registers. If the agent of this passive construction is third-person, it must be preceded by a preposition. If it is not third-person, it cannot be preceded by a preposition.

The second true passive voice (Patient Verb), marked by the verbal prefix &quot;ma-,&quot; always omits the agent. It connotes a complete event and is only available to some verbs.

==Dialect==
Balinese has 2 main dialects, the Highland dialect and the Lowland dialect. The difference between the two dialects lies in the variety of vocabulary, phonology, and usage of register (e.g. High register vs. Low register). Highland dialect, also referred as Bali Aga dialect, has fewer high register variations, while the lowland dialect recognises both high register and low register.

===Highland dialect===
The highland dialect, also known as Bali Aga [dialect] is a dialect of the Balinese language spoken by the Bali Aga people in mountainous areas and northern part of Bali, especially in the mountain range of Kintamani, and regencies nearby such as Bangli, Buleleng, and Karangasem, as well in Nusa Penida. According to Bawa (1983:394), the highland dialect is grouped into three main usage areas, namely the eastern, northern, and western regions which are detailed as follows:
*The eastern region of Bali Island which includes Karangasem Regency, Kintamani District (or around Lake Batur), Klungkung Regency, parts of East Buleleng, and Nusa Penida;
* Northern Badung mountainous region;
* The western region of Bali Island, which includes Pupuan sub-district, Penebel (precisely in Wongaya Gede village), and parts of West Buleleng (precisely in Bantiran, Sepang, and Padawa villages).

Overall, there are two Highland sub-dialects that are distinct from varieties spoken in the area mentioned. Those sub-dialects are Nusa Penida dialect, spoken mostly in Nusa Penida, and Kapara dialect (also called as &quot;Bali Kapara&quot;) notably spoken in Sembiran village, Tejakula sub-regency, Buleleng Regency with an estimated 4,883 users. Nusa Penida dialect was thought to be a different dialect, but there is some indication that Nusa Penida dialect might be a sub-dialect of the highland dialect. According to Jendra, et al. (1997), both Nusa Penida and Highland dialects share the same phonological pattern as explained below:
* presences of in the middle of word, such as in ;
* presences of and affix or in the final-word position as allophony of ;
* the intonation of speakers&#x27; speech tends to have a fast tempo and louder stress
However, there are other notable differences between the two dialects, namely the absence or reduction of the distribution of the phoneme in word-final positions.

====Nusa Penida dialect====
Currently, the Nusa Penida dialect is widely used only in Nusa Penida in Klungkung Regency. However, it is important to note that not all communities in Nusa Penida use the Nusa Penida dialect. There are several groups of people who communicate using different dialects. On the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, which are located next to Nusa Penida, as well as in a small part of Nusa Penida close to these islands, there is a distinct dialect that is quite different from the Nusa Penida dialect. One of the most striking differences is in words like &quot;eda&quot; (you) and &quot;kola&quot; (I) in the Nusa Penida dialect. Speakers of the Nusa Lembongan dialect use words like &quot;cai&quot; or &quot;ci&quot; (you) and &quot;cang&quot; (I). Another example is &quot;əndək&quot; (Nusa Penida dialect) and &quot;tusing&quot; (Nusa Lembongan dialect), &quot;geleng-cenik&quot;, &quot;hangken-kenken&quot;, and so on. Only 13 out of 16 villages in Nusa Penida use the Nusa Penida dialect. The remaining villages either speak the Nusa Lembongan dialect or a dialect resembling mainland Klungkung Balinese.

The Nusa Penida dialect is also used outside Nusa Penida, mainly due to the migration of its speakers following the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963. Significant speakers relocated to southern Sumatra, particularly to Bandar Lampung, Palembang, Mesuji, and East Lampung.

===Lowland dialect===
==Writing system==
Balinese has been written in two different writing systems: the Balinese script, and in modern times the Latin script.

===Balinese script===
The Balinese script (, ), which is arranged as (), is an abugida, ultimately derived from the Brāhmī script of India. The earliest known inscriptions date from the 9th century AD.

Few people today are familiar with the Balinese script. The Balinese script is almost the same as the Javanese script.

===Latin alphabet===
Schools in Bali today teach a Latin alphabet known as .

<text>CPRE, The Countryside Charity, formerly known by names such as the &quot;Council for the Preservation of Rural England&quot; and the &quot;Campaign to Protect Rural England&quot;, is a charity in England with over 40,000 members and supporters. Formed in 1926 by Patrick Abercrombie to limit urban sprawl and ribbon development, the CPRE claims to be one of the longest running environmental groups in the UK. CPRE campaigns for a &quot;sustainable future&quot; for the English countryside. They state it is &quot;a vital but undervalued environmental, economic and social asset to the nation.&quot; They aim to &quot;highlight threats and promote positive solutions.&quot; They campaign using their own research to lobby the public and all levels of government.

== History ==
CPRE was formed following the publication of &quot;The Preservation of Rural England&quot; by Sir Patrick Abercrombie in 1926. Abercrombie became its Honorary Secretary. The inaugural meeting was held in December 1926 at the London offices of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was addressed by Neville Chamberlain, a future prime minister. Various groups were involved in its formation including the National Trust, the Women&#x27;s Institute and the Commons Preservation Society. Molly Trevelyan was the WI representative and she served on the founding committee.

The early years

In CPRE&#x27;s first years, it campaigned for rural planning, for the creation of national parks in especially beautiful areas and used for the recreation of those living in cities, for the reservation of farming belt zones around towns and cities so as to keep fresh produce close to urban markets and against urban sprawl and uncontrolled ribbon development. It also began arguing the case for protecting areas of England&#x27;s most beautiful countryside, and for setting up green belts to preserve the character of towns and to give town dwellers easy access to the countryside.

In the war years, CPRE was identified as a stakeholder that government ministries were required to consult with over proposed use of land in rural areas for airfields, training camps and war industries.

1941-1960

CPRE campaigning helped lead to the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. There were also CPRE campaigns for subsidies for rural housing and for adequate publicity for planning enquiries. This period also saw the &#x27;Best Kept Village&#x27; and &#x27;Keep Britain Tidy&#x27; initiatives.

When England&#x27;s first motorway the M1 was proposed in 1957, CPRE successfully campaigned for it to avoid the heart of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire (the road was put into a cutting).

1961-1980

CPRE worked on the issues of indestructible plastics, loss of hedgerows, energy infrastructure and the UK coastline. When the M4 was built in 1963 CPRE successfully fought to protect the Berkshire Downs. It also began to seek for tighter control on advertising hoardings along roadsides.

1981-1990

This era saw the creation of protected Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, something CPRE had campaigned for along with others. Attention was also paid to campaigns for sustainable energy generation and the use of brownfield land for building. In 1985 in a campaign to reform the EC&#x27;s Agricultural Structures Directive, CPRE stopped funding for many damaging agricultural activities and secured the first “green” farm payments. In 1988 it helped persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to scrap tax incentives favouring blanket conifer plantations in upland areas.

1990 onwards

In 1990 the Government&#x27;s first ever Environment White Paper accepted the case for hedgerow protection, 20 years after CPRE&#x27;s campaign was first launched, and in 1997 laws to protect hedgerows finally came into force.

In 1995 CPRE published “tranquillity” maps which show the diminishing areas of the countryside not disturbed by man-made noise, visual intrusion or light pollution. These were updated using a pioneering new methodology in 2006. CPRE also published similar maps focusing solely on light pollution in 2003.

In 1996, English composer John Rutter wrote the words and music for an anthem entitled &quot;Look at the World&quot; in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the CPRE.

In April 2006 CPRE Peak District &amp; South Yorkshire sought to clarify its identity across its vast territory by operating under two distinct identities. Due to its long association with Peak District National Park, the organisation operates as the Friends of the Peak District in the Peak District National Park, High Peak Borough and six parishes of North East Derbyshire (Eckington, Unstone, Holmesfield, Killamarsh, Dronfield, Barlow).

In 2007 CPRE published a series of intrusion maps which are in development which highlighted areas disturbed by the presence of noise and visual intrusion from major infrastructure. The resulting maps show the extent of intrusion in the early 1960s, early 1990s and 2007. They cannot be reproduced.

In July 2024, Mary-Ann Ochota was elected President of the CPRE. She was previously interviewed by CPRE and described time spent in green space as &quot;a wonder drug&quot;.

== Campaigns ==
In 2013 there was agreement to place electricity transmission lines underground in some National Parks, something CPRE is still campaigning for.

In 2018 after CPRE&#x27;s 10-year campaign against drink-container litter, the Government announced that it is considering the introduction of a deposit return scheme to increase recycling rates. It is hoped by CPRE that the scheme will include all single use drink-containers, whether plastic, glass or metal.

According to the main CPRE website, campaigns in 2022 are now grouped under the broad headlines, Dark Skies, Hedgerows, What gets built where, and the Climate Emergency.

Under the Dark Skies heading, in 2013, Star Count was launched. This is a campaign to stop light pollution by involving the public in star-counting in order to map light pollution across the UK and raise awareness. A related idea is reducing the impact of light pollution, reducing carbon budgets and saving money by pushing councils to adjust street lighting.

Under the What gets built where heading, CPRE&#x27;s includes influencing development plans at local, regional and national level. There is also a focus on reducing “clutter” in the form of unnecessary road signs and advertising billboards in the countryside and seeking ways to protect quiet rural roads. Tools to map tranquility in the countryside are being developed for use by local and regional planners. Effort is put into reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the fight for farmers to be recognised for the work they do in protecting the character of the countryside. Planners are lobbied to ensure that as many new developments as possible are built on Brownfield (rather than Greenfield) land. In particular CPRE is fighting for the protection of green belts. There is emphasis on reducing litter in rural areas across England via local action and events and lobbying government.

Under the Climate emergency heading, support is given to campaigns against &#x27;surface&#x27; or opencast mining. CPRE has challenged the government to modify HS2 rail plans to remove all planned out-of-town interchange (&quot;parkway&quot;) stations as well as challenging the potential Oxford–Cambridge Expressway. Suggestions have been offered for a range of practical measures to be adopted by central and local government in order to support local food businesses so that they can provide fair and affordable prices. Preliminary work consisted of a five-year research – &#x27;Mapping Local Food Webs&#x27; (2007–2012). Campaigns support farming funding that will stem loss of smaller farms and the diversity they provide (2017). There is campaigning against large-scale fracking operation in the UK, that will destroy large areas of the countryside and exacerbate the global plastic binge (2018).

A photography competition was started in 2016 to celebrate the beauty of Dorset&#x27;s countryside (2016).

== Structure ==
CPRE&#x27;s national office is at 5–11, Lavington Street, Southwark, London. It also has offices in the eight other regions of England.

In addition there are CPRE branches in each of England&#x27;s counties and groups in over 200 districts. All but two of the 43 CPRE branches are independent charities of their own. CPRE Durham and CPRE Northumberland are subsidiaries of national CPRE. Each CPRE branch has its own website.

== Publications ==
Members receive a quarterly magazine entitled &#x27;Countryside Voices&#x27;, and can opt to receive &#x27;Fieldwork&#x27; which contains details of campaigns around the UK.

The CPRE promotes a large number of rural attractions such as gardens, houses and museums, by means of its annual Members&#x27; Guide. The 2012 Members Guide was supported by the National Farmers Union.

In 2015, CPRE published the &#x27;Warm and Green&#x27; report, which sheds new light on the scale of the energy problems and the solutions needed to tackle them. During the same year CPRE earned the Bankside Star by contributing significantly to the Together at Christmas gift collection campaign for the homeless, vulnerably housed and elderly people.

==Influence==
CPRE has influenced public policy relating to town and country planning in England, most notably in the formation of the National Parks and AONBs in 1949, and of green belts in 1955.

It claims some credit for the slow shift of agricultural policies across Europe away from a price-support philosophy to one of environmental stewardship, a policy shift begun in England. Campaigns against noise and light pollution have been pursued over recent years, and CPRE is now focusing on &quot;tranquillity&quot; as a key aspect of the countryside which CPRE wants to see protected in England&#x27;s planning policies.

CPRE joined the 10:10 project in 2010 in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. One year later they announced that they had reduced their carbon emissions (according to 10:10&#x27;s criteria) by 12%.

==Criticisms and countercriticisms==
In the UK, there are competing demands on the use of land for biodiversity, food production, housing, recreation, health and well-being. Movements of populations and climate change exacerbate the pressure of these demands. It is thus to be expected that tensions will arise between and among food producers, residents, planners, builders, industrialists, environmentalists and others. Points of view vary significantly and CPRE thus has its critics.

Some critics characterise CPRE as being:
* A proponent of a drawbridge mentality (i.e. &quot;I&#x27;ve moved to the countryside but I don&#x27;t want others to do likewise&quot;) This is sometimes characterised as betraying a NIMBY approach. CPRE counters this by saying that what is needed in rural areas is low-cost rental accommodation or genuinely affordable homes. 
* Motivated by Luddite nostalgia.
* A supporter of exclusionary planning practices to keep low-income residents out of rural areas.

CPRE has changed its positions on issues over time. For example, in December 2008 George Monbiot of &quot;The Guardian&quot; interviewed the then CPRE head, Shaun Spiers, about the organisation&#x27;s opposition to wind farms but not opencast coal mines. George Monbiot asked why he couldn&#x27;t find any opposition of the CPRE to surface coal mining over the past five years, and pointed out that the negative effects that coal mines cause by removing the soil from large areas are much greater than the negative effects wind energy might have on the countryside. However, perhaps as a result of this pressure, in 2010, campaigning against inappropriate mineral extraction by opencast mining started to be featured under the &#x27;Climate change and natural resources&#x27; section of CPRE&#x27;s website.

In 2011, the CPRE argued that not enough public consultation had been done on HS2 though a 5-month public consultation was currently being run at the time.

The CPRE has been accused by some of exaggerating the threat to rural England and of being alarmist by warning that the Green Belt is in danger of being &#x27;concreted over&#x27;. According to a right-wing think tank, the Institute for Economic Affairs, only about one-tenth of the English surface area, (rather than the Green Belt) is &#x27;developed&#x27; in the broadest sense; about half of this &#x27;development&#x27; consists of domestic gardens, leaving only one-twentieth which is really &#x27;under concrete&#x27; (including roads, railways, car parks, etc.). It is nevertheless the case that in 2017/18, 8.9 km of previously undeveloped Green Belt land changed to a developed use, of which 2.9 km turned into residential use.

Figures from the British YIMBY movement have criticised the CPRE, accusing it of denying the British housing crisis and significantly underestimating housing need in high-cost areas to justify the inviolability of the Greenbelt. YIMBYs have claimed that this policy denies both rural and urban communities the housing that, if planned correctly, they would want to build. The alleged success of CPRE&#x27;s campaign to restrict housing on the rural-urban fringe has led John Myers, co-founder of London YIMBY, to describe it as &#x27;the NRA of the UK&#x27; (referring to the National Rifle Association of America, rather than the unrelated British NRA). A CPRE report admits more housing is needed but challenges the government statistics on numbers, stating they are based on aspiration rather than observed need.

Criticism has also been targeted at the CPRE&#x27;s emphasis on the use of brownfield sites over greenfield sites as a first choice for building, accusing it of overstating their ability to meet Britain&#x27;s housing need. According to the YIMBY movement, this is a distraction from the necessary infill development in and around major urban centres, which is claimed to offer significantly more potential to meet housing need inside urban areas. In October 2020 however, a CPRE report revealed that there is enough brownfield land for 1.3 million new homes and over half a million already have planning permission.

In 2024, CPRE Hertfordshire were criticised by one Hertfordshire local authority about the accuracy of information in the charity&#x27;s published analysis of a draft Local Plan. Concerns were publicly raised by the local authority that such misinformation could detrimentally affect residents’ abilities to provide a well-informed response to its Draft Local Plan as part of its ongoing consultation.

<text>was a son of Azai Sukemasa and the second head of the Azai clan.

Hisamasa became the head of the clan in 1542 after his father died, but unlike his father, he was never a strong leader. Losing domains against Rokkaku clan, he instead became a Rokkaku retainer. Hisamasa&#x27;s retainers had enough and, after his son Azai Nagamasa won the Battle of Norada against a force at least twice the size of his led by Rokkaku Yoshikata to win back independence, they forced Hisamasa into retirement.

Yet, this retirement was not complete and Hisamasa managed to hold some sway of the clan. This surfaced in 1570 after Oda Nobunaga - who was allied with Hisamasa&#x27;s son, Azai Nagamasa - attacked Asakura Yoshikage, who had supported Hisamasa against enemies like the Rokkaku clan. Hating Nobunaga for his personality, Hisamasa demanded that the Azai clan pay back the support of the Asakura clan and forced a war by breaking the alliance. It is thought that Nagamasa opposed him and believed that the alliance could somehow be mended over time since he refused to divorce his wife, Oichi, but he failed to gain enough support to overturn Hisamasa.

In 1573, Odani Castle was besieged by Nobunaga&#x27;s forces. Facing a loss, Hisamasa committed seppuku.

<text>In mathematics, a knot is an embedding of the circle () into three-dimensional Euclidean space, (also known as ). Often two knots are considered equivalent if they are ambient isotopic, that is, if there exists a continuous deformation of which takes one knot to the other. 

A crucial difference between the standard mathematical and conventional notions of a knot is that mathematical knots are closed — there are no ends to tie or untie on a mathematical knot. Physical properties such as friction and thickness also do not apply, although there are mathematical definitions of a knot that take such properties into account. The term &quot;knot&quot; is also applied to embeddings of in , especially in the case . The branch of mathematics that studies knots is known as knot theory and has many relations to graph theory.

==Formal definition==

A knot is an embedding of the circle () into three-dimensional Euclidean space (), or the 3-sphere (), since the 3-sphere is compact. Two knots are defined to be equivalent if there is an ambient isotopy between them.

===Projection===

A knot in (or alternatively in the 3-sphere, ), can be projected onto a plane  (respectively a sphere ). This projection is almost always regular, meaning that it is injective everywhere, except at a &quot;finite number&quot; of crossing points, which are the projections of &quot;only two points&quot; of the knot, and these points are not collinear. In this case, by choosing a projection side, one can completely encode the isotopy class of the knot by its regular projection by recording a simple over/under information at these crossings. In graph theory terms, a regular projection of a knot, or knot diagram is thus a quadrivalent planar graph with over/under-decorated vertices. The local modifications of this graph which allow to go from one diagram to any other diagram of the same knot (up to ambient isotopy of the plane) are called Reidemeister moves.

==Types of knots==

The simplest knot, called the unknot or trivial knot, is a round circle embedded in . In the ordinary sense of the word, the unknot is not &quot;knotted&quot; at all. The simplest nontrivial knots are the trefoil knot ( in the table), the figure-eight knot () and the cinquefoil knot ().

Several knots, linked or tangled together, are called links. Knots are links with a single component.

===Tame vs. wild knots===

A &quot;polygonal&quot; knot is a knot whose image in is the union of a finite set of line segments. A &quot;tame&quot; knot is any knot equivalent to a polygonal knot. Knots which are not tame are called &quot;wild&quot;, and can have pathological behavior. In knot theory and 3-manifold theory, often the adjective &quot;tame&quot; is omitted. Smooth knots, for example, are always tame.

===Framed knot===

A &quot;framed knot&quot; is the extension of a tame knot to an embedding of the solid torus in .

The &quot;framing&quot; of the knot is the linking number of the image of the ribbon with the knot. A framed knot can be seen as the embedded ribbon and the framing is the (signed) number of twists. This definition generalizes to an analogous one for &quot;framed links&quot;. Framed links are said to be &quot;equivalent&quot; if their extensions to solid tori are ambient isotopic.

Framed link &quot;diagrams&quot; are link diagrams with each component marked, to indicate framing, by an integer representing a slope with respect to the meridian and preferred longitude. A standard way to view a link diagram without markings as representing a framed link is to use the &quot;blackboard framing&quot;. This framing is obtained by converting each component to a ribbon lying flat on the plane. A type I Reidemeister move clearly changes the blackboard framing (it changes the number of twists in a ribbon), but the other two moves do not. Replacing the type I move by a modified type I move gives a result for link diagrams with blackboard framing similar to the Reidemeister theorem: Link diagrams, with blackboard framing, represent equivalent framed links if and only if they are connected by a sequence of (modified) type I, II, and III moves.
Given a knot, one can define infinitely many framings on it. Suppose that
we are given a knot with a fixed framing. One may obtain a new framing from the existing one by cutting
a ribbon and twisting it an integer multiple of 2π around the knot and then glue back again in the place
we did the cut. In this way one obtains a new framing from an old one, up to the equivalence relation
for framed knots„ leaving the knot fixed. The framing in this sense is associated to the number of twists
the vector field performs around the knot. Knowing how many times the vector field is twisted around
the knot allows one to determine the vector field up to diffeomorphism, and the equivalence class of the
framing is determined completely by this integer called the framing integer.

===Knot complement===

Given a knot in the 3-sphere, the knot complement is all the points of the 3-sphere not contained in the knot. A major theorem of Gordon and Luecke states that at most two knots have homeomorphic complements (the original knot and its mirror reflection). This in effect turns the study of knots into the study of their complements, and in turn into 3-manifold theory.

===JSJ decomposition===
The JSJ decomposition and Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem reduces the study of knots in the 3-sphere to the study of various geometric manifolds via &quot;splicing&quot; or &quot;satellite operations&quot;. In the pictured knot, the JSJ-decomposition splits the complement into the union of three manifolds: two trefoil complements and the complement of the Borromean rings. The trefoil complement has the geometry of , while the Borromean rings complement has the geometry of .

===Harmonic knots===
Parametric representations of knots are called harmonic knots. Aaron Trautwein compiled parametric representations for all knots up to and including those with a crossing number of 8 in his PhD thesis.

==Applications to graph theory==

===Medial graph===



Another convenient representation of knot diagrams was introduced by Peter Tait in 1877.

Any knot diagram defines a plane graph whose vertices are the crossings and whose edges are paths in between successive crossings. Exactly one face of this planar graph is unbounded; each of the others is homeomorphic to a 2-dimensional disk. Color these faces black or white so that the unbounded face is black and any two faces that share a boundary edge have opposite colors. The Jordan curve theorem implies that there is exactly one such coloring.

We construct a new plane graph whose vertices are the white faces and whose edges correspond to crossings. We can label each edge in this graph as a left edge or a right edge, depending on which thread appears to go over the other as we view the corresponding crossing from one of the endpoints of the edge. Left and right edges are typically indicated by labeling left edges + and right edges –, or by drawing left edges with solid lines and right edges with dashed lines. 

The original knot diagram is the medial graph of this new plane graph, with the type of each crossing determined by the sign of the corresponding edge. Changing the sign of &quot;every&quot; edge corresponds to reflecting the knot in a mirror.

===Linkless and knotless embedding===
In two dimensions, only the planar graphs may be embedded into the Euclidean plane without crossings, but in three dimensions, any undirected graph may be embedded into space without crossings. However, a spatial analogue of the planar graphs is provided by the graphs with linkless embeddings and knotless embeddings. A linkless embedding is an embedding of the graph with the property that any two cycles are unlinked; a knotless embedding is an embedding of the graph with the property that any single cycle is unknotted. The graphs that have linkless embeddings have a forbidden graph characterization involving the Petersen family, a set of seven graphs that are intrinsically linked: no matter how they are embedded, some two cycles will be linked with each other. A full characterization of the graphs with knotless embeddings is not known, but the complete graph is one of the minimal forbidden graphs for knotless embedding: no matter how is embedded, it will contain a cycle that forms a trefoil knot.

==Generalization==
In contemporary mathematics the term &quot;knot&quot; is sometimes used to describe a more general phenomenon related to embeddings. Given a manifold with a submanifold , one sometimes says can be knotted in if there exists an embedding of in which is not isotopic to . Traditional knots form the case where and or .

The Schoenflies theorem states that the circle does not knot in the 2-sphere: every topological circle in the 2-sphere is isotopic to a geometric circle. Alexander&#x27;s theorem states that the 2-sphere does not smoothly (or PL or tame topologically) knot in the 3-sphere. In the tame topological category, it&#x27;s known that the -sphere does not knot in the -sphere for all . This is a theorem of Morton Brown, Barry Mazur, and Marston Morse. The Alexander horned sphere is an example of a knotted 2-sphere in the 3-sphere which is not tame. In the smooth category, the -sphere is known not to knot in the -sphere provided . The case is a long-outstanding problem closely related to the question: does the 4-ball admit an exotic smooth structure?

André Haefliger proved that there are no smooth -dimensional knots in provided , and gave further examples of knotted spheres for all such that . is called the codimension of the knot. An interesting aspect of Haefliger&#x27;s work is that the isotopy classes of embeddings of in form a group, with group operation given by the connect sum, provided the co-dimension is greater than two. Haefliger based his work on Stephen Smale&#x27;s &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem. One of Smale&#x27;s theorems is that when one deals with knots in co-dimension greater than two, even inequivalent knots have diffeomorphic complements. This gives the subject a different flavour than co-dimension 2 knot theory. If one allows topological or PL-isotopies, Christopher Zeeman proved that spheres do not knot when the co-dimension is greater than 2. See a generalization to manifolds.

<text>The knot () is a unit of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour, exactly (approximately or ). The ISO standard symbol for the knot is kn. The same symbol is preferred by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), while kt is also common, especially in aviation, where it is the form recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The knot is a non-SI unit. The knot is used in meteorology, and in maritime and air navigation. A vessel travelling at 1 knot along a meridian travels approximately one minute of geographic latitude in one hour.

==Definitions==
;1 international knot =
:1 nautical mile per hour (by definition),
: (exactly),
: (approximately),
: (approximately),
: (approximately)
: (approximately).

The length of the internationally agreed nautical mile is . The US adopted the international definition in 1954, having previously used the US nautical mile (). The UK adopted the international nautical mile definition in 1970, having previously used the UK Admiralty nautical mile ( or ).
==Usage==
The speeds of vessels relative to the fluids in which they travel (boat speeds and air speeds) can be measured in knots. If so, for consistency, the speeds of navigational fluids (ocean currents, tidal streams, river currents and wind speeds) are also measured in knots. Thus, speed over the ground (SOG; ground speed (GS) in aircraft) and rate of progress towards a distant point (&quot;velocity made good&quot;, VMG) can also be given in knots. Since 1979, the International Civil Aviation Organization list the knot as permitted for temporary use in aviation, but no end date to the temporary period has been agreed .

== Origin ==
Until the mid-19th century, vessel speed at sea was measured using a chip log. This consisted of a wooden panel, attached by line to a reel, and weighted on one edge to float perpendicularly to the water surface and thus present substantial resistance to the water moving around it. The chip log was cast over the stern of the moving vessel and the line allowed to pay out. Knots tied at a distance of from each other, passed through a sailor&#x27;s fingers, while another sailor used a 30-second sand-glass (28-second sand-glass is the currently accepted timing) to time the operation. The knot count would be reported and used in the sailing master&#x27;s dead reckoning and navigation. This method gives a value for the knot of . The difference from the modern definition is less than 0.02%.

Derivation of knots spacing:

formula_1, so in formula_2 seconds that is formula_3 metres per knot.

==Modern use==
Although the unit &quot;knot&quot; does not fit within the SI system, its retention for nautical and aviation use is important because the length of a nautical mile, upon which the knot is based, is closely related to the longitude/latitude geographic coordinate system. As a result, nautical miles and knots are convenient units to use when navigating an aircraft or ship.

On a standard nautical chart using Mercator projection, the horizontal (East–West) scale varies with latitude. On a chart of the North Atlantic, the scale varies by a factor of two from Florida to Greenland. A single graphic scale, of the sort on many maps, would therefore be useless on such a chart. Since the length of a nautical mile, for practical purposes, is equivalent to about a minute of latitude, a distance in nautical miles on a chart can easily be measured by using dividers and the latitude scales on the sides of the chart. Recent British Admiralty charts have a latitude scale down the middle to make this even easier.

Speed is sometimes incorrectly expressed as &quot;knots per hour&quot;, which would mean &quot;nautical miles per hour per hour&quot; and thus would refer to acceleration.

=== Aeronautical terms ===
Prior to 1969, airworthiness standards for civil aircraft in the United States Federal Aviation Regulations specified that distances were to be in statute miles, and speeds in miles per hour. In 1969, these standards were progressively amended to specify that distances were to be in nautical miles, and speeds in knots.

The following abbreviations are used to distinguish between various measurements of airspeed:
* TAS is &quot;knots true airspeed&quot;, the airspeed of an aircraft relative to undisturbed air
* KIAS is &quot;knots indicated airspeed&quot;, the speed shown on an aircraft&#x27;s pitot-static airspeed indicator
* CAS is &quot;knots calibrated airspeed&quot;, the indicated airspeed corrected for position error and instrument error
* EAS is &quot;knots equivalent airspeed&quot;, the calibrated airspeed corrected for adiabatic compressible flow for the particular altitude

The indicated airspeed is close to the true airspeed only at sea level in standard conditions and at low speeds. At , an indicated airspeed of 300 kn may correspond to a true airspeed of 500 kn in standard conditions.

<text>was a province of Japan which consisted of a peninsula in the southeastern part of modern Mie Prefecture. Its abbreviated name was . Shima bordered on Ise Province to the west, and on Ise Bay on the north, east and south. It roughly coincides with the modern municipalities of Shima and Toba.
Shima is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō, and was the smallest of all provinces. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Shima was ranked as an &quot;inferior country&quot; (下国) and a &quot;near country&quot; (近国), in terms of its distance from the capital.

==History==
Shima was an autonomous district of Ise Province, noted as a prosperous fishing region, and during the Nara period governors of the district were responsible for providing annual gifts of fish and abalone to the Emperor. It was separated from Ise Province during the late 7th or early 8th centuries. During the Asuka period and Nara period it was dominated by the Takahashi clan. As the arable land area of Shima Province was very small, portions of the rice lands of Ise Province, as well as Mikawa Province and Owari Province were considered as part of the taxable revenues of Shima Province for the purpose of upkeep of its provincial capital, shrines and temples.

The exact location of the provincial capital is not known, but is traditionally believed to have been in Ago, currently part of the city of Shima where the ruins of the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; of Shima Province have been discovered. The &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the , one of the subsidiary shrines within the Ise Grand Shrine complex.

During the Kamakura period Shima came under the control of Hōjō clan, followed by the Kitabatake clan for much of the Muromachi period, although the Kuki clan, originally pirates in Ise Bay based at Toba Castle dominated much of the coastal areas by the end of the Sengoku period. Ohama Kagetaka was also a pirate operating in the Ise Bay area of Shima Province during the 16th century.

With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Kuki Moritaka was confirmed as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Toba, initially with revenues of 35,000 &quot;koku&quot;, growing to 55,000 &quot;koku&quot; under his son Kuki Hisataka, who was transferred to Sanda Domain in Settsu Province.

The Kuki were replaced by the &quot;tozama&quot; Naitō clan, which ruled Toba to 1680. The domain then reverted to &quot;tenryō&quot; status under the direct control of the Shogunate for one year. It then came under the control of the Doi clan (1681–1691), Ogyu-Matsudaira clan (1691–1710), Itakura clan (1710–1717), and Toda-Matsudaira clan (1717–1725) before finally coming under the Inagaki clan (1725–1871), where it remained until the Meiji Restoration.

During the Boshin War, Inagaki Nagayuki remained loyal to the Shogunate, and as a result was fined heavily by the Meiji government and forced into retirement. His son, Inagaki Nagahiro became domain governor, and after the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Toba Domain became &quot;Toba Prefecture&quot;, which merged with the short lived &quot;Watarai Prefecture&quot; of former Ise Province in November 1871, which later became part of Mie Prefecture.

<doc id="366823" wikidata="Q891773" url="?curid=366823" title="Shimonoseki campaign">
<text>The was a series of military engagements in 1863 and 1864, fought to control the Shimonoseki Straits of Japan by joint naval forces from the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, against the Japanese feudal domain of Chōshū, which took place off and on the coast of Shimonoseki, Japan.

==Background==

Despite efforts of appeasement by the Tokugawa shogunate to establish an atmosphere of peaceful solidarity, many feudal &quot;daimyōs&quot; remained bitterly resentful of the shogunate&#x27;s open-door policy to foreign trade. Belligerent opposition to European and American influence erupted into open conflict when the Emperor Kōmei, breaking with centuries of imperial tradition, began to take an active role in matters of state and issued on March 11 and April 11, 1863, his &quot;Order to expel barbarians&quot; (攘夷実行の勅命 – &quot;Jōi jikkō no chokumei&quot;).

The Chōshū clan, under the &quot;daimyō&quot; Mōri Takachika, began to take action to expel all foreigners after the deadline of the 10th day of the 5th month, according to the traditional Japanese calendar. Openly defying the shogunate, Mōri ordered his forces to fire without warning on all foreign ships traversing Shimonoseki Strait. This strategic but treacherous 600-meter waterway separates the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū and provides a passage connecting the Inland Sea with the Sea of Japan.

Even before tensions escalated in Shimonoseki Strait, foreign diplomats and military experts, notably U.S. Minister to Japan Robert Pruyn and U.S. Navy Captain David McDougal had been aware of the precarious state of affairs in Japan. McDougal wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, dated June 12, 1863, stating, &quot;General opinion is that the government of Japan is on the eve of revolution, the principal object of which is the expulsion of foreigners.&quot;

===&quot;Revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians!&quot;===

The Chōshū clan was equipped with mostly antiquated cannons firing cannonballs, but also some modern armament, such as five Dahlgren guns, which had been presented to Japan by the United States, and three steam warships of American construction: the bark &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; of six guns, the brig &quot;Lanrick&quot;, or &quot;Kosei&quot;, with ten guns, and the steamer &quot;Lancefield&quot;, or &quot;Koshin&quot;, of four guns.

The first attack occurred on June 25, 1863, soon after the Imperial &quot;Order to expel barbarians&quot; came into effect. The U.S. merchant steamer SS &quot;Pembroke&quot;, under Captain Simon Cooper, was riding at anchor outside Shimonoseki Strait when it was intercepted and fired upon by two European-built warships belonging to the rebel forces.

The crew of one enemy vessel taunted the frantic American seamen with a loud and unnerving cry: &quot;Revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians!&quot; ( &quot;sonnō jōi&quot;). Under incessant cannon fire, &quot;Pembroke&quot; managed to get underway and escape through the adjacent Bungo Strait with only slight damage and no casualties.
Upon arrival in Shanghai, Cooper filed a report of the attack and dispatched it to the U.S. Consulate in Yokohama, Japan. The next day, the French naval dispatch steamer &quot;Kien Chan&quot; was also riding at anchor outside the strait, when rebel Japanese artillery atop the bluffs surrounding Shimonoseki opened fire on her. &quot;Kien Chan&quot; sustained damage to its engine and suffered four casualties before escaping to the open ocean.

On July 11, despite warnings from the crew of the &quot;Kien Chan&quot;, the 16-gun Dutch warship &quot;Medusa&quot; cruised into Shimonoseki Strait. Her skipper, Captain François de Casembroot, was convinced that Lord Mōri Takachika would not dare fire on his vessel due to the strength of his ship and longstanding relations between the Netherlands and Japan.

However, Mōri did just that, pounding &quot;Medusa&quot; with more than thirty shells and killing or wounding nine seamen. De Casembroot returned fire and ran the rebel gauntlet at full speed, fearful of endangering the life of the Dutch Consul General, who was on board. Within a short time, the Japanese warlord had managed to fire on the flags of most of the nations with consulates in Japan.

===Battle of Shimonoseki Straits===
In the morning of July 16, 1863, under sanction by Minister Pruyn, in an apparent swift response to the attack on the &quot;Pembroke&quot;, the U.S. frigate USS &quot;Wyoming&quot;, under Captain McDougal, sailed into the strait and single-handedly engaged the U.S.-built but poorly manned local fleet for almost two hours before withdrawing. McDougal sank two enemy vessels and severely damaged another one, along with inflicting some forty Japanese casualties. The &quot;Wyoming&quot; suffered a significant amount of damage, with four crew dead and seven wounded, one later dying of his injuries. The two Japanese steamers sunk by the &quot;Wyoming&quot; were raised again by Chōshū in 1864 and attached to the harbour of Hagi.

==Campaign==

===First battle, July 20, 1863===

On the heels of McDougal&#x27;s engagement, on July 20, the French Navy retaliated for the attack on their merchant ship. The French force consisted of marines and two warships, the aviso &quot;Tancrède&quot; and the Admiral&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Sémiramis&quot;. With 250 men, under Captain Benjamin Jaurès, they swept into Shimonoseki and destroyed a small town, together with at least one artillery emplacement.

The intervention was supported by the French plenipotentiary in Japan, Gustave Duchesne de Bellecourt, but the French government, once informed, strongly criticized their representatives in Japan for taking such bellicose steps, for the reason that France had much more important military commitments to honour in other parts of the world, and could not afford a conflict in Japan. Duchesne de Bellecourt would be relieved from his position in 1864.

Jaurès was also congratulated by the shogunate for taking such decisive steps against anti-foreign forces, and was awarded a special banner.

===Diplomatic negotiations===

Meanwhile, the Americans, French, British and Dutch feverishly opened diplomatic channels to negotiate the reopening of the passage to the Inland Sea. Months dragged by with no end in sight to the growing dilemma. By May 1864, various bellicose Japanese factions had destroyed thousands of dollars in foreign property, including homes, churches and shipping. This wanton destruction included the U.S. Legation in Edo, which housed Minister Robert Pruyn.

Throughout the first half of 1864, as Shimonoseki Strait remained closed to foreign shipping, threats and rumors of war hung in the air, while diplomatic efforts remained deadlocked. Then the British Minister to Japan, Sir Rutherford Alcock, discussed with his treaty counterparts such as American Minister Robert Pruyn and Dutch Minister Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, the feasibility of a joint military strike against Mōri.

They were soon making preparations for a combined show of force. Under the wary eyes of the Japanese, fifteen British warships rode anchor alongside four Dutch vessels, while a British regiment from Hong Kong augmented their display of military might. The French maintained a minimal naval presence, with the bulk of their forces in Mexico trying to bolster Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s unstable regime.

The U.S., engaged in its Civil War, limited itself to demonstrate diplomatic and minimal military support for the allies. In the meantime, Mōri procrastinated in negotiations by requesting additional time to respond to the Allied demands, a response unacceptable to the treaty powers. The allies decided that the time for united action had arrived.

Despite retaliatory action from the treaty powers, another attack occurred in July 1864 when the rebel forces fired upon the U.S. steamer &quot;Monitor&quot; after she entered a harbor for coal and water. This provoked further outrage, even after a British squadron delivered a multi-national ultimatum to Mōri, threatening military force if the strait was not opened.

===Final battle, September 5–6, 1864===

On August 17, 1864, a squadron consisting of nine British (, &quot;Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Tartar&quot;, &quot;Leopard&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot;, &quot;Perseus&quot;, &quot;Argus&quot;, &quot;Coquette&quot;, and &quot;Bouncer&quot;), four Dutch (&quot;Djambi&quot;, &quot;Metalen-Kruis&quot;, &quot;Medusa&quot;, and &quot;Amsterdam&quot;), and three French warships (&quot;Tancrède&quot;, &quot;Sémiramis&quot;, and &quot;Dupleix&quot;), together with 2,000 soldiers, marines and sailors, all under the command of Admiral Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper of the Royal Navy, steamed out of Yokohama to open Shimonoseki Strait.

The U.S. chartered steamer accompanied the operation in a token show of support. The two-day battle that followed on September 5 and 6 did what the previous operations could not; it destroyed the Chōshū Domain&#x27;s ability to wage war on the Western powers. Unable to match the firepower of the international fleet, and amid mounting casualties, Takasugi Shinsaku negotiated peace with the four Western powers and Chōshū forces finally surrendered two days later on September 8, 1864.

Allied casualties included 72 killed or wounded; although Ernest Satow describes only 8 killed and 30 wounded for the British and two damaged British ships. A full account of the battle is contained in Ernest Satow&#x27;s &quot;A Diplomat in Japan&quot;. Satow was present as a young interpreter for the British admiral, Augustus Kuper on the British flagship HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;, commanded by Captain J. H. I. Alexander. It was also the action at which Duncan Gordon Boyes won his Victoria Cross (VC) at the age of seventeen. Satow described Boyes as receiving the award &quot;for conduct very plucky in one so young.&quot; Another VC winner at Shimonoseki was Thomas Pride, and the third was the first American to win the medal, William Seeley. De Casembroot wrote his account of the events in &quot;De Medusa in de wateren van Japan, in 1863 en 1864&quot;.

The stringent accord, drawn up in the wake of the ceasefire and negotiated by U.S. Minister Pruyn, included an indemnity of $3,000,000 from the Japanese, an amount equivalent to the cost of about 30 steamships at that time. The Tokugawa shogunate proved unable to pay such an amount, and this failure became the basis of further foreign pressure to open Japanese ports; Japan was forced to choose between paying compensation of three million piastres and opening another port on the Inland Sea. The harbour of Hyōgo was opened to foreign trade, and customs tariffs were lowered uniformly to 5%. In 1883, twenty years after the first battle to reopen the strait, the United States returned $785,000.87 to Japan, which represented its share of the reparation payment.

==Aftermath==

Right after the foreign interventions, the Shogunal government also launched its own preparations for a punitive expedition against Chōshū, the First Chōshū expedition. The expedition was aimed at punishing the 1864 Kinmon incident in which Chōshū forces attacked Shogunal forces in Kyoto. The expedition was however cancelled after a compromise was brokered, involving the beheading of the leaders of the rebellion.

At the same time as this campaign, the British Royal Navy engaged Satsuma samurai at the Bombardment of Kagoshima, one of the several engagements of the Japanese conflict of 1863 and 1864.

==Historical significance==

Closely resembling the series of little conflicts fought by the European powers in Asia, Africa and elsewhere during the nineteenth century, the troubles in Japan seemed to exemplify their gunboat diplomacy, a prevalent tool in imperialism. Bitter resentment against foreign influence made the Chōshū clan feel justified in engaging in acts of military provocation in defiance of their own government.
While it was bitterly embroiled in the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s government was carefully watched by the world for signs of weakness and indecision. The actions of &quot;USS Wyoming&quot; made it the first foreign warship to offensively uphold treaty rights with Japan; this fact coupled with the possibility that the events would mire the U.S. in a foreign war made the battle of Shimonoseki a significant engagement.

While the battles of Shimonoseki Strait were mere footnotes in the histories of the European powers, an interesting aspect of the affair was the resourcefulness displayed by the Japanese. The feudal Japanese had not set eyes on a steam-powered ship until Commodore Perry&#x27;s arrival only a decade before &quot;USS Wyoming″&quot;s battle. Yet they had rapidly advanced in such a short period of time.

The Shimonoseki city government in 2004, in recognition of the importance of the bombardment in Japanese history, placed several life-size replicas of the guns used by Chōshū. The replicas are made of hollow steel and include coin-operated sound effects and smoke from the barrels.

<doc id="366832" wikidata="Q1142446" url="?curid=366832" title="Azai Nagamasa">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku period known as the brother-in-law and enemy of Oda Nobunaga. Nagamasa was head of the Azai clan seated at Odani Castle in northern Ōmi Province and married Nobunaga&#x27;s sister Oichi in 1564, fathering her three daughters – Yodo-dono, Ohatsu, and Oeyo – who became prominent figures in their own right.

Nagamasa became one of Nobunaga&#x27;s enemies in 1570 due to the Azai alliance with the Asakura clan, and fought against Nobunaga at major battles including the Battle of Anegawa. Nagamasa and his clan were destroyed by Nobunaga in August 1573, and he committed &quot;seppuku&quot; during the siege of Odani Castle.

==Early life==
Azai Nagamasa was the son of Azai Hisamasa, from whom he inherited clan leadership in 1560. Hisamasa had been compelled to step down by many of his retainers in favor of his son, Nagamasa. Hisamasa retired, and would later commit suicide along with his son in August 1573. Nagamasa successfully battled both Rokkaku Yoshikata and Saitō Tatsuoki between 1560 and 1565. He is remembered as being a capable commander of troops on the battlefield.
He married Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s sister Oichi in 1564. Nobunaga desired peaceful relations with the Azai clan because of their strategic position in between Oda clan land&#x27;s and the capital, Kyoto.

==Conflict with Oda Nobunaga==
In 1570, Oda Nobunaga declared war on the Asakura family of Echizen and besieged Kanegasaki castle. The Asakura and Azai had been allies since the time of Nagamasa&#x27;s grandfather. This sudden war between two Azai clan allies is reported to have divided the clan. Many retainers wished to honor the alliance with the Asakura, while Nagamasa himself is reported to have favoured staying neutral, essentially siding with Nobunaga. In the end, the Azai clan chose to honor the generations-old alliance with the Asakura and came to their aid. Initially, this decision caused Nobunaga&#x27;s army, which was marching upon the Asakura&#x27;s lands, to retreat back to Kyoto. However, within a few months the forces of Nobunaga were again on the march, but this time they marched on Azai lands.

===Battle of Anegawa===

In the summer of 1570, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu brought an army estimated between 20,000-30,000 men into Northern Omi. The Azai called upon their allies, the Asakura, for assistance. The Asakura responded by sending troops. In either June or July, the two sides met at the battle of Anegawa. The combined Azai and Asakura force numbered between 15,000-20,000 men. The outcome is recorded elsewhere, but briefly: The battle was strongly contested by both sides. Nobunaga is recorded as having decided that his force should directly confront the numerically inferior Azai clan force, while Ieyasu would engage the Asakura. While the Oda were being held at bay, and perhaps even slowly losing ground to the Azai - who had fought against numerically superior forces in the past - Ieyasu&#x27;s force was apparently quickly gaining the advantage against the Asakura. Ieyasu, or perhaps one of his battle commanders, decided to send part of the Tokugawa force into the Azai flank, forcing the Azai to retreat, and guaranteeing victory. However, the battle was strategically indecisive because the Oda shortly withdrew.

==Death==
Over the course of the next two years, with the exception of occasional interventions by the Shogun, Azai Nagamasa was under constant threat of Nobunaga aggression into Omi. Often these threats manifested into sieges of the Azai capital of Odani. During this period the Azai are seen as being loosely aligned with numerous anti-Oda forces, including the Asakura, the Miyoshi, the Rokkaku, and several religious complexes.

===Siege of Odani Castle===

In July 1573, Nobunaga laid siege to Odani Castle. Although the Asakura clan sent a relief force, Nobunaga defeated this force and chased the Asakura into their lands. Shortly thereafter, the Asakura were destroyed. Nobunaga then returned south to prosecute the siege of Odani Castle.

Nagamasa had no hope of winning, and chose to commit seppuku. Before dying, he entrusted his wife Oichi and their three daughters to Nobunaga.

Nobunaga later convinced Oichi to tell him where she had sent her infant son and Nagamasa&#x27;s male heir, Manpukumaru, saying that he wanted the boy to live with and raise him. However, Nobunaga had Hideyoshi execute Manpukumaru, and the head was displayed on a stake. Nobunaga ensured that his sister, Oichi, was uninformed of this but she eventually came to that suspicion. There are reports that Nobunaga bore a strong grudge against Nagamasa for his perceived betrayal of their alliance even though it was he who broke the agreement first. It has also been reported that Nobunaga had the skulls of Nagamasa, Hisamasa, and the Asakura leader lacquered so that they could be used as cups, but whether this is historically accurate or merely fabricated to heighten Nobunaga&#x27;s reputation is debatable.

<doc id="366836" wikidata="Q33190" url="?curid=366836" title="Buginese language">
<text>Buginese or Bugis (Buginese: ) is a language spoken by about 4 million people mainly in the southern part of Sulawesi, Indonesia.

==History==

The word Buginese derives from the word &quot;Bugis&quot; in Malay. In Buginese, it is called while the Bugis people are called . According to a Buginese myth, the term is derived from the name to the first king of Cina, an ancient Bugis kingdom, . basically means &#x27;the followers of La Sattumpugi&#x27;.

Little is known about the early history of this language due to the lack of written records. The earliest written record of this language is Sureq Galigo, the epic creation myth of the Bugis people.

Another written source of Buginese is Lontara, a term which refers to the traditional script and historical record as well. The earliest historical record of Lontara dates to around the 17th century. Lontara records have been described by historians of Indonesia as &quot;sober&quot; and &quot;factual&quot; when compared to their counterparts from other regions of Maritime Southeast Asia, such as the &quot;babad&quot; of Java. These records are usually written in a matter-of-fact tone with very few mythical elements, and the writers would usually put disclaimers before stating something that they cannot verify.

Prior to the Dutch arrival in the 19th century, a missionary, B. F. Matthews, translated the Bible into Buginese, which made him the first European to acquire knowledge of the language. He was also one of the first Europeans to master Makassarese. The dictionaries and grammar books compiled by him, and the literature and folklore texts he published, remain basic sources of information about both languages.

Upon colonization by the Dutch, a number of Bugis fled from their home area of South Sulawesi seeking a better life. This led to the existence of small groups of Buginese speakers throughout Maritime Southeast Asia.

==Classification==
Buginese belongs to the South Sulawesi subgroup of the Austronesian language family. Within the South Sulawesi subgroup, it is most closely related to Campalagian and the Tamanic outlier in West Kalimantan.

==Geographical distribution==
Most of the native speakers (around 3 million) are concentrated in South Sulawesi, Indonesia but there are small groups of Buginese speakers on the island of Java, Samarinda and east Sumatra of Indonesia, east Sabah and Malay Peninsula, Malaysia and South Philippines. This Bugis diaspora is the result of migration since the 17th century that was mainly driven by continuous warfare situations. (Dutch direct colonization started in the early 20th century.)

== Phonology ==
Buginese has six vowels: , , , , , and the central vowel .

The following table gives the consonant phonemes of Buginese together with their representation in Lontara script.


When Buginese is written in Latin script, general Indonesian spelling conventions are applied: is represented by , by , by , by . The glottal stop is usually represented by an apostrophe (e.g. &#x27;child&#x27;), but occasionally is also used. and are usually uniformly spelled as , but is often written as to avoid ambiguity.

==Grammar==
===Pronouns===
Buginese has four sets of personal pronouns, one free set, and three bound sets:

The enclitic set is used with subjects of intransitive verbs, and objects of transitive verbs. The proclitic set is with subjects of transitive verbs. The suffixed set is primarily used in possessive function.

===Aspects===
The following are grammatical aspects of the language:

====Examples====

Example of usage:
{{fs interlinear|lang=bug|indent=3

==Writing system==
{{main|Lontara alphabet}}
Buginese was traditionally written using the Lontara script, of the Brahmic family, which is also used for the Makassar language and the Mandar language. The name Lontara derives from the Malay word for the palmyra palm, {{lang|ms|lontar}}, the leaves of which are the traditional material for manuscripts in India, South East Asia and Indonesia. Today, however, it is often written using the Latin script.

===Buginese lontara===
The Buginese lontara (locally known as {{lang|bug-Latn|Aksara Ugi}}) has a slightly different pronunciation from the other lontaras like the Makassarese. Like other Indic scripts, it also utilizes diacritics to distinguish the vowels {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[ə]}} from the default inherent vowel {{IPA|/a/}} (actually pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}}) implicitly represented in all base consonant letters (including the zero-consonant &quot;a&quot;).

But unlike most other Brahmic scripts of India, the Buginese script traditionally does not have any virama sign (or alternate half-form for vowel-less consonants, or subjoined form for non-initial consonants in clusters) to suppress the inherent vowel, so it is normally impossible to write consonant clusters (a few ones were added later, derived from ligatures, to mark the prenasalization), geminated consonants or final consonants.

==Dialects and subdialects==
The Bugis still distinguish themselves according to their major precolony states (Bone, Wajo, Soppeng and Sidenreng) or groups of petty states (around Pare-Pare, Sinjai and Suppa.) The languages of these areas, with their relatively minor differences from one another, have been largely recognized by linguists as constituting dialects: recent linguistic research has identified eleven of them, most comprising two or more sub-dialects.

The following Buginese dialects are listed in the &quot;Ethnologue&quot;: Bone (Palakka, Dua Boccoe, Mare), Pangkep (Pangkajane), Camba, Sidrap (Sidenreng, North Pinrang, Alitta), Pasangkayu (Ugi Riawa), Sinjai (Enna, Palattae, Bulukumba), Soppeng (Kessi), Wajo, Barru (Pare-Pare, Nepo, Soppeng Riaja, Tompo, Tanete), Sawitto (Pinrang), Luwu (Luwu, Bua Ponrang, Wara, Malangke-Ussu).

<doc id="366838" wikidata="Q225562" url="?curid=366838" title="Battle of Shizugatake">
<text>The took place during the Sengoku period of Japan between Toyotomi Hideyoshi (then Hashiba Hideyoshi) and Shibata Katsuie in Shizugatake, Ōmi Province over a period of two days beginning on the 20th day of the fourth month of Tenshō 11 (equivalent to 10-11 June 1583 on the Gregorian calendar). Katsuie supported Oda Nobutaka&#x27;s claim as successor of Oda Nobunaga in a succession dispute within the Oda clan that benefitted Hideyoshi. 

Katsuie and Sakuma Morimasa attacked fortifications loyal to Hideyoshi at Shizugatake, defeating Nakagawa Kiyohide, but the other sieges by Toshiie and Kazumasu stalled. Katsuie ordered Sakuma to retreat but was ignored, and Hideyoshi launched a surprise counterattack that routed Sakuma and forced him to retreat. Hideyoshi pursued Sakuma and successfully besieged Kitanosho Castle which led to the suicide of Katsuie and Oichi.

The Battle of Shizugatake allowed Hideyoshi to consolidate his position as Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s successor, and was one of the last challenges to his rule along with the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584. George Sansom states the Battle of Shizugatake &quot;must be regarded as one of the decisive battles in Japanese history.&quot;

==Background==
===Kiyosu conference===
In June 1582, Oda Nobunaga, the most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; in Japan, and his eldest son and heir Oda Nobutada were killed at the Honno-ji Incident after being betrayed by Akechi Mitsuhide. Their surprise deaths created a power vacuum and a succession crisis within the Oda clan. Nobunaga&#x27;s second and third eldest sons, Oda Nobukatsu and Oda Nobutaka, respectively, began to quarrel over who would succeed him. Nobunaga&#x27;s retainer and general Hashiba Hideyoshi (later known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi) summoned a council to Kiyosu Castle to settle the succession issue. However, the council declared that Nobutada&#x27;s 3-year-old son Oda Hidenobu was the rightful heir. Hideyoshi, having defeated Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki and with Nobunaga&#x27;s heir being an infant, was in a very strong position to unofficially succeed Nobunaga himself. Shibata Katsuie, one of Nobunaga&#x27;s trusted generals, challenged Hideyoshi by changing his initial support for Hidenobu to supporting Nobutaka&#x27;s claim to the lordship.

==Battle==

In May 1583, Katsuie coordinated a number of simultaneous attacks on Shizugatake, a series of forts in northern Ōmi Province, located in present-day Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture. These forts, Iwasaki-yama, Tagami, and Shizugatake, were held by Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals including Nakagawa Kiyohide and Takayama Ukon. Katsuie&#x27;s nephew Sakuma Morimasa attacked these forts on his orders, taking Iwasaki-yama and killing Nakagawa, but Shizugatake&#x27;s defenses held. On hearing that Hideyoshi had made camp at Ōgaki with a large mounted force of 20,000 men, Katsuie ordered Sakuma Morimasa to withdraw his troops to Ōiwa. Sakuma did not heed Katsuie&#x27;s orders, calculating the castle would fall before Hideyoshi&#x27;s army, assumed to be at least three days away, could arrive to relieve them. However, in midst of this fighting, the army led by Maeda Toshiie on the Shibata side, deployed on Mt. Shige, abruptly left the front lines. Later, Hideyoshi led his men on a forced march through the night, covering nearly 50 miles in 6 hours, and linked up with the defenders of Tagami. Sakuma ordered his men to break the siege lines and prepare to defend themselves, but Hideyoshi&#x27;s army pushed Sakuma&#x27;s forces into a rout.

After the armies of Fuwa Naomitsu and Kanamori Nagachika on the Shibata side began to retreat as well, Hideyoshi pursued Sakuma and his forces back to Katsuie&#x27;s fortress at Kitanosho Castle in Echizen Province, located within present-day Fukui. Hideyoshi&#x27;s men seized the castle after three days, but not before Katsuie killed members of his household including his wife, Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s sister Oichi, then setting the castle keep on fire and committing &quot;seppuku&quot;. Sakuma was captured by Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces and beheaded. 

==Aftermath==

As a result of the battle, Oichi&#x27;s young daughters with Azai Nagamasa (Katsuie&#x27;s step-daughters) were allowed to leave Kitanosho Castle unscathed and became Hideyoshi&#x27;s adoptive daughters. In June 1583, Oda Nobutaka was soon pressured by both Hideyoshi and Nobukatsu into committing suicide, eliminating him from the competition. Nobutaka wrote a death poem cursing Hideyoshi and implying that he had been involved in his father Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s death. 

Hideyoshi had now consolidated his position and most of his influence over the Oda clan, but would continue to face competition from Nobukatsu, who had allied himself with Tokugawa Ieyasu, until the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584.

==Seven Spears of Shizugatake==
Hideyoshi&#x27;s chief seven generals in the battle at Shizugatake earned a great degree of fame and honor, and came to be known as the &quot;shichi-hon yari&quot; or &quot;Seven Spears of Shizugatake&quot;. Among these generals were men who would later become some of Hideyoshi&#x27;s closest retainers, such as Katō Kiyomasa.

The Seven Spears of Shizugatake were the following Samurai:
*Wakizaka Yasuharu (1554–1626)
*Katagiri Katsumoto (1556–1615)
*Hirano Nagayasu (1559–1628)
*Fukushima Masanori (1561–1624)
*Kasuya Takenori (1562–1607)
*Katō Kiyomasa (1562–1611)
*Katō Yoshiaki (1563–1631)

==Notable warriors==
*Menjō Katsuteru (? –1583), swordsman killed in the Battle of Shizugatake
*Ishida Mitsunari (1559–1600)
According to the &quot;Hitotsuyanagi Kaki,&quot; Ishida Mitsunari was in charge of a mission to spy on Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s army and also performed a great feat of Ichiban-yari, being the first to thrust a spear at an enemy soldier, as one of the warriors on the front line.

*Otani Yoshitsugu (1558–1600)
Yoshitsugu was said to have taken part within the Toyotomi ranks. 
One account states that Otani Yoshitsugu was the one who used his wits to convince Shibata Katsutoyo to surrender prior to the battle.

<text>was the Sengoku era head of the Azai clan. Sukemasa was a retainer of the Kyōgoku clan but when the Kyōgoku clan declined for conflicts over the succession, the Azai clan came to power with Sukemasa as its daimyō.

After Sukemasa died, his son Azai Hisamasa became the head of the clan in 1542, but unlike his father, he was never a strong leader. Losing domains against Rokkaku clan, he instead became a Rokkaku retainer.

<text>Maureen Anne McTeer is a Canadian author and lawyer, married to Joe Clark, the 16th Prime Minister of Canada.

==Family and education==
McTeer was born to John and Bea McTeer. Her father taught her and her older sister, Colleen, to play hockey, resulting in McTeer&#x27;s childhood dream of playing in the NHL. Her commitment to feminism was born when her father reminded her that girls do not play in the NHL. She switched her focus to her academic and debating talents, which earned her a scholarship to the University of Ottawa. She earned an undergraduate degree in 1973 and a law degree in 1976, both from Ottawa, where she served as features editor of the student newspaper, &quot;The Fulcrum&quot;, and was a member of the English debate team and the Progressive Conservative Campus Club. McTeer was later awarded an MA in biotechnology, law and ethics from the University of Sheffield, and in 2008 she received an honorary LLD from that institution.

==Wife of the prime minister==
McTeer worked as a staffer in Clark&#x27;s office before marrying him in 1973. When Clark became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1976, McTeer became controversial for keeping her own surname and maintaining her own career. At one official luncheon for Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, where McTeer was seated with the guest of honour, the other women at the table teased McTeer by addressing her always as &quot;Mrs. Clark&quot;. The Queen Mother, however, did not, and after McTeer escorted the Queen Mother to her car, the latter said &quot;Don&#x27;t be bothered by criticism,&quot; and, left as parting words: &quot;Good Luck … Ms. McTeer.&quot; As of 2022, McTeer remains the only wife of a Canadian prime minister not to assume any part of her husband&#x27;s surname; although both Laureen Teskey Harper and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau had kept their own birth surnames in their earlier years of marriage, but shifted to using their husbands&#x27;s surnames upon assuming the role of prime minister&#x27;s spouse, in part &quot;because&quot; of the controversy McTeer experienced.

==Career==
Maureen is a lawyer, specializing in health policy. She has also been a professor at various universities. In the 1988 federal election, McTeer ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in Carleton—Gloucester, hoping to get elected alongside her husband. Despite the party&#x27;s re-election victory, McTeer was not elected in her riding, coming second to the Liberal candidate, Eugène Bellemare. As of 2023, however, she remains the only spouse of a former Canadian Prime Minister to have run for political office herself.

McTeer was also a professor and taught at the Universities of Dalhousie, Calgary and British Columbia in Canada, and was a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. McTeer was also a distinguished scholar in residence at American University in the Government department and lectured at George Mason University. McTeer is also the author of three books, &quot;In my own Name&quot; (2011), her autobiography, &quot;Parliament: Canada&#x27;s democracy and how it works&quot; (1995), and &quot;Residences: Homes of Canada&#x27;s leaders&quot; (1982). McTeer also wrote journals for various academic journals, many on the ethics of health, including euthanasia. Maureen McTeer promoted Frances Itani&#x27;s novel &quot;Deafening&quot; in &quot;Canada Reads 2006&quot;. She promoted its French-language translation, &quot;Une coquille de silence&quot;, in &quot;Le combat des livres 2006&quot;.

==Honours==
In 1982, McTeer and athlete Abby Hoffman were among the organizers of the Esso Women&#x27;s Nationals championship tournament for women&#x27;s ice hockey. One of the tournament&#x27;s trophies, the Maureen McTeer Trophy, is named for her. She was also awarded the DIVA award for Outstanding Contributions to Women&#x27;s Health and Well-Being, and the Hungarian President&#x27;s Cross. She is a specialist in medical law, and for a while was a member of the Royal Commission on Reproductive and Genetic Technologies (1989–1993). She received the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case in 2008. McTeer was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from Carleton University in Ottawa in 2010 and an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law from Acadia University in 2017.

==Personal life==
McTeer and her husband have one daughter, Catherine Clark.

<doc id="366845" wikidata="Q1053037" url="?curid=366845" title="Suō Province">
<text>was a province of ancient Japan in the area that is today the eastern part of Yamaguchi Prefecture. Suō bordered on Aki, Iwami, and Nagato Provinces.

Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Suō was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;yōdō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Suō was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the imperial capital, Kyoto. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Hōfu, Yamaguchi. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Tamanooya Shrine also located in Hōfu. 

==History==
Before the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system, the area of Suō was under control of various semi-independent &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;: Ōshima Kuni (Suō-Ōshima), Suō Kuni (Kumage County, Kuga County), Hakuki Kuni (Kishiki County), Tsunu Kuni (Tono County), and Sawa Kuni (Sawa County) . These were united to form the Ritsuryo province, which initially consisted of five counties: Oshima, Kumage, Tsuno, Sawa, and Kisiki. Kuga County was divided from Kumage in 721 to form the sixth counties. In the Asuka period, the Iwakisan Kōgoishi mountain fortification was constructed against a possible invasion by Tang dynasty China and the Kingdom of Silla in Korean peninsula. Wooden tally strips bearing the name of &#x27;Suho Province&#x27;, &#x27;Shuyō Province&#x27; and &#x27;Suō Province&#x27; have been found at the ruins of Fujiwara-kyō and Heijō-kyō and the names were used interchangeably in Nara period records, such as the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. 

During the Kamakura period, the ruling Hōjō clan were the &quot;shugo&quot; of the province, and were replaced in the Muromachi period by the Ōuchi clan. During the Sengoku period, the Mōri clan supplanted the Ōuchi, and the province became part of the holdings of Chōshū Domain in the Edo Period. Following the Meiji restoration, the province became part of Yamaguchi Prefecture. The area of former Suo Province is now divided between the cities of Hōfu, Kudamatsu, Iwakuni, Hikari, Yanai, Shūnan, Ōshima District, Kuga District, Kumage District, and most of Yamaguchi city (excluding the former Ato Town), and a portion of Ube.


==Meiji period==
Following the Meiji restoration, Suō was divided into six districts. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 295 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 548,861 &quot;koku&quot;.

<text>In the field of bioinformatics, a sequence database is a type of biological database that is composed of a large collection of computerized (&quot;digital&quot;) nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, or other polymer sequences stored on a computer. The UniProt database is an example of a protein sequence database. As of 2013 it contained over 40 million sequences and is growing at an exponential rate. Historically, sequences were published in paper form, but as the number of sequences grew, this storage method became unsustainable.

== Search ==
Searching in a sequence database involves looking for similarities between a genomic/protein sequence and a query string and, finding the sequence in the database that &quot;best&quot; matches the target sequence (based on criteria which vary depending on the search method). The number of matches/hits is used to formulate a score that determines the similarity between the sequence query and the sequences in the sequence database. The main goal is to have a good balance between the two criteria.

== History ==

=== 1950 ===
The need for sequence databases originated in 1950 when Fredrick Sanger reported the primary structure of insulin. He won his second Nobel Prize for creating methods for sequencing nucleic acids, and his comparative approach is what sparked other protein biochemists to begin collecting amino acid sequences. Thus marking the beginning of molecular databases.

=== 1960 ===
In 1965 Margaret Dayhoff and her team at the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) published &quot;&quot;The Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure&quot;.&quot; They put all know protein sequences in the &quot;Atlas&quot;, even unpublished material. This can be seen as the first attempt to create a molecular database. They made use of the newly computerized (1964) Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The team used computers to store the data but had to manually type and proofread each sequence, which had a high cost in time and money.

In 1966 the team released the second edition of the &quot;Atlas,&quot; double the size of the first. It contained about 1000 sequences, and this time was coined as an information explosion. The National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) was on the cutting edge of utilizing computers for medicine and biology at this time. Dayhoff and her team made use of their facilities for determining amino acid sequences of protein molecules in mainframe computers. The number of discovered sequences continued to grow allowing for a deeper comparative analysis of proteins than ever before. This led to many developments such as, probabilistic models of amino acid substitutions, sequence aligning and phylogenetic trees of evolutionary relationships of proteins.

=== 1970 ===

Entire sequencing process became fully automated.

=== 1980 ===
The first nucleotide sequence database was created. Previously known as the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Nucleotide Sequence Data Library (now known as European Nucleotide archive). Human Genome Project began in 1988. The project&#x27;s goal was sequence and map all the genes in a human which required the capability to create and utilize a large sequence database.

=== Present day ===
We now have many sequence databases, tools for using them and easy access to them. One of the largest being GenBank which contains over 2 billion sequences.

=== Timeline ===
== Current issues ==

=== Storage &amp; redundancy ===
Records in sequence databases are deposited from a wide range of sources, from individual researchers to large genome sequencing centers. As a result, the sequences themselves, and especially the biological annotations attached to these sequences, may vary in quality. There is much redundancy, as multiple labs may submit numerous sequences that are identical, or nearly identical, to others in the databases.

Many annotations of the sequences are based not on laboratory experiments, but on the results of sequence similarity searches for previously annotated sequences. Once a sequence has been annotated based on similarity to others, and itself deposited in the database, it can also become the basis for future annotations. This can lead to a &quot;transitive annotation problem&quot; because there may be several such annotation transfers by sequence similarity between a particular database record and actual wet lab experimental information. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting the annotation data from sequence databases.

=== Scoring methods ===
Most of the current database search algorithms rank alignment by a score, which is usually a particular scoring system. The solution towards solving this issue is found by making a variety of scoring systems available to suit to the specific problem.

=== Alignment statistics ===
When using a searching algorithm we often produce an ordered list which can often carry a lack of biological significance.

<text>Joseph Allen &quot;Country Joe&quot; McDonald (born January 1, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter and musician who was the lead vocalist of the 1960s psychedelic rock group Country Joe and the Fish.

== Early life and early career ==
McDonald was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in El Monte, California, in the Los Angeles area. 

His father, Worden McDonald, worked for a telephone company. He was from Oklahoma, the son of a Presbyterian minister of Scottish heritage. His mother, Florence Plotnick, was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants and served for many years as the City Auditor of Berkeley, California.
In their youth, both were Communist Party members and named their son after Joseph Stalin, before renouncing the cause.

In high school McDonald was student conductor and president of the marching band. At the age of 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy for three years and was stationed in Japan. After his enlistment, he attended Los Angeles City College for a year. In the early 1960s, he began busking on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California.

==Music career==

McDonald has recorded 33 albums and has written hundreds of songs over a career spanning 60 years. In 1965, he and Barry Melton co-founded Country Joe &amp; the Fish which became a pioneer psychedelic rock band with their eclectic performances at the Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium, the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, and both the 1969 original and 1979 reunion Woodstock Festivals.
Their best-known song is his &quot;The &quot;Fish&quot; Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die Rag&quot; (1965), a black comedy novelty song about the Vietnam War, whose familiar chorus (&quot;One, two, three, what are we fighting for?&quot;) is well known to the Woodstock generation and Vietnam veterans of the 1960s and &#x27;70s. McDonald wrote the song in about 20 minutes for an anti-Vietnam War play. The &quot;Fish Cheer&quot; was the band performing a call-and-response with the audience, spelling the word &quot;fish&quot;, followed by Country Joe yelling, &quot;What&#x27;s that spell?&quot; twice, with the audience responding, and then, the third time, &quot;What&#x27;s that spell?&quot;, followed immediately by the song. The &quot;Fish Cheer&quot; evolved into the &quot;Fuck Cheer&quot; after the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. The cheer was on the original recording of &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-To-Die Rag&quot;, being played right before the song on the LP of the same name. The cheer became popular and the crowd would spell out F-I-S-H when the band performed live. During the summer of 1968 the band played on the Schaefer Music Festival tour. Gary &quot;Chicken&quot; Hirsh suggested before one of the shows to spell the word &quot;fuck&quot; instead of &quot;fish&quot;. Although the crowd loved it, the management of the Schaefer Beer Festival did not and kicked the band off the tour for life. &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; then canceled a previously scheduled appearance by the band, telling them to keep the money they had already been paid in exchange for never playing on the show. The modified cheer continued at most of the band&#x27;s live shows throughout the years, including Woodstock and elsewhere. In Worcester, Massachusetts, McDonald was arrested for obscenity and fined $500 for uttering &quot;fuck&quot; in public.

McDonald subsequently embarked on a solo career. One of his solo albums, the 1973 Vanguard LP &quot;Paris Sessions&quot;, was reviewed by Robert Christgau in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), in which he said: &quot;Amazing. The man (repeat: man) has written feminist songs that are both catchy and sensible. Despite the real/honest prison poem and the silly, outdated record fan routines, his best in about five years.&quot;
In 2003 McDonald was sued for copyright infringement over his signature song, specifically the &quot;One, two, three, what are we fighting for?&quot; chorus part, as derived from the 1926 early jazz classic &quot;Muskrat Ramble&quot;, co-written by Kid Ory. The suit was brought by Ory&#x27;s daughter Babette, who held the copyright at the time. Since decades had already passed from the time McDonald composed his song in 1965, Ory based her suit on a new version of it recorded by McDonald in 1999. The court, however, upheld McDonald&#x27;s laches defense, noting that Ory and her father were aware of the original version of the song, with the same questionable section, for some three decades without bringing a suit. In 2006, Ory was ordered to pay McDonald $395,000 for attorney fees and had to sell her copyrights to do so.

In 2004, McDonald regrouped with three of the original members of Country Joe and the Fish (Bruce Barthol, David Bennett Cohen, and Gary &quot;Chicken&quot; Hirsh) and they toured the United States and the United Kingdom as the &quot;Country Joe Band&quot;.

In 2005, McDonald joined a larger protest against California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s proposed budget cuts at the California State Capitol Building. Later in 2005, political commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly compared McDonald to Cuban President Fidel Castro, remarking on McDonald&#x27;s involvement in Cindy Sheehan&#x27;s protests against the Iraq War.

In 2015, McDonald (with assistance from Alec Palao), formed The Electric Music Band; the intention of the group was to perform the early psychedelic material of the early career of Country Joe And The Fish. The band has performed 
Electric Music For The Mind And Body in its entirety, and band members include Palao, the Rain Parade&#x27;s Matt Piucci and Derek See of the Chocolate Watchband.

In 2017, McDonald released an album on his own Rag Baby label entitled &quot;50&quot;.

In 2019, McDonald was scheduled to play on Woodstock&#x27;s 50th Anniversary festival, which was cancelled after negotiations between partners failed.

== Personal life ==

McDonald was married to Kathe Werum from 1963 to 1966. 

McDonald has noted that his girlfriend at the time, Janis Joplin, showed much anger for breaking up with her to be with Robin Menken but asked him to write a song about her; the result was &quot;Janis&quot;.

On 31 March 1968, McDonald married Robin Menken, a year after his divorce from Werum. 

In 1968, Menken gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Seven Anne McDonald, in San Francisco. Seven had a career as a TV child actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, managed Johnny Depp&#x27;s Viper Room nightclub and the alternative rock band Smashing Pumpkins in the 1990s, and wrote for &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazines in the 1990s and 2000s. Seven was the subject of and inspiration behind the song &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;. 

Seven&#x27;s name was the inspiration behind the character Six on Blossom, cited by Don Reo on PeopleTV special Blossom Cast Reunion aired 2017, timestamp 10:07-10:33. Don&#x27;s son went to school with Seven, Don asked his son if she would be cool with his naming a character Seven, Seven said no, so it was either Six or Eight. 

McDonald has four other children, Devin (b. 1976) and Tara (b. 1980) from his marriage to Janice Taylor, and Emily (b. 1988) and Ryan (b. 1991) from his marriage to Kathy Wright.

McDonald lives in Berkeley, California.

<doc id="366850" wikidata="Q1143202" url="?curid=366850" title="Roque">
<text>Roque ( ) is an American variant of croquet played on a hard, smooth surface. Popular in the first quarter of the 20th century and billed &quot;the Game of the Century&quot; by its enthusiasts, it was an Olympic sport in the 1904 Summer Games, replacing croquet from the previous games.

==Roque court and equipment==

Roque is played on a hard sand or clay 30 by 60 foot (approximately 9 by 19 m) court bordered by a boundary wall, a curb bevelled at the ends to form an octagon. Players use this wall to balls similarly to how billiard balls are played off the cushions of a billiard table.

The wickets, called arches, are permanently anchored in the court. The arches are narrow as in professional six-wicket croquet. The court has ten arches in seven points configured in a double diamond (or figure-8). The two farthest end points and the central point of the figure-8 are double arches (one after the other) while the four side (or corner) points have single arches. Each arch of the double arches at either end of the court count as a separate arch, but the double arches in the center (which are closer together) are scored as a single arch. While in nine-wicket croquet the single central wicket opens up to the length of the court facing the stakes, in roque the double center arches face the sides of the court. Roque uses two stakes: at the head of the court is the &quot;head stake,&quot; the other stake at the far end of the court is the &quot;turning stake.&quot;

The mallets with which the balls are struck have a shorter handle (approx. 24 inches or 60 cm) than croquet mallets. One end of the mallet is surfaced with rubber, the other with wood, plastic, or aluminum.

==Differences from croquet==
The rules of roque are largely similar to those of croquet, with some notable exceptions:

*In roque, a wall marks the boundary of the court off of which the ball may be caromed. There is also a &quot;playing line&quot; 28 inches in from the wall marked in chalk. A player&#x27;s ball which comes to rest between the playing line and the wall is out of bounds and the fouled ball is placed at the point where the ball crossed the line (rather than a point nearest the line as in croquet).
*The hard court surface is &quot;faster&quot; than the grass croquet court, which affects and much as the speed of billiard table cloth affects billiard play.
*Using the rubber side of the mallet, roque players apply spin to a ball to affect its movement, as in billiards.
*In croquet, the two teams are the balls colored red and yellow versus blue and black. In roque, the two teams are red and blue versus black and white. The order of play is red, white, blue, black.
*In roque, the starting player is determined similarly to billiards: each player &quot;&quot; the ball, i.e. shoots it from one end of the court to the other, and the player whose ball is closest to the playing line at the opposite end of the court without touching the opposing wall, arches, or other balls, wins the lag and goes first.
*After the opening lag, the balls are placed on the court at the four boundary line corners nearest the center of the court, with partner balls (red and blue, white and black) diagonally opposite from each other. The playing ball and ball next in sequence occupy the corners at the head of the court, with the choice of corners going to the player who won the lag. The player then attempts to make the first arch through roqueting another ball, caroming into the arch, or by any other lawful means. The player may also forfeit his opening shot.
*While croquet is played with six wickets or nine wickets, roque is played with ten arches configured similarly to nine-wicket lawn croquet. However, the two center arches count as a single arch. Roque has two stakes, as in lawn croquet, the &quot;home stake&quot; and the &quot;turning stake.&quot;
*The double center arches score as a single arch. While the center arches can be made in several successive turns of play, the ball must remain &quot;within limits of center,&quot; have committed no foul, and contacted no live ball.
*After scoring the center arches, the player scores the side (or corner) arches by passing the ball from the corner of the court through the arch heading towards the center of the court, opposite from lawn croquet.
*&quot;A ball is within the limits of the center when any part of it is within the lines of a rectangle circumscribed by laying a straight edge successively against the inside of both stems of each arch, the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the home stake, and the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the turning stake.&quot; Rule 95, Official Rules and Regulations of the American Roque League (1958).
*The double arches at the head and turn of the court count as separate arches and are wider apart than the center arches.
*The most points that can be scored by one side in a game is 32: 16 points per ball (14 points for the arches and 2 points for the stakes).
*Like baseball, roque is played in &quot;innings,&quot; with ten innings per game. The game is over once one side either &quot;stakes out&quot; (thus scoring 32 points) or after ten innings expire. If both teams have the same score after 10 innings, the game ends in a tie (although some tournaments may permit extra innings). Scoring all of the arches in a single inning, thus winning the game outright, is called a &quot;home run.&quot; Some games could, by agreement or tournament rule, be timed.
*In roque, the side (or corner) arches (identified as points 3, 5, 11, and 13) can only be scored by a roquet or continuation shot.
*Unlike croquet, both balls must be staked out in the same turn in order to outright win the game. By necessity, this requires the first ball to be staked out on a roquet shot and the second ball to be staked out on the ensuing continuation shot. Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively &quot;stake-out&quot; an opponent&#x27;s rover in roque.
*Like croquet, roque makes use of deadness. However, unlike American croquet which employs the carryover deadness rule, roque follows the Association rule wherein deadness is cleared after the player&#x27;s turn ends.
*Like croquet, roque players mark their progress on the court by placing colored markers on the arches. However, while croquet traditionally places the marker on the top of the wicket for the first pass-through and on the side of the wicket for the second pass, roque markers were usually placed at the top of the arch and were labeled on one side. The labeled side would be facing the position side.

Roque developed sub-variants, including two-ball roque and royal roque.

==History==

===Historical roque===
The name &quot;roque&quot; was suggested by Samuel Crosby of New York City in 1899, who came to it by removing the initial &quot;c&quot; and final &quot;t&quot; from &quot;croquet.&quot; The National Croquet Association, formed in 1882, thereafter changed its name to the National Roque Association in 1899. &quot;Roque&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;roquet&quot; , the term used in both roque and croquet for the bonus shot a player earns after striking another ball (on which he is not &quot;dead&quot;) with his own.

The American Roque League was founded in 1916 and, after mergers with various other roque entities, it became the centralized roque league on August 20, 1920. It last published its rules in 1959; the National Two Ball Roque Association last published its revised rules in 1961.

===Contemporary roque===
In 2004, the American Roque and Croquet Association suspended tournaments indefinitely as the number of participants at the Nationals had dropped to single figures.

Roque is still played by a small number of people in the United States. An historic roque court in Clinton, Illinois was restored to playing condition in 2013. A roque tournament is held annually in Angelica, New York.

<doc id="366851" wikidata="Q1053727" url="?curid=366851" title="Tajima Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of northern Hyōgo Prefecture. Tajima bordered on Tango and Tanba to the east, Harima to the south, and Inaba to the west. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Tajimao was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;indō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Tajima was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Toyooka. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Izushi Shrine also located in Toyooka. The area of the province was 2099.01 square kilometers.

==History==

===Early history===
The early history of the Tajima region is uncertain. There appear to have been two power centers. The Tajima &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot; ruled in eastern Tajima (present-day Asago District and Yabu District) and are mentioned in the &quot;Kujiki&quot;. They tenuously claimed descent from then legendary Emperor Kaika,and eventually took the surname of &quot;Tajima&quot;. The Chasuriyama Kofun and the Miidani Kofun Cluster are located in their territory. Western Tajima (present-day Mita District) was under the control of the Futakata &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot;, who claimed descent from the rulers of Izumo. At some point, the two areas came under the control the ancient Tanba Kingdom, which was later divided into Tajima, Tango and Tanba. However, since the name &quot;Tajima&quot; appears in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, in an entry dated 675 AD, this division occurred before the formalization of the Japanese provinces.

The &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; states that the provincial capital was located in Keta District, possibly in the Izucho neighborhood of Toyooka city, but the precise location is uncertain. According to &quot;Nihon Koki&quot;, the capital was related to a place called &quot;Kodago&quot;, also in Keta District in the year 804. This appears to correspond the Nyogamori site which has been excavated near the former Hidaka town hall, which is also part of Toyooka city. The site of the Tajima Kokubun-ji (also in Toyooka) is known, and is a National Historic Site. The &quot;Engishiki&quot; records of 927 lists ten major and 106 minor Shinto shrines, with Kono Jinja and Awaga Jinja vying for the title of the &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province.

During the early Muromachi period, the Yamana clan were &quot;shugo&quot; of Tajima province and constructed Konosumiyama Castle as their stronghold. They were later defeated by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. 

===Edo Period===
During the Edo Period, Tango province was somewhat of a backwater, due to its geographical location. The Ikuno silver mine was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory directly administered by the shogunate. Two small domains were established in Tajima under the Tokugawa shogunate. Toyooka Domain was created for Sugihara Nagafusa, who had married a daughter of Azai Nagamasa. In 1658 the line went extinct, and in 1668 the shogunate transferred a cadet branch of the Kyōgoku clan from Tango-Tanabe Domain to Toyooka. Izushi Domain was established for Koide Yoshimasa, the son of one of Ieyasu&#x27;s generals. In 1706, it was awarded to the Sengoku clan, who ruled until the Meiji restoration.

The Yamana clan, formerly rulers of 11 provinces had been reduced in status the Battle of Sekigahara to a small &quot;hatamoto&quot; holding of 6700 &quot;koku&quot; in Shitsumi district. Yamana Toyokuni was allowed to construct a &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; and although it was a poor territory, his descendants opened mines, new rice fields, fostered raising cattle and gradually raided their revenues until 1868, when the reached the 11,000 &quot;koku&quot; level and were allowed to become &quot;daimyō&quot; by the new Meiji government. However, the title was abolished only a few months later, and the Yamana served as imperial governors of &quot;Muraoka Prefecture&quot; until the abolition of the han system in 1871. The final ruler, Yamana Yoshimichi, was ennobled with the &quot;kazoku&quot; title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;).

==Meiji period==
Following the Meiji restoration, each of the domains (Toyooka, Izushi and Muraoka) briefly became prefectures, which were annexed to Sasayama Prefecture in August 1871, transferred to Toyooka Prefecture in December 1871 and incorporated into Hyōgo Prefecture in August 1876. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 620 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 144,312 &quot;koku&quot;. Tajima Province consisted of:

<text>In the 1582 , Toyotomi Hideyoshi laid siege to Takamatsu Castle, which was controlled by the Mōri clan. He diverted a nearby river with dikes to surround and flood the castle. He also constructed towers on barges from which his gunmen could keep up a constant rate of fire and be unhindered themselves by the flooding.

==Background==
On the order of Oda Nobunaga, Hashiba Hideyoshi conquered Chūgoku region, and besieged Takamatsu Castle, defended by Mori&#x27;s vassal, Shimizu Muneharu, in Bitchu Province in the territory of the Mori clan.

==Prelude==
On April 17, 1582, Hideyoshi at last left Himeji Castle for Bitchu in his departure for the front with his 20,000 soldiers. On the way, he watched for the movement of the Ukita clan in Kameyama Castle, where the Ukita clan had resided, making sure that the Ukita clan would take sides with the Oda forces, and entered into Bitchu with 30,000-strong troops, with the addition of Ukita&#x27;s 10,000 soldiers.

==Siege==
On May 17, the Hideyoshi forces besieged the Takamatsu castle with an army of as many as 30,000 troops, led by the Ukita forces. Though they attacked the castle two times, they lost in the face of counterattacks by castle garrisons.

As the battle grew more intense, the Takamatsu garrison received reinforcements from Mōri Terumoto, who brought an army two times larger than Hideyoshi&#x27;s. Additionally, with the 40,000 support troops led by &quot;Mori&#x27;s Two Rivers&quot; approaching, Hideyoshi dispatched a messenger to request aid from Oda Nobunaga, who had just defeated the Takeda clan in Kai Province, to send over support troops. In response, Nobunaga mobilized six of his commanders including Akechi Mitsuhide, whom he planned to lead the resultant army. But Nobunaga gave Hideyoshi strict orders to conquer Takamatsu Castle as soon as possible. Later, Kuroda Yoshitaka offered an idea of using inundation tactics.

Adopting this tactic, Hideyoshi immediately started building an embankment, under the direction of Kuroda Yoshitaka, with support from Hachisuka Masakatsu, Ukita Tadaie, Horio Yoshiharu, Ikoma Chikamasa, Kuwayama Shigeharu, and Toda Masaharu. Meanwhile Asano Nagamasa and Konishi Yukinaga assembled boats and boatmen to make preparations for attacking the castle when it would be floating on a lake.

On June 8, which happened to be in the rainy season, the long-lasting rain swelled the Ashimori river, developing a lake and rendered Takamatsu Castle a solitary island. Takamatsu Castle was flooded by Hideyoshi and nearly fell. This made the provisions of rice for the garrison army decline by cutting their supply lines, and Mori&#x27;s support troops were unable to move. In addition, Asano Nagamasa and Konishi Yukinaga were in charge of naval bombardment on the north side of the castle.

Mori decided to make peace with Hideyoshi. They sent Ankokuji Ekei, for Kuroda Yoshitaka to offer peace negotiations.

==Aftermath==
Hideyoshi soon learned of the Incident at Honnōji and the death of Nobunaga, which encouraged him to end the siege. Hideyoshi made peace overtures with Mori&#x27;s forces, on the condition that Muneharu commit seppuku. Later, Shimizu Muneharu, the castle&#x27;s commander, was forced to commit suicide in a boat on the artificial lake created by the flooding, in full view of both sides.
==Cultural references==
The siege is described and dramatized in the novel &quot;Taiko: An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan&quot;, written by Eiji Yoshikawa and translated to English by William Scott Wilson.

<doc id="366854" wikidata="Q662482" url="?curid=366854" title="Takeda Katsuyori">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; (military lord) of the Sengoku period, who was famed as the head of the Takeda clan and the successor to the legendary warlord Takeda Shingen. He was son-in-law of Hojo Ujiyasu, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hojo clan.

==Early life==
He was the son of Shingen by the daughter of Suwa Yorishige (posthumous name:). Katsuyori&#x27;s children included Takeda Nobukatsu and Katsuchika.

Katsuyori, first known as , succeeded to his mother&#x27;s Suwa clan and gained Takatō Castle as the seat of his domain.

After his elder brother Takeda Yoshinobu died, Katsuyori&#x27;s son Nobukatsu became heir to the Takeda clan, making Katsuyori the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Takeda clan. Takeda Katsuyori built Shinpu Castle, a new and larger castle at Nirasaki and transferred his residence there in 1581.

==Military life==
In 1569, Katsuyori defeated Hojo Ujinobu at Siege of Kanbara

In 1572, Katsuyori successfully took a Tokugawa clan possession in the Siege of Futamata, and participated in the Battle of Mikatagahara against the Oda-Tokugawa alliance.

In 1573, Katsuyori took charge of the Takeda family after the death of Shingen and fought the Tokugawa clan.

In 1574, he captured Takatenjin castle, which even his father had not managed to do. This gained him the support of other members of the Takeda clan.

In 1575, he suffered a terrible loss at the Battle of Nagashino, defeated by one of the earliest recorded uses of volley fire (by Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s 3,000 muskets), and losing a large part of his forces as well as a number of Takeda&#x27;s generals and retainer.

In 1578, Katsuyori incurred the wrath of the Hōjō family by helping Uesugi Kagekatsu against Uesugi Kagetora who was Hōjō Ujiyasu&#x27;s seventh son, adopted by and heir to Uesugi Kenshin, that initiated the Battle of Omosu in 1580 against Hojo Ujimasa.

In 1581, Katsuyori lost Takatenjin fortress by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the siege ended with the deaths of 680 men of Okabe Motonobu garrison.

In 1582, Katsuyori lost Takatō castle by Oda Nobutada, the only Takeda stronghold in Shinano province to put up any resistance to Nobunaga&#x27;s final invasion of Takeda domain, the castle was taken on March the 2nd 1582.

==Death==

After Katsuyori lost Takatenjin fortress and Takatō castle, many clans like Kiso and Anayama withdrew their support for Takeda. The Oda-Tokugawa alliance advanced into Kai Province, and laid siege to Shinpu Castle, Katsuyori was unable to hold the castle with his remaining 300-400 men, so he set fire to Shinpu Castle and fled into the Tenmoku mountain. Later, his forces were destroyed by the combined armies of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, after which Katsuyori, his wife, and his son committed ritual suicide, known as seppuku. It was the end of Takeda clan.

The nun Rikei wrote an account of his wife&#x27;s suicide and, pitying them, wrote several verses in their honour.

== Spouse ==
=== Toyama Fujin ===
Takeda Katsuyori married Toyama Fujin, the adopted daughter of Oda Nobunaga. She died while giving birth to their son Nobukatsu in 1567.

=== Keirin&#x27;in ===
Katsuyori later married Keirin&#x27;in, daughter of Hojo Ujiyasu. They had a son and two daughters. In 1582, when Keirin&#x27;in was 19, Katsuyori was decisively defeated by Oda Nobunaga, and they had to flee. However, Katsuyori was resigned to die and urged her to leave him. She refused and killed herself (&quot;jigai&quot;), along with Katsuyori in the Battle of Tenmokuzan. Both of his sons died in the battle.

<doc id="366855" wikidata="Q897195" url="?curid=366855" title="Brag (card game)">
<text>Brag is an 18th century British card game, and the British national representative of the vying or &quot;bluffing&quot; family of gambling games. It is a descendant of the Elizabethan game of Primero and one of the several ancestors to poker, the modern version just varying in betting style and hand rankings. It has been described as the &quot;longest-standing British representative of the Poker family.&quot;

== History ==
The rules of Brag first appear in 1721 in &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; where it is referred to as &quot;The Ingenious and Pleasant Game of Bragg&quot;, but in fact, it originates in an almost identical game called Post and Pair which is recorded as far back as 1528 (as &quot;Post&quot;) and which, in turn, was descended from Primero. However, Brag introduced a key innovation over Post and Pair: the concept of wild cards known as &#x27;braggers&#x27;. Initially there was just one, the Knave of Clubs; later the Nine of Diamonds was added. In parallel with this early three-stake game, in 1751 Hoyle describes a version of Brag with a shortened pack that only had a single phase – the vying or &#x27;bragging&#x27; round – with special powers for certain Jacks and Nines, thus anticipating the modern single-stake game. In 1825, an early American account of Brag describes a much more elaborate single-stake game with a complex vying procedure. Not until 1860 are rules for both variants published in one compendium, whereby &quot;Three Stake Brag&quot; is virtually unchanged from the earliest rules and the version of &quot;Single Brag&quot; described is less complicated than its American cousin.

In a 1981 survey by Waddingtons, Brag was the fourth most popular card game in Britain. In 1992, Parlett stated that the classic three-stake variant (see Classic Brag below) was defunct; nevertheless, its rules were still being published in 2001.

== Classic Brag ==
The earliest published rules for any form of Brag appear in Richard Seymour&#x27;s 1721 revision of Charles Cotton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot;. They are less than complete, but with the aid of later descriptions, can be reconstructed. The following is based on Seymour, supplemented by &quot;The New Pocket Hoyle&quot; (1810).

Classic Brag is a three-stake game and players ante 3 stakes, one for each phase of the game. Eldest hand deals 3 cards to each player in turn, turning the last card dealt to each player face up. The game phases are:
;Best Card: In the first phase the player with the highest face-up card won the stakes, cards ranking in their natural order from Ace downwards, except that the A outranked the other Aces. 
;Bragging: In the second phase, players passed or vied. The procedure is not detailed, but based on the 1810 Hoyle, beginning with elder hand, players would pass or say &quot;I brag&quot; and place a stake. If a player bragged, he could be challenged by another player matching or raising the stake. If two players wished to challenge, the elder took precedence. Vying continued between the two players until one passed or said &quot;I&#x27;ll see you&quot; or the equivalent whereupon both revealed their hands. A &quot;prial&quot; (or &quot;pair royal)&quot; beat a &quot;pair&quot; which beat a single card. Two &quot;pair royals&quot; were decided by their ranking; likewise two &quot;pairs&quot; and so on. The was a wild card, which could represent any other card, but a natural hand beat a &#x27;wild&#x27; hand i.e. one with the Knave of Clubs. Some circles also admitted the as a wild card. 
;Thirty One: In the third phase, players scored their hands and the first player to reach exactly 31 or, if no-one did, was closest to 31, won the stakes. To that end, courts and Aces scored 10 and pips their face value. Players could improve their hand by drawing a card from the stock, but if they &#x27;drew out&#x27;, i.e. exceeded 31, they lost. If two or more scored the same, they drew again until a winner was established.

== American Brag ==
In 1825, the first American account of Brag appeared in a New York edition of &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games Improved&quot;. This was a far more elaborate variant based solely on the bragging phase of classic Brag.

== Modern Brag ==
Modern Brag, often called Three-Card Brag to distinguish it from its variants, is a single-stake game. Everyone antes, and players are each dealt three cards face down. There is a single round of betting, with action starting to the left of the dealer. Each player has the option of betting or folding. If there was a previous bet, the player must contribute at least that much more to the pot. (Unlike usual poker betting, a player&#x27;s previous money contributed to the pot is ignored.) This betting continues until there are only two players left, at which point either player may double the previous bet to see his opponent. At this point, the two hands are revealed, and the player with the better hand takes the entire pot. If there is a tie, the player who is seeing loses.

For example, with four players A, B, C and D, this situation could occur: Player A bets 2 chips, B folds, C bets 2 chips and D bets 2 chips. In order to stay in, A would have to bet another 2 chips (at least).

===Hand ranks===

Hands generally follow the same sequence as the five-card hands of poker with some variation created by the differing odds of a three-card hand. By convention a prial (three of a kind) ranks first, above a straight flush, despite a prial being marginally more likely than a straight flush. As there are only three cards, four of a kind and a full house are not possible. Note that unlike poker a straight beats a flush, as three-card flushes are more likely than three-card straights, while the reverse is true of five-card poker hands. Special conventions also usually apply that three 3s is the highest-ranking prial, and Ace-2-3 the highest-ranking straight flush. The full probabilities are as follows:

=== Prial ===
In Brag, three-of-a-kind is known as a &quot;prial&quot;, a word derived from &quot;pair royal&quot;. As such, three sevens would be described as &quot;a prial (of) sevens&quot;.

In most versions of Brag the highest prial depends on the variant being played, for instance, in three card Brag the highest prial would be a prial of threes, in seven card Brag it would be a prial of sevens and so on. The only exception to this is in four card brag, where the game is played as a three card game, so the highest prial in this instance would be a prial of threes.

=== Straight ===
In Brag a straight is more commonly called a &quot;run&quot;, and a straight flush is referred to as a &quot;run on the bounce&quot;.

== Variants ==
;Four-card Brag: Players are dealt four cards, and must then choose which card to throw away (place at the bottom of the deck) in order to create the best combination. The game is then played in the same way as three-card brag.
;Five-card Brag. Five cards are dealt, players discarding two.
;Seven-card Brag: Seven cards are dealt, players must choose three cards to play from their hands, or make two hands, with only a successful win if both hands win the pot.
;Nine-card Brag: Nine cards are dealt, players sort these into three sets. Four antes are played, one for each set, and a main pot. Each set is then played out, usually without further betting. The winner of each set takes one lot of antes; if a player wins all three sets they receive the main pot as well, otherwise it remains for the next hand. Players must always play the next best available set they have made. Often a player may be able to make two good sets and a poor third (e.g. prial, straight, ten-high), so players that do not think they will be able to win all three will order their hands to leave themselves with a strong third set to protect the main pot.
;Thirteen-card Brag: Thirteen cards are dealt, from which players must choose three cards to play. Another variation involves making four hands (or the most possible over a certain standard) from the thirteen cards. Four of a kind can also be played, and is usually rewarded by an additional fee to be paid by the other players, apart from any original stake. Players then show their respective best hands, then second best hands, etc., with each winning hand scoring that player a point, or points. Score is kept on a cribbage board, and is usually either a sprint of 10 or so holes, with one point scored for each winning hand, or played over the full length, or street, of the board, with 4 points awarded to the best highest hand, 3 points to the best second-highest hand, etc. Players not on the board by the time someone wins may have to pay double. Winnings are either a pre-arranged fixed amount from each loser to the winner, or paid proportionate to how far behind the winner they finish. Any player winning all four hands in any round is said to have crashed, and automatically wins the entire game. In some regions the game is known as Crash.
;Fifteen card Brag: A normally non-gambling related variant, played as a family game. Each player is dealt fifteen cards, from which they make five three-card tricks. Each player must then lay their tricks down in order, highest first. The winner is the one who wins the most tricks. This variant has a much higher likelihood of more powerful tricks, due to the extra cards. This version can also be played with 10 cards and one card is discarded.
;Stop the Bus: Three cards are dealt to each player, and three face-up communal cards are dealt. Players take turns at exchanging one or all (but not two) of their cards for any or all of the communal cards. Play continues until one player &#x27;sticks&#x27;, or &#x27;knocks&#x27;, meaning that they are happy with their hand. All the remaining players then exchange one last time before hands are compared. The player with the lowest hand is out, or loses a life.
;Faras: Also known as (literally &#x27;three cards&#x27; in Hindi). A variant of the game very popular in Trinidad, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, and played with numerous local variations.

Some of these rules can also lead to games, especially heads-up, becoming tactical, with players avoiding making their best hand until their hand is forced into that last exchange by another player sticking, risking that the card that completes their hand isn&#x27;t taken by another player in the meantime.

==Betting blind==
Players also have the option of playing blind (betting without looking at their cards). A blind player&#x27;s costs are all half as much as an open (non-blind) player&#x27;s. However, an open player may not raise or see a blind player. If all other players fold to a blind player, at least two variations exist - either the blind player takes the pot and the next round continues as normal; or alternatively, the pot remains, everyone re-antes, and the blind player gets to keep his hand for the next round (in addition to the new one he is dealt). At any time, a player with two blind hands may look at one of them and decide whether to keep it or throw it away. If he keeps it, he throws away the other hand and is considered open. If he throws it away, he keeps the other hand and is still blind. If everyone folds to a blind player with two hands, he must throw away one without looking. As with many rules in card games, regional differences apply to this rule.

==Shuffling==
Another unusual custom of Brag is that the deck is rarely shuffled. Unless a hand is seen and won by a prial, the cards from the hand are just placed on the bottom of the deck, and the next hand is dealt without shuffling.

<doc id="366862" wikidata="Q954511" url="?curid=366862" title="Tanba Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of central Kyoto and east-central Hyōgo Prefectures. Tanba bordered on Harima, Ōmi, Settsu, Tajima. Tango, Wakasa, and Yamashiro provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Tanba was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;indō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Tanba was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital is believed to have been located in what is now the city of Kameoka, although the exact location remains uncertain. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Izumo-daijingū also located in Kameoka. The province had an area of .

==History==
Before the establishment of the Ritsuryō system, the area was under control of the Tanba Kokuzō and included both the Tanba and Tango areas. The province of Tango was created in 713 during the reign of Empress Genmei by separating the northern five districts (Kasa District, Yoza District, Tamba District (later Naka District), Takeno District, and Kumano District) into &quot;Tango&quot;, and the districts closer to the capital as &quot;Tanba&quot;. The Tanba area is rugged, and can be roughly divided into several river basins separated by mountains. For this reason, historically the province has been difficult to govern as a whole. On the other hand, its proximity to the capital gave it a strategic importance. During the Muromachi period, the Hosokawa clan were the &quot;shugo&quot; of the province, but governed through their proxies, the Naito clan. During the late Sengoku period, the province was conquered by Akechi Mitsuhide, and after his defeat by Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Battle of Yamasaki in the aftermath of the assassination of Oda Nobunaga, it was governed by a succession of relatives of the Toyotomi clan. In the Edo Period, Tanba was governed by a mosaic of mostly &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; domains, who were considered more reliable by the Tokugawa shogunate and who could be called upon when necessary for the defense of Kyoto and Osaka.

==Meiji period==
Following the Meiji restoration, Tanba was divided into six districts. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 970 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 331,954 &quot;koku&quot;.

<doc id="366863" wikidata="Q464520" url="?curid=366863" title="Shangri-La">
<text>Shangri-La is a fictional place in Tibet&#x27;s Kunlun Mountains, described in the 1933 novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; by English author James Hilton. Hilton portrays Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia – an enduringly happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live in Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance.

Ancient Tibetan scriptures mention the existence of seven such places as &quot;Nghe-Beyul Khembalung&quot;. Khembalung is one of several Utopia &quot;beyuls&quot; (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) which Tibetan Buddhists believe that Padmasambhava established in the 9th century CE as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife.

== Possible sources for Hilton ==

In a 1936 interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hilton states that he used &quot;Tibetan material&quot; from the British Museum, particularly the travelogue of two French priests, Évariste Régis Huc and Joseph Gabet, to provide the Tibetan cultural and Buddhist spiritual inspiration for Shangri-La. Huc and Gabet travelled a round trip between Beijing and Lhasa in 1844–1846 on a route more than north of Yunnan. Their famous travelogue, first published in French in 1850, went through many editions in many languages. A popular &quot;condensed translation&quot; was published in the United Kingdom in 1928.

== Current claimants ==
Hilton visited the Hunza Valley, located in Gilgit−Baltistan, close to the China–Pakistan border, a few years before &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was published. Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel, and is believed to have inspired Hilton&#x27;s physical description of Shangri-La.

Today various places, such as parts of southern Kham in northwestern Yunnan province, including the tourist destinations of Zhongdian County, claim the title. In 2001, Zhongdian County in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, northwestern Yunnan province, officially renamed to Shangri-la. It is known as &quot;香格里拉&quot; (Xiānggélǐlā) in Chinese, &quot;སེམས་ཀྱི་ཉི་ཟླ།&quot; in Tibetan and &quot;ज्ञानगंज&quot; [gyanganj] in India.

== Non-claimant use of the name ==
Shangri-La was the name given to the presidential retreat Camp David by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, inspired by the mythical place. The modern day name was given to the retreat in 1953 by Dwight D. Eisenhower.

== Searches and documentaries ==

American explorers Ted Vaill and Peter Klika visited the Muli area of southern Sichuan Province in 1999, and claimed that the Muli monastery in this remote region was the model for James Hilton&#x27;s Shangri-La, which they thought Hilton learned about from articles on this area in several &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazines in the late 1920s and early 1930s written by Austrian-American explorer Joseph Rock. Vaill completed a film based on their research, &quot;Finding Shangri-La&quot;, which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a &quot;New York Times&quot; gossip column in which he reveals that his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La, if it is anywhere, is more than 250 km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.

Between 2002 and 2004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton&#x27;s book &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was based on references to the southern Yunnan Province from articles published by National Geographic&#x27;s first resident explorer Joseph Rock.

On 2 December 2010, OPB televised one of Martin Yan&#x27;s &quot;Hidden China&quot; episodes, &quot;Life in Shangri-La&quot;, in which Yan said that &quot;Shangri-La&quot; is the actual name of a real town in the hilly and mountainous region in southwestern Yunnan Province, frequented by both Han and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops and local farmers as they harvested crops, and sampled their cuisine. However, this town was not originally named Shangri-La, but was renamed so in 2001 to increase tourism.

In the &quot;Shangri-La&quot; episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;In Search of Myths and Heroes&quot;, television presenter and historian Michael Wood suggested that the legendary Shangri-La might be the abandoned city of Tsaparang, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of Guge in modern Tibet.

The Travel Channel in 2016 aired two episodes of &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot; that followed host Josh Gates to Lo Manthang, Nepal and its surrounding areas, including the sky caves found there, in search of Shangri-La. His findings offer no proof that Shangri-La is or was real.

<text>Gayo (alternatively rendered as Gajo) is an endangered Austronesian language spoken by some 275,000 people in the mountainous region of the Indonesian province Aceh on the Northern tip of the island of Sumatra, specifically around the Central Aceh, Bener Meriah and Gayo Lues regencies. It is classified as belonging to the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages, but is not closely related to other languages. Ethnologue lists &quot;Bukit&quot;, &quot;Dëret&quot;, &quot;Lues&quot;, &quot;Lut&quot;, and &quot;Serbejadi-Lukup&quot; as dialects.

Gayo is distinct from other languages in Aceh. The art and culture of the Gayo people is also significantly different compared with other ethnic groups in Aceh.

In 1907, G.A.J. Hazeu wrote a first Gayo–Dutch dictionary for the colonial authorities of the Dutch East Indies.

<text>In software development, small matter of programming (SMOP) or simple matter of programming is a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change would in fact require a great deal of effort.

It points out that although the change is clearly possible, it would be very laborious to actually perform. It often implies that the person proposing the feature underestimates its cost.

==Definitions==

The 1983 Jargon File describes an SMOP as follows:

The IBM Jargon Dictionary defines SMOP as:

==Usage==

SMOP was among the &quot;games&quot; described in an article as paralleling the &quot;Games People Play&quot; identified by Dr. Eric Berne in the field of self-help psychology. The game essentially consists of proposing seemingly simple adjustments to a design, leading to unexpected consequences and delays.

Alternative phrases such as simple matter of software or small matter of software are occasionally used in the same manner. However, the phrase is also used without irony to indicate that straightforward software development is all that is required to resolve some issue. This usage is often invoked when the speaker wants to contrast the implied ease of software changes with the suggested greater difficulty of making a hardware change or a change to an industry standard. This non-ironic usage is more often invoked by senior management and hardware engineers, than it is by software engineers.

The term was also explored and expanded upon by computer scientist Bonnie Nardi in her 1993 book &quot;A Small Matter of Programming: Perspectives on End User Computing&quot;.

<doc id="366876" wikidata="Q33424" url="?curid=366876" title="Iban language">
<text>The Iban language () is spoken by the Iban, one of the Dayak ethnic groups who live in Brunei, the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan and in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. It belongs to the Malayic subgroup, a Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

Iban has reached a stage of becoming a koiné language in Sarawak due to contact with groups speaking other related Ibanic languages within the state. It is ranked as Level 5 (i.e. &quot;safe&quot;) in term of endangerment on Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). Since 2024, the Iban language is included in Google Translate under Malaysia domain.

==Classification==
Iban comes from the Ibanic language group spoken in Sarawak, West Kalimantan, and Brunei within Borneo island. part of the Malayic subshoot of the Malayo-Polynesian branch in the Austronesian language family. The Malayic languages originate from western Borneo, thus Iban is closely related to Malay, especially the Sarawakian dialect. Other isolects in the Ibanic group of languages are Sebuyau, Mualang, Kantu, and Seberuang. These groups of languages can be identified by the word-final position in certain lexical forms of /-ai/. These lexical forms are similar to other Malayic languages with lexical forms of /-an/, /-ang/, or, less frequently, /-ar/.

The Iban language is also related to other dialects such as Sebuyau, Kendayan, Balau and Selaku.

== History ==
According to the oral history of the Iban people, Benedict Sandin, in 1968, plotted the ancestry of the Iban people as descendants from the Kapuas Hulu Range, the border of Sarawak-Kalimantan. The Iban people arrived in Sarawak in the 16th century, and settled in the regions of Batang Lupar drainage basin and Undop river in southern Sarawak. From there, they migrated north, east, and west, and expanded into Saribas, Batang Sadong, Batang Layar, and Batang Lupar rivers. In the 1800s, they moved into the Rajang basin (middle region of Sarawak) from Batang Lupar river, Katibas river, and Saribas river (Saribas is a tributary of the Rajang River). By 1870s, they had reached Mukah and Oya rivers. In the early 1900s, they reached Balingian, Tatau, and Kemena rivers (near Bintulu). They also reached the Baram area and Limbang rivers around the same time in northern Sarawak and would become the largest ethnic group in Sarawak.

===Brooke administration===
Fearing that the Iban tribes outnumbered the pre-existing local tribes with detrimental environmental effects on lands intended for shifting cultivation, the Brooke government restricted the Iban people from further migration to other river systems such as the Baleh river. However, the Brooke government allowed the Ibans to settle in other areas such as Lundu, Balingian, Bintulu, Limbang and Baram to consolidate the government&#x27;s authority there. As a result of this policy, several minority ethnic groups such as Bukitans living along the Batang Lupar River were assimilated into the Iban people, thus contributing to the growth of Iban tribe and the expansion of the Iban language in the state. The Iban language was taught in schools in the 1940s during the Brooke era.

===1958-1977: Borneo Literature Bureau (BLB) foundation===
During the period of Crown Colony of Sarawak, the Iban language was used in government official letters, courts, announcements, and notices. Radio Sarawak, started by the British, offered Iban language programmes. The Iban language, known under the name of &quot;Asian language&quot;, was offered as an examination subject in the Sarawak Junior Certificate. The &quot;Asian language&quot; was renamed to &quot;Iban language&quot; in 1963. Borneo Literature Bureau (BLB) was founded by the British in 1958 to collect and document oral Iban literature. BLB published more than 60 Iban language books during its lifetime until 1973 when it was replaced by a Malaysian federal government agency Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) in 1977. After that, the publication of books in Bornean languages came to a halt. The publication of the &quot;Nendak&quot; () magazine, which was started by BLB in 1967 also came to a halt. Jimbun Tawai, the former vice chairman of Sarawak Dayak Iban Association, called this period under Crown Colony as &quot;golden era&quot; of the Iban language.

===1977-2000s post BLB closure===
After the closure of BLB, other smaller publishers continue in this niche such as the Kuching-based publishing company named &quot;Klasik&quot;. Examples of works include &quot;ensera&quot; (Iban epic story) and &quot;cherita kelulu&quot; (morality novellas). Christian churches such as the Catholic church publish prayer books that adopt certain aspects of Iban &quot;adat&quot; (culture). Thus, Christian texts bear greater significance as cultural repositories of the Iban language when to compared to other genres after the demise of BLB.

State-sponsored media such as &quot;Berita Rakyat&quot; was founded in 1974 and ended in the 1990s. The magazine was started by Rajang Security Command (RASCOM) in Sibu to defeat the communists&#x27; activities in the Rajang basin. The magazine stopped publication after the cessation of the communist insurgency in Sarawak in 1990. The state government&#x27;s information department published another magazine named &quot;Pembrita&quot; and aimed to provide developmental news to the rural Iban populace, such as exemplary longhouses, lucrative cash crops, and animal husbandry. The magazine also called on the rural Ibans to modernise their ways of farming. There were no Iban newspapers in the 1990s and early 2000s. The high cost of imported paper materials and low advertising revenues contributed to the difficulties of Iban newspaper publishing.

The Tun Jugah Foundation was established in 1985 after the death of Jugah Barieng, paramount chief of the Iban, to record the oral history of the Iban people, producing Iban dictionaries and surveys of the rural-urban migration of the Iban people.

Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) expanded their Iban radio broadcasts to 10 hours on Sundays and 9 hours on rest of the week by the 1980s as WaiFM Cats FM is the first commercial radio station to broadcast in Iban opening in 1997.

The Iban language was included in the primary school curriculum in 1968 and a few secondary schools in 1988. From 1968 to 1969, teachers&#x27; training colleges offered Iban as an elective subject. It was only in 1988 that Iban was formalised as part of the Malaysian national curriculum. There are no Iban-medium schools in Sarawak. In 2008, Iban was taught as an elective language subject in Malaysian Form 5 secondary schools for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) certificate examination. A survey done in Sarawak in 2008 showed that a total of 367 primary schools and 55 secondary schools have taught the Iban subjects since 1968. The number of primary schools offering the Iban language subject increased to 1,264 in 2015, while the number of secondary schools reduced to 52 in 2015. Most schools have a significant Iban population in the Kapit, Sibu, Sri Aman, and Sarikei Divisions. The Iban language subject is also offered in undergraduate programmes in two teachers&#x27; institutions in Sarawak. In Sultan Idris Education University, Perak, the Iban language is offered as a minor subject for Iban students majoring in Malay studies. The introduction of Iban language subjects in schools results in the standardisation of Iban language spelling, dialect, and pronunciation from regional variations.

In 2003, Malaysian federal authorities banned the Iban-language Bible or &quot;Bup Kudus&quot; as its use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; for God overlaps with the use of Allah as the name of God in Islam. While Christianity is the majority faith of the Iban, Islam has official federal status, which the government argues can &quot;confuse&quot; the Muslim populace in the state. The ban was lifted by the then deputy prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi after persistent protests.

===2010-present: emergence of vernacular mass media===
Newspapers &quot;The Borneo Post&quot; and &quot;Utusan Borneo&quot; started Iban language sections in 2010 and 2014 respectively. The Borneo Post stopped the Iban section in 2017. A monthly Iban magazine named &quot;Pegari&quot; was also published by a small company named PEGARI Iban Production from 2012 to 2018. Borneo Media Solutions, a subsidiary of PEGARI Iban Production, also published several books in Iban language.

RTM opened their first Borneo-oriented channel TVi in 2011 which later became TV Okey in 2018 which includes a 30-minute Iban news slot. TV Sarawak started the Iban language section in October 2020. Iban language support was added to Malaysian domain of Google Translate in 2024.

==Extent of use==
The Iban language is allowed in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly with the special permission from the Speaker and simultaneous interpretations will be provided during the assembly sitting and when written into the Hansard.

Rentap&#x27;s battle cry while fighting against James Brooke in 1860s “Agi Idup, Agi Ngelaban!” (“I will fight as long I will live!”) is adopted by Sarawak Royal Ranger Regiment as their motto. The battle cry is also used in speeches and car stickers to evoke the warrior spirit of the Iban people. The word &quot;Oo-ha&quot;, an Iban call for celebration, was popularised by the former chief minister of Sarawak Adenan Satem as a form of &quot;hello&quot; before giving speeches in order to motivate a crowd. The Chinese-predominant Sarawak United Peoples&#x27; Party used the Iban word &quot;Sa&#x27;ati&quot; (United) as their party slogan. Another Chinese-predominant Sarawak Democratic Action Party has been using the Iban language to garner support from the Iban population. Other words include &quot;Segulai sejalai&quot; (going together) that was selected as the slogan for Malaysian national unity, and &quot;Ngap Sayot&quot; (literally means &quot;eat vegetables&quot;) used by Sarawak FA football team battle cry to signify taking down opponents just like eating vegetables.

Iban churches in Sarawak conduct services in the Iban language.

Trades in the Sarawak bazaars are also frequently conducted in the Iban language.

These words can also act as demonstrative pronouns where they can stands on theirs own, replacing rather than modifying a noun.

Example:

* &#x27;That&#x27;s ok.&#x27;
* &#x27;Look at that.&#x27;

===Demonstrative pronouns===
In Iban, demonstrative pronouns are words that show which person or thing is being referred in relation to the location of the addressee to the speaker. There are three demonstrative pronouns in Iban depending on location to the speaker. They can only be used to refer to an addressee (human) and cannot be used to refer to inanimate objects.

Examples:
* &#x27;Why is this person acting in such a way?&#x27;
* &#x27;Where is he going?&#x27; (Referring to the second closest person to the speaker)
* &#x27;Where is the other (person) one?&#x27; (referring to third person which is the furthest from the speaker)

===Adverbs===

====Demonstrative adverbs====
Demonstrative adverbs in Iban are closely related to the demonstrative pronouns in Iban grammar. For example, corresponding to the demonstrative pronouns are the adverbs such as (&#x27;going here&#x27;), (&#x27;going there&#x27;) and (&#x27;going there (farthest)&#x27;) equivalent adverbs corresponding to the demonstrative pronoun this are , and .

==Vocabulary==
The first Iban-English Dictionary was published in 1900 by Rev. William Howell, an Anglican priest based at Sabu, near Simanggang (Sri Aman) and D.J.S. Bailey, a Brooke administrative officer as &quot;&quot;.

&quot;A Comprehensive Iban-English Dictionary&quot;, jointly published by The Dayak Cultural Foundation and The Tun Jugah Foundation in 2016, contains 31,000 entries and about 1900 pages.

The Iban-Malay dictionary was first published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), in 1989. The second edition was published in 2015. It contains 11,530 entries dan 9,710 subentries.

==Writing system==
According to Iban legend, an ancestor named Renggi devised a writing script on the skin of wood, but it was soaked in water and the writing vanished. Anguished with the tragedy, Renggi munched the script and swallowed it where the script became ingrained in Renggi&#x27;s brain and blood and also his descendants. Since then, the Ibans became adept at memorising oral traditions, just like exactly written in books. Occasionally, the Ibans used personalised symbols as memory aids on their writing boards (&quot;papan turai&quot;). &quot;Papan turai&quot; was used to record ritual poems such as &quot;pengap&quot; and &quot;sabak&quot;.

As the Iban language had no extant writing system of its own, Christian missionaries adopted the Latin alphabet in an attempt to codify the language. &quot;A Sea Dyak Dictionary&quot;, published in 1900, was important in the early development of the Iban as a written language. During the Crown Colony era, the Borneo Literature Bureau also worked on the written form of the Iban language.

From 1947 to 1962, Dunging anak Gunggu invented an Iban syllabary known as the Dunging script. In 2010, Dr. Bromeley Philip of Universiti Teknologi MARA, who is also a grandnephew to Dunging, created digital fonts for Dunging script, named &quot;LaserIban&quot;, available for Windows and Macintosh computers. Dr Bromeley also launched a course to promote the use of LaserIban and had transcribed several traditional folktales from Latin alphabet into Dunging script. However, the Dunging script is not widely adopted. As of 2011, only three people in the world mastered the Dunging script, namely Dr Bromeley himself, longhouse chief Tuai Rumah Bagat Nunui and teacher Ngambong Katoi.

==Dialects==

Iban can be subdivided into different sub-ethnic groups, each of which speak in different dialects. The most formal, intermediate, and working dialect is the Saribas dialect, and mainly Betong and Saratok. Others such as Balau, Sebuyau, Ulu Ai, and Rejang are mutually intelligible throughout the Sarawak region. The exception is the Iban Remun/Milikin dialect, which is still understood by Ibans from other districts. In West Kalimantan, dialects such as Bugau, Seberuang, Mualang, Chengkang, Sebaru, and Dau are more disparate.

<text>The Act of Security 1704 (c. 3), also referred to as the Act for the Security of the Kingdom, was a response by the Parliament of Scotland to the Parliament of England&#x27;s Act of Settlement 1701. Queen Anne&#x27;s last surviving child, William, Duke of Gloucester, had died in 1700, and both parliaments needed to find a Protestant successor. The English Parliament had settled on Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of King James VI and I, without consulting the Scottish Parliament.

The response of the Scottish Parliament was to pass a bill in 1703 requiring that, on the death of Queen Anne without issue, the three Estates of the Parliament were to appoint a Protestant successor from the descendants of the Scottish kings, but not the English successor unless various economic, political and religious conditions were met. The bill was refused royal assent by the Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.

The following year, 1704, the bill became an act after the Scottish Parliament refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s army in the War of the Spanish Succession unless royal assent was given.

The English Parliament retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to cut trade and free movement between the two countries, unless negotiations opened leading either to the repeal of the Act of Security, or (as in the event happened) to an Act of Union. The result was the Union of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, approximately one hundred years after the Union of the Crowns.

The Parliament of Great Britain passed an act, the Repeal of Certain Scotch Acts 1707 (6 Ann. c. 32) explicitly repealing this act together with the Peace and War Act 1703 (c. 6) (S)).

<doc id="366888" wikidata="Q929001" url="?curid=366888" title="Nazarene (sect)">
<text>The Nazarenes (or Nazoreans; ) were an early Jewish Christian sect in first-century Judaism. The first use of the term is found in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 24, ) of the New Testament, where Paul the Apostle is accused of being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes (&quot;&quot;) before the Roman procurator Antonius Felix at Caesarea Maritima by Tertullus. At that time, the term simply designated followers of Jesus of Nazareth, as the Hebrew term (&#x27;), and the Arabic term (&#x27;), still do. 

As time passed, the term came to refer to a sect of Jewish Christians who continued to observe the Torah, in contrast to gentiles who eschewed Torah observance. They are described by Epiphanius of Salamis and are mentioned later by Jerome and Augustine of Hippo. The writers made a distinction between the Nazarenes of their time and the &quot;Nazarenes&quot; mentioned in Acts 24:5.

==Nazarene (title)==

The English term &quot;Nazarene&quot; is commonly used to translate two related Greek words that appear in the New Testament: &quot;Nazōraios&quot; () (&quot;Nazorean&quot;) and &quot;Nazarēnos&quot; (&quot;Nazarene&quot;). The term &quot;Nazōraios&quot; may have a religious significance instead of denoting a place of origin, while &quot;Nazarēnos&quot; () is an adjectival form of the phrase &quot;apo Nazaret&quot; &quot;from Nazareth.&quot;

Because of this, the phrases traditionally rendered as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; can also be translated as &quot;Jesus the Nazarene&quot; or &quot;Jesus the Nazorean.&quot; In the New Testament, the form &quot;Nazōraios&quot; or &quot;Nazaraios&quot; is more common than &quot;Nazarēnos&quot; (meaning &quot;from Nazareth&quot;).

In Arabic however, Nasrani (نصراني), the name given to Christians in the quran can be interpreted as coming from the root verb , meaning victory, or support. The meaning is elucidated on in Surah Al Imran, verse 52 where Jesus asks who will become his supporters (Ansar-i) for the sake of God, the Hawariyun (the Apostles\ Followers) answer that they will become the Ansar. The same root comes in reference to the Ansar, those that sheltered the prophet Muhammad in Medina.

==The Sect of the Nazarenes (1st century)==
The Greek epithet &quot;Nazōraios&quot; is applied to Jesus 14 times in the New Testament, and is used once in Acts to refer to the sect of Christians of which Paul was a leader. It is traditionally translated as &quot;a man from Nazareth&quot;; the plural &quot;Nazōraioi&quot; would mean &quot;men from Nazareth&quot;. The title is first applied to the Christians by Tertullus (), though Herod Agrippa II () uses the term &quot;Christians&quot; which had first been used at Antioch (). The name used by Tertullus survives into Mishnaic and modern Hebrew as &quot;notzrim&quot; () a standard Hebrew term for &quot;Christian&quot;, the name also exist in the Quran and modern Arabic as &quot;naṣārā&quot; (plural of &quot;naṣrānī&quot; &quot;Christian&quot;).

Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 220, ) records that the Jews called Christians &quot;Nazarenes&quot; from Jesus being a man of Nazareth, though he also makes the connection with Nazarites in . Jerome too records that, in the synagogues, the word &quot;Nazarenes&quot; was used to describe Christians. Eusebius, around 311 CE, records that the name &quot;Nazarenes&quot; had formerly been used of Christians. The use relating to a specific &quot;sect&quot; of Christians does not occur until Epiphanius (310/20–403). According to Arnold Ehrhardt, just as Antioch coined the term Christians, so Jerusalem coined the term Nazarenes, from Jesus of Nazareth.

The terms &quot;sect of the Nazarenes&quot; and &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; both employ the adjective &quot;nasraya&quot; (ܕܢܨܪܝܐ) in the Syrian Aramaic Peshitta, from &quot;Nasrat&quot; (ܢܨܪܬ) for Nazareth.

==The Nazarenes (4th century)==
According to Epiphanius in his &quot;Panarion&quot;, the 4th-century Nazarenes (Ναζωραῖοι) were originally Jewish converts of the Apostles who fled Jerusalem because of Jesus&#x27; prophecy of its coming siege. They fled to Pella, Peraea (northeast of Jerusalem), and eventually spread outwards to Beroea (Aleppo) and Basanitis, where they permanently settled (Panarion 29.3.3).

The Nazarenes were similar to the Ebionites, in that they considered themselves Jews, maintained an adherence to the Law of Moses. Unlike the Ebionites, they accepted the Virgin Birth. They seemed to consider Jesus as a prophet, but other attestations from the church fathers might suggest that they also hold on the divinity of Jesus.

As late as the eleventh century, Cardinal Humbert of Mourmoutiers still referred to the Nazarene sect as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. Modern scholars believe it is the Pasagini or Pasagians who are referenced by Cardinal Humbert, suggesting the Nazarene sect existed well into the eleventh century and beyond (the Catholic writings of Bonacursus entitled &quot;Against the Heretics&quot;). It is believed that Gregorius of Bergamo, about 1250 CE, also wrote concerning the Nazarenes as the Pasagians.

===Gospel of the Nazarenes===

The Gospel of the Nazarenes is the title given to fragments of one of the lost Jewish-Christian Gospels partially reconstructed from the writings of Jerome.

===Patristic references to &quot;Nazarenes&quot;===
In the 4th century, Jerome also refers to Nazarenes as those &quot;who accept Messiah in such a way that they do not cease to observe the old Law.&quot; In his &quot;Epistle&quot; 75, to Augustine, he said:

Jerome saw a distinction between Nazarenes and Ebionites, a different Jewish sect, but does not comment on whether Nazarene Jews considered themselves to be &quot;Christian&quot; or not or how they viewed themselves as fitting into the descriptions he uses. He clearly equates them with Filaster&#x27;s Nazarei. His criticism of the Nazarenes is noticeably more direct and critical than that of Epiphanius.

The following creed is from a church at Constantinople at the same period, and condemns practices of the Nazarenes:
&quot;Nazarenes&quot; are referenced past the fourth century CE as well. Jacobus de Voragine (1230–98) described James as a &quot;Nazarene&quot; in The Golden Legend, vol 7. Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) quotes Augustine of Hippo, who was given an apocryphal book called &quot;Hieremias&quot; (Jeremiah in Latin) by a &quot;Hebrew of the Nazarene Sect&quot;, in Catena Aurea — Gospel of Matthew, chapter 27. So this terminology seems to have remained at least through the 13th century in European discussions.

===Nazarene beliefs===
The beliefs of the Nazarene sect or sects are described through various church fathers and heresiologists.

==The Judeo-Nazarenes (7th century)==

Odon Lafontaine, from the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies, hypothesized that this sect survived into the seventh century, when they attempted to precipitate the return of Jesus, as the Messiah of the Apocalypse, by translating their scripture and lectionaries into Arabic, recruiting the local Arab Christians, capturing Jerusalem, rebuilding the Temple, and re-initiating its sacrifices. When Jesus did not return, he concluded that the situation eventually spun out of control, resulting in the development of the Quran and Islam.

==Nasoraean Mandaeans==
Those few who are initiated into the secrets of the Mandaean religion are called &quot;Naṣuraiia&quot; or Nasoraeans/Nasaraeans meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. According to the Haran Gawaita, Nasoraean Mandaeans fled Jerusalem before its fall in 70 CE due to persecution. The word &quot;Naṣuraiia&quot; may come from the root n-ṣ-r meaning &quot;to keep&quot;, since although they reject the Mosaic Law, they consider themselves to be keepers of Gnosis. Epiphanius mentions a group called Nasaraeans (Νασαραίοι, of the Panarion), distinguished from the &quot;Nazoraioi&quot; (). According to Joseph Lightfoot, Epiphanius also makes a distinction between the Ossaeans and the Nasaraeans, the two main groups within the Essenes:

The Nasaraeans may be the same as the Mandaeans of today. Epiphanius says (29:6) that they existed before Christ. That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of this group.

Van Bladel (2017) suggests that the Mandaeans and Nasoraeans were historically separate groups, with the Nasoraeans being a Judeo-Christian priestly baptismal sect from central Mesopotamia that found followers from the indigenous Mandaeans of southern Mesopotamia. According to van Bladel&#x27;s hypothesis, the original Mandaean laypeople had their Mesopotamian temples decimated due to temple pillaging during the Sasanian period and switched to the Nasoraean priests&#x27; religion in order to compensate for the loss of their former religion. However, this hypothesis has been criticized by Predrag Bukovec and other scholars. Bogdan Burtea (2008) has also proposed that the Nasoraeans and Mandaeans may have historically been separate groups.

In the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, the term &quot;Nasoraean&quot; is used to refer to righteous Mandaeans, i.e., Mandaean priests (comparable to the concept of &quot;pneumatikoi&quot; in Gnosticism). As Nasoraeans, Mandaeans believe that they constitute the true congregation of &quot;bnai nhura&quot; meaning &#x27;Sons of Light&#x27;.

==Modern &quot;Nazarene&quot; churches==

A number of modern churches use the word &quot;Nazarene&quot; or variants in their name or beliefs:
* The Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarene), originating in the Swiss Nazarene Baptist movement;
* The Church of the Nazarene, a Protestant Christian denomination that was born out of the Holiness Movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries;

<text>The Brethren Church is an Anabaptist Christian denomination with roots in and one of several groups that trace its origins back to the Schwarzenau Brethren of Germany, and is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.

==Background==
The Brethren church tradition traces its roots back over 300 years to 1708. Eighteenth-century Europe was a time of strong governmental control of the church and low tolerance for religious diversity. Nevertheless, there were religious dissenters who lived their faith in spite of the threat of persecution. Some of these dissenters found refuge in the town of Schwarzenau in present-day Nordrhein-Westfalen in Germany. Among them was Alexander Mack, a miller who had been influenced by both Pietism and Anabaptism.

Religious persecution drove the Brethren to take refuge in Surhuisterveen, Friesland, in the Netherlands. They settled among the Mennonites and remained there until 1729. Eventually all but a handful emigrated to America in three separate groups between 1719 and 1733. Because of growing persecution and economic hardship, Brethren began emigrating to Pennsylvania under the leadership of Peter Becker. Most Brethren left Europe by 1740, including Mack, who brought a group over in 1729. The first congregation in the New World was organized at Germantown, Pa., in 1723. Soon after its formation, the Germantown congregation sent missionaries to rural areas around Philadelphia. These missionaries preached, baptized, and started new congregations.

In 1781 these Brethren adopted the title &quot;German Baptist Brethren&quot; at their Annual Meeting; in 1782 they forbade slaveholding by members.

The group continued to expand and from Pennsylvania, they migrated chiefly westward. By 1908 they were most numerous in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and North Dakota.

==Split and new formation==

Expansion across the continent and changes due to the Industrial Revolution caused strain and conflict among the Brethren. In the early 1880s a major schism took place resulting in a three-way split: The traditional Old German Baptist Brethren, the progressive Brethren Church, and the conservative German Baptist Brethren, who later changed their name to the Church of the Brethren in 1908. In total, in the 21st-century United States, 14 Anabaptist or evangelical Protestant groups survive who descended from the 18th-century Schwarzenau Brethren of Germany.

===Progressive Brethren &quot;Brethren Church&quot;===
The elements constituting the formation of the Brethren Church were historically referred to as progressives and later, by others, as &quot;traditionalists.&quot; Progressives stressed evangelism, advocated for revival meetings, Sunday schools, and foreign missionary work, and objected to plain, non-fashionable distinctive dress, and objected to the supremacy of the annual conferences.

In 1882, progressive leader Henry Holsinger, who was the publisher of &quot;The Progressive Christian&quot;, was disfellowshipped from the Annual Meeting. He and others organized &quot;The Brethren Church&quot; in 1883 at Dayton, Ohio, with about 6000 members. &quot;The Progressive Christian&quot; was renamed &quot;The Brethren Evangelist&quot; and was published quarterly by the church until the end of 2019 when it ceased publication.

The early years after the division were difficult for the new body, yet they quickly went about emphasizing and developing positions that had estranged them from the more conservative Brethren: education, theological training for ministers, the ordination of women, and home and foreign missions. Like many mainstream denominations, between 1913 and 1920 the Brethren Church suffered from the fundamentalism versus liberalism controversy. This was ended in 1921, when the church adopted a conservative statement of faith and practice. Many liberals withdrew to join other denominations more favorable to their positions. The fundamentalist strength developed and played into a later division.

===Split with Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches===
In 1939 the &quot;Progressive&quot; Brethren Church experienced another schism, with those seeking an open position to the issue of eternal security maintaining the name Brethren Church with headquarters in Ashland, Ohio, and those seeking a firm affirmation of eternal security becoming the National Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, since renamed Charis Fellowship, headquartered in Winona Lake, Indiana. An additional issue between the progressive and conservative divide concerned the conversion of Ashland College into a Bible college, where the &quot;traditionalists&quot; wanted it to remain an accredited liberal arts college. The resulting schism effectively divided the denomination along equal lines.

==Affiliations==
The Brethren Church is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.

They are still affiliated with Ashland University and Ashland Theological Seminary (org. 1906) in Ashland, Ohio, where they also maintain international headquarters.

As of 2003, six Brethren bodies meet together in the Brethren World Assembly: Church of the Brethren, Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International, Dunkard Brethren, Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, Old German Baptist Brethren, and The Brethren Church. The first Assembly was held in Pennsylvania in 1992. They met at Elizabethtown College and celebrated the 250th anniversary of the first known Brethren Annual Meeting in 1742. That first meeting gathered near Conestoga in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The second Assembly met in 1998 at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Virginia. The third Assembly was held by Grace College in Winona Lake, Indiana, in 2003. The Assembly represents some 600,000 members around the world.

==Beliefs==

Brethren Beliefs is a compilation of three popular Brethren Church documents. This single booklet contains the complete original contents of &quot;A Centennial Statement,&quot; &quot;How Brethren Understand God&#x27;s Word,&quot; and &quot;Brethren Positions on Social Issues.&quot; All three of these publications are now combined under one cover for ease of use, cost efficiency, and as an encouragement to utilize all three consistently.

===Three negatives===
Brethren adhere to the &quot;three negatives.&quot; According to &quot;A Centennial Statement,&quot;
Obedience to Christ is the center of Brethren life. This conviction has led the Brethren historically to practice non-conformity, non-resistance, and non-swearing. In non-conformity, Brethren have sought to follow the way of Christ in contrast to the way of the world. In non-resistance, Brethren have renounced the Christian&#x27;s use of violence in combating evil, striving, as far as possible, to be reconciled to all persons. In non-swearing, Brethren have sought to lead such trustworthy Christian lives that oath-taking becomes unnecessary. Every believer must live in a way that exhibits to the world the truth and love of Christ.
===Military and non-violence===
As a denomination within the peace church movement, it still holds strongly to its pursuit of peace, but within the denomination there are many different interpretations of how this peaceful lifestyle should be lived out. Twentieth-century Brethren continue to uphold the ideal of peace, but the church embraces persons of opposing convictions concerning the role and means of &quot;peacemaking&quot;. The Brethren Church is also the only Anabaptist denomination currently with a history of supporting non-combatant military chaplains. According to their website,
On the one hand, some Brethren understand peacemaking as a practice of nonresistance or nonviolence, following Jesus in loving our enemies. Brethren annually reaffirm that historic position as a nonresistant peace church and, as such, provide counsel and support for those persons who, as a matter of personal conscience, hold a conviction of nonresistance. On the other hand, some Brethren understand peacemaking as the responsibility of the state to use force, to defend against and deter evil. These Brethren affirm the role of the state to maintain peace and deter aggression through force and a strong national defense by sanctioning chaplains in all branches of military service and providing counsel and support for those who, as a matter of personal conscience, hold to the conviction of strong military defense or &quot;resistance.&quot; ...Our role as peacemakers may be in dispute, but the goal of peace is undeniable.
Consequently, Brethren oppose tyranny, injustice, exploitation, and dehumanization as interpreted from a biblical perspective whenever and wherever they exist. Their materials specifically call for political action, working within the system to vote against candidates or policies which support oppression. In addition to calling Brethren to prayer for peace, they advocate for non-violent resistance in exposing oppression and injustice by raising questions and drawing attention to such evils. Brethren stand to encourage the US government to reduce the threat of all war and to pursue peace through all possible diplomatic means. Brethren encourage the government to pursue peace through summits, diplomatic talks, and negotiations to decrease the use of weapons and warfare. Additionally, Brethren stand to maintain the US military for the purposes of defense and deterrence of aggression only and maintain that the US should avoid being the aggressor in military action.

The history of the denomination is rife with stories of conscientious objection.

==Members==
The Brethren Church had 17,042 members in 1906, 24,060 in 1916, 26,026 in 1926 and 30,363 in 1936. In 1939 with the founding of the National Fellowship of Brethren Churches, now the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, some 17,000 members left the Brethren Church. In 1956 there were 18,697 members, in 1964 18,013, in 1976 15,920, in 1984 14,229 and in 1996 13,746.

In 2006, the Brethren Church had 10,387 members and 119 churches. Membership is strongly concentrated in three states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, but also exist in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wyoming, Arizona, California &amp; Kansas.

<text>Roots of Peace is a humanitarian organization dedicated to the removal of landmines and the subsequent replanting and rebuilding of war-torn regions. Founded in 1997 by Heidi Kuhn, the goal of Roots of Peace is to turn minefields into farmland and support victims of landmine accidents. The organization is funded by private and public funding, including the California Wine Industry, and is based in San Rafael, California.

On May 1, 2002, Roots of Peace began removing landmines in the Shomali Plain north of Kabul in Afghanistan. In 2003, Roots of Peace began a major replanting campaign targeted at revitalizing Afghanistan’s table grape industry. The organization is also working in other countries such as Cambodia, Croatia and Iraq. It is supported by the United Nations, the United States State Department, and other commercial entities such as Warner Brothers and Palm, Inc.

Roots of Peace received the Skoll Foundation Award for Social Entrepreneur 2006. This award for $765,000 was presented by Jeffrey Skoll, Founder of eBay, Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley and Al Gore at the Said International School of Business in Oxford, England. 

Roots of Peace has raised the necessary funds to remove landmines in the Shomali Plains and empowered Afghan farmers to harvest/export over 90,000 metric tons of fresh grapes and raisins to India, Pakistan, Dubai, Ukraine, and Russia. This MINES TO VINES initiative has successfully replaced the scourge of landmines in the Shomali Plains region of Afghanistan with the bountiful nectar of grapes. 

On May 11, 2023, Roots of Peace founder Heidi Kuhn was named the 2023 World Food Prize Laureate.

<doc id="366897" wikidata="Q1054331" url="?curid=366897" title="Tango Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of northern Kyoto Prefecture. Tango bordered on Tanba to the south, Tajima to the west, and Wakasa to the east. Its abbreviated form name was . It was also referred to as or . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Tango was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;indō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Tango was ranked as one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Miyazu. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Kono Shrine also located in Miyazu. The province had an area of .

==History==

===Early history===
The Tango region prospered around the Takeno River basin (present-day Kyōtango city) during the Kofun period, during which time many keyhole-shaped burial mounds were constructed. As coins from the Xin dynasty of northern China have been found in the from the Hakoishihama Site in Kumihama, Kyōtango, it is clear that the area had trade connections with the Asian continent. Also, in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, when the Yamato Kingdom sent four generals in four directions to conquer the country, ancient Tanba was the only specific destination mentioned, highlighting its importance to the Yamato rulers as a transportation center towards Asia.

The province of Tango was created in 713 during the reign of Empress Genmei by separating the northern five districts (Kasa District, Yoza District, Tamba District (later Naka District), Takeno District, and Kumano District) of northern Tanba Province. In &quot;Wadō 5&quot; (712), Mutsu Province had been severed from Dewa Province. The &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; lists 35 townships in the area, and states that the area was ruled by the Tanba-no-atai clan, who were the &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot;. Per the &quot;Kujiki&quot;, this clan claimed descent from the &quot;kami&quot; Amenohoakari,who was either the younger brother or son of Ninigi-no-mikoto. The provincial capital was located in Kasa District, possibly in the Fuchū neighborhood of Miyazu, but the precise location is uncertain. The site of the Tango Kokubun-ji (also in Miyazu) is known, and is a National Historic Site. The &quot;Engishiki&quot; records of 927 list seven major and 58 minor Shinto shrines, with Kono Jinja as the &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province.

During the early Muromachi period, the Yamana clan were &quot;shugo&quot; of Tango province, but they were supplanted by the Isshiki clan in 1392. The Isshiki ruled until replaced by Hosokawa Fujitaka in 1579, who constructed Tanabe Castle, also known as “Maizuru Castle” under orders of Oda Nobunaga.

===Edo Period===
In 1600, the Hosokawa clan was transferred to Kyushu and all of Tango Province was awarded to Kyōgoku Takatomo, who established Miyazu Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1622, he divided his 123,000 &quot;koku&quot; holdings, with 35,000 &quot;koku&quot; going to his third son, Kyōgoku Takamitsu,who established a cadet branch at Tango-Tanabe Domain and 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; to a grandson, Kyōgoku Takamichi,who established Mineyama Domain. This proved a wise decision, as in 1666 The Kyōgoku clan was dispossessed of Miyazu Domain for bad administration, and reduced to &quot;hatamoto&quot; status. Miyazu Domain was reduced in size and passed to a number of &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; clans until 1758 when it came under the control of the Honjō-Matsudaira clan. Tango-Tanabe Domain fared better in that it remained in Kyōgoku hands until 1668, when the clan was transferred to Toyooka Domain in Tajima Province and replaced by a cadet branch of the Makino clan. Mineyama Domain remained with the Kyōgoku until the Meiji restoration. Territory directly controlled by the shogunate was administered by Kumihama &quot;daikanshō&quot;. During the Edo Period, Tango province was somewhat of a backwater, due to its geographical location. In the mid-Edo period, Mineyama Domain brought in craftsmen from Nishijin to introduce the technique of producing silk crepe cloth, which was named &quot;Tango chirimen&quot;. This became a regional speciality and a source of income for both Miyazu and Mineyama Domains.

==Meiji period==
Following the Meiji restoration, each of the domains (Miyazu, Tango-Tanabe and Mineyama) briefly became prefectures, which were annexed to Toyooka Prefecture in November 1871 and incorporated into Kyoto Prefecture in 1876. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, the province had 409 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 146,724 &quot;koku&quot;. Tango Province consisted of:

Although the province no longer officially existed after 1871, the name continued to be used for some purposes. For example, Tango is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 between Japan and the United States and between Japan and the United Kingdom.

<text>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide PLC (informally Cable &amp; Wireless) was a British multinational telecommunications services company headquartered in Bracknell, United Kingdom. It was formed in 2010 by the split of Cable &amp; Wireless plc into two companies, the other being Cable &amp; Wireless Communications serving Central America and the Caribbean (and now a part of Liberty Latin America).

Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide specialised in servicing large corporates, governments, carriers and resellers and its services included managed voice, data and IP-based services. It had operations in Asia Pacific, Europe, India, the Middle East &amp; Africa and North America. The company was bought by Vodafone in July 2012 and integrated into the business on 1 April 2013.

==History==
The company was formed on 26 March 2010, made up of the remaining business of Cable &amp; Wireless plc following the demerger of the company&#x27;s international division to form Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. The split meant that the FTSE 100 Index temporarily held 101 firms, before Cable &amp; Wireless Communications dropped to the FTSE 250 Index.

Following the split, CWW went through a tumultuous period – its shares, which hit a high of 98.5 pence after the split, valuing the group at $4.25 billion; fell to 13 pence in November 2011, increasing speculation it would be a takeover target.

On 28 June 2011, the board of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide accepted the resignation of Jim Marsh and announced that John Pluthero, the then-Chairman, would become Chief Executive. On 14 November 2011, Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide announced that it had appointed the former Vodafone Group executive Gavin Darby as its new chief executive.

On 23 April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide for £1.04 billion.

Vodafone, who was looking to strengthen its integrated corporate services business arm – Vodafone Global Enterprise, bid for CWW with Tata Communications Ltd. also in the fray. Vodafone became the sole bidder after Tata group withdrew; and on 23 April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire the operations of CWW for £1.04 billion in cash. On 18 June 2012, CWW shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead. Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable &amp; Wireless.

The acquisition gave Vodafone access to CWW&#x27;s fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise integration service offerings in emerging markets.

The purchase was completed on 30 July 2012, and one-time CWW employee and CEO of Vodafone Global Enterprise Nick Jefferey was appointed as CEO of CWW. Cable &amp; Wireless was fully integrated into Vodafone on 1 April 2013.

==Executive remuneration==
Shareholder groups repeatedly warned about excessive executive remuneration at the company. Before it split into two separately listed companies in early 2010, Cable &amp; Wireless suffered one of the biggest shareholder rebellions in 2009 when 38% of the shareholder register failed to back the company&#x27;s pay policy at a fiery meeting. The company&#x27;s highly controversial long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was calculated on 10% of the company valuation and was claimed to pay out to senior managers; in fact the members of the LTIP were the only executive directors who for the year 2009/2010 shared a £60 million bonus pool.

<doc id="366900" wikidata="Q316213" url="?curid=366900" title="Jun'ichirō Tanizaki">
<text>was a Japanese author who is considered to be one of the most prominent figures in modern Japanese literature. The tone and subject matter of his work range from shocking depictions of sexuality and destructive erotic obsessions to subtle portrayals of the dynamics of family life within the context of the rapid changes in 20th-century Japanese society. Frequently, his stories are narrated in the context of a search for cultural identity in which the West and Japanese tradition are juxtaposed.

He was one of six authors on the final shortlist for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, the year before his death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tanizaki was born into a well-to-do merchant-class family in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, where his uncle owned a printing press, which had been established by his grandfather. His parents were Kuragorō and Seki Tanizaki. His older brother, Kumakichi, died three days after his birth, which made him the next eldest son of the family. Tanizaki had three younger brothers: Tokuzō, Seiji (also a writer) and Shūhei, as well three younger sisters: Sono, Ise and Sue. Tanizaki described his admittedly pampered childhood in his &quot;Yōshō Jidai&quot; (&quot;Childhood Years&quot;, 1956). His childhood home was destroyed in the 1894 Meiji Tokyo earthquake, to which Tanizaki later attributed his lifelong fear of earthquakes. His family&#x27;s finances declined dramatically as he grew older until he was forced to reside in another household as a tutor.

Despite these financial problems, he attended the Tokyo First Middle School, where he became acquainted with Isamu Yoshii. Tanizaki attended the Literature Department of Tokyo Imperial University from 1908, but was forced to drop out in 1911 because of his inability to pay for tuition.

==Early literary career==
Tanizaki began his literary career in 1909. His first work, a one-act stage play, was published in a literary magazine that he had helped found. Tanizaki&#x27;s name first became widely known with the publication of the short story &quot;Shisei&quot; (&quot;The Tattooer&quot;, 1910). In the story, a tattoo artist inscribes a giant spider on the body of a beautiful young woman. Afterwards, the woman&#x27;s beauty takes on a demonic, compelling power, in which eroticism is combined with sado-masochism. The femme-fatale is a theme repeated in many of Tanizaki&#x27;s early works, including &quot;Kirin&quot; (1910), &quot;Shonen&quot; (&quot;The Children&quot;, 1911), &quot;Himitsu&quot; (&quot;The Secret&quot;, 1911), and &quot;Akuma&quot; (&quot;Devil&quot;, 1912). Tanizaki&#x27;s other works published in the Taishō period include &quot;Shindo&quot; (1916) and &quot;Oni no men&quot; (1916), which are partly autobiographical.
Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in 1915, and his only child, Ayuko, was born in 1916. However, it was an unhappy marriage, and in time he encouraged a relationship between Chiyo and his friend and fellow writer Haruo Satō. The psychological stress of this situation is reflected in some of his early works, including the stage play &quot;Aisureba koso&quot; (&quot;Because I Love Her&quot;, 1921) and the novel &quot;Kami to hito no aida&quot; (&quot;Between Men and the Gods&quot;, 1924). Even though some of Tanizaki&#x27;s writings seem to have been inspired by these and other persons and events in his life, his works are far less autobiographical than those of most of his contemporaries in Japan. Tanizaki later adopted Emiko, the daughter of his third wife, Matsuko Morita.

In 1918, Tanizaki toured Chōsen, northern China, and Manchuria. In his early years he became infatuated with the West and all things modern. In 1922, he relocated from Odawara, where he had been living since 1919, to Yokohama, which had a large expatriate population, living briefly in a Western-style house and leading a bohemian lifestyle. This outlook is reflected in some of his early writings.

Tanizaki had a brief career in silent cinema, working as a script writer for the Taikatsu film studio. He was a supporter of the Pure Film Movement and was instrumental in bringing modernist themes to Japanese film. He wrote the scripts for the films &quot;Amateur Club&quot; (1922) and &quot;A Serpent&#x27;s Lust&quot; (1923) (based on the story of the same title by Ueda Akinari, which was, in part, the inspiration for Mizoguchi Kenji&#x27;s 1953 masterpiece &quot;Ugetsu monogatari&quot;). Some have argued that Tanizaki&#x27;s relation to cinema is important to understanding his overall career.

==Period in Kyoto==

Tanizaki&#x27;s reputation began to take off in 1923, when he moved to Kyoto after the Great Kanto earthquake, which destroyed his house in Yokohama (at the time Tanizaki was on a bus in Hakone and thus escaped injury). The loss of Tokyo&#x27;s historic buildings and neighborhoods in the quake triggered a change in his enthusiasms, as he redirected his youthful love for the imagined West and modernity into a renewed interest in Japanese aesthetics and culture, particularly the culture of the Kansai region (around the cities of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto). His first novel after the earthquake, and his first truly successful novel, was &quot;Chijin no ai&quot; (&quot;Naomi&quot;, 1924-25), which is a tragicomic exploration of class, sexual obsession, and cultural identity. Tanizaki made another trip to China in 1926, where he met Guo Moruo, with whom he later maintained correspondence. He relocated from Kyoto to Kobe in 1928.

Inspired by the Osaka dialect, Tanizaki wrote &quot;Manji&quot; (&quot;Quicksand&quot;, 1928–1929), in which he explored lesbianism, among other themes. This was followed by the classic &quot;Tade kuu mushi&quot; (&quot;Some Prefer Nettles&quot;, 1928–29), which depicts the gradual self-discovery of a Tokyo man living near Osaka, in relation to Western-influenced modernization and Japanese tradition. &quot;Yoshino kuzu&quot; (&quot;Arrowroot&quot;, 1931) alludes to Bunraku and kabuki theater and other traditional forms even as it adapts a European narrative-within-a-narrative technique. His experimentation with narrative styles continued with &quot;Ashikari&quot; (&quot;The Reed Cutter&quot;, 1932), &quot;Shunkinshō&quot; (&quot;A Portrait of Shunkin&quot;, 1933), and many other works that combine traditional aesthetics with Tanizaki&#x27;s particular obsessions.

His renewed interest in classical Japanese literature culminated in his multiple translations into modern Japanese of the eleventh-century classic &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and in his masterpiece &quot;Sasameyuki&quot; (literally &quot;A Light Snowfall,&quot; but published in English translation as &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot;, 1943–1948), a detailed characterization of four daughters of a wealthy Osaka merchant family who see their way of life slipping away in the early years of World War II. The sisters live a cosmopolitan life with European neighbors and friends, without suffering the cultural-identity crises common to earlier Tanizaki characters. When he began to serialize the novel, the editors of the literary magazine &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot; were warned that it did not contribute to the needed war spirit and, fearful of losing supplies of paper, cut off the serialization.

Tanizaki relocated to the resort town of Atami, Shizuoka in 1942, but returned to Kyoto in 1946.

==Post-war period==

After World War II, Tanizaki again emerged into literary prominence, winning a host of awards. Until his death, he was widely regarded as Japan&#x27;s greatest contemporary author. He won the prestigious Asahi Prize in 1948, was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1949, and in 1964 was elected to honorary membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, the first Japanese writer to be so honoured.

His first major post-war work was &quot;Shōshō Shigemoto no haha&quot; (&quot;Captain Shigemoto&#x27;s Mother&quot;, 1949–1950), which includes a restatement of Tanizaki&#x27;s frequent theme of a son&#x27;s longing for his mother. The novel also introduces a new theme, of sexuality in old age, which reappears in later works such as &quot;Kagi&quot; (&quot;The Key&quot;, 1956). &quot;Kagi&quot; is a psychological novel in which an aging professor arranges for his wife to commit adultery in order to boost his own sagging sexual desires.

Tanizaki returned to Atami in 1950, and was designated a Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in 1952. He suffered from paralysis of the right hand from 1958, and was hospitalized for Angina pectoris in 1960. Tanizaki&#x27;s characters are often driven by obsessive erotic desires. In one of his last novels, &quot;Futen Rojin Nikki&quot; (&quot;Diary of a Mad Old Man&quot;, 1961–1962), the aged diarist is struck down by a stroke brought on by an excess of sexual excitement. He records both his past desires and his current efforts to bribe his daughter-in-law to provide sexual titillation in return for Western baubles. In 1964, Tanizaki moved to Yugawara, Kanagawa, southwest of Tokyo, where he died of a heart attack on 30 July 1965, shortly after celebrating his 79th birthday. His grave is at the temple Hōnen-in, in Kyoto.

== Legacy ==
The Tanizaki Prize is one of Japan&#x27;s most sought-after literary awards. Established in 1965 by the publishing company Chūō Kōronsha, it is awarded annually to a work of fiction or drama.

Before Haruki Murakami had achieved wide renown, Tanizaki was frequently considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; postwar Japanese writers along with Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima.

<doc id="366901" wikidata="Q1045768" url="?curid=366901" title="Battle of Tedorigawa">
<text>The took place near the Tedori River in Japan&#x27;s Kaga Province in 1577, between the forces of Oda Nobunaga against Uesugi Kenshin. This was destined to be Kenshin&#x27;s last great battle. Kenshin tricked Nobunaga into launching a frontal attack across the Tedorigawa and defeated him. Having suffered the loss of 1,000 men, the Oda withdrew south. The battle site is in the modern-day Ishikawa Prefecture.

==Background==
After Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s victory at Nagashino, Uesugi Kenshin broke off his alliance with Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, he then initiated an alliance in 1575 with the Ishiyama Honganji warrior monks (&quot;Ikko Ikki&quot;) and Takeda Katsuyori of the Takeda clan, with whom he had previously been at odds.

The Tedorigawa Campaign was precipitated by an Uesugi intervention inside the domain of the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, an Oda client state. A &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led by the pro-Oda General Chō Shigetsura, killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori, the lord of Noto, and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka, a puppet ruler. In response, Uesugi Kenshin, the head of the Uesugi clan, mobilized an army and lead them into Noto against Shigetsura. 

Consequently, Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and Maeda Toshiie; with some of his most experienced generals to reinforce their allies.

Kenshin, taking the initiative moved to encircle Shigetsura&#x27;s forces, preventing them from linking with the Oda army, and trapping Chō Shigetsura (Tsunatsura) in Nanao Castle (the main Hatakeyama stronghold in Noto Province). The subsequent breakthrough killed Shigetsura and resulted in the Hatakeyama of Noto switching allegiance to the Uesugi.

==Battle==
The Oda forces under the command of Shibata Katsuie, Maeda Toshiie, and Sassa Narimasa crossed the Tedori River (Minatogawa or Tedorigawa) and prepared to enter Noto Province, as they did not yet know about the fall of Nanao Castle. Due to the fall of Nanao Castle and Suemori Castle in Noto, the Oda army (now joined by Nobunaga himself) halted their march into Noto and went back across the Tedori River. 

Uesugi Kenshin, now bolstered in his ranks with Hatakeyama Noto troops, advanced towards the Oda position. The Oda army came up with a plan to use cannons for stand-off tactics against the Uesugi and to bombard the Uesugi from across the river.

However, a skillful night-time feint by Kenshin (suggesting he had divided his forces) led to Nobunaga ordering Katsuie to charge against the Uesugi lines and engaging the Uesugi troops on the river bank. Kenshin ordered the river&#x27;s floodgates to be opened. The strong current from the river and perhaps also some rainfall prevented the Oda clan from effectively using its arquebus and cannons. The Oda charge itself was repulsed due to the current and inferior close-quarter ability of the ashigaru making up the bulk of the Oda army; the troops of the Oda were being pushed into the river. 

Having lost a thousand men in combat and some more as the Oda troops attempted to escape across the Tedori river, Nobunaga ordered a retreat into Ōmi Province.

==Aftermath==
Kenshin brought his army back into Noto province and ordered the repair of Nanao Castle as he himself went back into home province, Echigo. The Uesugi scored a significant victory at Tedorigawa. As a result, the distribution of power in the central north shifted towards Kenshin and the Uesugi were temporarily able to extend their influence as far as Kaga Province. 

There seems to be some debate among scholars as to Kenshin&#x27;s next moves, however letters written by Kenshin seem to suggest that Kenshin did not perceive the Oda as a significant threat for the time being, although it could have been that Kenshin&#x27;s true intentions were hidden. In these letters to Kanto samurai, Kenshin suggested that his next moves would have been an offensive against the Hojo in Kanto and not towards Kyoto at that time. In letters written by Oda Nobunaga, Nobunaga suggested that he was willing to cede all of the northern provinces to the Uesugi in order to avoid Uesugi advance upon Kyoto.

In 1578, Kenshin died before any plan was initiated. Subsequently, the Uesugi&#x27;s succession fell in the Siege of Otate. As a result, by 1582 the Oda forces had managed to push the Uesugi clan all the way back to Echigo Province.

<text>The siege of Terabe Castle took place in 1558 in feudal Japan. Terabe Castle was a possession of the Ogasawara clan of Mikawa Province. The Siege of Terabe Castle was Matsudaira Motoyasu&#x27;s first battle, who would later change his name to Tokugawa Ieyasu.

== History ==
The castle was built on the north shore of Mikawa Bay, in what is now called Hazu, in the city of Nishio, Aichi Prefecture.
In 1558, Suzuki Shigeteru(or Suzuki Shigetatsu), lord of Terabe Castle, defected from the Imagawa in favor of an alliance with Oda Nobunaga. The Imagawa responded by sending an army under the command of Matsudaira Motoyasu, a young vassal of Imagawa Yoshimoto which would later be known as the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Terabe Castle was the first of a series of battles waged against the Oda clan.

According to the records of &quot;Mikawa Monogatari&quot; written by Ōkubo Tadachika and &quot;Tokugawa Jikki&quot; chronicle, Ieyasu implemented scorched earth strategy in this battle where he stormed the castle parts of &quot;Ninomaru&quot; (officials living quarters of japanese castles), and &quot;Sannomaru&quot; (barracks building of japanese castles), then retreated before the enemy reinforcements from another castles came in. It was said the senior vassals of Ieyasu cried in joy during this battle as they witnessed Ieyasu personal bravery on the battlefield and comparing his feat with his grandfather, Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Ieyasu was said fought in close combat while riding his horse.

Motoyasu&#x27;s forces attacked Terabe Castle, but were driven off by reinforcements sent by Oda Nobunaga. Motoyasu then continued his campaign against other Oda clan possessions.

<doc id="366909" wikidata="Q7631737" url="?curid=366909" title="Subobject classifier">
<text>In category theory, a subobject classifier is a special object Ω of a category such that, intuitively, the subobjects of any object &quot;X&quot; in the category correspond to the morphisms from &quot;X&quot; to Ω. In typical examples, that morphism assigns &quot;true&quot; to the elements of the subobject and &quot;false&quot; to the other elements of &quot;X.&quot; Therefore, a subobject classifier is also known as a &quot;truth value object&quot; and the concept is widely used in the categorical description of logic. Note however that subobject classifiers are often much more complicated than the simple binary logic truth values {true, false}.

== Introductory example ==

As an example, the set Ω = {0,1} is a subobject classifier in the category of sets and functions: to every subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; defined by the inclusion function &quot; j &quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;S&quot; we can assign the function &quot;χA&quot; from &quot;S&quot; to Ω that maps precisely the elements of &quot;A&quot; to 1 (see characteristic function). Every function from &quot;S&quot; to Ω arises in this fashion from precisely one subset &quot;A&quot;.

To be clearer, consider a subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; (&quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;S&quot;), where &quot;S&quot; is a set. The notion of being a subset can be expressed mathematically using the so-called characteristic function χ&quot;A&quot; : S → {0,1}, which is defined as follows:
:formula_1

(Here we interpret 1 as true and 0 as false.) The role of the characteristic function is to determine which elements belong to the subset &quot;A&quot;. In fact, χ&quot;A&quot; is true precisely on the elements of &quot;A&quot;.

In this way, the collection of all subsets of &quot;S&quot; and the collection of all maps from &quot;S&quot; to Ω = {0,1} are isomorphic.

To categorize this notion, recall that, in category theory, a subobject is actually a pair consisting of an object and a monic arrow (interpreted as the inclusion into another object). Accordingly, true refers to the element 1, which is selected by the arrow: true: {0} → {0, 1} that maps 0 to 1. The subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; can now be defined as the pullback of true along the characteristic function χ&quot;A&quot;, shown on the following diagram:
Defined that way, χ is a morphism &quot;Sub&quot;C(&quot;S&quot;) → HomC(S, Ω). By definition, Ω is a subobject classifier if this morphism is an isomorphism.

== Definition ==

For the general definition, we start with a category C that has a terminal object, which we denote by 1. The object Ω of C is a subobject classifier for C if there exists a morphism 
:1 → Ω

with the following property:
:For each monomorphism &quot;j&quot;: &quot;U&quot; → &quot;X&quot; there is a unique morphism &quot;χ j&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → Ω such that the following commutative diagram

:is a pullback diagram—that is, &quot;U&quot; is the limit of the diagram:
The morphism &quot;χ j&quot; is then called the classifying morphism for the subobject represented by &quot;j&quot;.

== Further examples ==

=== Sheaves of sets ===
The category of sheaves of sets on a topological space &quot;X&quot; has a subobject classifier Ω which can be described as follows: For any open set &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, Ω(&quot;U&quot;) is the set of all open subsets of &quot;U&quot;. The terminal object is the sheaf 1 which assigns the singleton {*} to every open set &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X.&quot; The morphism η:1 → Ω is given by the family of maps η&quot;U&quot; : 1(&quot;U&quot;) → Ω(&quot;U&quot;) defined by η&quot;U&quot;(*)=&quot;U&quot; for every open set &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. Given a sheaf &quot;F&quot; on &quot;X&quot; and a sub-sheaf &quot;j&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;F&quot;, the classifying morphism &quot;χ j&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → Ω is given by the family of maps &quot;χ j,U&quot; : &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) → Ω(&quot;U&quot;), where &quot;χ j,U&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the union of all open sets &quot;V&quot; of &quot;U&quot; such that the restriction of &quot;x&quot; to &quot;V&quot; (in the sense of sheaves) is contained in &quot;jV&quot;(&quot;G&quot;(&quot;V&quot;)).

Roughly speaking an assertion inside this topos is variably true or false, and its truth value from the viewpoint of an open subset &quot;U&quot; is the open subset of &quot;U&quot; where the assertion is true.

=== Presheaves ===
Given a small category formula_2, the category of presheaves formula_3 (i.e. the functor category consisting of all contravariant functors from formula_2 to formula_5) has a subobject classifer given by the functor sending any formula_6 to the set of sieves on formula_7. The classifying morphisms are constructed quite similarly to the ones in the sheaves-of-sets example above.

=== Elementary topoi ===
Both examples above are subsumed by the following general fact: every elementary topos, defined as a category with finite limits and power objects, necessarily has a subobject classifier. The two examples above are Grothendieck topoi, and every Grothendieck topos is an elementary topos.

== Related concepts ==
A quasitopos has an object that is almost a subobject classifier; it only classifies strong subobjects.

<text>Javanese ( , , ; , Javanese script: , Pegon: , IPA: ) is an Austronesian language spoken primarily by the Javanese people from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java, Indonesia. There are also pockets of Javanese speakers on the northern coast of western Java. It is the native language of more than 68 million people.

Javanese is the largest of the Austronesian languages in number of native speakers. It has several regional dialects and a number of clearly distinct status styles. Its closest relatives are the neighboring languages such as Sundanese, Madurese, and Balinese. Most speakers of Javanese also speak Indonesian for official and commercial purposes as well as a means to communicate with non-Javanese-speaking Indonesians.

There are speakers of Javanese in Malaysia (concentrated in the West Coast part of the states of Selangor and Johor) and Singapore. Javanese is also spoken by traditional immigrant communities of Javanese descent in Suriname, Sri Lanka and New Caledonia.

Along with Indonesian, Javanese is an official language in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

== Geographical distribution ==
Javanese is spoken throughout Indonesia, neighboring Southeast Asian countries, the Netherlands, Suriname, New Caledonia, and other countries. The largest populations of speakers are found in the six provinces of Java itself, and in the neighboring Sumatran province of Lampung.

The language is spoken in Yogyakarta, Central and East Java, as well as on the north coast of West Java and Banten. It is also spoken elsewhere by the Javanese people in other provinces of Indonesia, who are numerous due to the government-sanctioned transmigration program in the late 20th century, including Lampung, Jambi, and North Sumatra provinces. In Suriname, Javanese is spoken among descendants of plantation migrants brought by the Dutch during the 19th century. In Madura, Bali, Lombok, and the Sunda region of West Java, it is also used as a literary language. It was the court language in Palembang, South Sumatra, until the palace was sacked by the Dutch in the late 18th century.

Javanese is written with the Latin script, Javanese script, and Arabic script. In the present day, the Latin script dominates writings, although the Javanese script is still taught as part of the compulsory Javanese language subject in elementary up to high school levels in Yogyakarta, Central and East Java.

Javanese is the twenty-second largest language by native speakers and the seventh largest language without official status at the national level. It is spoken or understood by approximately 100 million people. At least 45% of the total population of Indonesia are of Javanese descent or live in an area where Javanese is the dominant language. All seven Indonesian presidents since 1945 have been of Javanese descent. It is therefore not surprising that Javanese has had a deep influence on the development of Indonesian, the national language of Indonesia.

There are three main dialects of the modern language: Central Javanese, Eastern Javanese, and Western Javanese. These three dialects form a dialect continuum from northern Banten in the extreme west of Java to Banyuwangi Regency in the eastern corner of the island. All Javanese dialects are more or less mutually intelligible.

A table showing the number of native speakers in 1980, for the 22 Indonesian provinces (from the total of 27) in which more than 1% of the population spoke Javanese:

According to the 1980 census, Javanese was used daily in approximately 43% of Indonesian households. By this reckoning there were well over 60 million Javanese speakers, from a national population of 147,490,298.
In Banten, the descendants of the Central Javanese conquerors who founded the Islamic Sultanate there in the 16th century still speak an archaic form of Javanese. The rest of the population mainly speaks Sundanese and Indonesian, since this province borders directly on Jakarta.

At least one third of the population of Jakarta are of Javanese descent, so they speak Javanese or have knowledge of it. In the province of West Java, many people speak Javanese, especially those living in the areas bordering Central Java, the cultural homeland of the Javanese.

Almost a quarter of the population of East Java province are Madurese (mostly on the Isle of Madura); many Madurese have some knowledge of colloquial Javanese. Since the 19th century, Madurese was also written in the Javanese script.

The original inhabitants of Lampung, the Lampungese, make up only 15% of the provincial population. The rest are the so-called &quot;transmigrants&quot;, settlers from other parts of Indonesia, many as a result of past government transmigration programs. Most of these transmigrants are Javanese who have settled there since the 19th century.

In Suriname (the former Dutch colony of Surinam), South America, approximately 15% of the population of some 500,000 are of Javanese descent, among whom 75,000 speak Javanese. A local variant evolved: the &quot;Tyoro Jowo-Suriname&quot; or &quot;Suriname Javanese&quot;.

== Classification ==
Javanese is part of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, although its precise relationship to other Malayo-Polynesian languages is hard to determine. Using the lexicostatistical method, Isidore Dyen classified Javanese as part of the &quot;Javo-Sumatra Hesion&quot;, which also includes the Sundanese and &quot;Malayic&quot; languages. This grouping is also called &quot;Malayo-Javanic&quot; by linguist Berndt Nothofer, who was the first to attempt a reconstruction of it based on only four languages with the best attestation at the time (Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Malay).

Malayo-Javanic has been criticized and rejected by various linguists. Alexander Adelaar does not include Javanese in his proposed Malayo-Sumbawan grouping (which also covers Malayic, Sundanese, and Madurese languages). Robert Blust also does not include Javanese in the Greater North Borneo subgroup, which he proposes as an alternative to Malayo-Sumbawan grouping. However, Blust also expresses the possibility that Greater North Borneo languages are closely related to many other western Indonesian languages, including Javanese. Blust&#x27;s suggestion has been further elaborated by Alexander Smith, who includes Javanese in the Western Indonesian grouping (which also includes GNB and several other subgroups), which Smith considers as one of Malayo-Polynesian&#x27;s primary branches.

== Dialects ==

There are three main groups of Javanese dialects, based on sub-regions: Western Javanese, Central Javanese, and Eastern Javanese. The differences are primarily in pronunciation, but with vocabulary differences also. Javanese dialects are all mutually intelligible.

A preliminary general classification of Javanese dialects given by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology&#x27;s Department of Linguistics is as follows. Pesisir (Tegalan), Banyumas and Tengger are considered to be among the most conservative dialects. The Banten, Pesisir Lor, Banyumas and Tengger dialect do not have the vowel raising and vowel harmony features that are innovations of the &quot;standard&quot; Solo and Yogyakarta dialects.

=== Dialects description ===

==== Standard Javanese ====
Standard Javanese is the variety of the Javanese language that was developed at the Yogyakarta and Surakarta courts (the heirs to the Mataram Sultanate that once dominated the whole of Java and beyond), based on the Central Javanese dialect, and becomes the basis for the Javanese modern writings. It is marked with the strict usage of two speech levels for politeness, i.e. vernacular level called &quot;ngoko&quot; and high-register level called &quot;krama&quot;. Other dialects do not contrast the usage of the speech levels.

==== Central Javanese ====
Central Javanese (&quot;Jawa Tengahan&quot;) is founded on the speech of Surakarta and to a lesser extent of Yogyakarta. It is considered the most &quot;refined&quot; of the regional variants, and serves as a model for the standard language. This variant is used throughout eastern part of Central Java, the Special Region of Yogyakarta, and the western part of East Java provinces. There are many lower-level dialects such as &quot;Kedu&quot; ( bit influenced by banyumasan) , &quot;Muria&quot; and &quot;Semarangan&quot;, as well as &quot;Surakarta&quot; and &quot;Yogyakarta&quot; themselves. Javanese spoken in the Madiun region (along with Javanese spoken in Blitar, Ponorogo, Pacitan, and Tulungagung, most parts of Kediri) bears a strong influence of Surakarta Javanese. The variation of Central Javanese are said to be so plentiful that almost every administrative region (or &quot;kabupatèn&quot;) has its own local slang, in the eastern part of Nganjuk (Kertosono Raya), north and northeastern part of Kediri (Papar Raya &amp; Pare Raya) and the eastern part of Blitar (Wlingi Raya) there is some influences of the Arekan dialect even though the basic vocabulary is still predominantly Mataraman and still classified as Mataraman Dialect, those minor dialects are not seen as distinct by most Javanese speakers.

# Mataram dialect, Kewu dialect, or Standard dialect is spoken commonly in Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Klaten, Karanganyar, Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Sragen, and Boyolali.
# Pekalongan dialect is spoken in Pekalongan, Pekalongan regency, Batang and also in Pemalang.
# Kedu dialect is spoken in the former Kedu residency, including: Temanggung, eastern part of Kebumen, Magelang, and Wonosobo.
## Bagelen dialect is sub-dialect of Kedu spoken in Purworejo.
# Semarang dialect is spoken in Semarang, Semarang regency, and also Salatiga, Grobogan, Demak and Kendal.
# Muria (Agung) dialect or Eastern North-Coast dialect is spoken in Jepara, Rembang, Kudus, Pati, and also in Tuban and Bojonegoro.
## Blora dialect is sub-dialect of Muria, spoken in Blora, the eastern part of Grobogan, and the western part of Ngawi.
# Madiunan dialect or Mataraman dialect is spoken mainly in western part of East Java province, including Madiun, Ngawi, Pacitan, Ponorogo, Magetan, Kediri, Nganjuk, Trenggalek, Tulungagung, and Blitar.

==== Western Javanese ====
Western Javanese (&quot;Jawa Kulonan&quot;), spoken in the western part of the Central Java province and throughout the West Java and Banten province (particularly on the north coast), includes dialects that are distinct for their Sundanese influences. It retains many archaic words and original pronunciation from Old Javanese.

# North Banten dialect (&quot;Jawa Sérang&quot;) is spoken in Serang, Cilegon, and the western part of Tangerang regency.
# Cirebon dialect (&quot;Cirebonan&quot; or &quot;basa Cerbon&quot;) is spoken in Cirebon, Indramayu, and Losari.
# Tegal dialect, known as &quot;Tegalan&quot; or &quot;dhialèk Pantura&quot; (North-Coast dialect), is spoken in Tegal, Brebes, and the western part of Pemalang regency.
# Banyumas dialect, known as &quot;Banyumasan&quot;, is spoken in Banyumas, Cilacap, Purbalingga, Banjarnegara, and Bumiayu.

Some Western Javanese dialects such as Banyumasan dialects and Tegal dialect are sometimes referred to as &quot;basa ngapak&quot; by other Javanese because of the dialectal pronunciation of word &quot;apa&quot; (what).

==== Eastern Javanese ====
Eastern Javanese (&quot;Jawa Wétanan&quot;) speakers range from the eastern banks of Brantas River in Kertosono, and from Jombang to Banyuwangi, comprising the second majority of the East Java province excluding Madura island , Situbondo and Bondowoso. However, some variant like Pedalungan has been influenced by Madurese.

The most outlying Eastern Javanese dialect is spoken in Balambangan (or Banyuwangi). It is generally known as &quot;basa Using&quot;. &quot;Using&quot;, a local negation word, is a cognate of &quot;tusing&quot; in Balinese.

# Arekan dialect is commonly spoken in Surabaya, Malang, Gresik, Mojokerto, Pasuruan, Lumajang, western and south-western part of Jember, eastern part of Lamongan, and Sidoarjo. Many Madurese people also use this dialect as their second language.
## Pasisir Lor Wétan (Northeastern Coast) dialect is spoken in Mojokerto, eastern part of Lamongan, Sidoarjo, Gresik, and Surabaya.
## Malang-Pasuruhan dialect is spoken in Malang and Pasuruan.
## Lumajangan dialect is sub-dialect of arekan , bit influenced by madurese languages, spoken in central and southern part of Lumajang (except in north and north-east which base of madurese people&#x27;s) and also spoken in southwestern part of Jember like Kencong, Jombang, Umbulsari, Gumukmas, Puger
## Jombang dialect is sub dialect of Arekan, bit influenced by Mataraman Javanese dialect, spoken in most part of Jombang
# Tengger dialect used by Tengger people, which is centered in thirty villages in the isolated Tengger mountains (Mount Bromo) within the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in East-Central Java.
# Osing dialect or Blambangan dialect is spoken in central part of Banyuwangi.

==== Surinamese-Javanese ====
Surinamese-Javanese is mainly based on Central Javanese, especially from Kedu residency. The number of speakers of Suriname-Javanese in Suriname was estimated at 60,000 as of 2012. Most Surinamese-Javanese are bi- or trilingual. According to the 2004 census, Surinamese-Javanese was the first or second language in 11 percent of households. In a 2012 study of multilingualism in Surinamese education by the Dutch Language Union, 3,497 out of 22,643 pupils (15 percent) in primary education indicated Surinamese-Javanese as a language spoken at home. Most of them were living in Wanica and Paramaribo districts.

Not all immigrants from Indonesia to Suriname were speakers of Javanese. Immigration records show that 90 percent of immigrants were Javanese, with 5 percent Sundanese, 0.5 percent Madurese and 2.5 percent from Batavia. The ethnic composition of this last group was not determinable. Probably Sundanese, Madurese or Malay speaking immigrants were forced to learn Javanese during their stay in Suriname to adapt. In view of the language policies in Netherlands Indies at the time of immigration, it is unlikely the immigrants had knowledge of the Dutch language prior to immigration to Suriname. Dutch today is the official language of Suriname.

Surinamese Javanese is somewhat different from Indonesian Javanese. In Surinamese-Javanese there is a difference between formal and informal speech. Surinamese-Javanese took many loanwords from languages like Dutch, Sranantongo, Sarnami and Indonesian. The influence of the latter language, which is not spoken in Suriname, can be attributed to the Indonesian embassy and Islamic teachers from Indonesia. Indonesian movies are popular, and usually shown without subtitles on Surinamese-Javanese television channels.

In 1986, the Surinamese government adopted an official spelling for Surinamese-Javanese. It is seldom used as a written language, however.

In the 2012 survey, pupils who indicated Surinamese-Javanese as a language spoken at home, reported Dutch (97.9 percent) and Sranantongo (76.9 percent) also being spoken in the household.

Surinamese-Javanese speaking pupils report high proficiency in speaking and understanding, but very low literacy in the language. They report a low preference for the language in interaction with family members, including their parents, with the exception of their grandparents. Pupils where Surinamese-Javanese is spoken at tend at home to speak Dutch (77 percent) rather than Surinamese-Javanese (12 percent).

==== New Caledonian Javanese ====
As expected, New Caledonian Javanese is somewhat different from Indonesian Javanese. New Caledonian Javanese took many loanwords from French. New Caledonian society, in addition to their mastery of the language according to their ethnicity (New Caledonian Javanese), is obliged to be fluent in French that is a medium that is used in all the affairs of the state, economy, and education. French is regarded as a prestigious language because it is the language of the government, an official language in France include New Caledonia, one of the major languages in Europe, and one of the official languages of the United Nations.

=== Phonetic differences ===
Phoneme /i/ at closed ultima is pronounced as [ɪ] in Central Javanese (Surakarta–Yogyakarta dialect), as [i] in Western Javanese (Banyumasan dialect), and as [ɛ] in Eastern Javanese.

Phoneme /u/ at closed ultima is pronounced as [ʊ] in Central Javanese, as [u] in Western Javanese, and as [ɔ] in Eastern Javanese.

Phoneme /a/ at closed ultima in Central Javanese is pronounced as [a] and at open ultima as [ɔ]. Regardless of position, it tends toward [a] in Western Javanese and as [ɔ] in Eastern Javanese.

Western Javanese tends to add a glottal stop at the end of word-final vowels, e.g.: &quot;Ana apa?&quot; [anaʔ apaʔ] &quot;What happened?&quot;, &quot;Aja kaya kuwè!&quot; [adʒaʔ kajaʔ kuwɛʔ] &quot;Don&#x27;t be like that!&quot;.

Final consonant devoicing occurs in the standard Central Javanese dialect, but not in Banyumasan. For example, &quot;endhog&quot; (egg) is pronounced [əɳɖ̥ɔk] in standard Central Javanese, but [əɳɖ̥ɔg] in Banyumasan. The latter is closer to Old Javanese.

=== Vocabulary differences ===
The vocabulary of standard Javanese is enriched by dialectal words. For example, to get the meaning of &quot;you&quot;, Western Javanese speakers say &quot;rika&quot; , Eastern Javanese use &quot;kon&quot; or &quot;koen&quot; , and Central Javanese speakers say &quot;kowé&quot; . Another example is the expression of &quot;how&quot;: the Tegal dialect of Western Javanese uses &quot;keprimèn&quot; , the Banyumasan dialect of Western Javanese employs &quot;kepriwé&quot; or &quot;kepribèn&quot; , Eastern Javanese speakers say &quot;ya&#x27; apa&quot;  – originally meaning &quot;like what&quot; (&quot;kaya apa&quot; in standard Javanese) or &quot;kepiyé&quot;  – and Central Javanese speakers say &quot;piye&quot; or &quot;kepriyé&quot; .

The Madiun–Kediri dialect has some idiosyncratic vocabulary, such as &quot;panggah&quot; &#x27;still&#x27; (standard Javanese: &quot;pancet&quot;), &quot;lagèk&quot; &#x27;progressive modal&#x27; (standard Javanese: &quot;lagi&quot;), and emphatic particles &quot;nda&quot;, &quot;pèh&quot;, and &quot;lé&quot;.

==History==
In general, the history of the Javanese language can be divided into two distinct phases: 1) Old Javanese and 2) New Javanese.

=== Old Javanese ===

The earliest attested form of Old Javanese can be found on the Sukabumi inscription at Kediri regency, East Java which dates from 804 CE. Between the 8th and the 15th century, this form of Javanese flourished in the island of Java. Old Javanese is commonly written in the form of verses. This language variety is also called &quot;kawi&quot; or &#x27;of poets, poetical&#x27;s, although this term could also be used to refer to the archaic elements of New Javanese literature. The writing system used to write Old Javanese is a descendant of the Pallava script from India. Almost half of the entire vocabularies found in Old Javanese literature are Sanskrit loanwords, although Old Javanese also borrowed terms from other languages in the Maritime Southeast Asia.

The form of Old Javanese found in several texts from 14th century onward (mostly written in Bali) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Middle Javanese&quot;. Both Old and Middle Javanese written forms have not been widely used in Java since early 16th century. However, Old Javanese works and poetic tradition continue to be preserved in the Javanese-influenced Bali, and the variety is also used for religious purposes.

=== Modern Javanese ===
Modern Javanese emerged as the main literary form of the language in the 16th century. The change in the literary system happened as Islam started to gain influence in Java. In its early form, Modern Javanese literary form was based on the variety spoken in the north coast of Java, where Islam had already gained foothold among the local people. Many of the written works in this variety were Islamic in nature, and several of them were translation from works in Malay. The Arabic abjad was also adopted (as Pegon) to write Javanese.

The rise of Mataram in the 17th century shifted the main literary form of Javanese to be based on the inland variety. This written tradition was preserved by writers of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and later became the basis of the modern written standard of the language. Another linguistic development associated with the rise of Mataram is the stratification of Javanese into speech levels such as &quot;ngoko&quot; and &quot;krama&quot;, which were unknown in Old Javanese.

Books in Javanese have been printed since 1830s, at first using the Javanese script, although the Latin alphabet started to be used later. Since mid-19th century, Javanese has been used in newspapers and travelogues, and later, also novels, short stories, as well as free verses. Today, it is used in media, ranging from books to TV programs, and the language is also taught at schools in primarily Javanese areas.

Although Javanese is not a national language, it has recognized status as a regional language in the three Indonesian provinces with the biggest concentrations of Javanese people: Central Java, Yogyakarta, and East Java. Javanese is designated as the official language of the Special Region of Yogyakarta under Yogyakarta Special Region Regulation Number 2 of 2021. Previously, Central Java promulgated a similar regulation—Regional Regulation 9/2012—but this did not imply an official status for the language.

Javanese is taught at schools and is used in some mass media, both electronically and in print. There is, however, no longer a daily newspaper in Javanese. Javanese-language magazines include &quot;Panjebar Semangat&quot;, &quot;Jaka Lodhang&quot;, &quot;Jaya Baya&quot;, &quot;Damar Jati&quot;, and &quot;Mekar Sari&quot;. &quot;Damar Jati&quot;, a new Javanese language magazine, appeared in 2005 is not published in the Javanese heartlands, but in Jakarta.

Since 2003, an East Java local television station (JTV) has broadcast some of its programmes in the Surabayan (&quot;Suroboyoan&quot;) dialect, including &quot;&quot; (&quot;Village Corner&quot;, main newscast), &quot;Kuis RT/RW&quot; (&quot;RT/RW Quiz&quot;), and &quot;Pojok Perkoro&quot; (&quot;Case Corner&quot;, a crime newscast). In later broadcasts, JTV offers programmes in the Central Javanese dialect (called by them &quot;basa kulonan&quot;, &quot;the western language&quot;) and Madurese. The speakers of Suroboyoan dialect are well known for being proud of their distinctive dialect and consistently maintain it wherever they go.

== Endangerment ==
Several linguists has voiced concerns about the status of Javanese. It is believed that Ngoko Javanese enjoys a stable diglossic status, while Krama Javanese is under more serious threat. The number of Javanese native speakers has significantly dwindled over the years. In a research in Yogyakarta, it was revealed that a significant number of parents do not transmit Javanese to their children. Instead, Javanese speakers typically acquire Javanese through extrafamilial sources, like friend groups. Although Javanese enjoys a large quantity of speaker base, it is not immune from pressures from other languages like Indonesian and English.

== Phonology ==
The phonemes of Modern Standard Javanese as shown below.

=== Vowels ===
In closed syllables the vowels are pronounced respectively. In open syllables, are also when the following vowel is in an open syllable; otherwise they are , or identical (). In the standard dialect of Surakarta, is pronounced in word-final open syllables, and in any open penultimate syllable before such an .

=== Consonants ===
The Javanese &quot;voiced&quot; phonemes are not in fact voiced but voiceless, with breathy voice on the following vowel. The relevant distinction in phonation of the plosives is described as stiff voice versus slack voice.

A Javanese syllable can have the following form: , where C = consonant, S = sonorant (, or any nasal consonant), and V = vowel. As with other Austronesian languages, native Javanese roots consist of two syllables; words consisting of more than three syllables are broken up into groups of disyllabic words for pronunciation. In Modern Javanese, a disyllabic root is of the following type: .

Apart from Madurese, Javanese is the only language of Western Indonesia to possess a distinction between dental and retroflex phonemes. The latter sounds are transcribed as &quot;th&quot; and &quot;dh&quot; in the modern Roman script, but previously by the use of an underdot: &quot;ṭ&quot; and &quot;ḍ&quot;.

== Writing system ==

Javanese has been traditionally written with Javanese script. Javanese and the related Balinese script are modern variants of the old Kawi script, a Brahmic script introduced to Java along with Hinduism and Buddhism. Kawi is first attested in a legal document from 804 AD. It was widely used in literature and translations from Sanskrit from the 10th century; by the 17th, the script is identified as &quot;carakan&quot;.

The Javanese script is an abugida. Each of the twenty letters represents a syllable with a consonant (or a &quot;zero consonant&quot;) and the inherent vowel &#x27;a&#x27; that is pronounced as /ɔ/ in open position. Various diacritics placed around the letter indicate a different vowel than [ɔ], a final consonant, or a foreign pronunciation.

Letters have subscript forms used to transcribe consonant clusters, though the shapes are relatively straightforward, and not as distinct as conjunct forms of Devanagari. Some letters are only present in old Javanese and became obsolete in modern Javanese. Some of these letters became &quot;capital&quot; forms used in proper names. Punctuation includes a comma; period; a mark that covers the colon, quotations, and indicates numerals; and marks to introduce a chapter, poem, song, or letter.

However, Javanese can also be written with the Arabic script (known as the Pegon script) and today generally uses Latin script instead of Javanese script for practical purposes. A Latin orthography based on Dutch was introduced in 1926, revised in 1972–1973; it has largely supplanted the carakan. The current Latin-based forms:

The italic letters are used in loanwords from European languages and Arabic.

Javanese script:
== Grammar ==
=== Morphology ===

Javanese, like many other Austronesian languages, is an agglutinative language, where base words are modified through extensive use of affixes.

==== Personal pronoun ====
Javanese has no specific personal pronoun to express plural except for &quot;kita&quot; which was influenced by Indonesian’s first person plural inclusive pronoun. Pronoun pluralization can be ignored or expressed by using phrases such as &quot;aku kabèh&quot; &#x27;we&#x27;, &quot;awaké dhéwé&quot; &#x27;us&#x27;, &quot;dhèwèké kabèh&quot; &#x27;them&#x27; and so on. Personal pronoun in Javanese, especially for the second and third person, are more often replaced by certain nouns or titles. In addition to the pronoun described in the table below, Javanese still has a variety of other pronoun whose use varies depending on the dialect or level of speech.
==== Demonstrative ====
==== Noun ====
==== Numeral ====
==== Verb ====
=== Syntax ===
Modern Javanese usually employs SVO word order. However, Old Javanese sometimes had VSO and sometimes VOS word order. Even in Modern Javanese, archaic sentences using VSO structure can still be made.

Examples:
* Modern Javanese: &quot;&quot;Dhèwèké&quot; (S) &quot;teka&quot; (V) &quot;ing&quot; (pp.) &quot;karaton&quot; (O)&quot;.
* Old Javanese: &quot;&quot;Teka&quot; (V) &quot;ta&quot; (part.) &quot;sira&quot; (S) &quot;ri&quot; (pp.) &quot;-ng&quot; (def. art.) &quot;kadhatwan&quot; (O)&quot;.

Both sentences mean: &quot;He (S) comes (V) into (pp.) the (def. art.) palace (O)&quot;. In the Old Javanese sentence, the verb is placed at the beginning and is separated by the particle &quot;ta&quot; from the rest of the sentence. In Modern Javanese the definite article is lost, and definiteness is expressed by other means if necessary.

Verbs are not inflected for person or number. There is no grammatical tense; time is expressed by auxiliary words meaning &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;already&quot;, etc. There is a complex system of verb affixes to express differences of status in subject and object. However, in general the structure of Javanese sentences both Old and Modern can be described using the topic–comment model, without having to refer to conventional grammatical categories. The topic is the head of the sentence; the comment is the modifier. So the example sentence has a simpler description: &quot;Dhèwèké&quot; = &quot;topic&quot;; &quot;teka&quot; = comment; &quot;ing karaton&quot; = setting.

== Vocabulary ==
Javanese has many loanwords supplementing those from the native Austronesian base. Sanskrit has had a deep and lasting influence. The &quot;Old Javanese–English Dictionary&quot; contains approximately 25,500 entries, over 12,600 of which are borrowings from Sanskrit. Such a high number is no measure of usage, but it does suggest the extent to which the language adopted Sanskrit words for formal purposes. In a typical Old Javanese literary work about 25% of the vocabulary is from Sanskrit. Many Javanese personal names also have clearly recognisable Sanskrit roots.

Sanskrit words are still very much in use. Modern speakers may describe Old Javanese and Sanskrit words as &quot;kawi&quot; (roughly meaning &quot;literary&quot;); but &quot;kawi&quot; words may also be from Arabic. Dutch and Malay are influential as well; but none of these rivals the position of Sanskrit.

There are far fewer Arabic loanwords in Javanese than in Malay, and they are usually concerned with Islamic religion. Nevertheless, some words have entered the basic vocabulary, such as &quot;pikir&quot; (&quot;to think&quot;, from the Arabic &quot;fikr&quot;), &quot;badan&quot; (&quot;body&quot;), &quot;mripat&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;, thought to be derived from the Arabic &quot;ma&#x27;rifah&quot;, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;). However, these Arabic words typically have native Austronesian or Sanskrit alternatives: &quot;pikir&quot; = &quot;galih&quot;, &quot;idhep&quot; (Austronesian) and &quot;manah&quot;, &quot;cipta&quot;, or &quot;cita&quot; (from Sanskrit); &quot;badan&quot; = &quot;awak&quot; (Austronesian) and &quot;slira&quot;, &quot;sarira&quot;, or &quot;angga&quot; (from Sanskrit); and &quot;mripat&quot; = &quot;mata&quot; (Austronesian) and &quot;soca&quot; or &quot;nétra&quot; (from Sanskrit).

Dutch loanwords usually have the same form and meaning as in Indonesian, with a few exceptions such as:
The word &quot;sepur&quot; also exists in Indonesian, but there it has preserved the &quot;literal&quot; Dutch meaning of &quot;railway tracks&quot;, while the Javanese word follows Dutch &quot;figurative&quot; use, and &quot;spoor&quot; (lit. &quot;rail&quot;) is used as metonymy for &quot;trein&quot; (lit. &quot;train&quot;). (Compare a similar metonymic use in English: &quot;to travel by rail&quot; may be used for &quot;to travel by train&quot;.)

Malay was the lingua franca of the Indonesian archipelago before the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945; and Indonesian, which was based on Malay, is now the official language of Indonesia. As a consequence, there has been an influx of Malay and Indonesian vocabulary into Javanese. Many of these words are concerned with bureaucracy or politics.

=== Basic vocabulary ===
=== Numbers ===

[Javanese Ngoko is on the left, and Javanese Krama is on the right.]

=== Registers ===

In common with other Austronesian languages, Javanese is spoken differently depending on the social context. In Austronesian languages there are often three distinct styles or registers. Each employs its own vocabulary, grammatical rules, and even prosody. In Javanese these styles are called:
# &quot;Ngoko&quot; (): Vernacular or informal speech, used between friends and close relatives. It is also used by persons of higher status (such as elders, or bosses) addressing those of lower status (young people, or subordinates in the workplace).
# &quot;Madya&quot; (): Intermediate between &quot;ngoko&quot; and &quot;krama&quot;. Strangers on the street would use it, where status differences may be unknown and one wants to be neither too formal nor too informal. The term is from Sanskrit &quot;madhya&quot; (&quot;middle&quot;).
# &quot;Krama&quot; (): The polite, high-register, or formal style. It is used between those of the same status when they do not wish to be informal. It is used by persons of lower status to persons of higher status, such as young people to their elders, or subordinates to bosses; and it is the official style for public speeches, announcements, etc. The term is from Sanskrit &quot;krama&quot; (&quot;in order&quot;).

There are also &quot;meta-style&quot; honorific words, and their converse &quot;humilifics&quot;. Speakers use &quot;humble&quot; words concerning themselves, but honorific words concerning anyone of greater age of higher social status. The humilific words are called &quot;krama andhap&quot;, while the honorifics are called &quot;krama inggil&quot;. This honorific system is very similar to that of the Japanese &quot;keigo&quot;, and was likely influenced by it during the Japanese Empire&#x27;s occupation of Java in World War II. Children typically use the &quot;ngoko&quot; style, but in talking to the parents they must be competent with both &quot;krama inggil&quot; and &quot;krama andhap&quot;.

The most polite word meaning &quot;eat&quot; is &quot;dhahar&quot;. But it is forbidden to use these most polite words for oneself, except when talking with someone of lower status; and in this case, &quot;ngoko&quot; style is used. Such most polite words are reserved for addressing people of higher status:
* Mixed usages
** (honorific – addressing someone of high status) &quot;Bapak kersa dhahar?&quot; (&quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;; literally &quot;Does father want to eat?&quot;)
** (reply to a person of lower status, expressing speaker&#x27;s superiority) &quot;Iya, aku kersa dhahar.&quot; (&quot;Yes, I want to eat.&quot;)
** (reply to a person of lower status, but without expressing superiority) &quot;Iya, aku arep mangan.&quot;
** (reply to a person of equal status) &quot;Inggih, kula badhé nedha.&quot;

The use of these different styles is complicated and requires thorough knowledge of Javanese culture, which adds to the difficulty of Javanese for foreigners. The full system is not usually mastered by most Javanese themselves, who might use only the &quot;ngoko&quot; and a rudimentary form of the &quot;krama&quot;. People who can correctly use the different styles are held in high esteem.

== Biography ==

Yorifusa was first enfeoffed in the Shimotsuma domain (100,000 &quot;koku&quot;) from 1606 to 1609, before being transferred to Mito (Hitachi Province, 350,000 &quot;koku&quot;) in 1610, thereby founding the Mito branch of the Tokugawa house (the junior branch of the gosanke). A holder of the junior 3rd court rank (&quot;jusanmi&quot;), Yorifusa held the title of &quot;chūnagon&quot; (middle counselor), both of which he received in 1627.

<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the early Edo period.

Born under the name Nagatomimaru (長福丸), he was the 10th son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by his concubine Kageyama-dono. On December 8, 1603, Yorinobu received the fief of Mito, then rated at 200,000 &quot;koku&quot;, as his fief. Mito had formerly belonged to his older brother, Takeda Nobuyoshi. Following his stipend increase to 250,000 &quot;koku&quot; in October 1604, he came of age on September 12, 1606, taking the name Yorimasa, and receiving the court rank of junior 4th, lower grade (&quot;ju-shi-i-ge&quot;) and the title of &quot;Hitachi no Suke&quot;. On January 6, 1610, he was transferred to a 500,000 &quot;koku&quot; fief in Suruga and Tōtōmi Provinces (thereby founding Sunpu Domain centered on Sunpu Castle), and took the name Yorinobu. However, after a little under a decade in Suruga, he was transferred to the 550,000 &quot;koku&quot; Wakayama Domain on August 27, 1619, following the transfer of the previous rulers, the Asano clan, to Hiroshima, in Aki Province. Yorinobu thus became the founder of the Kii branch of the Tokugawa family. Yorinobu&#x27;s wife, Yorin-in (1601-1666) was the daughter of Katō Kiyomasa. By the end of his life, Yorinobu had achieved junior 2nd court rank (&quot;ju-ni-i&quot;), as well as holding the title of dainagon (&quot;major counselor&quot;).

Yorinobu had four children: his successor Tokugawa Mitsusada, Yorizumi, the founder of the Iyo-Saijo Domain, Inaba-hime, who married Ikeda Mitsunaka of the Tottori Domain, and Matsuhime, who married Matsudaira Nobuhira of the Yoshii Domain. Following his death, he was referred to by the title &quot;Nanryū-in&quot;.

In 1915, Yorinobu was posthumously promoted to senior 2nd court rank (&quot;shō-ni-i&quot;).

<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the early Edo period who ruled the Takatō Domain in Shinano Province (modern-day Nagano Prefecture). 

== History ==
Tadaharu was the 3rd son of Torii Tadamasa, the lord of the Yamagata Domain. As his father died before a successor was named from among his sons, the Torii family&#x27;s holdings were confiscated. However, because of his grandfather Torii Mototada&#x27;s distinguished service, the family name was restored, and Tadaharu was made lord of the Takatō fief, with an income of 32,000 koku.

Tadaharu was first famed for his wise rulership of Takatō; however, his rule soon became oppressive, especially after he killed seven of his senior retainers who admonished him. Many of the peasants from Takatō fled to Tokugawa-controlled &quot;tenryō&quot; territory in 1654. In 1663, while serving at Osaka Castle, Tadaharu was murdered by his doctor Matsui Jukaku.

The family headship was passed to Tadaharu&#x27;s eldest son Tadanori.

<text>was a Japanese samurai of the mid-Sengoku period. Longtime retainer of Matsudaira Hirotada and later, his son Tokugawa Ieyasu. When Ieyasu was sent to Sunpu Castle to be a hostage to the Imagawa clan, Tadayoshi served alongside Matsudaira Shigeyoshi as castle warden of Okazaki Castle. He was renowned as a model of frugality, eventually saving up enough money by the time Ieyasu returned, in order to rearm the Matsudaira (Tokugawa) clan. 

Tadayoshi was a father in law of Honda Shigetsugu. 
In later years, he was held up as the model Mikawa-era Tokugawa vassal. After he died, his son, Torii Mototada succeeded the Torii family headship.

<doc id="366935" wikidata="Q49341" url="?curid=366935" title="Old Javanese">
<text>Old Javanese or Kawi is the oldest attested phase of the Javanese language. It was spoken in the central and eastern part of Java Island, what is now Central Java and East Java, Indonesia. As a literary language, Kawi was used across Java and on the islands of Madura, Bali, and Lombok. It had a sizable vocabulary of Sanskrit loanwords but had not yet developed the formal &quot;krama&quot; language register, to be used with one&#x27;s social superiors that is characteristic of modern Javanese.

==History==
While evidence of writing in Java dates to the Sanskrit &quot;Tarumanegara inscription&quot; of 450 AD, the oldest example written entirely in Javanese, called the Sukabumi inscription, is dated 25 March 804 AD. This inscription, located in the district of Pare in the Kediri Regency of East Java, is a copy of the original, dated some 120 years earlier; only this copy has been preserved. Its contents concern the construction of a dam for an irrigation canal near the river Śrī Hariñjing (now shortened to Srinjing). This inscription is the last of its kind to be written using Pallava script; all consequent examples of Old Javanese are written using Kawi script.

=== Development ===
Old Javanese was not static, and its usage covered approximately 500 years – from the Sukabumi (Kediri, East Java) inscription until the founding of the Majapahit empire in 1292. The Javanese language which was spoken and written in the Majapahit era already underwent some changes and is therefore already closer to the Modern Javanese language.

==== Austronesian origins ====
The most important shaping force on Old Javanese was its Austronesian heritage in vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar that it shared with its sister languages in Southeast Asia.

==== Sanskrit influence ====
The Indian linguistic influence in the Old Javanese language was almost exclusively Sanskrit influence. There is no evidence of Indian linguistic elements in Old Javanese other than Sanskrit. This is different from, for example, the influence of Indian linguistics in the (Old) Malay language.

Sanskrit has had a deep and lasting impact on the vocabulary of the Javanese language. The &quot;Old Javanese–English Dictionary&quot;, written by Professor P.J. Zoetmulder in 1982, contains approximately 25,500 entries, no fewer than 12,500 of which are borrowed from Sanskrit. This large number is not an indication of usage, but it is an indication that the Ancient Javanese knew and employed these Sanskrit words in their literary works. In any given Old Javanese literary work, approximately 25% of the vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit.

===== Phonology =====
Sanskrit has also influenced both the phonology and the vocabulary of Old Javanese. Old Javanese also contains retroflex consonants, which might have been derived from Sanskrit. That is disputed by several linguists, who hold the view that it is also possible that the occurrence of these retroflex consonants was an independent development within the Austronesian language family.

===== Vocabulary =====
A related question is the form in which Sanskrit words were loaned in Old Javanese. The borrowed Sanskrit words in Old Javanese are almost without exceptions nouns and adjectives in their undeclined form (Sanskrit &quot;lingga&quot;). Old Javanese texts contain many more characters with similar phonology values to represent distinct vowels and consonants in Sanskrit such as unadapted loanwords. Wherever these diacritics occur in Old Javanese texts, they are neglected in pronunciation: &quot;bhaṭāra&quot; is the same as &quot;baṭara&quot; (loss of vowel length and aspiration is also shared by Elu Prakrit, the ancestor of Sinhala). Nor do they influence the order of the words in the dictionary: the variants s, ṣ, and ś, for example, are all treated like s.

=== Influences ===
Medieval poems written in Old Javanese using the Kawi script continued to be circulated within the courts of Kartasura, Surakarta, and Yogyakarta. The poems were called &quot;layang kawi&quot; (Kawi books) or &quot;kakawin&quot; and were held in high regard. Starting in the 18th century, literature inspired by Old Javanese was written using the modern Javanese language and verse.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Old Javanese has six vowels. Those vowels are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ĕ&quot; /ə/, &quot;e&quot; /e/, i, u, and o in Latin transliteration. Little can be said about the pronunciation of Old Javanese. It is believed that
it has not been much different from the pronunciation of modern Javanese. However, the major difference is the pronunciation of /a/ in open syllables: now å, then /a/, such as in (forest). Although, Old Javanese made a distinction between those &quot;short vowels&quot; and &quot;long vowels&quot; in writing such as ā, ö, e, ī, ū, and o, however, these &quot;long vowels&quot; have no distinction in phonology with those &quot;short vowels&quot;. This distinction is generally happened with unadapted loanwords from Sanskrit which differentiates the short and long vowels.

=== Consonants ===
There are twenty consonants in Old Javanese which are written as b, c, d, ḍ, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ñ, ŋ, p, r, s, t, ṭ, w, and y in Latin transliteration. The consonant ñ sometimes is written as the digraph ny and IPA ɲ, while the consonant ŋ sometimes is written as the digraph ng.

=== Sandhi ===
Sandhi is a cover term for a wide variety of sound changes that occur at morpheme or word boundaries.

* If a word ends in a vowel and the next word in the same sentence begins with a vowel, both words may merge into one, with one vowel instead of two vowels, such as &quot;dewatādi&quot; instead of &quot;dewata&quot; + &quot;adi&quot;.
* A merger of ĕ with the preceding vowel results in assimilated ĕ to the preceding vowel, such as &quot;wawan&quot; (load, cargo; vessel, carrier, container, setting) from &quot;wawa&quot; (to carry, to bring) + &quot;ĕn&quot;.
* Similar vowels without short-long vowels consideration are assimilated as &quot;long vowels&quot;. For example, &quot;rĕngön&quot; (hearing) is constructed from &quot;rĕngö&quot; (hearing, listening) + &quot;ĕn&quot;.
* The open vowel /a/ followed by close-front vowels of /e/ or /i/ are assimilated as /e/, such as &quot;bhinna ika&quot; become &quot;bhinneka&quot; (those are different). Meanwhile, the open vowel /a/ followed by close-back vowels of /o/ or /u/ is assimilated as /o/, such as &quot;mantra oṣadha&quot; becomes &quot;mantroṣadha&quot;.
* The semi-vowel y or w will replace the corresponding vowel i, u, or ö, when followed by a dissimilar vowel. For example, &quot;kadi amṛta&quot; become &quot;kadyamṛta&quot; (i + a → ya), &quot;ri ubhaya&quot; become &quot;ryubhaya&quot; (i + u → yu), &quot;milu āśā&quot; become &quot;milwāśā&quot; (u + a → wa), &quot;māsku ibu&quot; become &quot;māskwibu&quot; (u + i → wi), and &quot;angangsö agawe&quot; become &quot;angangswagawe&quot; (ö + a → wa).

== Grammar ==

=== Verb ===
Old Javanese verbs are morphologically complex and are conjugated by taking on a variety of affixes reflecting focus/trigger, aspect, voice, and other categories. 

==== Voice/Focus/Trigger ====
* The active voice is derived through either prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot; or infix &quot;-um-&quot;. 
** The prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot;, which is realised as &quot;maN-&quot; and &quot;aN-,&quot; is the prefix to make transitive verbs, for example, &quot;amati&quot; (to kill) from &quot;pati&quot; (death) and &quot;mangan&quot; (to eat) from &quot;pangan&quot; (food), if the base word is a verb. However, if the base word is a noun, the derivation can result in both transitive and intransitive verbs, such as &quot;angjanma&quot; (to be born, incarnate) from &quot;janma&quot; (man), whether the result will be either transitive or intransitive can not be predicted. In the base word is an adjective, the derived verbs are causative, such as &quot;anghilang&quot; (to cause something to disappear) from &quot;hilang&quot; (disappeared). The derivation can undergo denasalization in particular situations such as &quot;pamangan&quot; instead of &quot;mamangan&quot; (to eat) and &quot;panginum&quot; instead of &quot;manginum&quot; (to drink).
** The infix &quot;-um-&quot; is the prefix to show active verb which generally shows no difference in meaning with the derivation with prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot;. Sometimes, there is a difference in meaning between the prefixed &quot;(m)aN-&quot; and infixed &quot;-um-&quot;, such as &quot;anahur&quot; (to repay) and &quot;sumahur&quot; (to answer) from &quot;sahur&quot; (answer, return).
* Passive voices are derived through either the prefix &quot;ka-&quot; or infix &quot;-in-&quot;. It is not necessary to express the actor in a passive sentence. If the actor is explicitly mentioned, the actor is introduced by &quot;de&quot; and put after the subject, such as &quot;Katon pwa ta de sang Śrutasena&quot;.
** The prefix &quot;ka-&quot; refers to passive voice. If it is put before the consonant of the stem, it shows no change. However, if it is put before vowels, the sandhi is applicable, such as in &quot;kālap&quot; (taken) from &quot;ka-&quot; + &quot;alap&quot;. Other than &quot;ā&quot; from &quot;a + a&quot;, the other sandhi is &quot;ā&quot; from a + ĕ /ə/, e from a + either i or e, and o from a + u (there is no example with a + o exist).
** The other passive voice derivation is through infix &quot;-in-&quot;, such as &quot;inalap&quot; (taken) from &quot;alap&quot;.

==== Case ====
*The beneficiary-orientedness or plurality can be indicated with the suffix &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-an&quot;. The suffix &quot;-i&quot; is used for active transitive verbs (with prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot; or infix &quot;-um-&quot;) which harmonised into either &quot;-i&quot; (&quot;amatī&quot;, to slay, from &quot;pati&quot;) and &quot;-ani&quot; (&quot;amatyani&quot;, to slay, from &quot;pati&quot;) after a vowel. However, passive transitive verbs use the suffix &quot;-an&quot; (with the prefix &quot;ka-&quot; or infix &quot;-in-&quot;). In case of a final vowel &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-an&quot; is attached, not &quot;-anan&quot;, for example, &quot;kapaḍan&quot;.
* Causative can be indicated by the suffix -&quot;akĕn&quot; from verbal and nominal bases (either prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot; or infix &quot;-um-&quot;). The verb with &quot;-akĕn&quot; is object-oriented. There is no combination between the passive &quot;ka-&quot; and with suffix -&quot;akĕn.&quot; 
* Applicative can be indicated by prefix &quot;maka-&quot; and &quot;pinaka-&quot; with sandhi rules applied. Prefix &quot;maka-&quot; is used for active voice (with &quot;(m)aN-&quot; and &quot;-um-&quot; integrated), while passive voice uses the prefix &quot;pinaka-&quot; (with &quot;-in&quot;- and &quot;ka-&quot; integrated). The denasalisation phenomenon can happen.

==== Mood ====
* Irrealis mood can be indicated by suffix &quot;-a&quot; to the verbs. The active irrealis verb can be constructed as active affixes (prefix &quot;(m)aN-&quot; or infix &quot;-um-&quot;) with suffix -a (such as &quot;manghuripa&quot; from &quot;manghurip&quot;). However, passive irrealis can be constructed with suppression of infix &quot;-in-&quot; and addition of the suffix -&quot;ĕn&quot; (such as &quot;huripĕn&quot;), while the addition of suffix &quot;-a&quot; to prefixed &quot;ka-&quot; passive verbs. The presence of sandhi sometimes made it impossible to see whether -a of irrealis mood. In the case of pronominal suffix presence, the irrealis suffix is prioritized.
* There are three ways to put a verb in the imperative mood.
** ...by bare form without any affix, such as &quot;mijil&quot; (please come out) and &quot;anunggangi&quot; (please mount), which is the polite form. This form is just recognized by the context.
** ...drop the verbal prefix, such as &quot;wijil&quot; and &quot;tunggangi&quot;.
** ...place either &quot;t(a)&quot; or &quot;p(a)&quot; before the unchanged or reduced form&quot;,&quot; such as &quot;ta mijil&quot;, &quot;ta wijil, pamijil&quot; or &quot;pawijil&quot; and &quot;tānunggangi, ta tunggangi, pānunggangi&quot; or &quot;patunggangi&quot;.
* Prohibition is expressed by the word &quot;haywa&quot; (do not), such as &quot;haywa ta kita malara!&quot; (Don&#x27;t be sad!).

=== Noun and pronoun ===

==== Particle ====
There are various particles in Old Javanese. Particle &quot;ta&quot; is the most common one. The other particles that occur regularly are &quot;pwa&quot;, &quot;ya,&quot; and &quot;sira&quot;. These &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;sira&quot; as particles must be differentiated from the personal pronouns &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;sira&quot;, ‘he, she’. Sometimes they are combined such as &quot;ta pwa&quot; and &quot;ta ya&quot;. It is not compulsory to use them; they are often left out.

==== Personal pronouns and pronominal suffixes ====
Old Javanese have several personal pronouns for the first, second, and third person. The pronoun is not differentiated by singular and plural and social status in general. &quot;Sira&quot; may be used as an honorific particle, similar to &quot;sang&quot;.

The personal pronoun has corresponding pronominal suffixes which serve to express either the possessive relationship or an agent&quot;.&quot;

The suffixes exhibit sandhi features, such as

* The suffix &quot;-ku&quot; has no change after a consonant, such as in &quot;tanganku&quot; (my hand). However, the suffix will change into &quot;-ngku&quot; after a vowel.
* The suffix &quot;-ta&quot; has no change after consonant, but will change into &quot;-nta&quot; after vowel.
* The suffix &quot;-nya&quot; will change into &quot;-ya&quot; after n.
* The suffix &quot;-nira&quot; will change into &quot;-ira&quot; after n.

The third person pronominal suffixes can express a possessive relationship between two words, such as in &quot;Wĕtunira sang Suyodhana&quot; (the birth of Suyodhana). 

The third person pronominal suffixes can be used to nominalise verbs and adjectives such as &quot;widagdhanya&quot; (his skills) from adjective &quot;widagdha&quot; and &quot;pinintanira&quot; (his being asked) from the verb &quot;pininta&quot;.

In Old Javanese, a large number of other words than personal pronouns are used by way of personal pronouns for the first and second person. They consist of fixed expressions in which the original meaning of the words involved does not play a role and a virtually boundless list of words referring to functions and family relations. Proper names do not play a role in this respect. For example, first person pronouns can be manifested as &quot;nghulun&quot; (&quot;hulun&quot;, slave) and &quot;ngwang&quot; (&quot;wwang&quot;, man).

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
Old Javanese has four sets of demonstrative pronouns. The members of each set represent different degrees of distance seen from the speaker, while the four sets at least in theory express different shades of stress.
==== Determiner ====
Old Javanese does not have an indefinite article. A noun without an article is indefinite. Old Javanese has three sorts of articles to express definiteness: a definite article, several honorific articles, and &quot;ika&quot; (there are still other ways of expressing definiteness in Old Javanese, for example, the possessive suffix). Both definite articles and honorific articles are placed before the noun and cannot stand by themselves. The definite article is &quot;(a)ng&quot; and it is written combined with particles. Examples of honorific articles that express a certain amount of respect are &quot;si&quot;, &quot;pun&quot;, &quot;sang&quot;, &quot;sang hyang&quot;, &quot;ḍang hyang&quot;, &quot;śrī,&quot; and &quot;ra&quot;. 

Besides the definite article and the articles of respect, &quot;ika&quot; can be used to express definiteness. The word &quot;ika&quot; has two functions, those are definite article and demonstrative pronoun. The word &quot;ika&quot; as a demonstrative pronoun means &#x27;that&#x27; which is used to differentiate from &#x27;this&#x27;. If there is no such contrast, its function is that of a definite article, meaning ‘the’. &quot;Ika&quot; is put in front of the word to which it belongs and always combined with the definite article. 

==== Possessive suffixes ====
Expression of possessiveness in Old Javanese is done with the help of possessive suffixes, such as suffix &quot;-(n)ing&quot; and &quot;-(n)ika&quot;. The suffix -&quot;ning&quot; is constructed from clitic &quot;-(n)i&quot; and the definite article &quot;(a)ng&quot;. The clitic &quot;-(n)i&quot; have no meaning and cannot self-standing, although it is required in the construction. It is generally written as &quot;-ning,&quot; while it is written as &quot;-ing&quot; after base word ending in &quot;n&quot;. The suffix &quot;-(n)ika&quot; is constructed from clitic &quot;-(n)i&quot; and definite article &quot;ika&quot; and is written as &quot;-nika&quot; generally, while it is written as &quot;-ika&quot; after base word ending in &quot;n&quot;. The possessiveness can be expressed with pronominal suffixes, in which no definite article is added in a such case. Honorific articles can also express possessiveness and definiteness, such as &quot;ujar sang guru&quot; (the word of the teacher), by placing the honorific article after the possessed noun and followed by the possessor. 

=== Adjective ===
Old Javanese have two types of adjectives. The first one is an adjective-class base word, such as &quot;urip&quot; (alive). The second one is an adjective-class-derived word that uses affixation with the prefix &quot;(m)a-&quot; from noun base words, such as &quot;adoh&quot; (far away) from &quot;doh&quot; (distance), &quot;ahayu&quot; (beautiful) from &quot;hayu&quot; (beauty) and &quot;mastrī&quot; (married) from &quot;strī&quot; (wife). In case of derivation with the prefix &quot;(m)a-&quot;, the sandhi law is observed especially when the base word starts with a vowel, such as &quot;mānak&quot; (having a child) from &quot;anak&quot; (child), &quot;enak&quot; (at ease) from &quot;inak&quot; (ease), and &quot;mojar&quot; (having speech) from &quot;ujar&quot; (speech), while there is no change if the word begins with a consonant. Nouns can be qualified by adjectives.

=== Adverb ===
Verbs and adjectives, and also adverbs, can be qualified by adverbs. Adverbs are placed before of the words they qualify, except &quot;dahat&quot; (very, very much) is placed after the word. The word &quot;tan&quot; is used to express &#x27;not&#x27; and have several forms as &quot;tatan&quot;, &quot;tātan&quot;, &quot;ndatan&quot;, and &quot;ndātan&quot;.

=== Preposition ===
There are several prepositions in Old Javanese, in which the noun preceded by the preposition is definite, such as:

* Preposition &quot;(r)i&quot; has the meaning of ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘at’, and ‘to’, but also ‘for’, ‘towards’, and even ‘by’, and ‘through’.
* Preposition &quot;sa(ng)ka&quot; has the meaning of ‘from’, ‘compared to’ (‘than’ in comparisons), ‘because of’.
* Combination of both prepositions

However, there are particularities in the expression of &#x27;inside&#x27; or &#x27;from inside&#x27; in Old Javanese. Old Javanese use a combination of either &quot;jĕro&quot; or &quot;dalĕm&quot; (inner part, depth) followed by clitic &quot;-ni&quot;, such as &quot;dalĕmnikang&quot; to express the idea of &#x27;inside&#x27; or &#x27;from inside&#x27;. The preposition of the inside is expressed by placing either &quot;(r)i&quot; or &quot;sake&quot; before either &quot;jĕro&quot; or &quot;dalĕm&quot; (inner part, depth) without placement of both clitic &quot;-ni&quot; and definite articles.

It is important to remember that &quot;(r)i&quot; can be used as an object marker of transitive verb and proper noun maker.

=== Conjunction ===
There are several conjunctions in Old Javanese; the most common ones are &quot;an&quot;, &quot;yan&quot;, &quot;apan&quot;, and &quot;yarapwan&quot;. The order of elements in sub-clauses headed by &quot;an&quot; is the same as in main clauses: the subject follows the predicate. However, different from main clauses, in sub-clauses headed by an no separating particle is used.

* Conjunction &quot;an&quot; can be interpreted as either &#x27;that&#x27;, &#x27;so that, in order to&#x27; and &#x27;while, as&#x27;. The use of &quot;an&quot; may cause the suppression of -um- and denasalization.
* Conjunction &quot;yan&quot; means &#x27;that&#x27; or &#x27;if, when&#x27;.
* Conjunction &quot;apan&quot; means &#x27;because&#x27;.

===Syntax===
In a basic clause, predicate and subject are separated from each other by a particle (&quot;ta&quot;) marking the border between both parts of the sentence. For example, &quot;lunghā ta sira&quot; means &quot;he leaves&quot; as leave (&quot;lunghā&quot;), particle (&quot;ta&quot;), and the third person pronoun (&quot;sira&quot;). The predicate comes first in the sentence, the subject follows the predicate, which is the normal order. However, the reversed order also occurs which it signals of some particularity such as stress intended by the writer. These sentences lack an indication of time.

Subject in Old Javanese can be personal pronoun, noun, and proper names. The predicate can be a verbal predicate where the predicate is a verb. The predicate can also be a nominal predicate, where the predicate can be an adjective and nouns, including proper names, and pronouns. Old Javanese verbs are not conjugated and do not formally distinguish between present and past time.

==Writing system==
Old Javanese was written with Kawi or Old Javanese script in 8th–16th century. The Kawi script is a Brahmic script found primarily in Java and used across much of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Kawi script is related to the Pallava script and Kadamba script in South India. Nowadays, Old Javanese can be written with Balinese script and Javanese script in modern literatures which are descendants of Kawi script. 

==Usage==

=== Oral expression ===
Kawi is not truly extinct as a spoken language. It is commonly used in some Javanese traditional events such as wayang golek, wayang wong and wayang kulit, in addition to high activities such as a Javanese wedding, especially for the stylised meeting ritual of bride&#x27;s parents with groom&#x27;s parents in the ceremonies of Peningsetan and Panggih. Archaically or for certain nobles very strongly attached to tradition, it is used for the Midodareni, Siraman and Sungkeman ceremonies of the Javanese wedding.

The island of Lombok has adopted Kawi as its regional language, reflecting the very strong influence of East Java. Today, it is taught in primary school education as part of the compulsory secondary language unit of National curriculum. Traditionally, Kawi is written on lontar prepared palm leaves.

=== Literature ===
Kawi remains in occasional use as an archaic prose and literary language, in a similar fashion to Shakespeare-era English.

There are many important literary works written in Kawi, most notably Empu Tantular&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;&quot;Kakawin Sutasoma&quot;,&quot; from which is taken the National motto of Indonesia: &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot;. Although often glibly translated as &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;, it is more correctly rendered as &quot;[although] scattered, remaining [as] one&quot;— referring to the scattered islands of the archipelago nation, not as an expression of multicultural solidarity as may be perceived in modern times.

A more modern work is the poem &quot;Susila Budhi Dharma&quot;, by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo, the founder of Subud. In this work, he provides a framework for understanding the experience of the latihan kejiwaan.

==Scholars==
The first scholar to address Kawi in a serious academic manner was Wilhelm von Humboldt, who considered it the father of all Malay-Polynesian languages. Furthermore, he deprecated misconceptions about Kawi being wholly influenced by Sanskrit, finding that Kawi did not use verb inflexion, thus differing from Sanskrit&#x27;s highly developed inflectional system. Kawi might have come from a very ancient settlement in the pacific side of Asia. In Kawi language, the meaning of a sentence must be grasped through word order and context. Humboldt further noted that Kawi utilizes tense distinctions, with past, present, and future, and differentiated moods via the imperative and subjunctive.

Numerous scholars have studied the language, including the Dutch expatriate Indonesian Prof. Dr. Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder S.J., who contributed an enormous quantity of original texts and serious scholarly study to the language, and his pupil and associate, Father Dr. Ignatius Kuntara Wiryamartana. Other eminent Indonesian scholars of the language include Poedjawijatna, Sumarti Suprayitna, Poerbatjaraka and Tardjan Hadiwidjaja.

<doc id="366943" wikidata="Q26707660" url="?curid=366943" title="Killing of Amadou Diallo">
<text>In the early hours of February 4, 1999, an unarmed 23-year-old Guinean student named Amadou Diallo (born September 2, 1975) was fired upon with 41 rounds and shot a total of 19 times by four New York City Police Department plainclothes officers: Sean Carroll, Richard Murphy, Edward McMellon, and Kenneth Boss. Carroll later claimed to have mistaken Diallo for a rape suspect from one year earlier.

The four officers, who were part of the Street Crime Unit, which had expanded in size under mayor Rudy Giuliani, were charged with second-degree murder and acquitted at trial in Albany, New York. A firestorm of controversy erupted after the event, as the circumstances of the shooting prompted outrage both within and beyond New York City. Issues such as police brutality, racial profiling, and contagious shooting were central to the ensuing controversy.

== Early life ==

Diallo was one of four children born to Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo, and part of a historic Fulbe trading family in Guinea. He was born in Sinoe County in Liberia on September 2, 1975, while his father was working there, and while growing up followed his family to Togo, Singapore, Thailand, and back to Guinea. In September 1996, he followed other family members to New York City and started a business with a cousin. According to his family&#x27;s lawyer, he sought to remain in the United States by filing a political asylum application, falsely claiming that he was from Mauritania and that his parents had been killed in fighting. He sold video cassettes, gloves, and socks on the sidewalk along 14th Street during the day.

== Death ==
In the early morning of February 4, 1999, Diallo was standing near his building of residence after returning from a meal. At about 12:40 a.m., officers Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, and Richard Murphy were looking for a serial rapist in the Soundview section of the Bronx. While driving down Wheeler Avenue, the police officers observed Diallo standing in front of his building entrance looking up and down the street. They stopped their unmarked car intending to question Diallo. When they ordered Diallo to show his hands, he ran up into the building entrance and reached into his pocket to produce what turned out to be his wallet. Assuming Diallo was drawing a firearm, one officer fired as he was walking up the stairs. The recoil of the gun caused the officer to fall backwards. The other three officers, believing their partner was shot, fired their weapons. The four officers fired 41 shots with semi-automatic pistols, hitting Diallo 19 times, fatally wounding him. Eyewitness Sherrie Elliott stated that the police continued to shoot even though Diallo was already down.

The investigation found no weapons on or near Diallo; what he had pulled out of his jacket was a wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled that the officers had acted within policy, based on what a reasonable police officer would have done in the same circumstances. Nonetheless, the Diallo shooting led to a review of police training policy and switching away from the use of full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets.

On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. On December 16, a court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York because of pretrial publicity. On February 25, 2000, after three days of deliberation, a jury composed of four black and eight white jurors acquitted the officers of all charges.

== Aftermath ==

The killing prompted an outpouring of protest, culminating in 1,200 arrests of protesters in New York City, as well as Rep. John Lewis and Rev. Al Sharpton becoming involved. The head of the NAACP urged the United States Attorney General to take action. 

In March 2000, the United States Department of Justice found that the NYPD Street Crimes Unit, to which the four officers belonged, engaged in racial profiling.

In April 2000, Diallo&#x27;s mother and father filed a $61million lawsuit against the city and the officers, charging gross negligence, wrongful death, racial profiling, and other violations of Diallo&#x27;s civil rights. In March 2004, they accepted a $3 million settlement, one of the largest in the City of New York for a single man with no dependents under New York State&#x27;s &quot;wrongful death law&quot;, which limits damages to financial loss by the deceased person&#x27;s next of kin. Anthony H. Gair, representing the Diallo family, argued that federal common law should apply.

In April 2002, as a result of the killing of Diallo and other controversial actions, the Street Crime Unit was disbanded. In 2003, Diallo&#x27;s mother published a memoir, &quot;My Heart Will Cross This Ocean: My Story, My Son, Amadou&quot;, with the help of author Craig Wolff.

Diallo&#x27;s death became an issue in the 2005 New York City mayoral election. Bronx borough president and mayoral candidate Fernando Ferrer, who had protested against the circumstances of the killing at the time, was criticized by the Diallo family and many others for telling a meeting of police sergeants that although the shooting had been a tragedy, the officers had been &quot;over-indicted&quot;.

Officer Kenneth Boss had previously been involved in an incident in which an unarmed black man was shot. After the trial, Boss was reassigned to desk duty, but in October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss&#x27;s ability to carry a firearm. As of 2012, he was the only one of the four officers still working for the NYPD. In 2015, he was promoted to sergeant in accordance with state civil service law, which is not subject to review by top department officials. The next year, he was named &quot;sergeant of the year&quot; by his union. He retired from law enforcement in 2019.

A report from &quot;Capital New York&quot; reported that 85 IP addresses belonging to the New York Police Department had made changes to Wikipedia pages about NYPD misconduct and also to articles about people killed in police interventions, including this article. One of these edits changed the statement &quot;Officer Kenneth Boss had previously been involved in an incident in which an unarmed man was shot, but continued to work as a police officer&quot; to &quot;Officer Kenneth Boss was previously involved in an incident in which a man armed was shot.&quot; Two policemen associated with these edits were reported to receive only &quot;minor reprimands&quot;.

In April 2021, Diallo&#x27;s mother was interviewed about her reaction to the conviction of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. She said it was hard to tell if a corner had been turned in police accountability but it was &quot;a right step in the right direction.&quot;

<doc id="366953" wikidata="Q36213" url="?curid=366953" title="Madurese language">
<text>Madurese is a language of the Madurese people, native to the Madura Island and Eastern Java, Indonesia; it is also spoken by migrants to other parts of Indonesia, namely the eastern salient of Java (comprising Pasuruan, Surabaya, Malang, to Banyuwangi), the Masalembu Islands and even some on Kalimantan. It was traditionally written in the Javanese script, but the Latin script and the Pegon script (based on Arabic script) is now more commonly used. The number of speakers, though shrinking, is estimated to be 10-13 million, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the country. Bawean Madurese, which is a dialect of Madurese, is also spoken by Baweanese descendants in Malaysia and Singapore.

Madurese is a Malayo-Sumbawan language of the Malayo-Polynesian language family, a branch of the larger Austronesian language family. Thus, despite apparent geographic spread, Madurese is more related to Balinese, Malay, Sasak and Sundanese, than it is to Javanese, the language used on the island of Java just across Madura Island.

Links between Bali–Sasak languages and Madurese are more evident with the vernacular form (common form).

==Phonology==
Latin letters are given according to the 2008 orthography.

=== Vowels ===
Vowels , , , and its higher counterparts , , , are usually in complementary distribution. The last 4 vowels occur after voiced and aspirated consonants, while the first 4 vowels occur elsewhere. Consonants , , and , although by default lower the vowels, are transparent after higher vowels, for example &quot;belli&quot; &quot;to buy&quot; instead of &quot;*bellè&quot; .

=== Consonants ===
Madurese has more consonants than its neighboring languages due to it having voiceless unaspirated, voiceless aspirated (traditionally often transcribed as voiced aspirated), and voiced unaspirated. Similar to Javanese, it has a contrast between dental and alveolar (even retroflex) stops.

The letters , , , , and are used in loanwords.

==Morphology==
Madurese nouns are not inflected for gender and are pluralized via reduplication. Its basic word order is subject–verb–object. Negation is expressed by putting a negative particle before the verb, adjective or noun phrase. As with other similar languages, there are different negative particles for different kinds of negation.

==Common words==
===Numerals===
==Sample text==
From Article 1 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

;Latin: Sâdhâjâna orèng lahèr mardhika èsarengè dhrâjhât klabân ha&#x27;-ha&#x27; sè padâ. Sâdhâjâna èparèngè akal sareng nurani bân kodhu areng-sareng akanca kadhi tarètan.

;Aksara Pèghu: 

;Translation: &quot;All Human Beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<text>Nanna Popham Britton (November 9, 1896 – March 21, 1991) was an American woman who gained notoriety as a mistress of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. In 1927, Britton revealed that her daughter, Elizabeth, had been fathered by Harding while he was serving in the United States Senate, one year before his election to the presidency. Britton&#x27;s claim was open to question during her lifetime, but in 2015, Harding&#x27;s paternity was finally confirmed by DNA testing.

==Relationship with Harding==
Harding and Britton&#x27;s family both lived in Marion, Ohio. Harding&#x27;s younger sister, Abigail, was Britton&#x27;s high school English teacher. Britton was in her early teens when she developed a crush on Harding, which rapidly became an obsession. Nan&#x27;s father, Samuel H. Britton a physician, spoke to Harding about his teenage daughter&#x27;s infatuation, and Harding met with her, telling her that some day she would find the man of her dreams. Harding had married his wife, Florence in 1891 and was involved in a long and passionate affair with Carrie Fulton Phillips, wife of James Phillips, co-owner of a Marion department store. After graduating from high school in 1914, Britton moved to New York City, to begin a career as a secretary. She claimed she also began an intimate relationship with Harding at this time.

Following President Harding&#x27;s sudden death in August, 1923, Britton wrote what is considered to be the first kiss-and-tell book. In &quot;The President&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published in 1927, she told of her life as Harding&#x27;s mistress throughout his presidency and named him as the father of her daughter, Elizabeth Ann (1919–2005). One famous passage told of their having sexual relations in a closet near the President&#x27;s office in the White House.

According to Britton, Harding had promised to support their daughter, but after his death, his wife Florence refused to honor the obligation. Britton decided to write a tell-all book to earn money to support her daughter and to champion the rights of illegitimate children. She brought a lawsuit (&quot;Britton v. Klunk&quot;), but she was unable to provide any concrete evidence and was shaken by the vicious personal attacks made by Congressman Grant Mouser during the cross examination, which cost her the case.

Britton&#x27;s portrayal of Harding and his colloquialisms paints a picture of a crude womanizer. In his 1931 book &quot;Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s&quot;, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote that on the testimony of Britton&#x27;s book, Harding&#x27;s private life was &quot;one of cheap sex episodes&quot; and that &quot;one sees with deadly clarity the essential ordinariness of the man, the commonness of his &#x27;Gee dearie&#x27; and &#x27;Say, you darling&#x27;.&quot; Britton&#x27;s book was among those irreverently reviewed by Dorothy Parker for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine as part of her famous &quot;Constant Reader&quot; column, under the title &quot;An American DuBarry&quot;.

In 1964, the discovery of more than 250 love letters that Harding had written to Carrie Fulton Phillips between 1909 and 1920 gave further credence to Britton&#x27;s own claims. At that time, Britton was living in seclusion in Illinois; she was located by journalist R.W. Apple Jr. but she refused him an interview. Even at this time, over a generation later, her daughter and grandchildren would &quot;occasionally be hounded by hateful skeptics&quot; with threats and other unwanted attention that seemed to intensify during presidential election years.

In the 1980s, Britton and her extended family moved to Oregon, where her three grandchildren were living as of 2015. Britton died in 1991 in Sandy, Oregon, where she had lived during the last years of her life. She insisted until her death that Harding was Elizabeth&#x27;s father. In 2015, 24 years after Britton&#x27;s death (and 10 years after Elizabeth&#x27;s), Ancestry.com confirmed through DNA testing of descendants of Harding&#x27;s brother and Britton&#x27;s grandchildren that Elizabeth was unquestionably Harding&#x27;s daughter.

==In popular culture==
Nan Britton was portrayed by Virginia Kull in season one of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

<doc id="366968" wikidata="Q451697" url="?curid=366968" title="Ama Dablam">
<text>Ama Dablam is a mountain in the eastern Himalayan range of Koshi Province, Nepal. The main peak is , the lower western peak is . Ama Dablam means &quot;mother&#x27;s necklace&quot;; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (&quot;ama&quot;) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the &quot;dablam&quot;, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women. For several days, Ama Dablam dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp. For its soaring ridges and steep faces Ama Dablam is sometimes referred as the &quot;Matterhorn of the Himalayas.&quot; The mountain is featured on the one rupee Nepalese banknote.

Although Alfred Gregory led the first attempt on Ama Dablam in 1958 it was on 13 March 1961 that the first successful ascent was made, when Mike Gill (NZ), Barry Bishop (US), Mike Ward (UK) and Wally Romanes (NZ) ascended the Southwest Ridge. They were well-acclimatised to altitude, having wintered over at near the base of the peak as part of the 1960–61 Silver Hut expedition, led by Sir Edmund Hillary.

Situated at a distance of north of the provincial capital of Biratnagar and northeast to Kathmandu, Ama Dablam is the third most popular Himalayan peak for permitted expeditions. The most popular route by far is the Southwest Ridge (right skyline in the photo). Prior to a 2006 avalanche, climbers typically set up three camps along the ridge with Camp III just below and to the right of the hanging glacier, the Dablam. Any ice that calves off the glacier typically goes left, away from the camp. However, after the avalanche, climbers now prefer to set just two camps to minimize risk. Camp I is at an altitude of over 5,800 metres (19,029 ft), and Camp II is at an altitude of over 6,000 metres (19,685 ft). A climbing permit and a liaison officer are required when attempting Ama Dablam. As with Mount Everest, the best climbing months are April and May (before the monsoon) and September and October.

==Accidents==
In May 1959, George Fraser and Mike Harris, two of Britain&#x27;s finest climbers, were last seen at 6,400 metres (21,000 ft) on the mountain&#x27;s north ridge, but never returned to tell whether they had reached the summit.

On the night of 13/14 November 2006, a large serac collapse occurred from the hanging glacier, which swept away several tents at Camp III, killing six climbers (three European, three Nepalese). Eyewitness testimony indicates that Camp III had not been sited in an unusual or abnormally dangerous spot, and that the serac fall was of such magnitude as to render the specific placing of the tents at Camp III irrelevant.

On November 28, 2016, highly acclaimed climbing Sherpa Lakpa Thundu Sherpa of Pangboche was killed when a 5.4 magnitude earthquake struck, triggering an avalanche and the release of a few ice blocks. Thundu was at on the mountain.

On 11 November 2017, Valery Rozov was killed when he jumped from the mountain in a wingsuit and struck a cliff.

==In popular culture==
A representation of Ama Dablam was originally used by Invesco Perpetual as its branding logo within the UK. It has since been adopted by the INVESCO group of companies as its worldwide signature.
