<text>The history of geodesy () began during antiquity and ultimately blossomed during the Age of Enlightenment.

Many early conceptions of the Earth held it to be flat, with the heavens being a physical dome spanning over it. Early arguments for a spherical Earth pointed to various more subtle empirical observations, including how lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows, as well as the fact that Polaris is seen lower in the sky as one travels southward.

==Hellenic world==

===Initial developments===
Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of Earth was discovered, or if it was initially simply a guess. A plausible explanation given by the historian Otto E. Neugebauer is that it was &quot;the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable altitude of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between Greek settlements&quot; around the eastern Mediterranean Sea, particularly those between the Nile Delta and Crimea.

Another possible explanation can be traced back to earlier Phoenician sailors. The first circumnavigation of Africa is described as being undertaken by Phoenician explorers employed by Egyptian pharaoh Necho II . In &quot;The Histories&quot;, written 431–425 BC, Herodotus cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed by Phoenician explorers during their circumnavigation of Africa (, 4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians&#x27; report. The historian Dmitri Panchenko hypothesizes that it was the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa that inspired the theory of a spherical Earth, the earliest mention of which was made by the philosopher Parmenides in the 5th century BC. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived; therefore, later researchers have no evidence that they conceived of Earth as spherical.

Speculation and theorizing ranged from the flat disc advocated by Homer to the spherical body reportedly postulated by Pythagoras. Anaximenes, an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was rectangular in shape. Some early Greek philosophers alluded to a spherical Earth, though with some ambiguity. Pythagoras (6th century BC) was among those said to have originated the idea, but this might reflect the ancient Greek practice of ascribing every discovery to one or another of their ancient wise men. Pythagoras was a mathematician, and he supposedly reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure which to him was a sphere, but there is no evidence for this claim. Some idea of the sphericity of Earth seems to have been known to both Parmenides and Empedocles in the 5th century BC, and although the idea cannot reliably be ascribed to Pythagoras, it might nevertheless have been formulated in the Pythagorean school in the 5th century BC although some disagree. After the 5th century BC, just a few Greek writers of repute thought the world was anything but round. The Pythagorean idea was supported later by Aristotle. Efforts commenced to determine the size of the sphere.

===Plato===
Plato (427–347 BC) travelled to southern Italy to study Pythagorean mathematics. When he returned to Athens and established his school, Plato also taught his students that Earth was a sphere, though he offered no justifications. &quot;My conviction is that the Earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or of any similar force to be a support.&quot; If man could soar high above the clouds, Earth would resemble &quot;one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on Earth are in a manner samples.&quot; In &quot;Timaeus&quot;, his one work that was available throughout the Middle Ages in Latin, he wrote that the Creator &quot;made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures&quot;, though the word &quot;world&quot; here refers to the heavens.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle (384–322 BC) was Plato&#x27;s prize student and &quot;the mind of the school&quot;. Aristotle observed &quot;there are stars seen in Egypt and [...] Cyprus which are not seen in the northerly regions&quot;. Since this could only happen on a curved surface, he too believed Earth was a sphere &quot;of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent&quot;.

Aristotle reported the circumference of the Earth (which is actually slightly over 40,000 km or 24,000 miles) to be 400,000 stadia (45,000 miles or 74,000 km).

Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:

* Every portion of Earth tends toward the centre until by compression and convergence they form a sphere.
* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon.
* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round.

The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle&#x27;s work. In his &quot;Meteorology&quot; he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the equator, and two cold inhospitable regions, &quot;one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [...] southern pole&quot;, both impenetrable and girdled with ice. Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

Aristotle&#x27;s theory of natural place relied on a spherical Earth to explain why heavy things go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like air and fire go up. In this geocentric model, the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on celestial spheres around a stationary Earth.

Though Aristotle&#x27;s theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the heliocentric model was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the Solar System than the geocentric model, and atomic theory was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than classical elements like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.

===Archimedes===
Archimedes () gave an upper bound for the circumference of the Earth.

In proposition 2 of the First Book of his treatise &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;, Archimedes demonstrates that &quot;The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same as that of the Earth.&quot; Subsequently, in propositions 8 and 9 of the same work, he assumes the result of proposition 2 that Earth is a sphere and that the surface of a fluid on it is a sphere centered on the center of Earth.

===Eratosthenes===
Eratosthenes (276–194 BC), a Hellenistic astronomer from what is now Cyrene, Libya, working in Alexandria, Egypt, estimated Earth&#x27;s circumference around 240 BC, computing a value of 252,000 &quot;stades&quot;. The length that Eratosthenes intended for a &quot;stade&quot; is not known, but his figure only has an error of around one to five percent. Assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres, the error is between −2.4% and +0.8%. Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled &quot;On the Measure of the Earth&quot;, which has not been preserved. Eratosthenes could only measure the circumference of Earth by assuming that the distance to the Sun is so great that the rays of sunlight are practically parallel.

Eratosthenes&#x27;s method to calculate the Earth&#x27;s circumference has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by Cleomedes to popularise the discovery. Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, Alexandria and Syene, modern Assuan:
# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 stadia (a figure that was checked yearly by professional bematists, &quot;mensores regii&quot;); 
# he assumes the simplified hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the Tropic of Cancer, saying that at local noon on the summer solstice the Sun was directly overhead;
# he assumes the simplified hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.

Under the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, one can measure the Sun&#x27;s angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a gnomon) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculate the angle of the Sun&#x27;s rays, which he claims to be about 7.2°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth&#x27;s circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375 km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941 km.

Eratosthenes&#x27;s method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes&#x27;s book. The method was based on several surveying trips conducted by professional bematists, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes. Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes&#x27;s measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simplify calculations; other historians of science, on the other side, believe that Eratosthenes introduced a new length unit based on the length of the meridian, as stated by Pliny, who writes about the stadion &quot;according to Eratosthenes&#x27;s ratio&quot;.

1,700 years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes&#x27;s findings before sailing west for the Indies. However, ultimately he rejected Eratosthenes in favour of other maps and arguments that interpreted Earth&#x27;s circumference to be a third smaller than it really is. If, instead, Columbus had accepted Eratosthenes&#x27;s findings, he might have never gone west, since he did not have the supplies or funding needed for the much longer eight-thousand-plus mile voyage.

===Seleucus of Seleucia===
Seleucus of Seleucia (c. 190 BC), who lived in the city of Seleucia in Mesopotamia, wrote that Earth is spherical (and actually orbits the Sun, influenced by the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus of Samos).

===Posidonius===

A parallel later ancient measurement of the size of the Earth was made by another Greek scholar, Posidonius (c. 13551 BC), using a similar method as Eratosthenes. Instead of observing the Sun, he noted that the star Canopus was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the angular elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of a circle. He used a distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth&#x27;s circumference in stadia as 48 × 5000 = 240,000. Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the &quot;experiment&quot; may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes&#x27;s numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the base distance to agree with Eratosthenes&#x27;s Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia, since Posidonius&#x27; final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48 × 3750 stadia. The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is close to that which results from another method of measuring the Earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal atmospheric refraction. Posidonius furthermore expressed the distance of the Sun in Earth radii.

The above-mentioned larger and smaller sizes of the Earth were those used by later Roman author Claudius Ptolemy at different times: 252,000 stadia in his &quot;Almagest&quot; and 180,000 stadia in his later &quot;Geographia&quot;. His mid-career conversion resulted in the latter work&#x27;s systematic exaggeration of degree longitudes in the Mediterranean by a factor close to the ratio of the two seriously differing sizes discussed here, which indicates that the conventional size of the Earth was what changed, not the stadion.

== Roman Empire ==
The idea of a spherical Earth slowly spread across the globe, and ultimately became the adopted view in all major astronomical traditions.

In the West, the idea came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with Hellenistic civilization. Many Roman authors such as Cicero and Pliny refer in their works to the rotundity of Earth as a matter of course. Pliny also considered the possibility of an imperfect sphere &quot;shaped like a pinecone&quot;.

===Strabo===
It has been suggested that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that Earth was not flat, based on observations of the horizon. This argument was put forward by the geographer Strabo (c. 64 BC – 24 AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of Earth was probably known to seafarers around the Mediterranean Sea since at least the time of Homer, citing a line from the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as indicating that the poet Homer knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. Strabo cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.

===Claudius Ptolemy===
Claudius Ptolemy (90–168 AD) lived in Alexandria, the centre of scholarship in the 2nd century. In the &quot;Almagest&quot;, which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards mountains, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that Earth is curved north–south and that it is curved east–west.

He compiled an eight-volume &quot;Geographia&quot; covering what was known about Earth. The first part of the &quot;Geographia&quot; is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the &quot;Almagest&quot;, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.

&quot;Geographia&quot; indicated the countries of &quot;Serica&quot; and &quot;Sinae&quot; (China) at the extreme right, beyond the island of &quot;Taprobane&quot; (Sri Lanka, oversized) and the &quot;Aurea Chersonesus&quot; (Southeast Asian peninsula).

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to make maps both of the whole inhabited world (&quot;oikoumenè&quot;) and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the &quot;Geographia&quot;, he provided the necessary topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His &quot;oikoumenè&quot; spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to China, and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the East Indies and deep into Africa. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.

===Late Antiquity===
Knowledge of the spherical shape of Earth was received in scholarship of Late Antiquity as a matter of course, in both Neoplatonism and Early Christianity. Calcidius&#x27;s fourth-century Latin commentary on and translation of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed Hipparchus&#x27;s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses in &quot;On Sizes and Distances&quot; to compute the relative diameters of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

Theological doubt informed by the flat Earth model implied in the Hebrew Bible inspired some early Christian scholars such as Lactantius, John Chrysostom and Athanasius of Alexandria, but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose and Augustine of Hippo were clearly aware of the sphericity of Earth. &quot;Flat Earthism&quot; lingered longest in Syriac Christianity, which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as Cosmas Indicopleustes, presented Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning medieval period, &quot;no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth&quot;.

Such widely read encyclopedists as Macrobius and Martianus Capella (both 5th century AD) discussed the circumference of the sphere of the Earth, its central position in the universe, the difference of the seasons in northern and southern hemispheres, and many other geographical details. In his commentary on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;, Macrobius described the Earth as a globe of insignificant size in comparison to the remainder of the cosmos.

== Ancient India ==
While the textual evidence has not survived, the precision of the constants used in pre-Greek &quot;Vedanga&quot; models, and the model&#x27;s accuracy in predicting the Moon and Sun&#x27;s motion for Vedic rituals, probably came from direct astronomical observations. The cosmographic theories and assumptions in ancient India likely developed independently and in parallel, but these were influenced by some unknown quantitative Greek astronomy text in the medieval era.

Greek ethnographer Megasthenes, c. 300 BC, has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans believed in a spherical Earth as the center of the universe. With the spread of Hellenistic culture in the east, Hellenistic astronomy filtered eastwards to ancient India where its profound influence became apparent in the early centuries AD. The Greek concept of an Earth surrounded by the spheres of the planets and that of the fixed stars, vehemently supported by astronomers like Varāhamihira and Brahmagupta, strengthened the astronomical principles. Some ideas were found possible to preserve, although in altered form.

=== Aryabhata ===
The Indian astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata (476–550 CE) was a pioneer of mathematical astronomy on the subcontinent. He describes the Earth as being spherical and says that it rotates on its axis, among other places in his Sanskrit magnum opus, &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot;. &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; is divided into four sections: &quot;Gitika&quot;, &quot;Ganitha&quot; (&quot;mathematics&quot;), &quot;Kalakriya&quot; (&quot;reckoning of time&quot;) and &quot;Gola&quot; (&quot;celestial sphere&quot;). The discovery that the Earth rotates on its own axis from west to east is described in &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (Gitika 3,6; Kalakriya 5; Gola 9,10). For example, he explained the apparent motion of heavenly bodies as only an illusion (Gola 9), with the following simile:

:Just as a passenger in a boat moving downstream sees the stationary (trees on the river banks) as traversing upstream, so does an observer on earth see the fixed stars as moving towards the west at exactly the same speed (at which the earth moves from west to east.)

In the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, Aryabhata also estimates the circumference of the Earth. He gives this as 4967 Yojana and its diameter as 1581 yojana. The length of a Yojana varies considerably between sources (3.5 - 15 km); if a yojana is taken to be 8 km (4.97097 miles) the formula offers a circumference of , close to the current equatorial value of .

== Islamic world ==

Islamic astronomy was developed on the basis of a spherical Earth inherited from Hellenistic astronomy. The Islamic theoretical framework largely relied on the fundamental contributions of Aristotle (&quot;De caelo&quot;) and Ptolemy (&quot;Almagest&quot;), both of whom worked from the premise that Earth was spherical and at the centre of the universe (geocentric model).

Early Islamic scholars recognized Earth&#x27;s sphericity, leading Muslim mathematicians to develop spherical trigonometry in order to further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on Earth to Mecca. This determined the &quot;Qibla&quot;, or Muslim direction of prayer.

=== Al-Ma&#x27;mun ===

Around 830 CE, Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun commissioned a group of Muslim astronomers and geographers to measure the distance from Tadmur (Palmyra) to Raqqa in modern Syria. To determine the length of one degree of latitude, by using a rope to measure the distance travelled due north or south (meridian arc) on flat desert land until they reached a place where the altitude of the North Pole had changed by one degree.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s arc measurement result is described in different sources as 66 2/3 miles, 56.5 miles, and 56 miles. The figure Alfraganus used based on these measurements was 56 2/3 miles, giving an Earth circumference of . 66 miles results in a calculated planetary circumference of .

Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56 Arabic miles (111.8 km) per degree, which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248 km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3 km per degree and 40,068 km circumference, respectively.

=== Ibn Hazm ===
Andalusian polymath Ibn Hazm gave a concise proof of Earth&#x27;s sphericity: at any given time, there is a point on the Earth where the Sun is directly overhead (which moves throughout the day and throughout the year).

=== Al-Farghānī ===
Al-Farghānī (Latinized as Alfraganus) was a Persian astronomer of the 9th century involved in measuring the diameter of Earth, and commissioned by Al-Ma&#x27;mun. His estimate given above for a degree (56 Arabic miles) was much more accurate than the 60 Roman miles (89.7 km) given by Ptolemy. Christopher Columbus uncritically used Alfraganus&#x27;s figure as if it were in Roman miles instead of in Arabic miles, in order to prove a smaller size of Earth than that propounded by Ptolemy.

=== Biruni ===
Abu Rayhan Biruni (973–1048), in contrast to his predecessors, who measured Earth&#x27;s circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top. This yielded more accurate measurements of Earth&#x27;s circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location. Biruni&#x27;s method was intended to avoid &quot;walking across hot, dusty deserts&quot;, and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India (present day Pind Dadan Khan, Pakistan).

From the top of the mountain, he sighted the dip angle which, along with the mountain&#x27;s height (which he calculated beforehand), he applied to the law of sines formula to calculate the curvature of the Earth. While this was an ingenious new method, Al-Biruni was not aware of atmospheric refraction. To get the true dip angle the measured dip angle needs to be corrected by approximately 1/6, meaning that even with perfect measurement his estimate could only have been accurate to within about 20%.

Biruni also made use of algebra to formulate trigonometric equations and used the astrolabe to measure angles.

According to John J. O&#x27;Connor and Edmund F. Robertson,
=== Al-Zarqali ===
By 1060, Andalusi astronomer Al-Zarqali corrects geographical data from Ptolemy and Al-Khwarizmi, specifically by correcting Ptolemy&#x27;s estimate of the longitude of the Mediterranean Sea from 62 degrees to the correct value of 42 degrees.

=== Jamal-al-Din ===
A terrestrial globe (Kura-i-ard) was among the presents sent by the Persian Muslim astronomer Jamal-al-Din to Kublai Khan&#x27;s Chinese court in 1267. It was made of wood on which &quot;seven parts of water are represented in green, three parts of land in white, with rivers, lakes[, et cetera]&quot;. Ho Peng Yoke remarks that &quot;it did not seem to have any general appeal to the Chinese in those days&quot;.

=== Applications ===

Muslim scholars who held to the spherical Earth theory used it to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on Earth to Mecca. Muslim mathematicians developed spherical trigonometry; in the 11th century, al-Biruni used it to find the direction of Mecca from many cities and published it in &quot;The Determination of the Co-ordinates of Cities&quot;. This determined the Qibla, or Muslim direction of prayer.

=== Magnetic declination ===
Muslim astronomers and geographers were aware of magnetic declination by the 15th century, when the Egyptian astronomer &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz al-Wafa&#x27;i (d. 1469/1471) measured it as 7 degrees from Cairo.

== Medieval Europe ==

===Greek influence===

In medieval Europe, knowledge of the sphericity of Earth survived into the medieval corpus of knowledge by direct transmission of the texts of Greek antiquity (Aristotle), and via authors such as Isidore of Seville and the Venerable Bede. It became increasingly traceable with the rise of scholasticism and medieval learning.

Revising the figures attributed to Posidonius, another Greek philosopher determined as the Earth&#x27;s circumference. This last figure was promulgated by Ptolemy through his world maps. The maps of Ptolemy strongly influenced the cartographers of the Middle Ages. It is probable that Christopher Columbus, using such maps, was led to believe that Asia was only west of Europe.

Ptolemy&#x27;s view was not universal, however, and chapter 20 of Sir John Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot; (c. 1357) supports Eratosthenes&#x27; calculation.

Spread of this knowledge beyond the immediate sphere of Greco-Roman scholarship was necessarily gradual, associated with the pace of Christianisation of Europe. For example, the first evidence of knowledge of the spherical shape of Earth in Scandinavia is a 12th-century Old Icelandic translation of &quot;Elucidarius&quot;. A list of more than a hundred Latin and vernacular writers from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages who were aware that Earth was spherical has been compiled by Reinhard Krüger, professor for Romance literature at the University of Stuttgart.

It was not until the 16th century that his concept of the Earth&#x27;s size was revised. During that period the Flemish cartographer, Mercator, made successive reductions in the size of the Mediterranean Sea and all of Europe which had the effect of increasing the size of the earth.

===Early medieval Europe===
====Isidore of Seville====
Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, that Earth was &quot;round&quot;. The bishop&#x27;s confusing exposition and choice of imprecise Latin terms have divided scholarly opinion on whether he meant a sphere or a disk or even whether he meant anything specific. Notable recent scholars claim that he taught a spherical Earth. Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.

====Bede the Venerable====
The monk Bede (c. 672–735) wrote in his influential treatise on computus, &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;, that Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from &quot;the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called &#x27;the orb of the world&#x27; on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe.&quot; (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;, copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of Earth. Ælfric of Eynsham paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, &quot;Now the Earth&#x27;s roundness and the Sun&#x27;s orbit constitute the obstacle to the day&#x27;s being equally long in every land.&quot;

Bede was lucid about Earth&#x27;s sphericity, writing &quot;We call the earth a globe, not as if the shape of a sphere were expressed in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth&#x27;s circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe ... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides.&quot;

====Anania Shirakatsi====
The 7th-century Armenian scholar Anania Shirakatsi described the world as &quot;being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)&quot;.

===High and late medieval Europe===
During the High Middle Ages, the astronomical knowledge in Christian Europe was extended beyond what was transmitted directly from ancient authors by transmission of learning from medieval Islamic astronomy. An early student of such learning was Gerbert d&#x27;Aurillac, the later Pope Sylvester II.

Saint Hildegard (Hildegard von Bingen, 1098–1179), depicted the spherical Earth several times in her work &quot;Liber Divinorum Operum&quot;.

Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1195c. 1256 AD) wrote a famous work on Astronomy called &quot;Tractatus de Sphaera&quot;, based on Ptolemy, which primarily considers the sphere of the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of Earth&#x27;s sphericity in the first chapter.

Many scholastic commentators on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Heavens&quot; and Sacrobosco&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Sphere&quot; unanimously agreed that Earth is spherical or round. Grant observes that no author who had studied at a medieval university thought that Earth was flat.

The &quot;Elucidarium&quot; of Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy, which was translated into Middle English, Old French, Middle High German, Old Russian, Middle Dutch, Old Norse, Icelandic, Spanish, and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that Bertold von Regensburg (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as an illustration in a sermon shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.

Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, written in Italian in the early 14th century, portrays Earth as a sphere, discussing implications such as the different stars visible in the southern hemisphere, the altered position of the Sun, and the various time zones of Earth.

== Early modern period ==
The invention of the telescope and the theodolite and the development of logarithm tables allowed exact triangulation and arc measurements.

=== Ming China ===
Joseph Needham, in his &quot;Chinese Cosmology&quot; reports that Shen Kuo (1031–1095) used models of lunar eclipse and solar eclipse to conclude the roundness of celestial bodies.

However, Shen&#x27;s ideas did not gain widespread acceptance or consideration, as the shape of Earth was not important to Confucian officials who were more concerned with human relations. In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth, now considerably advanced by Western astronomy, ultimately spread to Ming China, when Jesuit missionaries, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that Earth was flat and square.

The &quot;Ge zhi cao&quot; (格致草) treatise of Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) published in 1648 showed a printed picture of Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that &quot;the round Earth certainly has no square corners&quot;. The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of Earth.

The influence of the map is distinctly Western, as traditional maps of Chinese cartography held the graduation of the sphere at 365.25 degrees, while the Western graduation was of 360 degrees. The adoption of European astronomy, facilitated by the failure of indigenous astronomy to make progress, was accompanied by a sinocentric reinterpretation that declared the imported ideas Chinese in origin:

Although mainstream Chinese science until the 17th century held the view that Earth was flat, square, and enveloped by the celestial sphere, this idea was criticized by the Jin-dynasty scholar Yu Xi (fl. 307–345), who suggested that Earth could be either square or round, in accordance with the shape of the heavens. The Yuan-dynasty mathematician Li Ye (c. 1192–1279) firmly argued that Earth was spherical, just like the shape of the heavens only smaller, since a square Earth would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies in his estimation. The 17th-century &quot;Ge zhi cao&quot; treatise also used the same terminology to describe the shape of Earth that the Eastern-Han scholar Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) had used to describe the shape of the Sun and Moon (as in, that the former was as round as a crossbow bullet, and the latter was the shape of a ball).

=== Circumnavigation of the globe ===

The Portuguese exploration of Africa and Asia, Columbus&#x27;s voyage to the Americas (1492) provided more direct evidence of the size and shape of the world.

The first direct demonstration of Earth&#x27;s sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan&#x27;s command departed from Seville. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean, passed through what is now called the Strait of Magellan, crossed the Pacific, and arrived in Cebu, where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano, continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. Charles I of Spain, in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a coat of arms with the motto &quot;Primus circumdedisti me&quot; (in Latin, &quot;You went around me first&quot;).

A circumnavigation alone does not prove that Earth is spherical: it could be cylindric, irregularly globular, or one of many other shapes. Still, combined with trigonometric evidence of the form used by Eratosthenes 1,700 years prior, the Magellan expedition removed any reasonable doubt in educated circles in Europe. The Transglobe Expedition (1979–1982) was the first expedition to make a circumpolar circumnavigation, travelling the world &quot;vertically&quot; traversing both of the poles of rotation using only surface transport.

===European calculations===

In the Carolingian era, scholars discussed Macrobius&#x27;s view of the &quot;antipodes&quot;. One of them, the Irish monk Dungal, asserted that the tropical gap between our habitable region and the other habitable region to the south was smaller than Macrobius had believed.

In 1505 the cosmographer and explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira calculated the value of the degree of the meridian arc with a margin of error of only 4%, when the current error at the time varied between 7 and 15%.

Jean Picard performed the first modern meridian arc measurement in 1669–1670. He measured a baseline using wooden rods, a telescope (for his angular measurements), and logarithms (for computation). Gian Domenico Cassini then his son Jacques Cassini later continued Picard&#x27;s arc (Paris meridian arc) northward to Dunkirk and southward to the Spanish border. Cassini divided the measured arc into two parts, one northward from Paris, another southward. When he computed the length of a degree from both chains, he found that the length of one degree of latitude in the northern part of the chain was shorter than that in the southern part (see illustration).

This result, if correct, meant that the earth was not a sphere, but a prolate spheroid (taller than wide). However, this contradicted computations by Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens. In 1659, Christiaan Huygens was the first to derive the now standard formula for the centrifugal force in his work &quot;De vi centrifuga&quot;. The formula played a central role in classical mechanics and became known as the second of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation combined with the rotation of the Earth predicted the Earth to be an oblate spheroid (wider than tall), with a flattening of 1:230.

The issue could be settled by measuring, for a number of points on earth, the relationship between their distance (in north–south direction) and the angles between their zeniths. On an oblate Earth, the meridional distance corresponding to one degree of latitude will grow toward the poles, as can be demonstrated mathematically.

The French Academy of Sciences dispatched two expeditions. One expedition (1736–37) under Pierre Louis Maupertuis was sent to Torne Valley (near the Earth&#x27;s northern pole). The second mission (1735–44) under Pierre Bouguer was sent to what is modern-day Ecuador, near the equator. Their measurements demonstrated an oblate Earth, with a flattening of 1:210. This approximation to the true shape of the Earth became the new reference ellipsoid.

In 1787 the first precise trigonometric survey to be undertaken within Britain was the Anglo-French Survey. Its purpose was to link the Greenwich and Paris&#x27; observatories. The survey is very significant as the forerunner of the work of the Ordnance Survey which was founded in 1791, one year after William Roy&#x27;s death.

Johann Georg Tralles surveyed the Bernese Oberland, then the entire Canton of Bern. Soon after the Anglo-French Survey, in 1791 and 1797, he and his pupil Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler measured the base of the Grand Marais (German: &quot;Grosses Moos&quot;) near Aarberg in Seeland. This work earned Tralles to be appointed as the representative of the Helvetic Republic on the international scientific committee meeting in Paris from 1798 to 1799 to determine the length of the &quot;metre&quot;.

The French Academy of Sciences had commissioned an expedition led by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain, lasting from 1792 to 1799, which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in Dunkerque and Montjuïc castle in Barcelona at the longitude of Paris Panthéon. The &quot;metre&quot; was defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator passing through Paris, assuming an Earth&#x27;s flattening of 1/334. The committee extrapolated from Delambre and Méchain&#x27;s survey the distance from the North Pole to the Equator which was 5 130 740 toises. As the metre had to be equal to one ten-million of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,296 lignes of the Toise of Peru (see below).

===Asia and Americas===
A discovery made in 1672–1673 by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to the deviation of the Earth&#x27;s shape from a spherical form. This astronomer, having been sent by the Academy of Sciences of Paris to Cayenne, in South America, for the purpose of investigating the amount of astronomical refraction and other astronomical objects, notably the parallax of Mars between Paris and Cayenne in order to determine the Earth-Sun distance, observed that his clock, which had been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes and a half daily at Cayenne, and that in order to bring it to measure mean solar time it was necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line (about 1⁄12th of an in.). This fact was scarcely credited till it had been confirmed by the subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes on the coasts of Africa and America.

In South America Bouguer noticed, as did George Everest in the 19th century Great Trigonometric Survey of India, that the astronomical vertical tended to be pulled in the direction of large mountain ranges, due to the gravitational attraction of these huge piles of rock. As this vertical is everywhere perpendicular to the idealized surface of mean sea level, or the geoid, this means that the figure of the Earth is even more irregular than an ellipsoid of revolution. Thus the study of the &quot;undulation of the geoid&quot; became the next great undertaking in the science of studying the figure of the Earth.

== 19th century ==

In the late 19th century the Mitteleuropäische Gradmessung (Central European Arc Measurement) was established by several central European countries and a Central Bureau was set up at the expense of Prussia, within the Geodetic Institute at Berlin. One of its most important goals was the derivation of an international ellipsoid and a gravity formula which should be optimal not only for Europe but also for the whole world. The Mitteleuropäische Gradmessung was an early predecessor of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) one of the constituent sections of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) which was founded in 1919.

=== Prime meridian and standard of length ===

In 1811 Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler was selected to direct the U.S. Survey of the Coast, and sent on a mission to France and England to procure instruments and standards of measurement. The unit of length to which all distances measured by the Survey of the Coast—which became the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878—were referred is the French &quot;metre,&quot; a copy of which Hassler had brought to the United States in 1805.

The Scandinavian-Russian meridian arc or Struve Geodetic Arc, named after the German astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, was a degree measurement that consisted of a nearly 3000 km long network of geodetic survey points. The Struve Geodetic Arc was one of the most precise and largest projects of earth measurement at that time. In 1860 Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve published his &quot;Arc du méridien de 25° 20′ entre le Danube et la Mer Glaciale mesuré depuis 1816 jusqu’en 1855&quot;. The flattening of the earth was estimated at 1/294.26 and the earth&#x27;s equatorial radius was estimated at 6378360.7 metres.

In the early 19th century, the Paris meridian&#x27;s arc was recalculated with greater precision between Shetland and the Balearic Islands by the French astronomers François Arago and Jean-Baptiste Biot. In 1821 they published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of &quot;Bases du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l&#x27;arc méridien compris entre les parallèles de Dunkerque et Barcelone&quot; (Basis for the decimal metric system or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona) by Delambre and Méchain.

Louis Puissant declared in 1836 in front of the French Academy of Sciences that Delambre and Méchain had made an error in the measurement of the French meridian arc. Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. Méchain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. As this survey was also part of the groundwork for the map of France, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked, from 1861 to 1866, the geodesic opérations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and Méchain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the International Association of Geodesy in Neuchâtel Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero announced Spain&#x27;s contribution to the remeasurement and extension of the French meridian arc. In 1870, François Perrier was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This new survey of the Paris meridian arc, named West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc by Alexander Ross Clarke, was undertaken in France and in Algeria under the direction of François Perrier from 1870 to his death in 1888. Jean-Antonin-Léon Bassot completed the task in 1896. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, the Earth equatorial radius was 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15.

Many measurements of degrees of longitudes along central parallels in Europe were projected and partly carried out as early as the first half of the 19th century; these, however, only became of importance after the introduction of the electric telegraph, through which calculations of astronomical longitudes obtained a much higher degree of accuracy. Of the greatest moment is the measurement near the parallel of 52° lat., which extended from Valentia in Ireland to Orsk in the southern Ural mountains over 69 degrees of longitude. F. G. W. Struve, who is to be regarded as the father of the Russo-Scandinavian latitude-degree measurements, was the originator of this investigation. Having made the requisite arrangements with the governments in 1857, he transferred them to his son Otto, who, in 1860, secured the co-operation of England.

In 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Wilhelm von Sturve invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements, it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. Notably the standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the toise, of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for Bouguer and De La Condamine as their standard of reference in the French Geodesic Mission, conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa.

Friedrich Bessel was responsible for the nineteenth-century investigations of the shape of the Earth by means of the pendulum&#x27;s determination of gravity and the use of Clairaut&#x27;s theorem. The studies he conducted from 1825 to 1828 and his determination of the length of the pendulum beating the second in Berlin seven years later marked the beginning of a new era in geodesy. Indeed, the reversible pendulum as it was used by geodesists at the end of the 19th century was largely due to the work of Bessel, because neither Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger, its inventor, nor Henry Kater who used it in 1818 brought the improvements which would result from the precious indications of Bessel, and which converted the reversible pendulum into one of the most admirable instruments which the scientists of the nineteenth century could use. The reversible pendulum built by the Repsold brothers was used in Switzerland in 1865 by Émile Plantamour for the measurement of gravity in six stations of the Swiss geodetic network. Following the example set by this country and under the patronage of the International Geodetic Association, Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Russia and Saxony undertook gravity determinations on their respective territories.

However, these results could only be considered provisional insofar as they did not take into account the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its suspension plane, which constitute an important factor of error in measuring both the duration of the oscillations and the length of the pendulum. Indeed, the determination of gravity by the pendulum is subject to two types of error. On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the device designed by the Repsold brothers on Bessel&#x27;s indications, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolphe Hirsch found a way to highlight the movements of the pendulum suspension plane by an ingenious optical amplification process. Isaac-Charles Élisée Cellérier, a Genevan mathematician and Charles Sanders Peirce would independently develop a correction formula which would make it possible to use the observations made using this type of gravimeter.

As Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero stated. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, it could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the pendulum, if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the rulers for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimeter would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations one with another, and then proclaim the result of the measurement of the Globe.

Alexander Ross Clarke and Henry James published the first results of the standards&#x27; comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the &quot;Europäische Gradmessung&quot; and the General Conference of the association proposed the metre as a uniform length standard for the Arc Measurement and recommended the establishment of an International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

The Europäische Gradmessung decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Conference of the International Association of Geodesy also dealt with the best instrument to be used for the determination of gravity. After an in-depth discussion in which Charles Sanders Peirce took part, the association decided in favor of the reversion pendulum, which was used in Switzerland, and it was resolved to redo in Berlin, in the station where Bessel made his famous measurements, the determination of gravity by means of apparatus of various kinds employed in different countries, in order to compare them and thus to have the equation of their scales.

The Metre Convention was signed in 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. The first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures was the Spanish geodesist Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the &quot;Europäische Gradmessung&quot; from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed its name to the International Geodetic Association and Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the International Geodetic Association gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the &quot;Europäische Gradmessung&quot; had proposed to select the Greenwich meridian as prime meridian in the hope that United States and Great Britain would accede to the Association. Moreover, according to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc the meridian of Greenwich was nearer the mean than that of Paris.

=== Geodesy and mathematics ===
In 1804 Johann Georg Tralles was made a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1810 he became the first holder of the chair of mathematics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. In the same year he was appointed secretary of the mathematics class at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Tralles maintained an important correspondence with Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and supported his appointment to the University of Königsberg.

In 1809 Carl Friedrich Gauss published his method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies. In that work he claimed to have been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Adrien-Marie Legendre. However, to Gauss&#x27;s credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the normal distribution. He had managed to complete Laplace&#x27;s program of specifying a mathematical form of the probability density for the observations, depending on a finite number of unknown parameters, and define a method of estimation that minimises the error of estimation. Gauss showed that the arithmetic mean is indeed the best estimate of the location parameter by changing both the probability density and the method of estimation. He then turned the problem around by asking what form the density should have and what method of estimation should be used to get the arithmetic mean as estimate of the location parameter. In this attempt, he invented the normal distribution.

In 1810, after reading Gauss&#x27;s work, Pierre-Simon Laplace, after proving the central limit theorem, used it to give a large sample justification for the method of least squares and the normal distribution. In 1822, Gauss was able to state that the least-squares approach to regression analysis is optimal in the sense that in a linear model where the errors have a mean of zero, are uncorrelated, and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator of the coefficients is the least-squares estimator. This result is known as the Gauss–Markov theorem.

The publication in 1838 of Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel&#x27;s &quot;Gradmessung in Ostpreußen&quot; marked a new era in the science of geodesy. Here was found the method of least squares applied to the calculation of a network of triangles and the reduction of the observations generally. The systematic manner in which all the observations were taken with the view of securing final results of extreme accuracy was admirable. Bessel was also the first scientist who realised the effect later called &quot;personal equation&quot;, that several simultaneously observing persons determine slightly different values, especially recording the transition time of stars.

Most of the relevant theories were then derived by the German geodesist Friedrich Robert Helmert in his famous books &quot;Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorien der höheren Geodäsie&quot;, Volumes 1 &amp; 2 (1880 &amp; 1884, resp.). Helmert also derived the first global ellipsoid in 1906 with an accuracy of 100 meters (0.002 percent of the Earth&#x27;s radii). The US geodesist Hayford derived a global ellipsoid in ~1910, based on intercontinental isostasy and an accuracy of 200 m. It was adopted by the IUGG as &quot;international ellipsoid 1924&quot;.

<text>(For Thee, O Lord, I long), , is an early church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach composed for an unknown occasion. It is unique among Bach&#x27;s cantatas in its sparse orchestration and in the independence and prominence of the chorus, which is featured in four out of seven movements. The text alternates verses from Psalm 25 and poetry by an unknown librettist. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins, bassoon and basso continuo.

Many scholars think that it may be the earliest extant cantata by Bach, possibly composed in Arnstadt in 1707.

== History and text ==
Bach&#x27;s original score is lost. The music survives in a copy made by C F Penzel, one of Bach&#x27;s last pupils, after the composer&#x27;s death. The date of composition is not known, and sources differ as to when and where Bach composed the work. However, the balance of opinion has moved towards a date at the beginning of Bach&#x27;s career. It is not currently in dispute that it is one of Bach&#x27;s earliest surviving cantatas.
Suggestions for the place of composition have been:
* Weimar, where Bach worked from 1708. The conductor and academic Jonathan Green dates the work c. 1708–1710; the Bach scholar William G. Whittaker dates it c. 1712.
* Mühlhausen, where Bach worked in 1707/1708. The Zwang catalogue (which attempts to list the cantatas chronologically) dated it as the sixth of the surviving cantatas by Bach, and placed &quot;Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir&quot;, BWV 131, as the earliest. &quot;Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir&quot; is known to have been composed in Mühlhausen in 1707/1708. 
* Arnstadt, where Bach worked until his move to Mühlhausen in the summer of 1707. Late 20th-century scholarship suggests &quot;Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich&quot; could have been composed at Arnstadt.
The Bach scholar Andreas Glöckner argued in 1988 that the cantata may have been composed in Arnstadt. 

The scholar Hans-Joachim Schulze identified in 2010 a remarkable acrostic in movements 3, 5 and 7 (which he described in the 2010 &quot;Bach-Jahrbuch&quot;, the journal of the Neue Bachgesellschaft). Adjusting for transposition errors by the copyist, the initial letters should spell DOKTOR CONRAD MECKBACH and plausibly therefore the work was composed to mark this Mühlhausen councillor&#x27;s 70th birthday in April 1707. On this basis the cantata may date from Bach&#x27;s time in Arnstadt. Possibly the cantata was heard a few weeks later after the end of Lent, and thus it may have formed a test-piece for the Mühlhausen appointment, composed in Arnstadt with Bach&#x27;s supporter Meckbach in mind.

The cantata is, as John Eliot Gardiner notes, &quot;generally accepted to be Bach&#x27;s very first church cantata.&quot; Gardiner conducted in 2000 the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage and performed the cantata in the church for which it was then probably composed, at Bach&#x27;s time called &quot;Neue Kirche&quot; (new church), now the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Kirche.

The libretto alternates between biblical verses and free contemporary poetry, which is common in Bach&#x27;s later cantatas, but rare among his early cantatas. The text of movements 2, 4, and 6 are selected psalm verses, . The author of the poetry is unknown. On the basis of the text, it has been suggested that the work was written for a penitential service.

The cantata was first published in 1884 in the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe, the first edition of Bach&#x27;s complete works. The composer Johannes Brahms, who served on the editorial board of the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe, took an interest in the cantata as it was being published. He used an adapted version of the bass line of the closing chaconne for a work he completed in 1885, his Symphony No. 4.

== Structure and scoring ==

Bach structured the cantata in seven movements, an opening instrumental sinfonia and four choral movements interspersed by only two arias. He scored it for four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, and a small Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), bassoon (obbligato) (Fg) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is about 17 minutes.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.




== Music ==
The work begins with a sinfonia and then alternates choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, and there is no chorale tune, unusually for Bach&#x27;s cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.
The sinfonia and the opening choral movement are both based on the motive of an octave leap followed by five descending half steps. This chromatic figure, sometimes dubbed the &quot;lamento bass&quot; or passus duriusculus, has been utilized by composers as early as Monteverdi as a musical representation of anguish, pain, and longing. The sinfonia also introduces thematic material developed later in the work, uses asymmetric phrasing, and &quot;a seamless flow of unstoppable melody&quot;.
The first chorus on the beginning of Psalm 25, &quot;&quot; (Lord, I long for you. My God, I hope in you.), is &quot;waywardly constructed despite its relative brevity&quot;. It is episodic, emphasizing a descending chromatic scale motif. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes &quot;the graphically chromatic phrases of the opening sinfonia and the following chorus; these are evocative of the suffering of the world&quot;.
The following soprano aria, &quot;&quot; (Yet I am and remain content), is also brief but includes significant word painting.
The fourth movement, &quot;&quot; (Lead me in your Truth and teach me), is another short and episodic chorus, divided into four sections.
Movement five, &quot;&quot; (Cedars must, before the winds,
often feel much hardship), is one of only a handful of vocal trios to be found in Bach&#x27;s oeuvre, as well as the only movement in the cantata in all major. Isoyama writes: &quot;the continuo part drives the music forward with its phrase describing the trials of the stormwinds&quot;.
The penultimate movement, &quot;&quot;, features a &quot;celestial haze&quot; of instruments as part of a complex texture. It is in binary form and modulates from D major through B minor to B major.
The final movement, &quot;&quot;, is a chaconne, a form which is typically constructed over a repeated ground bass. Bach uses a ground bass which is possibly a borrowing from Pachelbel. It is the inversion of the chromatic fourth ostinato from the opening movement. Bach&#x27;s orchestration includes strumming effects which could be seen as recalling the origin of the chaconne in Spanish guitar music. From a theological point of view, both the inversion of the lamento bass and the series of modulations in this movement express in baroque musical affect how Christ leads from sorrow to joy.

<text>In geodesy, the figure of the Earth is the size and shape used to model planet Earth. The kind of figure depends on application, including the precision needed for the model. A spherical Earth is a well-known historical approximation that is satisfactory for geography, astronomy and many other purposes. Several models with greater accuracy (including ellipsoid) have been developed so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of navigation, surveying, cadastre, land use, and various other concerns.

== Motivation ==
Earth&#x27;s topographic surface is apparent with its variety of land forms and water areas. This topographic surface is generally the concern of topographers, hydrographers, and geophysicists. While it is the surface on which Earth measurements are made, mathematically modeling it while taking the irregularities into account would be extremely complicated.

The Pythagorean concept of a spherical Earth offers a simple surface that is easy to deal with mathematically. Many astronomical and navigational computations use a sphere to model the Earth as a close approximation. However, a more accurate figure is needed for measuring distances and areas on the scale beyond the purely local. Better approximations can be made by modeling the entire surface as an oblate spheroid, using spherical harmonics to approximate the geoid, or modeling a region with a best-fit reference ellipsoid.

For surveys of small areas, a planar (flat) model of Earth&#x27;s surface suffices because the local topography overwhelms the curvature. Plane-table surveys are made for relatively small areas without considering the size and shape of the entire Earth. A survey of a city, for example, might be conducted this way.

By the late 1600s, serious effort was devoted to modeling the Earth as an ellipsoid, beginning with French astronomer Jean Picard&#x27;s measurement of a degree of arc along the Paris meridian. Improved maps and better measurement of distances and areas of national territories motivated these early attempts. Surveying instrumentation and techniques improved over the ensuing centuries. Models for the figure of the Earth improved in step.

In the mid- to late 20th century, research across the geosciences contributed to drastic improvements in the accuracy of the figure of the Earth. The primary utility of this improved accuracy was to provide geographical and gravitational data for the inertial guidance systems of ballistic missiles. This funding also drove the expansion of geoscientific disciplines, fostering the creation and growth of various geoscience departments at many universities. These developments benefited many civilian pursuits as well, such as weather and communication satellite control and GPS location-finding, which would be impossible without highly accurate models for the figure of the Earth.

== Models ==
The models for the figure of the Earth vary in the way they are used, in their complexity, and in the accuracy with which they represent the size and shape of the Earth.

=== Sphere ===


The simplest model for the shape of the entire Earth is a sphere. The Earth&#x27;s radius is the distance from Earth&#x27;s center to its surface, about . While &quot;radius&quot; normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the Earth deviates from spherical by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term &quot;the radius of the Earth&quot;.

The concept of a spherical Earth dates back to around the 6th century BC, but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century BC. The first scientific estimation of the radius of the Earth was given by Eratosthenes about 240 BC, with estimates of the accuracy of Eratosthenes&#x27;s measurement ranging from −1% to 15%.

The Earth is only approximately spherical, so no single value serves as its natural radius. Distances from points on the surface to the center range from to . Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of . Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about and the equatorial maximum of about . The difference correspond to the polar radius being approximately 0.3% shorter than the equatorial radius.

===Ellipsoid of revolution===

As theorized by Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens, the Earth is flattened at the poles and bulged at the equator. Thus, geodesy represents the figure of the Earth as an oblate spheroid. The oblate spheroid, or oblate ellipsoid, is an ellipsoid of revolution obtained by rotating an ellipse about its shorter axis. It is the regular geometric shape that most nearly approximates the shape of the Earth. A spheroid describing the figure of the Earth or other celestial body is called a reference ellipsoid. The reference ellipsoid for Earth is called an &quot;Earth ellipsoid&quot;.

An ellipsoid of revolution is uniquely defined by two quantities. Several conventions for expressing the two quantities are used in geodesy, but they are all equivalent to and convertible with each other:
* Equatorial radius formula_1 (called &quot;semimajor axis&quot;), and polar radius formula_2 (called &quot;semiminor axis&quot;);
* formula_1 and eccentricity formula_4;
* formula_1 and flattening formula_6.
Eccentricity and flattening are different ways of expressing how squashed the ellipsoid is. When flattening appears as one of the defining quantities in geodesy, generally it is expressed by its reciprocal. For example, in the WGS 84 spheroid used by today&#x27;s GPS systems, the reciprocal of the flattening formula_7 is set to be exactly .

The difference between a sphere and a reference ellipsoid for Earth is small, only about one part in 300. Historically, flattening was computed from grade measurements. Nowadays, geodetic networks and satellite geodesy are used. In practice, many reference ellipsoids have been developed over the centuries from different surveys. The flattening value varies slightly from one reference ellipsoid to another, reflecting local conditions and whether the reference ellipsoid is intended to model the entire Earth or only some portion of it.

A sphere has a single radius of curvature, which is simply the radius of the sphere. More complex surfaces have radii of curvature that vary over the surface. The radius of curvature describes the radius of the sphere that best approximates the surface at that point. Oblate ellipsoids have a constant radius of curvature east to west along parallels, if a graticule is drawn on the surface, but varying curvature in any other direction. For an oblate ellipsoid, the polar radius of curvature formula_8 is larger than the equatorial

:formula_9

because the pole is flattened: the flatter the surface, the larger the sphere must be to approximate it. Conversely, the ellipsoid&#x27;s north–south radius of curvature at the equator formula_10 is smaller than the polar

:formula_11

where formula_1 is the distance from the center of the ellipsoid to the equator (semi-major axis), and formula_2 is the distance from the center to the pole. (semi-minor axis)

=== Non-spheroidal deviations ===

==== Triaxiality (equatorial eccentricity) ====

The possibility that the Earth&#x27;s equator is better characterized as an ellipse rather than a circle and therefore that the ellipsoid is triaxial has been a matter of scientific inquiry for many years. Modern technological developments have furnished new and rapid methods for data collection and, since the launch of Sputnik 1, orbital data have been used to investigate the theory of ellipticity. More recent results indicate a 70 m difference between the two equatorial major and minor axes of inertia, with the larger semidiameter pointing to 15° W longitude (and also 180-degree away).

==== Egg or pear shape ====
Following work by Picard, Italian polymath Giovanni Domenico Cassini found that the length of a degree was apparently shorter north of Paris than to the south, implying the Earth to be egg-shaped. In 1498, Christopher Columbus dubiously suggested that the Earth was pear-shaped based on his disparate mobile readings of the angle of the North Star, which he incorrectly interpreted as having varying diurnal motion.

The theory of a slightly pear-shaped Earth arose when data was received from the U.S.&#x27;s artificial satellite Vanguard 1 in 1958. It was found to vary in its long periodic orbit, with the Southern Hemisphere exhibiting higher gravitational attraction than the Northern Hemisphere. This indicated a flattening at the South Pole and a bulge of the same degree at the North Pole, with the sea level increased about at the latter. This theory implies the northern middle latitudes to be slightly flattened and the southern middle latitudes correspondingly bulged. Potential factors involved in this aberration include tides and subcrustal motion (e.g. plate tectonics).

John A. O&#x27;Keefe and co-authors are credited with the discovery that the Earth had a significant third degree zonal spherical harmonic in its gravitational field using Vanguard 1 satellite data. Based on further satellite geodesy data, Desmond King-Hele refined the estimate to a difference between north and south polar radii, owing to a &quot;stem&quot; rising in the North Pole and a depression in the South Pole. The polar asymmetry is about a thousand times smaller than the Earth&#x27;s flattening and even smaller than its geoidal undulation in some regions.

=== Geoid ===

Modern geodesy tends to retain the ellipsoid of revolution as a reference ellipsoid and treat triaxiality and pear shape as a part of the geoid figure: they are represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients formula_14 and formula_15, respectively, corresponding to degree and order numbers 2.2 for the triaxiality and 3.0 for the pear shape.

It was stated earlier that measurements are made on the apparent or topographic surface of the Earth and it has just been explained that computations are performed on an ellipsoid. One other surface is involved in geodetic measurement: the geoid. In geodetic surveying, the computation of the geodetic coordinates of points is commonly performed on a reference ellipsoid closely approximating the size and shape of the Earth in the area of the survey. The actual measurements made on the surface of the Earth with certain instruments are however referred to the geoid. The ellipsoid is a mathematically defined regular surface with specific dimensions. The geoid, on the other hand, coincides with that surface to which the oceans would conform over the entire Earth if free to adjust to the combined effect of the Earth&#x27;s mass attraction (gravitation) and the centrifugal force of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. As a result of the uneven distribution of the Earth&#x27;s mass, the geoidal surface is irregular and, since the ellipsoid is a regular surface, the separations between the two, referred to as geoid undulations, geoid heights, or geoid separations, will be irregular as well.

The geoid is a surface along which the gravity potential is equal everywhere and to which the direction of gravity is always perpendicular. The latter is particularly important because optical instruments containing gravity-reference leveling devices are commonly used to make geodetic measurements. When properly adjusted, the vertical axis of the instrument coincides with the direction of gravity and is, therefore, perpendicular to the geoid. The angle between the plumb line which is perpendicular to the geoid (sometimes called &quot;the vertical&quot;) and the perpendicular to the ellipsoid (sometimes called &quot;the ellipsoidal normal&quot;) is defined as the deflection of the vertical. It has two components: an east–west and a north–south component.

=== Local approximations ===

Simpler local approximations are possible.

==== Local tangent plane ====
The local tangent plane is appropriate for analysis across small distances.

==== Osculating sphere ====
The best local spherical approximation to the ellipsoid in the vicinity of a given point is the &quot;Earth&#x27;s osculating sphere&quot;. Its radius equals Earth&#x27;s Gaussian radius of curvature, and its radial direction coincides with the geodetic normal direction. The center of the osculating sphere is offset from the center of the ellipsoid, but is at the center of curvature for the given point on the ellipsoid surface. This concept aids the interpretation of terrestrial and planetary radio occultation refraction measurements and in some navigation and surveillance applications.

== Earth rotation and Earth&#x27;s interior ==

Determining the exact figure of the Earth is not only a geometric task of geodesy, but also has geophysical considerations. According to theoretical arguments by Newton, Leonhard Euler, and others, a body having a uniform density of 5,515 kg/m that rotates like the Earth should have a flattening of 1:229. This can be concluded without any information about the composition of Earth&#x27;s interior. However, the measured flattening is 1:298.25, which is closer to a sphere and a strong argument that Earth&#x27;s core is extremely compact. Therefore, the density must be a function of the depth, ranging from 2,600 kg/m at the surface (rock density of granite, etc.), up to 13,000 kg/m within the inner core.

== Global and regional gravity field ==

Also with implications for the physical exploration of the Earth&#x27;s interior is the gravitational field, which is the net effect of gravitation (due to mass attraction) and centrifugal force (due to rotation). It can be measured very accurately at the surface and remotely by satellites. True vertical generally does not correspond to theoretical vertical (deflection ranges up to 50&quot;) because topography and all &quot;geological masses&quot; disturb the gravitational field. Therefore, the gross structure of the Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle can be determined by geodetic-geophysical models of the subsurface.

<text>The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transport facilities.

At the start of World War I the RFC, commanded by Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson, consisted of five squadrons – one observation balloon squadron (RFC No 1 Squadron) and four aeroplane squadrons. These were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again only became effective the next year. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from 15,000 feet and were interpreted by over 3,000 personnel. Parachutes were not available to pilots of heavier-than-air craft in the RFC – nor were they used by the RAF during the First World War – although the Calthrop Guardian Angel parachute (1916 model) was officially adopted just as the war ended. By this time parachutes had been used by balloonists for three years.

On 17 August 1917, South African General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power. Because of its potential for the &#x27;devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale&#x27;, he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the Army and Royal Navy. The formation of the new service would also make the under-used men and machines of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) available for action on the Western Front and end the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement. On 1 April 1918, the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated to form a new service, the Royal Air Force (RAF), under the control of the new Air Ministry. After starting in 1914 with some 2,073 personnel, by the start of 1919 the RAF had 4,000 combat aircraft and 114,000 personnel in some 150 squadrons.

==Origin and early history==

With the growing recognition of the potential for aircraft as a cost-effective method of reconnaissance and artillery observation, the Committee of Imperial Defence established a sub-committee to examine the question of military aviation in November 1911. On 28 February 1912 the sub-committee reported its findings which recommended that a flying corps be formed and that it consist of a naval wing, a military wing, a central flying school and an aircraft factory. The recommendations of the committee were accepted and on 13 April 1912 King George V signed a royal warrant establishing the Royal Flying Corps. The Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers became the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps a month later on 13 May.

The Flying Corps&#x27; initial allowed strength was 133 officers, and by the end of that year it had 12 manned balloons and 36 aeroplanes. The RFC originally came under the responsibility of Brigadier-General Henderson, the Director of Military Training, and had separate branches for the Army and the Navy. Major Sykes commanded the Military Wing and Commander C R Samson commanded the Naval Wing. The Royal Navy, however, with priorities different from those of the Army and wishing to retain greater control over its aircraft, formally separated its branch and renamed it the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 July 1914, although a combined central flying school was retained.

The RFC&#x27;s motto was &quot;Per ardua ad astra&quot; (&quot;Through adversity to the stars&quot;). This remains the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and other Commonwealth air forces.

The RFC&#x27;s first fatal crash was on 5 July 1912 near Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain; Captain Eustace B. Loraine and his observer, Staff Sergeant R.H.V. Wilson, flying from Larkhill Aerodrome, were killed. An order was issued after the crash stating &quot;Flying will continue this evening as usual&quot;, thus beginning a tradition.

In August 1912, RFC Lieutenant Wilfred Parke RN became the first aviator to be observed to recover from an accidental spin when the Avro G cabin biplane, with which he had just broken a world endurance record, entered a spin at 700 feet above ground level at Larkhill. Four months later, on 11 December 1912, Parke was killed when the Handley Page monoplane in which he was flying from Hendon to Oxford crashed.

==Structure and growth==

On its inception in 1912 the Royal Flying Corps consisted of a Military and a Naval Wing, with the Military Wing consisting of three squadrons each commanded by a major. The Naval Wing, with fewer pilots and aircraft than the Military Wing, did not organise itself into squadrons until 1914; it separated from the RFC that same year. By November 1914 the Royal Flying Corps, even taking the loss of the Naval Wing into account, had expanded sufficiently to warrant the creation of wings consisting of two or more squadrons. These wings were commanded by lieutenant-colonels. In October 1915 the Corps had undergone further expansion which justified the creation of brigades, each commanded by a brigadier-general. Further expansion led to the creation of divisions, with the Training Division being established in August 1917 and RFC Middle East being raised to divisional status in December 1917. Additionally, although the Royal Flying Corps in France was never titled as a division, by March 1916 it comprised several brigades and its commander (Trenchard) had received a promotion to major-general, giving it in effect divisional status. Finally, the air raids on London and the south-east of England led to the creation of the London Air Defence Area in August 1917 under the command of Ashmore who was promoted to major-general.

===Squadrons===

Two of the first three RFC squadrons were formed from the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers: &quot;No. 1 Company&quot; (a balloon company) becoming No. 1 Squadron, RFC, and &quot;No. 2 Company&quot; (a &#x27;heavier-than-air&#x27; company) becoming No. 3 Squadron, RFC. A second heavier-than-air squadron, No. 2 Squadron, RFC, was also formed on the same day.

No. 4 Squadron, RFC was formed from No. 2 Sqn in August 1912, and No. 5 Squadron, RFC from No. 3 Sqn in July 1913.

By the end of March 1918, the Royal Flying Corps comprised some 150 squadrons.

The composition of an RFC squadron varied depending on its designated role, although the commanding officer was usually a major (in a largely non-operational role), with the squadron &#x27;flights&#x27; (annotated A, B, C etc.) the basic tactical and operational unit, each commanded by a captain. A &#x27;recording officer&#x27; (of captain/lieutenant rank) would act as intelligence officer and adjutant, commanding two or three NCOs and ten other ranks in the administration section of the squadron. Each flight contained on average between six and ten pilots (and a corresponding number of observers, if applicable) with a senior sergeant and thirty-six other ranks (as fitters, riggers, metalsmiths, armourers, etc.). The average squadron also had on complement an equipment officer, armaments officer (each with five other ranks) and a transport officer, in charge of twenty-two other ranks. The squadron transport establishment typically included one car, five light tenders, seven heavy tenders, two repair lorries, eight motorcycles and eight trailers.

===Wings===

Wings in the Royal Flying Corps consisted of a number of squadrons.

When the Royal Flying Corps was established it was intended to be a joint service. Owing to the rivalry between the British Army and Royal Navy, new terminology was thought necessary in order to avoid marking the Corps out as having a particularly Army or Navy ethos. Accordingly, the Corps was originally split into two wings: a Military Wing (i.e. an army wing) and a Naval Wing. By 1914, the Naval Wing had become the Royal Naval Air Service, having gained its independence from the Royal Flying Corps.

By November 1914 the Flying Corps had significantly expanded and it was felt necessary to create organizational units which would control collections of squadrons; the term &quot;wing&quot; was reused for these new organizational units.

The Military Wing was abolished and its units based in Great Britain were regrouped as the Administrative Wing. The RFC squadrons in France were grouped under the newly established 1st Wing and the 2nd Wing. The 1st Wing was assigned to the support of the 1st Army whilst the 2nd Wing supported the 2nd Army.

As the Flying Corps grew, so did the number of wings. The 3rd Wing was established on 1 March 1915 and on 15 April the 5th Wing came into existence. By August that year the 6th Wing had been created and in November 1915 a 7th Wing and 8th Wing had also been stood up. Additional wings continued to be created throughout World War I in line with the incessant demands for air units. The last RFC wing to be created was the 54th Wing in March 1918, just prior to the creation of the RAF.

Following the creation of brigades, wings took on specialised functions. Corps wings undertook artillery observation and ground liaison duties, with one squadron detached to each army corps. Army wings were responsible for air superiority, bombing and strategic reconnaissance. United Kingdom based forces were organised into home defence and training wings. By March 1918, wings controlled as many as nine squadrons.

===Brigades===

Following Sir David Henderson&#x27;s return from France to the War Office in August 1915, he submitted a scheme to the Army Council which was intended to expand the command structure of the Flying Corps. The Corps&#x27; wings would be grouped in pairs to form brigades and the commander of each brigade would hold the temporary rank of brigadier-general. The scheme met with Lord Kitchener&#x27;s approval and although some staff officers opposed it, the scheme was adopted.

In the field, most brigades were assigned to the army. Initially a brigade consisted of an army wing and corps wing; beginning in November 1916 a balloon wing was added to control the observation balloon companies. Logistics support was provided by an army aircraft park, aircraft ammunition column and reserve lorry park.

===Stations===
All operating locations were officially called &quot;Royal Flying Corps Station &quot;name&quot;&quot;. A typical Squadron may have been based at four Stations – an Aerodrome for the HQ, and three Landing Grounds, one per each flight. Stations tended to be named after the local railway station, to simplify the administration of rail travel warrants.

Typically a training airfield consisted of a grass square. There were three pairs plus one single hangar, constructed of wood or brick, x in size. There were up to 12 canvas Bessonneau hangars as the aircraft, constructed from wood, wire and fabric, were liable to weather damage. Other airfield buildings were typically wooden or Nissen huts.

Landing Grounds were often L-shaped, usually arrived at by removing a hedge boundary between two fields, and thereby allowing landing runs in two directions of . Typically they would be manned by only two or three airmen, whose job was to guard the fuel stores and assist any aircraft which had occasion to land. Accommodation for airmen and pilots was often in tents, especially on the Western Front. Officers would be billeted to local country houses, or commandeered châteaux when posted abroad, if suitable accommodation had not been built on the Station.

Landing Grounds were categorised according to their lighting and day or night capabilities:
* First Class Landing Ground – Several buildings, hangars and accommodation.
* Second Class Landing Ground – a permanent hangar, and a few huts.
* Third Class Landing Ground – a temporary Bessonneau hangar
* Emergency (or Relief) Landing Ground – often just a field, activated by telephone call to the farmer, requesting he move any grazing animals out.
* Night Landing Grounds would be lit around the perimeter with gas lights and might have a flarepath laid out in nearby fields.

Stations that were heavily used or militarily important grew by compulsorily purchasing extra land, changing designations as necessary. Aerodromes would often grow into sprawling sites, due to the building of headquarters/administration offices, mess buildings, fuel and weapon stores, wireless huts and other support structures as well as the aircraft hangarage and repair facilities. Narborough and Marham both started off as Night Landing Grounds a few miles apart. One was an RNAS Station, the other RFC. Narborough grew to be the largest aerodrome in Britain at with of buildings including seven large hangars, seven motorised transport (MT) garages, five workshops, two coal yards, two Sergeants&#x27; Messes, three dope sheds and a guardhouse. Marham was . Both these Stations are now lost beneath the present RAF Marham. Similarly, Stations at Easton-on-the-Hill and Stamford merged into modern day RAF Wittering although they are in different counties.

====Canada====
The Royal Flying Corps Canada was established by the RFC in 1917 to train aircrew in Canada. Air Stations were established in southern Ontario at the following locations:
* Camp Borden 1917–1918
* Armour Heights Field 1917–1918 (pilot training, School of Special Flying to train instructors)
* Leaside Aerodrome 1917–1918 (Artillery Cooperation School)
* Long Branch Aerodrome 1917–1918
* Curtiss School of Aviation (flying-boat station with temporary wooden hangar on the beach at Hanlan&#x27;s Point on Toronto Island 1915–1918; main school, airstrip and metal hangar facilities at Long Branch)
* Camp Rathbun, Deseronto 1917–1918 (pilot training)
* Camp Mohawk (now Tyendinaga (Mohawk) Airport) 1917–1918 – located at the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve (now Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory) near Belleville 1917–1918 (pilot training)
* Hamilton (Armament School) 1917–1918
* Beamsville Camp (School of Aerial Fighting) 1917–1918 – located at 4222 Saan Road in Beamsville, Ontario; hangar remains and property now used by Global Horticultural Incorporated

====Other locations====
* St-Omer, France 1914–1918 (headquarters) – now Saint-Omer-Wizernes Airport and site of British Air Services Memorial
* Ismailia, Egypt (training – No. 57 TS, 32 (Training) Wing HQ) – now Al Ismailiyah Air Base
* Aboukir, Egypt 1916–1918 (training – No. 22 TS &amp; No. 23 TS, 20 (Training) Wing HQ)
* Abu Sueir, Egypt 1917–1918 (training – No. 57 TS &amp; No. 195 TS) – now Abu Suwayr Air Base, also used by RAF during World War II
* El Ferdan, Egypt (training – No. 17 TDS)
* El Rimal, Egypt 1917–1918 (training – No. 19 TDS) – later as RAF El Amiriya and now abandoned (after World War II)
* Camp Taliaferro, North Texas, USA 1917–1918 (training) – sites now either residential development or commercial/industrial parks

==First World War==
The RFC was also responsible for the manning and operation of observation balloons on the Western front. When the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) arrived in France in August 1914, it had no observation balloons and it was not until April 1915 that the first balloon company was on strength, albeit on loan from the French Aérostiers. The first British unit arrived 8 May 1915, and commenced operations during the Battle of Aubers Ridge. Operations from balloons thereafter continued throughout the war. Highly hazardous in operation, a balloon could only be expected to last a fortnight before damage or destruction. Results were also highly dependent on the expertise of the observer and was subject to the weather conditions.
To keep the balloon out of the range of artillery fire, it was necessary to locate the balloons some distance away from the front line or area of military operations. However, the stable platform offered by a kite-balloon made it more suitable for the cameras of the day than an aircraft.

For the first half of the war, as with the land armies deployed, the French air force vastly outnumbered the RFC, and accordingly did more of the fighting. Despite the primitive aircraft, aggressive leadership by RFC commander Hugh Trenchard and the adoption of a continually offensive stance operationally in efforts to pin the enemy back led to many brave fighting exploits and high casualties – over 700 in 1916, the rate worsening thereafter, until the RFC&#x27;s nadir in April 1917 which was dubbed &#x27;Bloody April&#x27;.

This aggressive, if costly, doctrine did however provide the Army General Staff with vital and up-to-date intelligence on German positions and numbers through continual photographic and observational reconnaissance throughout the war.

===1914–15: Initial actions with the British Expeditionary Force===
At the start of the war, numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 Squadrons were equipped with aeroplanes. No. 1 Squadron had been equipped with balloons but all these were transferred to the Naval Wing in 1913; thereafter No. 1 Squadron reorganised itself as an &#x27;aircraft park&#x27; for the British Expeditionary Force. The RFC&#x27;s first casualties were before the Corps even arrived in France: Lt Robert R. Skene and Air Mechanic Ray Barlow were killed on 12 August 1914 when their (probably overloaded) plane crashed at Netheravon on the way to rendezvous with the rest of the RFC near Dover. Skene had been the first Englishman to perform a loop in an aeroplane.

On 13 August 1914, 2, 3, and 4 squadrons, comprising 60 machines, departed from Dover for the British Expeditionary Force in France and 5 Squadron joined them a few days later. The aircraft took a route across the English Channel from Dover to Boulogne, then followed the French coast to the Bay of the Somme and followed the river to Amiens. When the BEF moved forward to Maubeuge the RFC accompanied them. On 19 August the Corps undertook its first action of the war, with two of its aircraft performing aerial reconnaissance. The mission was not a great success; to save weight each aircraft carried a pilot only instead of the usual pilot and observer. Because of this, and poor weather, both of the pilots lost their way and only one was able to complete his task.

On 22 August 1914, the first British aircraft was lost to German fire. The crewpilot Second Lieutenant Vincent Waterfall and observer Lt. Charles George Gordon Bayly, of 5 Squadronflying an Avro 504 over Belgium, were killed by infantry fire. Also on 22 August 1914, Captain L E O Charlton (observer) and his pilot, Lieutenant Vivian Hugh Nicholas Wadham, made the crucial observation of the 1st German Army&#x27;s approach towards the flank of the British Expeditionary Force. This allowed the BEF Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Sir John French to realign his front and save his army around Mons.

Next day, the RFC found itself fighting in the Battle of Mons and two days after that, gained its first air victory. On 25 August, Lt C. W. Wilson and Lt C. E. C. Rabagliati forced down a German Etrich Taube, which had approached their aerodrome while they were refuelling their Avro 504. Another RFC machine landed nearby and the RFC observer chased the German pilot into nearby woods. After the Great Retreat from Mons, the Corps fell back to the Marne where in September, the RFC again proved its value by identifying von Kluck&#x27;s First Army&#x27;s left wheel against the exposed French flank. This information was significant as the First Army&#x27;s manoeuvre allowed French forces to make an effective counter-attack at the Battle of the Marne.

Sir John French&#x27;s (the British Expeditionary Force commander) first official dispatch on 7 September included the following: &quot;I wish particularly to bring to your Lordships&#x27; notice the admirable work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their skill, energy, and perseverance has been beyond all praise. They have furnished me with most complete and accurate information, which has been of incalculable value in the conduct of operations. Fired at constantly by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they have remained undaunted throughout. Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in destroying five of the enemy&#x27;s machines.&quot;

=== Markings ===

Early in the war RFC aircraft were not systematically marked with any national insignia. At a squadron level, Union Flag markings in various styles were often painted on the wings (and sometimes the fuselage sides and/or rudder). However, there was a danger of the large red St George&#x27;s Cross being mistaken for the German &quot;Eisernes Kreuz&quot; (iron cross) marking, and so of RFC aircraft being fired upon by friendly ground forces. By late 1915, therefore, the RFC had adopted a modified version of the French cockade (or roundel) marking, with the colours reversed (the blue circle outermost). In contrast to usual French practice, the roundel was applied to the fuselage sides as well as the wings. To minimise the likelihood of &quot;friendly&quot; attack, the rudders of RFC aircraft were painted to match the French, with the blue, white and red stripes – going from the forward (rudder hingeline) to aft (trailing edge) – of the French tricolour. Later in the war, a &quot;night roundel&quot; was adopted for night flying aircraft (especially Handley Page O/400 heavy bombers), which omitted the conspicuous white circle of the &quot;day&quot; marking.

=== Roles and responsibilities ===

====Wireless telegraphy====

Later in September, 1914, during the First Battle of the Aisne, the RFC made use of wireless telegraphy to assist with artillery targeting and took aerial photographs for the first time.

====Photo-reconnaissance====
From 16,000 feet a photographic plate could cover some of front line in sharp detail. In 1915 Lieutenant-Colonel JTC Moore-Brabrazon designed the first practical aerial camera. These semi-automatic cameras became a high priority for the Corps and photo-reconnaissance aircraft were soon operational in numbers with the RFC. The camera was usually fixed to the side of the fuselage, or operated through a hole in the floor. The increasing need for surveys of the western front and its approaches, made extensive aerial photography essential. Aerial photographs were exclusively used in compiling the British Army&#x27;s highly detailed 1:10,000 scale maps introduced in mid-1915. Such were advances in aerial photography that the entire Somme Offensive of July–November 1916 was based on the RFC&#x27;s air-shot photographs.

==== Artillery observation ====
One of the initial and most important uses of RFC aircraft was observing artillery fire behind the enemy front line at targets that could not be seen by ground observers. The fall of shot of artillery fire were easy enough for the pilot to see, providing he was looking in the right place at the right time; apart from this the problem was communicating corrections to the battery.

Development of procedures had been the responsibility of No 3 Squadron and the Royal Artillery in 1912–13. These methods usually depended on the pilot being tasked to observe the fire against a specific target and report the fall of shot relative to the target, the battery adjusted their aim, fired and the process was repeated until the target was effectively engaged. One early communication method was for the flier to write a note and drop it to the ground where it could be recovered but various visual signalling methods were also used. This meant the pilots had to observe the battery to see when it fired and see if it had laid out a visual signal using white marker panels on the ground.

The Royal Engineers&#x27; Air Battalion had pioneered experiments with wireless telegraphy in airships and aircraft before the RFC was created. Unfortunately the early transmitters weighed 75 pounds and filled a seat in the cockpit. This meant that the pilot had to fly the aircraft, navigate, observe the fall of the shells and transmit the results by morse code by himself. Also, the wireless in the aircraft could not receive. Originally only a special &quot;Wireless Flight&quot; attached to No. 4 Squadron RFC had the wireless equipment. Eventually this flight was expanded into No. 9 Squadron under Major Hugh Dowding. However, in early 1915 the Sterling lightweight wireless became available and was widely used. In 1915 each corps in the BEF was assigned a RFC squadron solely for artillery observation and reconnaissance duties. The transmitter filled the cockpit normally used by the observer and a trailing wire antenna was used which had to be reeled in prior to landing.

The RFC&#x27;s wireless experiments under Major Herbert Musgrave, included research into how wireless telegraphy could be used by military aircraft. However, the most important officers in wireless development were Lieutenants Donald Lewis and Baron James in the RFC HQ wireless unit formed in France in September 1914. They developed both equipment and procedures in operational sorties.

An important development was the Zone Call procedure in 1915. By this time maps were &#x27;squared&#x27; and a target location could be reported from the air using alphanumeric characters transmitted in Morse code. Batteries were allocated a Zone, typically a quarter of a mapsheet, and it was the duty of the RFC signallers on the ground beside the battery command post to pick out calls for fire in their battery&#x27;s Zone. Once ranging started the airman reported the position of the ranging round using the clock code, the battery adjusted their firing data and fired again, and the process was repeated until the pilot observed an on-target or close round. The battery commander then decided how much to fire at the target.

The results were mixed. Observing artillery fire, even from above, requires training and skill. Within artillery units, ground observers received mentoring to develop their skill, which was not available to RFC aircrew. There were undoubtedly some very skilled artillery observers in the RFC, but there were many who were not and there was a tendency for &#x27;optimism bias&#x27; – reporting rounds as being on target when they were not. The procedures were also time-consuming.

The ground stations were generally attached to heavy artillery units, such as Royal Garrison Artillery Siege Batteries, and were manned by RFC wireless operators, such as Henry Tabor. These wireless operators had to fend for themselves as their squadrons were situated some distance away and they were not posted to the battery they were colocated with. This led to concerns as to who had responsibility for them and in November 1916 squadron commanders had to be reminded &quot;that it is their duty to keep in close touch with the operators attached to their command, and to make all necessary arrangements for supplying them with blankets, clothing, pay, etc&quot; (Letter from Headquarters, 2nd Brigade RFC dated 18 November 1916 – Public Records Office AIR/1/864)

The wireless operators&#x27; work was often carried out under heavy artillery fire in makeshift dug-outs. The artillery batteries were important targets and antennas were a lot less robust than the guns, hence prone to damage requiring immediate repair. As well as taking down and interpreting the numerous signals coming in from the aircraft, the operator had to communicate back to the aircraft by means of cloth strips laid out on the ground or a signalling lamp to give visual confirmation that the signals had been received. The wireless communication was one way as no receiver was mounted in the aircraft and the ground station could not transmit. Details from: 

By May 1916, 306 aircraft and 542 ground stations were equipped with wireless.

====Covert operations====
An unusual mission for the RFC was the delivery of spies behind enemy lines. The first mission took place on the morning of 13 September 1915 and was not a success. The plane crashed, the pilot and spy were badly injured and they were both captured (two years later the pilot, Captain T.W. Mulcahy-Morgan escaped and returned to England). Later missions were more successful. In addition to delivering the spies the RFC was also responsible for keeping them supplied with the carrier pigeons that were used to send reports back to base. In 1916, a Special Duty Flight was formed as part of the Headquarters Wing to handle these and other unusual assignments.

==== Aerial bombardment ====
The obvious potential for aerial bombardment of the enemy was not lost on the RFC, and despite the poor payload of early war aircraft, bombing missions were undertaken. Front line squadrons (at the prompting of the more inventive pilots) devised several methods of carrying, aiming and dropping bombs. Lieutenant Conran of No 3 Squadron attacked an enemy troop column by dropping hand grenades over the side of his cockpit; the noise of the grenades caused the horses to stampede. At No 6 Squadron, Captain Louis Strange managed to destroy two canvas-covered trucks with home-made petrol bombs.
In March 1915 a bombing raid was flown, with Captain Strange flying a modified Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, to carry four 20 lb Cooper bombs on wing racks released by pulling a cable fitted in the cockpit. Attacking Courtrai railway station. Strange approached from low level and hit a troop train causing 75 casualties. The same day Captain Carmichael of No 5 Squadron dropped a 100 lb bomb from a Martinsyde S1 on the railway junction at Menin. Days later, Lieutenant William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse of No 2 Squadron was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after bombing Courtrai station in a BE2c.

In October 1917 No 41 Wing was formed to attack strategic targets in Germany. Consisting of No 55 Squadron (Airco DH.4), No 100 (Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b) and No 16 (Naval) Squadron (Handley Page 0/100) the wing was based at Ochey commanded by Lt Colonel Cyril Newall. Its first attack was on Saarbrücken on 17 October with 11 DH-4s and a week later nine Handley Page O/100s carried out a night attack against factories in Saarbrücken, while 16 F.E.2bs bombed railways nearby. Four aircraft failed to return. The wing was expanded with the later addition of Nos 99 and 104 Squadrons, both flying the DH-4 into the Independent Air Force.

==== Ground attack – army support ====
Aircraft were increasingly engaged in ground attack operations as the war wore on, aimed at disrupting enemy forces at or near the front line and during offensives. While formal tactical bombing raids were planned and usually directed at specific targets, ground-attack was usually carried out by individual pilots or small flights against targets of opportunity. Although the fitted machine guns were the primary armament for ground attack, bomb racks holding 20 lb Cooper bombs were soon fitted to many single-seat aircraft. Ground attack sorties were carried out at very low altitude and were often highly effective, in spite of the primitive nature of the weaponry involved, compared with later conflicts. The moral effect on ground troops subjected to air attack could even be decisive. Such operations became increasingly hazardous for the attacking aircraft, as one hit from small arms fire could bring an aircraft down and troops learned deflection shooting to hit relatively slow moving enemy aeroplanes.

During the Battle of Messines in June 1917, Trenchard ordered the British crews to fly low over the lines and strafe all available targets. Techniques for Army and RFC co-operation quickly evolved and improved and during the Third Battle of Ypres over 300 aircraft from 14 RFC squadrons, including the Sopwith Camel, armed with four 9 kg (20 lb) bombs, constantly raided enemy trenches, troop concentrations, artillery positions and strongholds in co-operation with tanks and infantry.

The cost to the RFC was high, with a loss rate of ground attack aircraft approaching 30 per cent. The first British production armoured type, the Sopwith Salamander, did not see service during the First World War.

==== Home defence ====
In the UK the RFC Home Establishment was not only responsible for training air and ground crews and preparing squadrons to deploy to France, but providing squadrons for home defence, countering the German Zeppelin raids and later Gotha raids. The RFC (and the Royal Naval Air Service) initially had limited success against the German raids, largely through the problem of locating the attackers and having aircraft of sufficient performance to reach the operating altitude of the German raiders.

With the bulk of the operational squadrons engaged in France few could be spared for home defence in the UK. Therefore, training squadrons were called on to supply home defence aircraft and aircrews for the duration of the war. Night flying and defence missions were often flown by instructors in aircraft deemed worn-out and often obsolete for front-line service, although the pilots selected as instructors were often among the most experienced in the RFC.

The RFC officially took over the role of Home Defence in December 1915 and at that time had 10 permanent airfields. By December 1916 there were 11 RFC home defence squadrons:
===Saint-Omer===
As the war moved into the period of the mobile warfare commonly called the Race to the Sea, the Corps moved forward again. The RFC arrived in Saint-Omer on 8 October 1914, and a headquarters was established at the aerodrome next to the local race course. Over the next few days the four squadrons arrived, and for the next four years Saint-Omer was a focal point for all RFC operations in the field. Although most squadrons only used Saint-Omer as a transit camp before moving on to other locations, the base grew in importance as it increased its logistic support to the RFC.

===Trenchard in command in France===
Hugh Trenchard was the commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France from August 1915 until January 1918. Trenchard&#x27;s time in command was characterised by three priorities. First was his emphasis on support to and co-ordination with ground forces. This support started with reconnaissance and artillery co-ordination and later encompassed tactical low-level bombing of enemy ground forces. While Trenchard did not oppose the strategic bombing of Germany in principle, he opposed moves to divert his forces on to long-range bombing missions as he believed the strategic role to be less important and his resource to be too limited. Secondly, he stressed the importance of morale, not only of his own airmen, but more generally the detrimental effect that the presence of an aircraft had upon the morale of opposing ground troops. Finally, Trenchard had an unswerving belief in the importance of offensive action. Although this belief was widely held by senior British commanders, the RFC&#x27;s offensive posture resulted in the loss of many men and machines and some doubted its effectiveness.

=== 1916–1917 ===
Before the Battle of the Somme the RFC mustered 421 aircraft, with 4 kite-balloon squadrons and 14 balloons. These made up four brigades, which worked with the four British armies. By the end of the Somme offensive in November 1916, the RFC had lost 800 aircraft and 252 aircrew killed (all causes) since July 1916, with 292 tons of bombs dropped and 19,000 Recce photographs taken.

As 1917 dawned, the Allied Air Forces felt the effect of the German Air Force&#x27;s increasing superiority in both organisation and equipment (if not numbers). The recently formed &quot;Jastas&quot;, equipped with the Albatros fighter, inflicted very heavy losses on the RFC&#x27;s obsolescent aircraft, culminating in Bloody April, the nadir of the RFC&#x27;s fortunes in World War I.

To support the Battle of Arras beginning on 9 April 1917, the RFC deployed 25 squadrons, totalling 365 aircraft, a third of which were fighters (scouts). The British lost 245 aircraft with 211 aircrew killed or missing &amp; 108 as prisoners of war. The German Air Services lost just 66 aircraft from all causes.

By the summer of 1917, the introduction of the next generation of technically advanced combat aircraft (such as the SE5, Sopwith Camel and Bristol Fighter) ensured losses fell and damage inflicted on the enemy increased.

Close support and battlefield co-operation tactics with the British Army were further developed by November 1917, when low-flying fighter aircraft co-operated highly effectively with advancing columns of tanks and infantry during the Battle of Cambrai.

1917 saw 2,094 RFC aircrew killed in action or missing.

=== Italy ===
The disastrous defeat of the Italian Army by Austro-Hungarian and German forces in the Battle of Caporetto led to the transfer of 3 RFC Sopwith Camel fighter squadrons (28, 45 and 66), two two-seater squadrons (34 and 42, with RE8s) and No. 4 Balloon Wing to the Italian Front in November 1917. No. 139 Squadron (Bristol Fighters) were added in July 1918.

=== Other theatres of operations ===
RFC Squadrons were also deployed to the Middle East and the Balkans. In July 1916 the Middle-East Brigade of the RFC was formed under the command of Brigadier General W G H Salmond, concentrating RFC units based in Macedonia, Mesopotamia, Palestine and East Africa under one unified command.
In the Middle East units had to make do with older, often obsolete equipment before being given more modern aircraft. The Palestine Brigade of the RFC was formed in October 1917 to support General Allenby&#x27;s ground offensive against the Ottomans in Palestine.

Despite their relatively small numbers the RFC gave valuable assistance to the Army in the eventual defeat of Ottoman forces in Palestine, Trans Jordan and Mesopotamia (Iraq).

=== 1918 ===
The German Offensive in March 1918 was an all-out effort to win the war before the German economy collapsed from the pressures exerted on it by the Royal Navy&#x27;s blockade and the strains of war. In the weeks following the launch of the attack, RFC crews flew unceasingly, with all types of aircraft bombing and strafing ground forces, often from extremely low level, meantime also bringing back vital reports of the fluid ground fighting.

The RFC contributed significantly to slowing the German advance and ensuring the controlled retreat of the Allied Armies did not turn into a rout. The battle reached its peak on 12 April, when the newly formed RAF dropped more bombs, and flew more missions than any other day during the war. The cost of halting the German advance was high however, with over 400 aircrew killed and 1000 aircraft lost to enemy action.

===Amalgamation with the RNAS===
On 17 August 1917, General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power. Because of its potential for the &#x27;devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale&#x27;, he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the Army and Royal Navy. Pilots were seconded to the RFC from other regiments and could return when they were no longer able to fly but in a separate service this would be impossible. The formation of the new service would make underused RNAS resources available for the Western Front, as well as ending the inter-service rivalry that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement.

On 1 April 1918, the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated to form the Royal Air Force, under the control of a new Air Ministry. After starting in 1914 with some 2,073 personnel, by the start of 1919 the RAF had 4,000 combat aircraft and 114,000 personnel.

==Recruitment and training==
Many pilots were initially seconded to the RFC from their original regiments by becoming an observer. Some RFC ground crew (often NCO&#x27;s or below) also volunteered for these flying duties as they then received supplementary flying pay. There was no formal training for observers until 1917 and many were sent on their first sortie with only a brief introduction to the aircraft from the pilot. Once they were certified as fully qualified, the observer was awarded the coveted half-wing brevet. When it had been awarded this could not be forfeited, so it essentially amounted to a decoration. Originally in the RFC, as in most early air forces, the observer was nominally in command of the aircraft with the pilot having the role of a &quot;chauffeur&quot;. In practice, this was reversed at an early stage in the RFC, so that the pilot normally commanded the aircraft. Most operational two seaters of the period did not have dual controls (an exception was the F.K. 8), so that the death or incapacity of the pilot normally meant an inevitable crash – but nonetheless many observers gained at least rudimentary piloting skills, and it was very common for experienced observers to be selected for pilot training.

Applicants for aircrew generally entered the RFC as a cadet via the depot pool for basic training. The cadet would then generally pass on to the School of Military Aeronautics at either Reading or Oxford. Following this period of theoretical learning the cadet was posted to a Training Squadron, either in the UK or overseas.

Colonel Robert Smith-Barry, a former CO of 60 Squadron, appalled at the high fatality rate during training in 1915–16 and the poor standard of newly trained pilots, formulated a comprehensive curriculum for pilot training, and with the agreement of Trenchard, returned to the UK to implement his training ethos at RNAS Gosport in 1917. The immediate effect was to halve fatalities in training. The curriculum was based on a combination of classroom theory and dual flight instruction. Students were not to be discouraged from potentially dangerous manoeuvres but were exposed to them in a controlled environment so that the student could learn to safely rectify errors of judgement.

Dual flying training usually weeded out those not suitable for flying training (approximately 45% of the initial class intake) before the remaining cadets were taught in the air by an instructor ( initially a &#x27;tour-expired&#x27; pilot sent for a rest from an operational squadron in France, without any specific training on how to instruct). After flying 10 to 20 hours dual instruction, the pupil would be ready to &#x27;go solo&#x27;.

In May 1916 pilots under instruction were further trained for fighting in the air. Schools of Special Flying were set up at Turnberry, Marske, Sedgeford, Freiston, East Fortune and Ayr, where finished pilots could simulate combat flying under the supervision of veteran instructors.

During 1917 experienced pilots were redeployed from the Sinai and Palestine campaign to set up a new flying school and train pilots in Egypt and staff another in Australia. Seven Training Squadrons were eventually established in Egypt at five Training Depot Stations.

In 1917, the American, British, and Canadian Governments agreed to join forces for training. Between April 1917 and January 1919, Camp Borden in Ontario hosted instruction on flying, wireless, air gunnery and photography, training 1,812 RFC Canada pilots and 72 for the United States. Training also took place at several other Ontario locations.

During winter 1917–18, RFC instructors trained with the Aviation Section, US Signal Corps on three airfields in the United States accommodating about six thousand men, at Camp Taliaferro near Fort Worth, Texas. Training was hazardous; 39 RFC officers and cadets died in Texas. Eleven remain there, reinterred in 1924 at a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery where a monument honours their sacrifice.

As the war drew on the RFC increasingly drew on men from across the British Empire including South Africa, Canada and Australia. As well as individual personnel, the separate Australian Flying Corps (AFC) deployed Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 Squadrons AFC (which the RFC referred to as 67, 68, 69 and 71 Squadrons). Over 200 Americans joined the RFC before the United States became a combatant. Eventually Canadians made up nearly a third of RFC aircrew.

Although as the war progressed and training became far safer, by the end of the war, some 8,000 had been killed while training or in flying accidents.

== Parachutes ==
Parachuting from balloons and aircraft, with very few accidents, had been a popular &quot;stunt&quot; for several years before the war. In 1915 inventor Everard Calthrop offered the RFC his patented parachute. On 13 January 1917, Captain Clive Collett, a New Zealander, made the first British military parachute jump from a heavier-than-air craft. The jump, from 600 feet, was successful but although parachutes were issued to the crews of observation balloons, the higher authorities in the RFC and the Air Board were opposed to the issuing of parachutes to pilots of heavier-than-air craft. It was felt at the time that a parachute might tempt a pilot to abandon his aircraft in an emergency rather than continuing the fight. The parachutes of the time were also heavy and cumbersome, and the added weight was frowned upon by some experienced pilots as it adversely affected aircraft with already marginal performance. It was not until 16 September 1918 that an order was issued for all single-seater aircraft to be fitted with parachutes, and this did not eventuate until after the war.

== End of the war ==
At the end of the war there were 5,182 pilots in service (constituting 2% of total RAF personnel). In comparison, the casualties from the RFC/RNAS/RAF for 1914–18 totalled 9,378 killed or missing, with 7,245 wounded. Some 900,000 flying hours on operations were logged, and 6,942 tons of bombs dropped. The RFC claimed some 7,054 German aircraft and balloons either destroyed, sent &#x27;down out of control&#x27; or &#x27;driven down&#x27;.

Eleven RFC members received the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Initially the RFC did not believe in publicising the victory totals and exploits of their aces. Eventually, however, public interest and the newspapers&#x27; demand for heroes led to this policy being abandoned, with the feats of aces such as Captain Albert Ball raising morale in the service as well as on the &quot;home front&quot;. More than 1000 airmen are considered as &quot;aces&quot; (see List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire). However, the British criteria for confirming air victories were much lower than those from Germany or France, and do not meet modern standards (see Aerial victory standards of World War I).

For a short time after the formation of the RAF, pre-RAF ranks such as Lieutenant, Captain and Major continued to exist, a practice that officially ended on 15 September 1919. For this reason, some early RAF memorials and gravestones show ranks that no longer exist in the modern RAF. A typical example is James McCudden&#x27;s grave, though there are many others.

He studied composition and design with Arthur Wesley Dow at the Art Students League in the fall of 1900, and he studied painting with William Merritt Chase each of the three summers between 1900 and 1902 at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art, after which he entered in the fall of 1902 Robert Henri&#x27;s class at the New York School of Art, which Chase had founded. During the summer of 1903, in Dublin, New Hampshire, Kent was apprenticed to painter and naturalist Abbott Handerson Thayer. An undergraduate background in architecture at Columbia University prepared Kent for occasional work in the 1900s and 1910s as an architectural renderer and carpenter. At Columbia, Kent befriended future curator Carl Zigrosser, who became his close friend, supporter, and collaborator.

Kent&#x27;s early paintings of Mount Monadnock and New Hampshire were first shown at the Society of American Artists in New York in 1904, when &quot;Dublin Pond&quot; was purchased by Smith College. In 1905 Kent ventured to Monhegan Island, Maine, and found its rugged and primordial beauty a source of inspiration for the next five years. His first series of paintings of Monhegan were shown to wide critical acclaim in 1907 at Clausen Galleries in New York. These works form the foundation of his lasting reputation as an early American modernist, and can be seen in museums across the country, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum, New Britain Museum of American Art, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Among those critics lauding Kent was James Huneker of the &quot;Sun&quot;, who praised Kent&#x27;s athletic brushwork and daring color dissonances. (It was Huneker who deemed the paintings of The Eight as &quot;decidedly reactionary&quot;.) In 1910, Kent helped organize the Exhibition of Independent Artists, and in 1911, together with Arthur B. Davies he organized An Independent Exhibition of the Paintings and Drawings of Twelve Men, referred to as &quot;The Twelve&quot; and &quot;Kent&#x27;s Tent&quot;. Painters Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and Max Weber (but not John Sloan, Robert Henri, or George Bellows) participated in the 1911 exhibition. Kent was away in Winona, Minnesota, on an architectural assignment when the historic Armory Show took place in Manhattan in 1913.

A transcendentalist and mystic in the tradition of Thoreau and Emerson, whose works he read, Kent found inspiration in the austerity and stark beauty of wilderness. After Monhegan, he lived for extended periods of time in Winona, Minnesota (1912–1913), Newfoundland (1914–15), Alaska (1918–19), Vermont (1919–1925), Tierra del Fuego (1922–23), Ireland (1926), and Greenland (1929; 1931–32; 1934–35). His series of land and seascapes from these often forbidding locales convey the Symbolist spirit evoking the mysteries and cosmic wonders of the natural world. &quot;I don&#x27;t want petty self-expression&quot;, Kent wrote, &quot;I want the elemental, infinite thing; I want to paint the rhythm of eternity.&quot;

In the late summer of 1918, Kent and his nine-year-old son ventured to the American frontier of Alaska. &quot;Wilderness&quot; (1920), the first of Kent&#x27;s several adventure memoirs, is an edited and illustrated compilation of his letters home. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; (London) described &quot;Wilderness&quot; as &quot;easily the most remarkable book to come out of America since &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was published.&quot; Upon the artist&#x27;s return to New York in March 1919, publishing scion George Palmer Putnam and others, including Juliana Force—assistant to Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney—incorporated the artist as &quot;Rockwell Kent, Inc.&quot; to support him in his new Vermont homestead while he completed his paintings from Alaska for exhibition in 1920 at Knoedler Galleries in New York. Kent&#x27;s small oil-on-wood-panel sketches from Alaska—uniformly horizontal studies of light and color—were exhibited at Knoedler&#x27;s as &quot;Impressions.&quot; Their artistic lineage to the small and spare oil sketches of James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834–1903), which are often entitled &quot;Arrangements,&quot; underscores Kent&#x27;s admiration of Whistler&#x27;s genius.

Approached in 1926 by publisher R. R. Donnelley to produce an illustrated edition of Richard Henry Dana Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, Kent suggested &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; instead. Published in 1930 by the Lakeside Press of Chicago, the three-volume limited edition (1,000 copies) filled with Kent&#x27;s haunting black-and-white pen/brush and ink drawings sold out immediately; Random House also produced a trade edition.


Less well known are Kent&#x27;s talents as a jazz age humorist. As the pen-and-ink draftsman &quot;Hogarth Jr.,&quot; Kent created dozens of whimsical and smartly irreverent drawings published by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and the original &quot;Life&quot;. He also brought his Hogarth Jr., style to a series of richly colored reverse paintings on glass that he completed in 1918 and exhibited at Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store. (Two of these glass paintings are in the collection of the Columbus Museum of Art, part of the bequest of modernist collector Ferdinand Howald.) In &quot;Rockwell Kent: The Mythic and the Modern&quot;, Jake Milgram Wien devotes an entire chapter to Hogarth Jr. and reproduces several of the ink drawings and reverse paintings on glass. Kent frequently crossed into the realm of illustration in the 1920s and contributed drawings for reproduction on the covers of many leading magazines. For example, Kent&#x27;s pen, brush, and ink drawings were reproduced on the covers of the pulp magazine &quot;Adventure&quot; in 1927, leading &quot;Time&quot; magazine to say that &quot;if it were distinguished for nothing else, &quot;Adventure&quot; would stand apart from rival &#x27;pulps&#x27;... because it was once entirely illustrated by Rockwell Kent...&quot; Decorative work ensued intermittently: in 1939, Vernon Kilns reproduced three series of designs drawn by Kent (Moby Dick, Salamina, Our America) on its sets of contemporary china dinnerware.

At the Art Students League in the 1920s or 1930s, Kent met and befriended many artists, including Wilhelmina Weber Furlong and Thomas Furlong.

Raymond Moore, founder and impresario of the Cape Playhouse and Cinema in Dennis, Massachusetts, contracted with Rockwell Kent for the design of murals for the cinema—including an extraordinarily expansive mural for the ceiling. The work of transferring and painting the designs on the span was done by Kent&#x27;s collaborator Jo Mielziner (1901–1976) and a crew of stage set painters from New York City. Ostensibly staying away from the state of Massachusetts to protest the Sacco and Vanzetti executions of 1927, Kent did in fact venture to Dennis in June 1930 to spend three days on the scaffolding, making suggestions and corrections. The signatures of both Kent and Mielziner appear on opposite walls of the cinema.

In 1927, Kent moved to upstate New York where he had acquired an Adirondack farmstead. Asgaard, as he named it, was his residence for the remainder of his life, and from his studio there he worked tirelessly on countless painting and drawing assignments. In the summer of 1929, Kent sailed on a painting expedition to Greenland, and his adventures (and misadventures) are recounted in the best-selling &quot;N by E&quot; (1930). After meeting Danish Arctic explorers Peter Freuchen and Knud Rasmussen on this trip, Kent determined to return to Greenland to paint and write. He spent two years (1931–32 and 1934–35) above the Arctic Circle in a tiny fishing settlement called Igdlorssuit (or Illorsuit), where he conceived some of the largest and most celebrated paintings of his career. His cross-cultural encounters in Greenland included Leni Riefenstahl, the famed German filmmaker/actor, who was briefly in Illorsuit with the film crew of &quot;S.O.S. Iceberg&quot;. Kent&#x27;s own movie-making aspirations, including a quasi-documentary film featuring the Inuit, are explored in &quot;Rockwell Kent and Hollywood&quot; (Jake Milgram Wien, 2002), cited below. Many of Kent&#x27;s historic photographs and hand-tinted lantern slides are reproduced for the first time in &quot;North by Nuuk: Greenland after Rockwell Kent&quot; (Denis Defibaugh, 2019), also cited below.

As World War II approached, Kent shifted his artistic agenda, becoming increasingly active in progressive politics. In 1937, the Section of Painting and Sculpture of the U.S. Treasury commissioned Kent, along with nine other artists, to paint two murals in the New Post Office building at the Federal Triangle in Washington, DC; the two murals are named &quot;Mail Service in the Arctic&quot; and &quot;Mail Service in the Tropics&quot; to celebrate the reach of domestic airborne postal service. Kent included (in an Alaska Native language and in tiny letters) a polemical statement in the painting, apparently a message from the indigenous people of Alaska to the Puerto Ricans, in support of decolonization. As translated, the communication read &quot;To the peoples of Puerto Rico, our friends: Go ahead, let us change chiefs. That alone can make us equal and free&quot;. The incident caused some consternation.

Kent&#x27;s patriotism never waned in spite of his often critical views of American foreign policy and his impatience with the promises of capitalism. He remained America&#x27;s premier draftsman of the sea, and during World War II he produced a series of pen/brush and ink maritime drawings for American Export Lines and began another series of pen/brush and ink drawings for Rahr Malting Company which he completed in 1946. The drawings were reproduced in &quot;To Thee!&quot;, a book Kent also wrote and designed celebrating American freedom and democracy and the important role immigrants play in constructing American national identity. In 1948, Kent was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and in 1966 he became a full Academician. Kent passed away at his home in the Adirondacks in 1971.

==Politics==
Although he came from a relatively privileged background, Kent formed radical political views early in life, joining the Socialist Party of America in 1904. He cast his first presidential vote for Eugene Debs that year, and for the rest of his life was ready to debate socialist ideas on any occasion. His respect for the dignity of labor, acquired through personal experience and the skills of his craft, also made him a strong supporter of unions. He briefly joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1912 and belonged at various times to unions in the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Kent&#x27;s political activism came to the fore in the latter part of the 1930s, when he took part in several initiatives of the cultural popular front, including support for the Spanish Republic and the subsequent war against fascism. Most notably, he participated in the American Artists&#x27; Congress at the time of its formation in 1936 and later served as an officer of the Artists&#x27; Union of America and then the Artists&#x27; League of America in their efforts to represent artists to boards, museums and dealers. In 1948 he stood for Congress as an American Labor Party candidate supporting Henry Wallace&#x27;s Progressive Party presidential campaign as the best option for extending the legacy of the New Deal.

In the changing postwar context, Kent advocated nuclear disarmament and continued friendship with America&#x27;s wartime ally, the Soviet Union. This placed him on the wrong side of American Cold War policies. The Soviet Union extensively promoted Kent&#x27;s work, who was among hundreds of other prominent intellectuals and creative artists targeted by those in league with Joseph McCarthy, but he and William Gropper share the distinction of being the only graphic artists to be targeted.

Kent was not a Communist and considered his political views to be in the best traditions of American democracy. However, his participation in the Stockholm Appeal and the World Peace Council led to the suspension of his passport in 1950. After he filed suit to regain his foreign-travel rights, in June 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Kent v. Dulles&quot; affirmed his right to travel by declaring the ban a violation of his civil rights. Meanwhile, Kent also came under attack as an officer of the International Workers Order, a mutual benefit and cultural society supported by leftists and immigrants. In 1951, Kent defended his record in court proceedings and exposed the perjured testimony that claimed he was a Communist.

From 1957 to 1971, Kent was president of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship. After a well-received exhibition of his work in five Soviet museums – Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, the State Hermitage Museum, Kiev Museum of Western and Eastern Art, Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art and State Museum of Fine Arts, Riga – in 1957–58, he donated several hundred of his paintings and drawings to the Soviet peoples in 1960 (as catalogued in &quot;Rockwell Kent&#x27;s Forgotten Landscapes&quot;: Scott R Ferris and Ellen Pearce. Down East Books. 1998). He subsequently became an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Fine Arts and in 1967 the recipient of the International Lenin Peace Prize. Kent specified that his prize money be given to the women and children of Vietnam, both North and South. (The nature of Kent&#x27;s gift is clarified by his wife Sally in the 2005 documentary &quot;Rockwell Kent&quot;, produced and written by Fred Lewis.)

===Meeting with Soviet Ukrainian artists===

Rockwell Kent traveled to the Soviet Union and found like-minded people there. In the preface to the second Russian edition of his book &quot;Salamina&quot;, Kent wrote:
&quot;Recently… I&#x27;ve met two talented young artists from Kyiv Ada Rybachuk and Volodymyr Melnychenko. They lived and worked in the Soviet Arctic, just like me, they love the North and its inhabitants… Shouldn&#x27;t art reveal the essence of Humanity? .. We who strive to create a better world for people must know the clay from which we form man.&quot;

==Legacy==

When Kent died of a heart attack in 1971, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an extensive front-page obituary that commenced: &quot;At various (and frequently simultaneous) periods of his long life the protean Rockwell Kent was an architect, painter, illustrator, lithographer, xylographer, cartoonist, advertising artist, carpenter, dairy farmer, explorer, trade union leader and political controversialist. &quot;He is so multiple a person as to be multifarious,&quot; Louis Untermeyer, the poet, once observed.&quot; When an anthology of Kent&#x27;s work was published in 1982, a reviewer of the book for the &quot;New York Times&quot; further described Kent as &quot;... a thoughtful, troublesome, profoundly independent, odd and kind man who made an imperishable contribution to the art of bookmaking in the United States.&quot; Retrospectives of the artist&#x27;s paintings and drawings have been mounted, by the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, where the exhibition &quot;Pointed North: Rockwell Kent in Newfoundland and Labrador&quot; was curated by Caroline Stone in the summer of 2014. Other exhibitions include an exhibition in 2013 in Winona, Minnesota marking the centennial of Kent&#x27;s time there; the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery and Owen D. Young Library at St. Lawrence University (Canton, New York) in the autumn of 2012; the Farnsworth Art Museum (Rockland, Maine) during the spring through autumn of 2012; the Bennington Museum in Vermont during the summer of 2012; the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the spring through summer of 2012; and the Portland Museum of Art, Maine for the major summer show of 2005 commemorating the centenary of Kent&#x27;s arrival on Monhegan Island.

2018 through 2020 marked the 100th anniversary of Kent&#x27;s Alaskan painting expedition, his stay on Fox Island, and the publication of &quot;Wilderness: A Journal of Quiet Adventure in Alaska&quot;. The letters he wrote and received during that time reveal a less than quiet experience beneath his book&#x27;s narrative. Personal correspondence with his wife, Kathleen, and with Hildegarde Hirsch, his inamorata of that time, provide a fascinating glimpse into the backstory of his life. A more detailed account can be found at the blog &quot;Rockwell Kent &quot;Wilderness&quot; Centennial Journal&quot;.

One of Kent&#x27;s exemplary pen-and-ink drawings from &quot;Moby Dick&quot; appears on a U.S. postage stamp issued as part of the 2001 commemorative panel celebrating American Illustration, with other artistic examples by Maxfield Parrish, Frederic Remington, and Norman Rockwell. The year he spent in Newfoundland in 1914-1915 is fictionally recalled by Canadian writer Michael Winter in &quot;The Big Why&quot;, his 2004 Winterset Award-winning novel. Kent&#x27;s work also figures in Steve Martin&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;An Object of Beauty&quot; and is the subject of a chapter in Douglas Brinkley&#x27;s 2011 history &quot;The Quiet World: Saving Alaska&#x27;s Wilderness Kingdom: 1879–1960&quot;.

Columbia University is the repository of Rockwell Kent&#x27;s personal collection of 3,300 working drawings and sketches, most of which were unpublished. The gift was made in 1972 by Mr. and Mrs. Alfred C. Berol, Corliss Lamont, Mrs. Arthur Hayes Sulzberger, and Dan Burne Jones.

The Archives of American Art is the repository for Kent&#x27;s voluminous correspondence.

<text>The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&amp;R Canal) is a canal in central New Jersey, built in the 1830s, that connects the Delaware River to the Raritan River. It was an efficient and reliable means of transportation of freight between Philadelphia and New York City, transporting anthracite coal from eastern Pennsylvania during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The canal allowed shippers to cut many miles off the existing route from the Pennsylvania Coal Region down the Delaware, around Cape May, and up the occasionally treacherous Atlantic Ocean coast to New York City.

==History==

The idea of a canal between the Raritan and Delaware Rivers originated with William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, who suggested it in the 1690s. Such a canal would shorten the journey from Philadelphia to New York City by 100 miles, and relieve the need for boats to venture into the Atlantic Ocean.

===19th century===
In 1816, the New Jersey legislature created a commission of three people, including John Rutherfurd, a former United States Senator and a major landowner in New Jersey, which was authorized to survey and map a proposed route for a canal. Rutherfurd engaged John Randel Jr. to do the survey; Rutherfurd knew Randel from his work on the New York City Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, for which Rutherfurd was one of the commissioners, and Randel was the chief surveyor. The route was to be &quot;a level line as far as was practicable from Longbridge farm to the Delaware, and to the Raritan, in the shortest direction that the ground would admit, which line should be run with the greatest accuracy, and be esteemed the base line of the work.&quot; Randel spent two months surveying this route and, with the aid of a millwright, estimating water flow. They came to the conclusion that the canal would require less than an eighteenth of the water passing through the local streams, which would still leave enough water flow for local mills. Despite Randel&#x27;s report, and the clear advantage of having such a canal, the opposition to the project managed to keep anything from happening until 1830.

On February 4, 1830, the New Jersey legislature passed legislation that created the charter for the D&amp;R Canal. The charter for the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company was passed the same day. The D&amp;R charter allocated $1.5 million of stock for construction which was required to be completed within eight years. The canal was to be considered a public highway although the corporation would be allowed to collect tolls and transit duties for passengers and cargo transported along the canal.

The canal was almost not dug due to the lack of subscriptions. When that occurred, Robert F. Stockton, the grandson of Richard Stockton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, pledged his and his family&#x27;s personal fortune to continue the work. The canal system was dug mostly by hand tools, mostly by Irish immigrants. Work began in 1830 and was completed in 1834, at an estimated cost of $2,830,000, equal to $ today. When the canal first opened, before the steam engine was developed, teams of mules were used to tow canal boats through it.

The canal&#x27;s greatest usage occurred during the 1860s and 1870s when it was used primarily to transport coal from Pennsylvania to New York City during the American Industrial Revolution. On May 18, 1872, the D&amp;R Canal Company was merged with several parallel railroads into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company and leased by the Pennsylvania Railroad.

===20th century===
D&amp;R Canal&#x27;s importance waned as railroads were used to perform, more rapidly, the same function as canals, but it remained in operation until 1932. Years later, the section between Trenton and Bordentown was filled for various road and rail projects, leaving the feeder waters to solely supply the main canal from Trenton, New Jersey north to New Brunswick. Two other sections of the canal were piped underground: one in Trenton when the Trenton Freeway was constructed in 1952, and the other in New Brunswick when the Elmer Boyd Parkway Extension (Route 18) was constructed in 1984.

==Route==
The main section of the canal runs from Bordentown on the Delaware River to New Brunswick on the Raritan. A feeder canal section (which feeds water into the main canal) stretches northward from Trenton, upstream along the east bank of the Delaware to Bull&#x27;s Island near Frenchtown. The feeder canal collects water from higher elevations to the north, and feeds it to the highest section of the main canal, which flows generally north and east to the end, and had flowed south into the Crosswicks Creek at Bordentown. The total length of the entire canal system was approximately . The main section was long, wide and deep; the feeder was long, wide and deep.

===Altered and abandoned sections===
The southern branch of the D&amp;R Canal in Trenton was filled in by a W.P.A. project along the Trenton Freeway (now U.S. Route 1) to Lalor Street, while the northeastern branch was covered over and continues to flow beneath the surface. The portion of the canal that provided access to the Delaware River in Bordentown is also abandoned. In Trenton it has been covered by Route 129, which opened in 1996. Another section south of Trenton is located in Hamilton Township, New Jersey between the southern boundary of Trenton and the Crosswicks Creek.The surviving, easternmost lock is also severed from the canal by Route 18 in New Brunswick.

===Locks and spillways===
Locks were used to overcome elevation differences along the D&amp;R canal. Many of the locks are still present along the canal route; however, the lock gates have been replaced on the upstream side with small dams and water outfalls. The downstream gates have been removed, so the water in the locks is level with the water on the downstream side. Some of the locks have been buried or removed due to construction projects in the vicinity of the canal.

A number of spillways, which drained excess water from the canal into nearby waterways during periods of heavy flow, are located along the canal route. Spillways are evident as a dip in the towpath along the canal. Some have paving stones spaced closely enough for mules to walk, but are impassable for bicycles.

==Associated rivers==
*Delaware River: Feeds the Delaware and Raritan Canal via a feeder canal that approaches from the north along the east bank of the Delaware River, starting at Bulls Island, to the southern terminus of the D&amp;R Canal near Trenton.
*Millstone River: Parallels the Delaware and Raritan Canal from Princeton north to Manville.
*Raritan River: Parallels the Delaware and Raritan Canal from Manville north and east to New Brunswick. The northern terminus of the Delaware and Raritan Canal is in New Brunswick.

==Landmark==
The Delaware and Raritan Canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1973. The many historic canal houses where the bridge tenders have lived (such as the Blackwells Mills Canal House and the Port Mercer Canal House) were listed as contributing properties.

==State Park==
In 1974, most of the canal system was declared a New Jersey state park. It is used for canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. A graded natural-surface trail along the side of the canal, which was the tow path that mules used to tow barges on the canal before steam powered barges, is now used for hiking, jogging, bicycling, and horseback riding. Some of the main canal, and all of the feeder canal, still exist. The feeder canal along the Delaware, being a former railroad rather than a towpath, is especially suited to bicycling. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

The canal is accessible from many points along its route, with small parking areas providing access at most road crossings. One of the most scenic and popular sections of the D&amp;R Canal state park is the segment along Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, which features the canal on one side of the path and the lake on the other side. Another attractive section borders the Colonial Park Arboretum and Gardens in East Millstone.

When the canal was used for transportation, New Jersey&#x27;s landscape was mostly rural, and its primary business was agriculture. In the words of Howard Green, research director of the New Jersey Historical Commission, &quot;Now it is one of the most beloved parks in the state, a sinewy, snake-like greenway through one of the most heavily populated parts of the world. It has gone from being the machine in the garden, to being garden in the machine.&quot;

== Folklore ==
From 1972 onward, the canal developed a local legend. Residents of Griggstown, Franklin Township claimed to have seen a feral cow along the canal and the parallel Millstone River, said to be the ghost of one of many cows herded across and along the canal. The folklore endured for 30 years when, on November 23, 2002, an actual bull was found in a ditch, and was pulled out by local authorities only to be subsequently euthanized shortly afterward.

<doc id="233686" wikidata="Q159679" url="?curid=233686" title="George of Poděbrady">
<text>George of Kunštát and Poděbrady (23 April 1420 – 22 March 1471), also known as Poděbrad or Podiebrad (; ), was the sixteenth King of Bohemia, who ruled in 1458–1471. He was a leader of the Hussites, but moderate and tolerant toward the Catholic faith. His rule was marked by great efforts to preserve peace and tolerance between the Hussites and Catholics in the religiously divided Crown of Bohemia – hence his contemporary nicknames: &quot;King of two peoples&quot; () and &quot;Friend of peace&quot; (&quot;přítel míru&quot;).

During the 19th century, in period of the so-called Czech National Revival, he began to be praised (even somewhat idealized) as the last Czech national monarch (in terms of ethnic awareness), a great diplomat and a courageous fighter against the domination of the Catholic Church. In modern times he is remembered mainly for his idea and attempt to establish common European Christian institutions, which is now seen as an early historical vision of European unity.

== Early life ==
George was the son of Victor of Kunštát and Poděbrady, a Bohemian nobleman whose ancestors were of Moravian origin, one of the leaders of more moderate faction (called Utraquists) of the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. George&#x27;s mother is not known by name and it is likely that George was born out of wedlock; during his life he repeatedly heard ridicule from his enemies about his origin.

At the age of fourteen, George himself took part in the Battle of Lipany (1434), which marked the downfall of more radical Hussite factions (Taborites and Orebites) and the end of revolutionary phase of the Hussite movement. By that time he was already orphaned, as his father had died in 1427.

Early in life, as one of the leaders of the Hussite party, he defeated Austrian troops of King Albert II, who had succeeded King Sigismund as King of Bohemia, Germany and Hungary. George soon became a prominent member of the Hussite party after the death of Hynce Ptáček of Pirkstein, its leader.

King Albert was succeeded by his posthumously born son Ladislaus, during whose reign Bohemia sharply divided into two parties: the party faithful to Rome, led by powerful &quot;viceroy&quot; Oldřich II of Rosenberg, and the Hussite party, led by George.

After various attempts at reconciliation, George sought a military decision. He gradually raised an armed force in north-eastern Bohemia, where the Hussites were strong and where his ancestral Litice Castle was situated. In 1448, he marched this army, about 9000 strong, from Kutná Hora to Prague, and obtained possession of the capital almost without resistance.

Civil war broke out, but George succeeded in defeating the nobles who remained faithful to Rome. In 1451 the Emperor Frederick III, as guardian of the young king Ladislaus, entrusted Poděbrad with the administration of Bohemia. In the same year a diet assembled at Prague also confirmed the regency on George.

== Ruler of Bohemia ==

The struggle of the Hussites against the papal party continued uninterruptedly, and the position of George became a very difficult one when the young king Ladislaus, who was crowned in 1453, expressed his pro-Roman sympathies, though he had recognized the compacts and the ancient privileges of Bohemia. In 1457 King Ladislaus died suddenly and some voices accused George of having poisoned him. However, research in 1985 proved acute leukemia as the cause of death.

On 2 March 1458 the estates of Bohemia unanimously chose George as king. Even the adherents of the papal party voted for him, some in honour of his moderate policies, some out of deference to popular feeling, which opposed the election of a foreign ruler.

George attempted to rule in a moderate manner based on the &quot;Compacta of Prague&quot;. He won the loyalty of some Catholics, but had to contend with the opposition of Pope Pius II, which proved one of the most serious obstacles to his rule. Pius declared the Compacta null and void in 1462 and wished George to consent to this. George rejected this demand but endeavoured to curry favour with the Papal See by punishing the more extreme Hussites (Taborites) or members of then newly founded Unitas Fratrum church.

=== Message of peace ===

George attempted to secure peace with Rome by a radical suggestion, which some consider to have been a proposal before its time of a European Union. He proposed a treaty among all Christian powers, with Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, Bavaria, Brandenburg, Saxony, France, Burgundy and Italian states and its princes the founding members, but others, especially the Hispanic powers, joining later. The member states would pledge to settle all differences by exclusively peaceful means. There was to be a common parliament and other common institutions. George couched the proposal in Christian terms (&quot;Europe&quot; is not explicitly mentioned) as a way to stop the &quot;abominable Turk&quot;, who had conquered Constantinople in 1453.

He sent his brother-in-law Jaroslav Lev of Rožmitál on a tour of European courts with a draft treaty of the message of peace to promote the idea. George hoped that the treaty would come into effect in 1464. It is seen as one of historical propsals of European unity foreshadowing the European Union.

That did not happen. All George&#x27;s endeavours to establish peace with Rome proved ineffectual, but Pius II&#x27;s plan of a crusade against Bohemia remained unexecuted. After Pius&#x27; death in 1464, George attempted to negotiate with the new pope, Paul II, who proved to be an equally determined opponent.

===Struggle with internal opposition and antiking===
George made enemies among the nobles of the papal party, who assembled at Zelená Hora (Grüneberg) on 28 November 1465 to voice their grievances and conclude an alliance against the king. The alliance was from the outset supported by Paul II, who, on 23 December 1466, excommunicated George and pronounced his deposition as king of Bohemia, which released all subjects of the Bohemian crown from their oaths of allegiance to George. Emperor Frederick III and Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus, George&#x27;s former ally, joined the insurgent Bohemian nobles, starting the Bohemian War. Matthias conquered a large part of Moravia, and was crowned by the papal party in the Moravian ecclesiastical metropolis Olomouc as king of Bohemia on 3 May 1469.

George was successful against Matthias but, contrary to the wishes of his followers, came to an agreement with the Hungarian king in 1470.

In the spring of 1471, however, Jiřík&#x27;s health deteriorated significantly and he died on the 22nd of March. He was buried in the royal tomb in St. Vitus Cathedral. His heart and entrails were placed in the Church of Our Lady before Týn in the Old Town, next to the grave of John of Rokycany.

His followers chose Vladislaus II, the son of the Polish king, as his successor to continue the fight against Matthias.

==Legacy==
The large Jiřího z Poděbrad Square in Prague 3 with the nearby eponymous metro station are named after him. Other squares named after him are in Ostrava, Hořice, Toužim, Řevnice, Kunštát or Nový Knín.

In 1896, an equestrian statue of King George, sculpted by Bohuslav Schnirch was erected in Poděbrady.

During World War I, early in 1917, the 2nd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of the Czechoslovak Legions was formed in Russia and named after King George.

<text>Paul Guldin (born Habakkuk Guldin; 12 June 1577 (Mels) – 3 November 1643 (Graz)) was a Swiss Jesuit mathematician and astronomer. He discovered the Guldinus theorem to determine the surface and the volume of a solid of revolution. (This theorem is also known as the Pappus–Guldinus theorem and Pappus&#x27;s centroid theorem, attributed to Pappus of Alexandria.) Guldin was noted for his association with the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler. Guldin composed a critique of Cavalieri&#x27;s method of Indivisibles.

Although of Jewish descent, his parents were Protestants and they brought Guldin up in that faith. He was a professor of mathematics in Graz and Vienna.

In Paolo Casati&#x27;s astronomical work &quot;Terra machinis mota&quot; (1658), Casati imagines a dialogue among Guldin, Galileo, and Marin Mersenne on various intellectual problems of cosmology, geography, astronomy and geodesy.

==Belgium==

===Regions===
*Brussels, Dutch &quot;Brussel&quot;, French &quot;Bruxelles&quot; (the capital city, outside any province; also Belgium&#x27;s third region): medieval Dutch &quot;broek&quot; &#x27;bog&#x27; + &quot;zele&quot; (in many place names in the Low Countries=&quot;habitation using thatching&quot;)
*Flanders, Dutch &quot;Vlaanderen&quot;, French &quot;Flandre(s)&quot;: plural of a terrain type; or &quot;flooded land&quot;; or a compound Flemish &quot;vlakte&quot; &quot;plain&quot; and &quot;wanderen&quot; &quot;to wander&quot;. The name extended from the historical county (about half lost to French and Dutch neighbours; the rest roughly made up two administrative provinces, East Flanders and West Flanders; in French &quot;les Flandres&quot;, plural) to the whole Dutch-speaking, majority part of Belgium (French &quot;la Flandre&quot;, singular)
*Wallonia, French &quot;Wallonie&quot;: from the (Romanized (Germano-) Celtic, now Francophone) Walloon people: as in many European countries, so named by Germanic neighbours; meaning: &quot;strangers&quot;. Compare &quot;Wales&quot; below.

===Provinces===
*Antwerp: from the city of Antwerp, the province&#x27;s capital, which may derive from the Frankish &quot;anda&quot; (&quot;against&quot;) and a noun derived from the verb &quot;werpen&quot; (&quot;to throw&quot;).
*Brabant (now divided for administrative purposes into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant): The name in Carolingian times appeared in Latinised form as &quot;pagus Bracbatensis&quot;, from &quot;bracha&quot; &quot;new&quot; and &quot;bant&quot; &quot;region&quot;. See also under the Netherlands.
*East and West Flanders; see Flanders, above.
*Hainaut: after the river Haine.
*Liège: of disputed etymology. The name &quot;Liège&quot; (also used by the city of Liège, the province&#x27;s capital) may have the same origin as the ancient name of Paris, i.e. &quot;Lutetia&quot;; the German form, &quot;Lüttich&quot;, suggests this. Liège and Lutetia would both derive from Latin &quot;lucotætia&quot;, &quot;marsh&quot; or &quot;mud&quot;. Another suggestion derives the names from Latin &quot;Lætica&quot;, &quot;colony&quot;, or &quot;Leudica&quot;, &quot;free&quot;. Alternatively, the Latin &quot;Leudica&quot; meaning &quot;public place&quot; may have given rise to the Walloon &quot;Lîdje&quot; and thence to &quot;Liège&quot;. Note that the name appeared in written form as &quot;Liége&quot; (with an acute accent) until the 1950s.
*Limburg: Derived from the castle-fortified town of Limbourg, which in turn was derived from &quot;lint&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; and burg &quot;fortress&quot;. See also under the Netherlands.
*Luxembourg: identical with the independent country of the same name to the east. See List of country name etymologies#Luxembourg for the etymology of &quot;Luxembourg&quot;.
*Namur: after the city of Namur, the province&#x27;s capital, of uncertain etymology.

=== Regions ===

* Adamaoua: From the Adamawa Emirate, a vassal state of the 19th-century Sokoto Caliphate. &quot;Adamawa&quot; comes from the name of its founder, Modibbo Adama. The suffix &quot;-wa&quot; is used in the Hausa language to signify the collective identity of &#x27;people of&#x27; that place. Therefore, &quot;Adamawa&quot; means &quot;the people of Adama&quot;. 

==Canada==

===Provinces and territories===
===Historical regions===
*Acadia (French &quot;Acadie&quot;): origin disputed:
**# Credited to Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano, who first named a region around Chesapeake Bay &quot;Archadia&quot; (Arcadia) in 1524 because of &quot;the beauty of its trees&quot;, according to his diary. Cartographers began using the name &quot;Arcadia&quot; to refer to areas progressively farther north until it referred to the French holdings in maritime Canada (particularly Nova Scotia). The &quot;-r-&quot; also began to disappear from the name on early maps, resulting in the current &quot;Acadia&quot;.
**# Possibly derived from the Míkmaq word &quot;akatik&quot;, pronounced roughly &quot;agadik&quot;, meaning &quot;place&quot;, which French-speakers spelled as &quot;-cadie&quot; in place names such as Shubenacadie and Tracadie, possibly coincidentally.
*Nunatsiavut: Inuktitut, meaning &quot;our beautiful land&quot;.

==Chile==

===Regions===

*Los Ríos Region (Spanish &quot;XIV Región de los Ríos&quot;): refers to the river systems of Valdivia and Bueno and to the nickname of the city of Valdivia. The name may also reflect the name of Los Lagos Region (Spanish for Region of the Lakes) from which Los Ríos split away.
*Aisén Region, sometimes also spelled Aysén (Spanish &quot;XI Región Aisén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo&quot;): The name Aisén may come from the Huilliche word &quot;achen&quot;, meaning &quot;to crumble&quot;. Another theory suggests that the Chonos culture used the word to mean &quot;going more to the interior&quot;, in reference to the Fjord of Aisén that stretches east from the Moraleda strait.
*Magallanes y Antártica Chilena Region (Spanish &quot;XII Región de Magallanes y de la Antártica Chilena&quot;): named in honour of Ferdinand Magellan, the Strait of Magellan and the city of Punta Arenas, formerly called &quot;Magallanes&quot;.

===Special administrative regions===

*Hong Kong – An Anglicized transcription of the Cantonese Chinese place name (&quot;Hoeng1gong2&quot;, &quot;Fragrant Harbor&quot;), originally the name of the small inlet now known as Aberdeen Harbour. The reference to fragrance may refer to the harbor waters sweetened by the estuarine influx of the Pearl River or to the incense factories lining the coast to the north of Kowloon which was stored around Aberdeen Harbour, prior to the development of Victoria Harbour. The name was applied to the entirety of Hong Kong Island in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking.

==Czech Republic==
===Historical regions===

Until 19th century referred predominantly to Bohemia only, later the meaning has been extended to all Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia). Traditionally traced to a Forefather Čech, who brought the Czechs into Bohemia.
*Bohemia: &quot;Land of the Boii&quot;, a Celtic tribe of the region. The ultimate etymology of &quot;Boii&quot; is uncertain, but has been connected to Proto-Indo-European roots meaning &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;warrior&quot;
*Moravia: &quot;Land of the Morava&quot;
*Silesia – from the holy Silesian mountain of Ślęża
*Sudetenland – from the Sudeten mountains

==Denmark==
;Autonomous territories and geographic regions are:
*Bornholm: The Old Danish form, &quot;Burghændeholm&quot; shows derivation with the suffix &quot;-und&quot; from &quot;burgh&quot; &quot;fortress&quot;: &quot;provided with a fortress&quot;, later combined with &quot;holm&quot;, &quot;island&quot;. The similarity with the Germanic Burgundian tribe whose name has the same etymology and which may or may not have originated in Scandinavia, can be purely coincidental since the derivation is quite basic in meaning.
*Copenhagen (): The Old Danish form, &quot;Køpmannæhafn&quot; shows the older genitive plural &quot;køpmannæ&quot; of &quot;køpman&quot;, &quot;merchant&quot;, coupled with &quot;hafn&quot;, &quot;harbor&quot;, producing the meaning &quot;merchants&#x27; harbour&quot;. It has entered English via the (Low) German &quot;Kopenhagen&quot;.
*Danish Virgin Islands, a former territory: See British Virgin Islands below.
*Faroe Islands (, ): From Old Norse &quot;Færeyjar&quot; – literally, &quot;Sheep Islands&quot;, from their dense population of sheep. Another theory suggests that the lexeme &quot;fær&quot; instead derives from Celtic and means &quot;distant&quot;.
*Greenland (): From Old Norse &quot;Grœnland&quot;, literally, &quot;green land&quot;; so named by Erik the Red to induce settlement there. Greenlandic-speakers use the name &quot;Kalaallit Nunaat&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Greenlanders&quot;
*Jutland (; ): From Old Danish &quot;Jutland&quot;, derived from the tribal name of the Jutes, combined with &quot;land&quot; &quot;land&quot;.
*Zealand (): Old Icelandic &quot;Selund&quot;, Latin rendering &quot;Selon&quot;, Old Danish &quot;Sialand&quot;. A somewhat later form, now poetic, is &quot;Sjølund&quot;. The oldest forms with the single l and the original vowel reveal that the name is derived with the suffix &quot;-und&quot; (cf. Bornholm above) from Old Danish &quot;*sial&quot; meaning either &quot;seal&quot; or &quot;furrow&quot;: &quot;provided with seals&quot; or &quot;provided with furrows&quot;, referring either to populations of seals or inlets from the sea. The suffix has later been reinterpreted as the lexeme &quot;land&quot; &quot;land.
;Present administrative regions of Denmark are:
*Region Hovedstaden – &quot;Capital City Region&quot;
*Region Midtjylland – &quot;Mid Jutland Region&quot;, see above for &quot;Jutland&quot;
*Region Nordjylland – &quot;North Jutland Region&quot;, see above for &quot;Jutland&quot;
*Region Sjælland – &quot;Region Zealand&quot;, see above for &quot;Zealand&quot;
*Region Syddanmark – &quot;Region of Southern Denmark&quot;

==Dominican Republic==
==Estonia==
Note: Estonian &quot;maakond&quot; means &quot;county&quot; and &quot;maa&quot; means &quot;land&quot;. Counties given here without the suffix -&quot;maa&quot; take their names (and etymologies as given here) from their capitals.
*Hiiumaa: from Estonian &quot;hiis&quot; – &quot;holy grove&quot;, or &quot;hiid&quot; – &quot;giant&quot;, meaning &quot;land of holy groves&quot; or &quot;land of giants&quot;.
*Ida-Virumaa: &quot;Eastern Virumaa&quot; – see Virumaa below
*Jõgeva: from Estonian &quot;jõgi&quot; – &quot;river&quot; (Pedja river) and possibly &quot;vahe&quot; – &quot;between&quot; (since the old estate stood on an island in the river), meaning &quot;between rivers&quot;.
*Järvamaa: from Estonian &quot;järv&quot; – &quot;lake&quot;, meaning &quot;land of lakes&quot;.
*Läänemaa: from Estonian &quot;lääne&quot; – &quot;western&quot;, meaning &quot;western land&quot;.
*Lääne-Virumaa: &quot;Western Virumaa&quot; – see Virumaa below
*Petseri: from Russian &quot;peshchera&quot; – &quot;caves&quot;.
*Põlva: from Estonian &quot;põlv&quot; – &quot;knee&quot;. According to a legend, a virgin was once bricked in a church wall on her knees. According to another version, the Tartu-Võru and Kanepi-Räpina roads form a curve, shaped like a knee.
*Pärnu: named after Pärnu river, that drains into the sea at Pärnu
*Saaremaa: from Estonian &quot;saar&quot; – &quot;island&quot;, meaning &quot;island-land&quot;.
*Valga: from German family names &quot;de Walco&quot; and &quot;de Walko&quot;. According to another version, from Old Estonian &quot;valketa&quot; – &quot;white&quot;.
*Virumaa: from several Finnic languages &quot;virukas&quot; – &quot;big&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;, or &quot;vire&quot; &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;penetrating&quot; (for wind), meaning &quot;land of the strong / big&quot; or &quot;land of the sharp / penetrating winds&quot;. (In Finnish, the words for Estonia and Estonians derive from Virumaa – &quot;Viro&quot; and &quot;virolaiset&quot;.)

==Finland==
*Helsinki: The Swedish name ( ) represents the original official name of the city of Helsinki (in the very beginning, in the form &#x27;Hellssingeforss&#x27;). The Finnish language form of the city&#x27;s name probably originates from &#x27;Helsinga&#x27; and similar names used for the river currently known as Vantaanjoki, as documented as early as the 14th century. &quot;Helsinki&quot; (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable: ), refers to the city in all languages except Swedish and Norwegian. &quot;Helsingfors&quot; comes from the name of the surrounding parish, &quot;Helsinge&quot; (source for Finnish &quot;Helsinki&quot;) and the rapids (in Swedish: &quot;fors&quot;), which flowed through the original village. The name &quot;Helsinge&quot; possibly originated with medieval Swedish settlers who came from Hälsingland in Sweden. Another possible derivation looks to the Swedish word &quot;hals&quot; (neck), referring to the narrowest part of the river, i.e. the rapids.
*Ostrobothnia (or in Swedish: &quot;Österbotten&quot;) – &quot;Eastern Bothnia&quot;. Bothnia is a Latinization of Old Norse &quot;botn&quot;, meaning &quot;bottom&quot;. The name &quot;botn&quot; was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as &quot;Helsingjabotn&quot; in Old Norse, after Hälsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, &quot;botten&quot; was applied to the regions Västerbotten on the western side and Österbotten the eastern side (&quot;East Bottom&quot; and &quot;West Bottom&quot;). The Finnish name of Österbotten, &quot;Pohjanmaa&quot;, or &quot;Pohja&quot;-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: &quot;pohja&quot; means both &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;north&quot;.
*Åland – &quot;Waterland&quot;, from the proposed Germanic root &quot;*ahw-&quot;, cognate with Latin &quot;aqua&quot; and meaning &quot;water&quot;. &quot;Ahvenanmaa&quot;, its Finnish name means &quot;Land of Perch&quot; and is partially borrowed, partially folk-etymologized from Germanic.
*Finland Proper: The first part of Finland to be colonised by Swedes, therefore called Finland, later the name Finland was extended to all the country.
*Uusimaa (Swedish: &quot;Nyland&quot;): means &quot;New Land&quot;, reflects the colonisation around the 13th-14th century.
*Lapland: land of the Lappi (the Sami people), same word as Lapland (Sweden)

==France==

===Historic regions===
Most modern French départements take their names from local geographical features: usually rivers, occasionally mountain ranges or coasts. Thus most such names have a self-evident immediate origin. The traditional provinces and regions (of any period) often bear names with richer but more obscure histories.

*Alsace – from Latin &quot;Alsatia&quot;, a Latinised form of the Germanic name that also yields Old High German &quot;El-sasz&quot; (modern German &quot;Elsass&quot;), allegedly meaning &quot;foreign settlement&quot; (according to the OED article on &quot;Alsatia&quot;); or &quot;settlement on the Ill River&quot;
* Artois – from Latin &quot;Atrebatensis&quot;, adjectival form derived the Belgic tribe Atrebates, whose name comes from &quot;*ad-treb-ates&quot;, meaning &#x27;inhabitants&#x27;, based on the Celtic root &quot;treb-&quot; &#x27;building&#x27;, &#x27;home&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;treb&quot; &#x27;building&#x27;, &#x27;farm&#x27;, Welsh &quot;tref&quot; &#x27;building&#x27;, Middle Breton &quot;treff&quot; &#x27;city&#x27;, toponyms in &quot;Tre-&quot;, Provençal &quot;trevar&quot; &#x27;to live in a house or in a village&#x27;). According to Alexander MacBain (d. 1907), the name &quot;Atrebates&quot; parallels the Irish &quot;aitreibh&quot;, &#x27;building,&#x27; Early Irish &quot;aittreb&quot;, &#x27;building,&#x27; and Welsh &quot;adref&quot;, &#x27;homeward&#x27;. McBain states that the Celtic root &quot;treb&quot; corresponds to Latin &quot;tribus&quot;, &#x27;tribe&#x27;, and to English &quot;thorpe&quot;, &#x27;village&#x27;. MacBain reconstructs *&quot;ad-treb&quot;- as the Proto-Celtic form of Early Irish &quot;aittreb&quot;. The name of the main city of Artois, Arras (&quot;Atrecht&quot; in Dutch) derives directly from the tribe&#x27;s name Atrebates, so &quot;Artois&quot; properly means &quot;territory of Arras&quot;.
*Basque Country (, ) – derived from the ancient tribe of the Vascones via the medieval Duchy of Vasconia and a &quot;County of Vasconia&quot;, split from it. The Basque name derives from &quot;Euskara&quot; (the autochthonous name of the Basque language).
**Labourd (&quot;Lapurdi&quot;): from the Roman city of Lapurdum (modern Bayonne).
**Lower Navarre (French: &quot;Basse Navarre&quot;, Basque: &quot;Nafarroa Behera&quot;, &quot;Benafarroa&quot;). From the medieval Kingdom of Navarre, itself of disputed etymology (either Basque &quot;nabar&quot;: &quot;brownish, multicolor&quot;, also &quot;ploughshare&quot;; or Romance &quot;nava&quot;: &quot;river bank&quot;; or Basque &quot;naba&quot; (valley, plain) + &quot;herri&quot; (people, land)). Compare Kingdom of Navarre#Etymology
**Soule: deformation of the original Basque name &quot;Zuberoa&quot; or &quot;Xiberue&quot;
* Brittany (&quot;Bretagne&quot;) – area occupied by refugee Britons from Roman Britain (&quot;Britannia&quot;) &quot;circa&quot; 500 AD
* Burgundy (&quot;Bourgogne&quot;) – part of the land settled by the East Germanic Burgundians, who possibly originated on the island now known as Bornholm. Speakers of Old Norse knew the island as &quot;Borgundarholm&quot;, and in ancient Danish especially the island&#x27;s name appears as &quot;Borghand&quot; or &quot;Borghund&quot;; these names relate to Old Norse &quot;borg&quot; &quot;height&quot; and &quot;bjarg/berg&quot; &quot;mountain, rock&quot;, as the island rises high from the sea. Other names known for the island include &quot;Burgendaland&quot; (9th century), &quot;Hulmo&quot; / &quot;Holmus&quot; (Adam of Bremen), &quot;Burgundehulm&quot; (1145), and &quot;Borghandæholm&quot; (14th century). Alfred the Great uses the form &quot;Burgenda land&quot;. Some scholars believe that the Burgundians take their name from the island of Bornholm; they comprised a Germanic tribe which moved west when the western Roman Empire collapsed, and occupied and named Burgundy in France in the 5th century CE.
*Champagne – from the Latin &quot;campania&quot; (plain, open country, battlefield). Compare &quot;Campania&quot;, below.
*Corsica (&quot;Corse&quot;) – possibly from the Phoenician &quot;Korsai&quot;, which means something like &quot;forest-covered&quot;
*Dauphiné – from the nickname and coat of arms of former ruler Guy VIII of Vienne: &quot;dolphin&quot;
*Franche-Comté – in French, literally the &quot;Free County&quot; of Burgundy (as opposed to the Duchy of Burgundy)
*Gascony (&quot;Gascogne&quot;) – from the Duchy of Vasconia (also &quot;Wasconia&quot;), itself derived from the ancient tribe of the Vascones. In Latin and Romance languages in medieval times, &quot;Vascones&quot; came to apply to all the Basque-speaking peoples.
*Languedoc – the region speaking the &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; (as opposed to the regions whose language (langue d&#x27;oïl) developed into modern French)
*Limousin – from an adjective referring to the local centre, Limoges
*Lorraine – from the Mediaeval Latin coining &quot;Lotharingia&quot;, meaning the lands granted as a kingdom in 855 AD to Lothair, son of the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I
*Maine (province/county), from the Maine River, considered a variant/continuation of the Mayenne River, whose early French name suggests &quot;middle river&quot;
*Normandy (&quot;Normandie&quot;) – land settled by Viking &quot;Northmen&quot; in the early 10th century
*Occitania, from &quot;Occitània&quot; in Occitan. From medieval Latin &quot;Occitania&quot; (approximately since 1290). The first part of the name, &quot;Occ-&quot;, is from Occitan &quot;[lenga d&#x27;]òc&quot; or Italian &quot;[lingua d&#x27;]oc&quot; (i.e. &quot;Language of Òc&quot;), a name given to the Occitan language by Dante according to its way of saying &quot;yes&quot; (&quot;òc&quot;). The ending &quot;-itania&quot; is probably an imitation of the old Latin name &quot;[Aqu]itania&quot;.
*Provence – from Latin &quot;provincia&quot; (province), short for &quot;Provincia Narbonensis&quot;, the Roman province located in present-day southern France.
*Savoy – of unknown origin, but dating to the days of the Kingdom of Burgundy

==Germany==

=== States ===
*Baden-Württemberg: formed by combining the names of the former states of Baden and of Württemberg.
**Baden: after the city of Baden-Baden, formerly &quot;Baden&quot;, the name became reduplicated to distinguish it from the state (as in &quot;Baden in Baden&quot;). The name means &quot;baths&quot;, after the springs in the city.
**Württemberg: after Württemberg Castle, which stood on the Württemberg, a hill in Stuttgart, formerly &quot;Wirtemberg&quot;, further origin uncertain (&quot;-berg&quot; means &quot;mountain&quot;)
*Bavaria (German &quot;Bayern&quot;): the state of Bavaria developed out of the tribe of the Baiuvarii, who probably gained their name from the land of Bohemia
*Brandenburg: after the city of Brandenburg. The earlier Slavic name of the castle (&quot;Burg&quot;) of Brandenburg appears as &quot;Branibor&quot; (Slavic for &quot;Branim&#x27;s forest&quot;, where &quot;bor&quot; means &quot;a dense forest&quot;).
*Hamburg: from the 9th-century name &quot;Hammaburg&quot;, where &quot;Hamma&quot; has multiple conflicting interpretations, but &quot;burg&quot; means &quot;castle&quot;.
*Hesse: after the tribe of the Chatti
*Lower Saxony (German &quot;Niedersachsen&quot;): after the tribe of the Saxons. &quot;Lower Saxony&quot; became differentiated in modern times from the state of Saxony to its southeast. The word &quot;lower&quot; reflects Lower Saxony&#x27;s location in the lowlands of the North German Plain, as opposed to Saxony, which has a higher elevation. See below for etymology of &quot;Saxony&quot;.
*Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (German) &quot;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&quot;): formed geographically by joining Mecklenburg with the western part of Pomerania, also called &quot;Hither Pomerania&quot;.
**Mecklenburg takes its name from Mecklenburg Castle in Dorf Mecklenburg (&quot;Burg&quot; means &quot;castle&quot; in German, the first part means &quot;big&quot;: compare Middle Low German &quot;mekel&quot;, cognate with English &quot;mickle&quot;—&quot;big castle&quot;).
**&quot;Pomerania&quot; (German &quot;Pommern&quot;) comes from Slavic roots meaning &quot;near the sea&quot; (in Slavic languages &quot;more&quot; means &quot;sea&quot;): the standard modern Polish name for the region, &quot;Pomorze&quot;, demonstrates this well.
* North Rhine-Westphalia (German &quot;Nordrhein-Westfalen&quot;)—geographically formed by joining the northern part of the Rhineland (after the River Rhine) with Westphalia.
** The name of the Rhine derives from Gaulish &quot;Renos&quot;, and ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;reie-&quot; (&quot;to move, flow, run&quot;); words like &quot;river&quot; and &quot;run&quot; share the same root. The Reno River in Italy shares the same etymology. The spelling with -h- suggests a borrowing from the Greek form of the name, &quot;Rhenos&quot;, seen also in &quot;rheos&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;, and &quot;rhein&quot;, &quot;to flow&quot;.
** Westphalia formed the westernmost subdivision of the Saxon tribe; the origin of the second part (&quot;-falen&quot; in German) remains unknown
* Rhineland-Palatinate (German &quot;Rheinland-Pfalz&quot;): formed geographically by joining parts of the Rhineland (see above under North Rhine-Westphalia) with the Rhenish Palatinate, formerly a palatine county located near the Rhine, meaning that its count administered a palace of the Holy Roman Emperor.
** The word Palatinate derives from Latin &quot;palatinus&quot; &quot;imperial&quot;, from &quot;palatium&quot; &quot;palace&quot;, after the location of the palace of the Roman Emperor Augustus on the Palatine Hill in Rome
*Saarland: after the Saar River
*Saxony (German &quot;Sachsen&quot;): land of the Saxons (possibly the &quot;sword-folk&quot;). The state of Saxony developed out of the Saxon tribe, which principally inhabited present-day Lower Saxony; during the Middle Ages and early modern times, the name migrated to the current location of the state of Saxony
*Saxony-Anhalt (German, &quot;Sachsen-Anhalt&quot;): formed geographically by joining the Prussian Province of Saxony (see above under Saxony) with Anhalt
**Anhalt takes its name from Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown
*Schleswig-Holstein: created by joining Schleswig and Holstein.
**Schleswig takes its name from the City of Schleswig, which in turn derives its name from the Schlei bay and the Low German word &quot;wig&quot; for &quot;trading place&quot;.
** &quot;Holstein&quot; comes from a Saxon subtribe named, in Latin, Holcetae, whose means &quot;dwellers in the wood&quot; (Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Hol(t)saten&quot;; German: &quot;Holzsassen&quot;).
* Thuringia (German &quot;Thüringen&quot;) – after the tribe of the Thuringii.

===Historic regions===
* Brunswick (German: &quot;Braunschweig&quot;): from the town of Brunswick, possibly originating as &quot;Bruno&#x27;s &quot;wik&quot;&quot; (Bruno&#x27;s marketplace) (with reference to the legendary founder Bruno, Duke of Saxony, died 880, or another Bruno) or as &quot;burnt &quot;wik&quot;&quot;); the High German form &quot;Braunschweig&quot; is an erroneous translation of the original Low German &quot;Brunswick&quot;
* Franconia (German: &quot;Franken&quot;): from the traditional designation &quot;Franks&quot;, referring especially to the Kingdom of the East Franks. The name refers to those areas east of the Rhine that were first occupied by the Franks, as opposed to areas that were held by the Swabians, Bavarians or Saxons.
* Hohenzollern: ultimately from the names of Hohenzollern Castle and its location, Mount Hohenzollern (known locally as &quot;Zoller&quot; or &quot;Zollern&quot;). The lexeme &quot;hoh&quot;/&quot;hohen&quot; in German means &quot;high/height&quot;.
*Oldenburg, after the city of Oldenburg, first recorded in 1108 as the town of &quot;Aldenburg&quot;, subsequently also a county, duchy, grand duchy and republic, meaning &quot;old castle&quot;
*Prussia (German: &quot;Preußen&quot;) – (at times historically connected with Germany or with parts thereof): from the people known as the Prussians, a grouping of western Balt peoples whose collective name (German: &quot;Prussen&quot; or anciently &quot;Pruzzen&quot;) may possibly derive from an Indo-European root meaning &quot;swamp&quot;: see Old Prussians; for political reasons, the electors of Brandenburg decided to name themselves kings of Prussia in the 18th century; in this way, they transferred the name of the remote eastern region to a major German state
* Swabia (German: &quot;Schwaben&quot; or &quot;Schwabenland&quot;): after the tribe of the Suebi whose name may come from Proto-Germanic *&quot;swēbaz&quot; based on the Proto-Germanic root *&quot;swē-&quot; meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot; [people], from an Indo-European root *swe-, the third-person reflexive pronoun.

*Bengkulu: named after the Bengkulu river, which passes through the area of the province. The name of &quot;Bengkulu&quot; itself comes from the Malay word &quot;bangkai&quot; meaning &quot;corpse&quot;, and &quot;hulu&quot; meaning &quot;river-source&quot;—it refers to the story that in the past the area near the source of the river Bengkulu had often served as a battlefield—tribes and clans battled each other on the river banks leaving them full of corpses and blood.
*Gorontalo: from the Dutch version of the local phrase &quot;hulontalo&quot;, meaning &quot;lands surrounded by water&quot; due to the many lakes and rivers formerly in the area
*Irian Jaya: The name &quot;Irian&quot; is said to come from the Biak language. An alternative etymology for &quot;Irian&quot; stems from the acronym &quot;Ikut Republik Indonesia, Anti Nederland&quot; (&quot;Join/Follow the Republic of Indonesia, rejecting The Netherlands) (see the article on the Province of Papua— the official Indonesian and internationally recognized name for &quot;Irian Jaya&quot;). The word &quot;jaya&quot; means &quot;victory&quot; or &quot;glorious&quot; in Indonesian, referring to the Indonesian victory over the colonisers who controlled the area both militarily and diplomatically, a sign of pride as the Indonesians showed themselves capable not only of defending their lands from the Dutch attempt to reestablish colonial rule after World War II, but also of taking over lands not included in the 1945 proclamation or the 1950 reunification, specifically &quot;Irian Jaya&quot; or the province of Papua.
*Jakarta: from the Javanese words &quot;jaya&quot; (meaning &quot;victory&quot;) and &quot;karta&quot; (meaning &quot;glory&quot;), which make up the phrase &quot;victorious &amp; glorious; this refers to the victory of Prince Pati Unus (also known as Fatahillah) of the Demak Sultanate in his campaign to defeat the rival Malacca Sultanate of the Malay Peninsula and Samudera Pasai Sultanate of Aceh region in the mid-16th century. The &quot;glorious victory&quot; also refers to the event of Indonesian Proclamation of Independence on 17 August 1945 which took place in the city.
*Jambi: the province takes its name from the historical Jambi Sultanate which ruled over the area from the 17th to the 19th centuries
*Lampung: From the word &quot;Lambung&quot; in the Old Malay phrase &quot;anjak Lambung&quot;, which means &quot;descended from the heights&quot;. This refers to the ancestral riddle of the Lampung people, who allegedly had ancestors &quot;descended from the heights&quot;. The &quot;heights&quot; reference the southernmost part of the Barisan mountain range that runs through all the western part of the Lampung province.
*Nusa Tenggara: from &quot;Nusa&quot; meaning &quot;islands&quot; (referring to the Lesser Sunda Islands that make up the area) and &quot;tenggara&quot; meaning &quot;south-east&quot; (referring to the position of the area within the country).
*Sumatra: from Ibn Battuta&#x27;s 14th-century pronunciation of the name of the Samudra Kingdom (13th to 15th centuries CE)
*Yogyakarta: From &#x27;Jogja&#x27; and &#x27;Karta&#x27;. Jogja is a Javanised version of a Sanskrit word, &#x27;Ayodhya&#x27;, the prefix A- meaning &#x27;not&#x27; and &#x27;Yodhya&#x27; is synonymous to Hindi &#x27;Yuddha&#x27;, meaning battle, combat, fight, or war. Thus Ayodhya, which later Javanised into Jogja, meant &#x27;The place of no fight&#x27; or in simpler interpretation, peaceful. This may refer to the geographic location of Jogjakarta, being fortified naturally by the Java Sea to the South, the Merapi Mountain to the north, the Gunung Sewu Karst Mountains to the east and Progo River to the west where it would be the perfect fortress of peace, and even more supported as a breeding place of peaceful life with its rich and fertile volcanic land and rivers, sourcing up to the majestic Merapi. The word &#x27;Karta&#x27; means glory, referring to a hope that this city would bring glory to its people.

==Italy==

* Abruzzo: &quot;Aprutium&quot; in medieval Latin (6th century), a name by which the &quot;County of Teramo&quot; was known; in turn, Aprutium perhaps derives from the ancient people of Praetutii, who inhabited the territory in pre-Roman times.
* Aosta Valley (Valle d&#x27;Aosta): From the valley where Aosta rises, which owes its name to its ancient Latin name of &quot;Augusta Pretoria.&quot;
* Apulia (Puglia): From &quot;Apulia&quot;, a toponym used in pre-Roman times to indicate a territory corresponding to the current north-central Apulia. In turn, &quot;Apulia&quot; derived from the indigenous toponym &quot;Japudia&quot; (parallel to the Greek term Ἰαπυγία, then Latinized to lapygia), with a passing from D to L, typical of italic languages or, more precisely, Osco-Sabellic.
* Basilicata: From the Greek &quot;basilikos&quot; (royal, imperial), appeared during the 7th century and used to designate Bizantine Themi governors. &quot;Basilikos&quot; means &quot;King official&quot;, being adjective of &quot;basileus&quot;, &quot;king&quot;; Basilicata is a term referred to the period when the region belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. In ancient times it was also known as &quot;&quot;Lucania&quot;, a term that either originated from the pre-Romani people named Lucani (who took their name from the eponymous hero Lucus or by the Latin term &quot;lucus&quot;&quot;, meaning sacred wood) or by the Greek for wolf: &quot;lykos&quot;. Another supported theory indicates that the term may have originated from the ancient Anatolian people of Lici, which would be established in the area of their original land: &quot;Licia&quot;.
* Calabria: a Roman times toponym at the time referred to the Salentine Peninsula, now part of Apulia, that may be originated from a pre-Indo-European mediterranean root cal-/cala- or calabra/galabra-, meaning &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;calcareous concretion&quot;. 
* Campania: From the homonymous Latin name, coming from the Campanians people, the ethnonym would come from &quot;campus&quot;, &quot;open field, countryside&quot;, since this people was completely dedicated to agriculture; the first meaning of the Region name was the equivalent of &quot;Land of Work&quot;, a name that was given to it for the same reason. Compare &quot;Champagne&quot;, above.
* Emilia-Romagna: Emilia derives from the Via Aemilia, a main trading route, that takes its name from its builder, Marco Emilio Lepido, from the &quot;Aemilia gens.&quot; Romagna derives from Romania (Roman territory).
* Friuli-Venezia Giulia; Friuli derives from Latin Forum Iulii &quot;Forums of Giulio&quot;, name of Cividale del Friuli, in honour of Julius Caesar; Venezia Giulia was instead proposed by Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, to identify all the areas inhabited by Italian people but still in the hands of the Austro-hungarian empire after 1866.
* Lazio: From Latin &quot;Latium&quot;, given to the Region by the Latins (Italic tribe); in turn the toponym may be deriving from the size of their territory, being it wide, flat or large (&quot;latus&quot; in Latin). Ovid hints at perhaps a slightly more sophisticated folk etymology, with a legend of the naming of Latium after Saturn &quot;latente deo&quot; (as a god in hiding) after he allegedly fled to Italy following his expulsion by Jupiter. Modern linguists postulate origins in a Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) root &quot;*stela-&quot; (to spread, extend), expressing the idea of &quot;flat land&quot; (in contrast to the local Sabine high country). But the name may originate from an earlier, non-Indo-European one. See the Online Etymological Dictionary.
* Liguria: From the homonymous Latin toponym, the ancient pre-Romani people of Ligures, in greek Λιγυες, Ligues and in Latin &quot;Ligures&quot;, of uncertain origin, mentioned from the 7th century BC to the 5th century BC.

* Molise: Derives from a toponym registered for the first time during the early Middle Ages, indicating a Normans&#x27; county, like &quot;Castello di Molise&quot; (Molise Castle&quot;), which name may be originated from the Latin &quot;&quot;Molensis&quot;.
* Piedmont: From the expression that alludes to the Region morphology, &quot;at the foot of the mountains&quot;, particularly at the foot of the Western Alps.
* Sardinia: From the Latin &quot;Sardinia&quot; and the name of its ancient inhabitants, Sardi. It is unclear how those populations did define themselves, while it is possible that the etnonym derived from Sherden people.
* Sicily: From the Latin &quot;Sicilia&quot; and the Greek &quot;Sikelia&quot;, by the name of the people who inhabited the island, Sicels, who may had originated from the centre of Italy but moved then to the eastern side of Trinacria. Yet since the 2nd century BC, the Latin term &quot;Siculus&quot; has lost every ethnolinguistic connotation, indicating who is born or lives on the island.
* Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol: Trentino derived from the Latin &quot;Tridentinus&quot;, adjective of &quot;Tridentum&quot;, Trento, identifying the area of its Autonomous province. Alto Adige alludes to the upper course of the river Adige and identifies the area of Bolzano&#x27;s Autonomous province.
* Tuscany: From the medieval Latin &quot;Tuscania&quot;&quot;, having as an adjective &quot;Tuscanus&quot;, from the late Latin &quot;Tuscia&quot;, from the adjective &quot;Tuscus,&quot; plural &quot;Tusci&quot;, in turn from a previous &quot;Truscus&quot;, shortening of &quot;Etruscus&quot;, plural &quot;Etrusci, Etruscan civilization,&quot; the inhabitants of the Region during the pre-Roman times.
* Umbria: From the Latin &quot;Umbria&quot;, from the ancient Umbri people; it&#x27;s unclear the provenance of their etnonym. An hypothesis was proposed by Pliny the Elder in the &quot;Natural History (Pliny)&quot;: &quot;The umbrian population is estimated to be the most ancient of Italy; in facts, we believe that Umbri have been called &quot;Ombrii&quot; by the Greeks, since they may be survived to the rains when their land was flooded by the Flood&quot;. &quot;Ombros&quot; in Greek and &quot;Imbris&quot; in Latin means &quot;rain, downpour&quot;.
* Veneto; From the ancient pre-Roman Adriatic Veneti, also known as &quot;Paleoveneti&quot;, mentioned by some main historical figures like: Julius Caesar, Tacitus and Pliny the Elder; the Indo-European root detected at the origin of this name is &quot;wen&quot;, to love, so Veneti may be the &quot;lovely and friendly ones&quot;.

===Constituent countries===
*Aruba: Uncertain. One etymology derives from Spanish &quot;Oro Hubo&quot; (&quot;there was gold&quot;); another cites the Arawak &quot;oibubai&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;).
*Curaçao: Uncertain. One etymology derives from Portuguese &quot;curaçao&quot; (&quot;healing&quot;); another from Portuguese &quot;coração&quot; (&quot;heart&quot;); another that it is a local endonym.
*Netherlands (): &quot;Lowlands&quot;. See List of country name etymologies#Netherlands.
*Sint Maarten: Southern part of the island of Saint Martin, which was named for Saint Martin of Tours, as it was first sighted by Christopher Columbus on St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November), 1493.

===Provinces===
*Drenthe (Dutch Low Saxon: &quot;Drentie&quot;): first mentioned in a Latin document of 820 as &quot;pago Treanth&quot;. Treanth probably finds its origin in the number three, as the area was then divided in three jurisdictions. 
*Flevoland: from Latin &quot;Lacus Flevo&quot; (Lake Flevo), a name used in Roman sources to refer to a body of water at what would later become known as the Zuiderzee. The Netherlands government established the province in 1986 on lands reclaimed from the Zuiderzee in the 1950s and 1960s.

*Groningen (Gronings: &quot;Grönnen&quot; or &quot;Grunnen&quot;). Named after its capital city. The origin of the city name is uncertain; theories include an original meaning of &quot;people of Groni&quot; (a man&#x27;s name) or &quot;green fields&quot;.
*Limburg: Derived from the castle-fortified town of Limbourg which in turn was derived from &quot;lint&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; and burg &quot;fortress&quot;. See also under Belgium.

===Other names===
*Alkmaar: from &quot;Aelcemaer&quot;, meaning &#x27;lake of auks&#x27;, due to the fact that lakes formerly surrounded the core of Alkmaar—all of them now drained and thus turned into dry land
*Amsterdam: from &quot;Amstelredam&quot;, which means &quot;dam over the Amstel&quot; (the river Amstel flows through present-day Amsterdam)
*Batavia (Germanic): &quot;arable land&quot; (derived from the regional name &quot;Betuwe&quot;, as opposed to the other regional name &quot;Veluwe&quot; meaning &quot;fallow&quot; or &quot;waste&quot; land). Alternatively: the people known as the Batavians (Latin: &quot;Batavi&quot;) inhabited the island of &quot;Betawe&quot; between the Waal and the Rhine. The name of the island probably derives from &quot;batawjō&quot; (&quot;good island&quot;, from Germanic &quot;bat&quot;—&quot;good, excellent&quot; and &quot;awjō&quot;—&quot;island, land near water&quot;), referring to the region&#x27;s fertility.
*Bonaire: Uncertain, but thought to have been originally derived from the Caquetio word &quot;bonay&quot;. Later Dutch and Spanish colonists modified it, first to Bojnaj and finally to its current name of Bonaire (French: &quot;good air&quot;).
*Holland (part of the Netherlands; but the term often refers to the country as a whole): Germanic &quot;holt (i.e. wooded) land&quot; (often incorrectly regarded as meaning &quot;hollow [i.e. marsh] land&quot;)
*Netherlands Antilles, a territory: From their Dutch owners and from a mythical land or island (Antillia), west of Europe, or a combination of two Portuguese words &quot;ante&quot; or &quot;anti&quot; (possibly meaning &quot;opposite&quot; in the sense of &quot;on the opposite side of the world&quot;) and &quot;ilha&quot; (&quot;island&quot;), currently the name for these Caribbean Islands.
*Rotterdam: meaning &#x27;dam over the Rotte&#x27; (the river Rotte flows through present-day Rotterdam)
*Stad en Ommelanden for the province of Groningen, meaning &quot;city and surrounding lands&quot; and referring to the city of Groningen and the medieval Frisian lordships west, north and east of the city.
*Twente (region in the east of the province of Overijssel): from Latin &quot;tvihanti&quot;; or after the Germanic tribe the Tubantii as described by Tacitus; or an early form of the current Twents-language word for a 2-year-old horse: &quot;Tweanter&quot;.

==New Zealand==
===Provinces===
*Auckland: in honour of George Eden, Earl of Auckland, a patron of William Hobson, who founded and named the city of Auckland. The Earl took his sobriquet from Auckland in Durham, United Kingdom, possibly deriving from the Celtic &quot;Alclet&quot; or &quot;Aclet&quot;, or &quot;Cliffs of the Clyde&quot;. Although nowhere near the River Clyde, the locality may have had connections with the Celtic kingdom of Strathclyde; it may have borrowed the name of the Clyde for aesthetic or prestige reasons, as Alclet&#x27;s river—the Gaunless—means &quot;useless&quot; in Old Norse; or a nearby river may have had the name &quot;Clyde&quot;—history does not record the name of the river Gaunless before the Norse named it
*Hawke&#x27;s Bay: in honour of Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke of Towton
*Marlborough: to commemorate John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough
*Nelson: in honour of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson (the Admiral)

== Nigeria ==

=== States ===

* Adamawa: the state occupies most of the territory of the defunct 19th-century Adamawa Emirate, which stretched from northeastern Nigeria to northern Cameroon. The word &quot;Adamawa&quot; derives from the name of the founder of the emirate, Modibbo Adama. The original name for the emirate was Fombina (&quot;southlands&quot; in Fulfulde), named by the founder of the Sokoto Caliphate, Usman dan Fodio. However, it later came to be known as Adamawa, meaning &quot;the people of Adama&quot; in the Hausa language. The suffix -wa is appended in Hausa to signify the collective identity of &#x27;people of&#x27; that place, so, Adamawa means &quot;the people of Adama&quot;.

*Muntenia – from &quot;muntean&quot;=man of the mountains, from Romanian &quot;munte&quot;=mountain
*Oltenia – from the river Olt, called &quot;Alutus&quot; by the Romans, possibly from Latin &quot;lutum&quot;, meaning &quot;mud&quot; or &quot;clay&quot;.
*Transylvania – &quot;beyond the woods&quot;—i.e., from Hungary
**&quot;Ardeal&quot; – possibly a borrowing of the Hungarian name Erdély, like the Romani name &quot;Ardyalo&quot;—speakers of old Hungarian pronounced &quot;Erdély&quot; as &quot;Erdél&quot;. The initial Hungarian &quot;e-&quot; occasionally changes to &quot;a-&quot; in Romanian (compare Hungarian &quot;egres&quot; &quot;gooseberry&quot; and &quot;Egyed&quot;, which became &quot;agriş&quot; and &quot;Adjud&quot; in Romanian). The ending &#x27;-eal&#x27; in Romanian does not suggest a Romanian borrowing from Hungarian. In parallel examples, Hungarian &quot;-ely&quot; becomes &quot;-ei&quot; in Romanian. But when Hungarian adopts a word from Romanian, &quot;a&quot; usually becomes &quot;e&quot;: &quot;Andreas&quot; becomes &quot;Endre&quot;, the Latin &quot;ager&quot; becomes &quot;eger&quot;, etc. Thus the word &quot;Ardeal&quot; could become &quot;Erdély&quot;. The linguist Josep Lad Pic determined that the word &quot;Ardeal&quot; has an Indo-European origin, while the words &quot;Erdely&quot; and &quot;Erdo&quot; do not. The Proto-Indo-European root *arde (&quot;to grow&quot;, &quot;high&quot;) manifests itself in the Old Indian &quot;árdhuka&quot; (&quot;prospering&quot;), and in Latin &quot;arduus&quot; (&quot;high&quot;). In Celtic Gaul, &quot;Arduenna silva&quot; parallels the English &quot;Forest of Arden&quot; and the Ardennes Woods in Belgium. In Romanian, &quot;deal&quot; means &quot;hill&quot; and &quot;ardica&quot; &quot;to grow, high, prosperous&quot;.
*Wallachia – &quot;land of the Romance-speaking people&quot;

==Russia==
*Arkhangelsk Oblast: the region of the city of Arkhangelsk, whose name the inhabitants traditionally associated with a monastery in the area dedicated to the Archangel Michael (Russian: Архангел Михаил or &quot;Arkhangel Mikhail&quot;).
*Chechnya: the Russian ethnonym &quot;Chechen&quot; probably derives from the name of the ancient village of Chechana or Chechen-aul. The village stands on the bank of the Argun River, near Grozny. Another theory derives the name from &quot;chechenit&#x27; sya&quot;, &quot;to talk mincingly&quot;. Vasmer suggests a Kabardian origin: &quot;šešen&quot;. The native term, &quot;Noxçi&quot;, comes from &quot;nexça&quot; (sheep cheese), &quot;nox&quot; (plow) or from the prophet Noah (&quot;Nox&quot; in Chechen).
*Dagestan: the word &quot;Daghestan&quot; or &quot;Daghistan&quot; (; Arabic and ) means &quot;country of mountains&quot;; it derives from the Turkic word &quot;dağ&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain&quot; and the Persian suffix -&quot;stan&quot; meaning &quot;land of&quot;. The spelling &quot;Dagestan&quot; transliterates the Russian name, which lacks the voiced velar fricative.
*Kaliningrad Oblast: from the Russian name &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; (Kalinin-city) of its largest city, renamed in 1946 to commemnorate Mikhail Kalinin
*Kazan (former Imperial Russian governorate): (compare the name of the city of Kazan)

*Novaya Zemlya: Russian for &quot;new land&quot;
*Sakhalin: derived from misinterpretation of a Manchu name &quot;sahaliyan ula angga hada&quot; (peak of the mouth of the Amur River). &quot;Sahaliyan&quot; means &quot;black&quot; in Manchu and refers to the Amur River ( &quot;sahaliyan ula&quot;).
*Siberia: from a Tatar word meaning &quot;sleeping land&quot;
*Smolensk Oblast: from the river Smolnya

==Slovakia==
*Banská Bystrica: The name includes two distinct roots: the adjective &quot;Banská&quot; (from Slovak &quot;baňa&quot;—&quot;mine&quot;) and the name of the local river Bystrica (from Slavic &quot;bystrica&quot;—&quot;a swift stream&quot;). Its name in has the same semantic origin. The name literally means &quot;mining creek&quot;.
*Bratislava: The first written reference comes from the &quot;Annales Iuvavenses&quot;, which calls the locality &quot;Brezalauspurc&quot; (literally: Braslav&#x27;s castle), in relation to the battles between the Bavaria and Hungary, which took place before the walls of Bratislava Castle in 907. The castle got its name either from Predslav, third son of King Svatopluk I or from the local noble Braslav. This former variant reappears as &quot;Braslav&quot; or &quot;Preslava&quot; on coins minted by King István I of Hungary, dating to about the year 1000 and in which appeared the motto &quot;Preslavva Civitas&quot;. At the end of the Middle Ages, the name took its final German form Pressburg: Slovak of &quot;Prešporok&quot; derived from this. Although Pressburg remained the official name until 1919, the Hungarians use and used the name &quot;Pozsony&quot; (attested by the 12th century). &quot;Bozan&quot; could result from a ruling of the Bratislava Castle from the eleventh century. The name &quot;Posonium&quot; Latin derives from Hungarian. In addition to these names, documents of the Renaissance call the city &#x27;Ιστροπόλις&#x27; Istropolis which means &quot;City of the Danube&quot; in Ancient Greek. The current name, &quot;Bratislava&quot;, dates from 1837 when the Slavist scholar Pavel Jozef Šafárik reconstructed a variant of the name, &quot;Břetislaw&quot; a from old names, believing that these derived from the name of the ruler Bretislaus I of Bohemia.
*Košice: The first written mention of the city as &quot;villa Cassa&quot; dates from 1230. The Slovak name of the city comes from the Slavic personal name &quot;Koša&quot; with the patronymic slavic suffix &quot;-ice&quot;. According to other sources the city name probably stems from an ancient Hungarian first name which begins with &quot;Ko&quot; such as Kokos-Kakas, Kolumbán-Kálmán, or Kopov-Kopó. Historically, the city has been known as &quot;Kaschau&quot; in German, &quot;Kassa&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Cassovia&quot; or &quot;Caschovia&quot; in Latin, &quot;Cassovie&quot; in French, &quot;Caşovia&quot; in Romanian, &quot;Кошицы&quot; (&quot;Koshitsy&quot;) in Russian and &quot;Koszyce&quot; in Polish (see here for more names).
* Nitra: The first mention of Nitra dates back to 880 (other variations: 826 as Nitrawa, 880 as Nitra, and in 1111/1113 as Nitra, Nitria). The name of the city derives from the river Nitra. The name originates in the Germanic word &quot;Nitrahwa&quot;: in the Indo-European languages &quot;nid&quot; means &quot;flow&quot; while &quot;ahwa&quot; means &quot;water&quot;.
* Prešov: The city name originates in the Hungarian word &quot;eper&quot; which means &quot;strawberry&quot;. The city&#x27;s historic coat of arms contains strawberries. Historically, the city has been known as &quot;Eperjes&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Eperies&quot; or &quot;Preschau&quot; in German, &quot;Fragopolis&quot; in Greco-Latin, &quot;Preszów&quot; in Polish, &quot;Peryeshis&quot; in Romany, &quot;Пряшев&quot; (&quot;Pryashev&quot;) in Russian and &quot;Пряшів&quot; (&quot;Priashiv&quot;) in Rusyn and Ukrainian.
* Trenčín: Trenčín first appeared under Greek name &quot;Leukaristos &quot;(Λευκαριστος), depicted on the Ptolemy world map around 150 CE. In 179 CE, during the Marcomannic Wars between the Roman Empire and Germanic Quadi, the Romans carved an inscription on the rock under the present-day castle, mentioning the place as &quot;Laugaricio&quot;. (The inscription marks the northernmost known presence of the Romans in Central Europe.) The first written mentions in the Middle Ages date from 1111 (as &quot;Treinchen&quot;) and from 1113 (adjective: &quot;Trenciniensis&quot;). The name became &quot;Trentschin&quot; in later German and &quot;Trencsén&quot; in Hungarian.
*Trnava: The name of the city derives from the Slovak word &quot;tŕnie&quot; (&quot;thornbush&quot;) which characterized the river banks in the region. The Hungarian name &quot;Nagyszombat&quot; (first mentioned in 1238 in the form of &quot;Zumbotel&quot;) originates from the Hungarian word &quot;szombat&quot; (&quot;Saturday&quot;), referring to the weekly market fairs held on Saturdays.

* Natal: &quot;see below at KwaZulu-Natal&quot;.
* Orange Free State: the Free State operated as an independent country (Free State) during most of the 19th century.

** KwaZulu: a bantustan formed in the apartheid era, ostensibly as a &quot;homeland&quot; for the Zulu

**Álava (): of uncertain etymology. Various theories see it deriving from a Roman town called &quot;Alba&quot;, from several prossible Basque etymologies or from Arabs (who only briefly held the province). A chronicle of 905 uses the form &quot;Arba&quot;, but later the word commonly appears as &quot;Alaba&quot; or &quot;Alava&quot;.
**Biscay (, ): variant of &quot;bizkarra&quot; (&quot;shoulder&quot;, &quot;back&quot; or, in this case, &quot;mountain range&quot; in Basque)
**Gipuzkoa (): of unknown etymology. Old documents sometimes use the variant &quot;Ipuscoa&quot;.
*Cantabria: from the Cantabri, a mountain people defeated by the Romans only after a great military effort (Cantabrian Wars, 29 – 19 BC). Celtologists have suggested a derivation from the Celtic root &quot;cant-&quot;, meaning &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;stone&quot;, and from the suffix &quot;-abr&quot;, used frequently in Celtic regions. From this we can deduce that the word &quot;cantabrus&quot; means &quot;dwelling in the mountains&quot;, referring to the rugged terrain of Cantabria. Another suggestion derives &quot;Cantabria&quot; from the Celtic &quot;Kant&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;) and &quot;Iber&quot; (the river Ebro), thus &quot;The Mountains of the Ebro&quot;. Spaniards also call this region &quot;La Montaña&quot; (&quot;The Mountain&quot;), but usually call the Bay of Biscay the Cantabrian Sea.
*Castile: the Spanish/Castilian name &quot;Castilla&quot; reflects the Spanish &quot;castillo&quot; (&quot;castle&quot;) and the Latin &quot;castellum&quot; (&quot;fort&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;) with reference to numerous forts or castles erected by King Alfonso I for the defence of the area
*Catalonia: from the &quot;castlà&quot; (&quot;castellan&quot;) class who governed the nascent feudal Catalonia from their castles in the 11th and 12th centuries. (Compare the etymology of &quot;Castile&quot;.) Other parallel theories exist: Lafont (1986) says &quot;Catalunya&quot; could come from Arabic &quot;Qalat-uniyya&quot; (&quot;Qalat&quot; means &quot;castle&quot; and &quot;-uniyya&quot; operates as a collective suffix) because medieval Catalonia formed a border country with a lot of castles in front of the Muslim and Arabized zone of the Iberic peninsula. Some texts suggest that the name &quot;Catalunya&quot; derives from &quot;Gauta-landia&quot;: land of the Goths, or &quot;Goth-Alania&quot; meaning &quot;Land of the Goths and Alans&quot; through Arabian &quot;*Cotelanuyya&quot; [cf. Andalusia, land of the Vandals], as the Visigoths and Alans invaded and divided Iberia between themselves, agreeing to rule some parts together, with the region of Catalunya going to the Visigoths. Additionally, the Visigothic kingdom of Catalonia may have taken its name from that of the original homeland of the Visigoths, &quot;Gotland&quot;. Coromines suggests an Iberian origin: &quot;Laietani&quot; (latinization of Iberian &quot;laiezken&quot;) &gt; &quot;*laketani&quot; &gt; &quot;laketans&quot; &gt; metathesized as &quot;catelans&quot; &gt; &quot;catalans&quot;, re-inforced by &quot;castellani&quot; (with an epenthetic &quot;s&quot; according to Coromines). Another theory suggests &quot;*kaste-lan&quot; as the Iberian name, later Latinized as &quot;castellani&quot; (an Iberian tribe in northern Catalonia according to Ptolemy); then the name would have evolved into &quot;*catellani&quot; &gt; &quot;*catelans&quot; &gt; &quot;*Catalans&quot;.
*Extremadura: from Medieval Latin &quot;Extrema Dorii&quot; (literally, &quot;extremes of the Douro river&quot;), referring to the territories south of the Douro basin; or from an Old Castilian word used to designate the further territories controlled by the Christians (see Reconquista)
*Galicia: from Latin &quot;Gallaecia&quot;, the name of the province created in Roman Hispania by Diocletian in 298 CE. It derives from &quot;gallicoi&quot; or &quot;callicoi&quot;, (&quot;Galli&quot; or Celts).
*León: the ancient kingdom and subsequent province of León take their name from the city of León, whose name derives from its position as the base of a Roman legion (Latin &quot;legio&quot;)
*Navarre (Spanish: &quot;Navarra&quot;, Basque: &quot;Nafarroa&quot;): from the Kingdom of Navarre. &quot;Navarra&quot; has been argued to have either a Basque or Romance etymology. In the first case it would come from &quot;nabar&quot; (&quot;brownish, multicolor&quot;, also &quot;plowshare&quot;), in the second from &quot;nava&quot; (&quot;river bank&quot;).
* Rioja: speculatively interpreted as &quot;red&quot; from the redness of a prominent soil type in the area.

===Historical Provinces===

Sweden formerly consisted of historical provinces (Swedish: &quot;landskap&quot;), and the province-names still often serve to describe locations in Sweden. Their names often date from before the year 1000. Officially Sweden now subdivides into counties (Swedish: &quot;län&quot;), introduced in 1634.

==United Kingdom==
===Constituent countries===
*England: &quot;Land of the Angles&quot;, from Old English &quot;Englaland&quot;, for the Germanic tribe first attested in 897. The Angles themselves were first attested as the Latin &quot;Anglii&quot; in Tacitus&#x27;s 1st-century &quot;Germania&quot; and the name was extended to cover the other Germans in Britain after the ascension of the Kentish Egbert to the Saxon thrones. Their etymology is uncertain: possible derivations include &quot;Angul&quot; (the Angeln peninsula of eastern Jutland), the &quot;people of the Narrow [Water]&quot; (from the proposed proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ang-&quot;, &quot;narrow&quot;, or &quot;*angh-&quot;, &quot;tight&quot;) in reference to the Angeln&#x27;s Schlei inlet, &quot;people of the meadows&quot; (cf. Old High German &quot;angar&quot;), the god &quot;*Ingwaz&quot;a proposed Proto-Germanic form of Freyr&#x27;s earlier name Yngvi,or the Ingaevones who claimed their descent from him. See Etymology of England.

**&quot;Angelcynn&quot;, a former name: &quot;Folk of the Angles&quot;, from Old English, name used by Alfred the Great.
*Northern Ireland: Northern part of the island of Ireland; see List of country-name etymologies: Ireland for the etymology of the name &quot;Ireland&quot;.
*Scotland: &quot;Land of the Scots&quot;, attested in the 11th-century &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; of Abingdon, Worcester and Laud. &quot;Scot&quot; from Old English &quot;Scottas&quot;, from Late Latin &quot;Scoti&quot; or &quot;Scotti&quot;, of ultimately uncertain origin, but used in Latin to reference Gaels raiding Roman Britain from a region (&quot;Scotia&quot;) in Ireland. and whose colinguists established the realm of Dál Riata in the vicinity of Argyll.
**&quot;Alba&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, or &quot;Albany&quot;, former endonyms: Uncertain etymology, presumed to derive from Albion or its antecedents. See also &quot;Albion&quot; at List of country-name etymologies: United Kingdom.
**&quot;Caledonia&quot;, a former name: &quot;Land of the Caledonii&quot; in Latin, from a Latin name for a local tribe, of uncertain etymology. Possibly related to the Welsh &quot;caled&quot; (&quot;hard&quot;, &quot;tough&quot;).
*Wales: From Proto-Germanic word &quot;Walhaz&quot;, meaning &quot;Romanised foreigner&quot;; through Old English &quot;welisċ&quot;, &quot;wælisċ&quot;, &quot;wylisċ&quot;, meaning &quot;foreigner&quot;, with the more specific &quot;Brytwylisc&quot; referring directly to Brittonic speaking people (literally &quot;British Welsh/Foreigners&quot;); to Modern English &quot;Welsh&quot;. &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius B) glosses Bede&#x27;s Ecclesiastical History, citing &quot;Brytwylsc&quot; as one of the &quot;fif geþeodu&quot;, or &quot;five languages&quot;, of the island of &quot;Brytene&quot;, along with the &quot;Ænglisc, Scottysc, Pihttisc, and Boclæden&quot; (English, Scottish, Pictish, and Latin). The same etymology applies to Cornwall in Britain and to Wallonia in Belgium. See Etymology of Wales.
**&quot;Brythoniaiad&quot;, a former name: &quot;Britons&quot; in Old Welsh. See &quot;Britain&quot; under List of country-name etymologies: United Kingdom. More inclusive than &quot;Cymru&quot;, its use predominated until around the 12th century.

**&quot;Cymru&quot; (endonym): &quot;Land of Compatriots&quot; from Old Welsh &quot;kymry&quot; (&quot;compatriots&quot;), first attested in an encomium to Cadwallon ap Cadfan c. 633, from Brythonic &quot;combrogi&quot;. Its use during the post-Roman era amounted to a self-perception that the Welsh and the &quot;Men of the North&quot; were one people, distinguished from the invaders, Cornishmen and Bretons.

===British Crown Dependencies===
*Jersey: The Norse suffix &quot;-ey&quot; means &quot;island&quot; and is commonly found in the parts of Northern Europe where Norsemen established settlements. (Compare modern Nordic languages: &quot;øy&quot; in Norwegian, &quot;ø/ö&quot; in Danish and Swedish.) The meaning of the first part of the island&#x27;s name is unclear. Among theories are that it derives from Norse &quot;jarth&quot; (&quot;earth&quot;) or &quot;jarl&quot; (&quot;earl&quot;), or perhaps a personal name, Geirr, to give &quot;Geirr&#x27;s Island&quot;. American writer William Safire suggested that the &quot;Jers&quot; in Jersey could be a corruption of &quot;Caesar&quot;.
*Isle of Man: The island&#x27;s name in both English and Manx (&quot;Mannin&quot;) derives from &quot;Manannán mac Lir&quot;, the Brythonic and Gaelic, equivalent to the god Poseidon.

Carteret named the main island &quot;Pitcairn&#x27;s Island&quot; after the man who first saw land: the son of Major Pitcairn of the Marines.

**South Sandwich Islands: Bestowed by British captain James Cook in honor of John Montagu, Earl of Sandwich, who at the time was First Lord of the Admiralty and helped fund Cook&#x27;s voyages. &quot;South&quot; distinguished them from the other Sandwich Islands, now known by their native name Hawaii.
*Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI):
**Turks Islands: for the indigenous Turk&#x27;s-cap cacti (&quot;Melocactus communis&quot;)

<text>The Pyrenean Mountain Dog or is a French breed of livestock guardian dog; in France it is commonly called the Patou. It originates from the eastern or French side of the Pyrenees Mountains that separate France and Spain and is recognised as a separate breed from the Mastín del Pirineo or Pyrenean Mastiff from the Spanish side of the mountains, to which it is closely related.

The Patou is widely used throughout France as a livestock guardian, particularly in the French Alps and the Pyrenees, protecting flocks from predation by wolves and bears. It is known as the Great Pyrenees in the United States, where it is also used to protect flocks from various predators.

== History ==
The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is a traditional breed of the Pyrenees. In France it is usually called the &#x27;Patou&#x27;. It is sometimes claimed that its forebears – and those of the Pyrenean Mastiff – were white livestock guardian dogs brought to the area from Asia in Roman times, and thus that it is related to Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog of Italy and the Kuvasz of Hungary. Genomic data places it within the same genetic clade as the Pharaoh Hound, Cirneco dell&#x27;Etna, and the Ibizan Hound.

In the seventeenth century, Madame de Maintenon and Louis, Dauphin of France, brought a dog of this type to the court of King Louis XIV, where they soon became in great demand, the King even naming it the Royal Dog of France. They came to be used by the French nobility to guard their châteaux, particularly in the south of the country. It is sometimes claimed that French settlers took these dogs with them to Canada and that they are among the forebears of the Newfoundland dog breed. In the 1830s, Pyrenean Mountain Dogs were used as one of the foundation breeds in the creation of the Leonberger.

After the extirpation of wolves from the Pyrenees in the nineteenth century, numbers of the dogs declined and by the beginning of the twentieth century the breed was on the verge of extinction. Local shepherds sold pups to eager tourists and some of these found their way to Britain, where several were registered with The Kennel Club at the beginning of the century; British interest in such a large breed declined during the First World War. The French aristocrat and dog authority Bernard Senac-Lagrange is credited with saving the breed from extinction at the beginning of the twentieth century, touring the mountains to collect the finest specimens available to form a breeding base. In 1923 Senac-Lagrange established a breed club, the Réunion des Amateurs de Chiens Pyrénées, and drew up the first breed standard; he also registered the breed as the Chien de Montagne des Pyrénées with the Société Centrale Canine in the same year. In 1946 the Real Sociedad Canina de España recognised the large white livestock guardian dogs on the western or Spanish side of the Pyrenees as the Mastín del Pirineo or Pyrenean Mastiff, with a slightly different breed standard. The Chien de Montagne des Pyrénées was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1955.

In the early 1930s the Pyrenean Mountain Dog was exported to North America, where it is known as the Great Pyrenees and became a favourite in the show ring in both Canada and the United States. In 1935, the American Kennel Club adopted a new breed standard that had a number of deviations from the French original that would not have been permitted in France. This standard promoted the exaggeration of certain physical features at the expense of functional form, and was later adopted by The Kennel Club of Great Britain. In 2011, to combat the perceived deterioration of show lines of the dog, the British Pyrenean Mountain Dog breed club released a brochure with instructions to show judges not to reward glamorous, heavy-bodied, short-muzzled examples of the breed over lean and muscular examples with weatherproof coats, capable of performing their original role in high mountainous regions.

== Description ==
The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is large and heavily built. According to the breed standard of the Société Centrale Canine, dogs stand from and bitches from . Healthy adults typically weigh between . The head is not overly large in comparison to the body; the muzzle is long, broad and slightly pointed, the lips are not pendulous and the ears are small and triangular and hang flat to the head. The neck is short and strong, the chest broad and moderately deep, and the tail long, hanging low when the dog is at rest but curling over the back when the dog is roused. Unusually, the dewclaws on the hind legs are double; absence of these is considered a disqualifying fault for showing.

The coat is long, thick and double, providing protection from harsh weather; the long flat outer coat is particularly long around the neck, the tail and the backs of the legs, the under coat is fine and thick. The dogs are predominantly white in colour, with patches of black, badger, grey or various shades of tan found mostly on the head; badger is defined as a mixture of brown, black, grey and white hairs and is commonly seen in puppies but usually fades as the dog ages. Purebred examples of the breed with black patches are sometimes seen in litters; such colouration is considered a disqualifying fault for show dogs.

== Use ==
For millennia these dogs were used by shepherds throughout the Pyrenean region to protect their flocks from predation by wolves and bears; in this role they were usually fitted with a heavy iron wolf collar studded with long nails for protection when fighting off wolves. They were often used by shepherds in combination with the much smaller Pyrenean Sheepdog, the former guarding the flocks and the latter herding them. They were also used to smuggle contraband between France and Spain, carrying packs over the Pyrenees on routes impassable to humans to avoid detection by customs officials.
The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is today used in its original role as a livestock guardian for French shepherds in the French Pyrenees and the French Alps, as well as in the United States.

===France===
In the early 1980s farmers in the Massif Central and Lozère were experiencing problems with stray dogs attacking their flocks, so the French ITOVIC commenced an experiment with around 15 Pyrenean Mountain Dogs given to farmers. By the late 1980s the ITOVIC experiment had been completed and an association, APAP, had been formed with around 15 Pyrenean Mountain Dog breeders, with the objective of providing suitable livestock guardian dogs to potential farmers, and by 1991 around 100 dogs were working on farms.

In the early 1990s Italian wolves began to cross from Italy into France, where they have become established in approximately one third of its continental territories, particularly in the French Alps and Provence, but also throughout the Massif Central. Even before the presence of wolves was publicly reported in France, some farmers around the Mercantour National Park had reported unusual stock predation, which was, at the time, attributed by authorities to uncontrolled domestic dogs. Wolves are protected in France; in order to protect the livelihoods of farmers from wolf predation, since the late 1990s, the French government has subsidized various methods of protecting flocks from depredation, including electrified pasture fencing, secured electrified night pens, hiring of additional farm hands, and the purchase, training and upkeep of livestock guardian dogs. After the extirpation of wolves from France in the 1800s, livestock guardian dogs had been absent from the French Alps for over a century; when wolves resettled the country in the 1990s, the French Pyrenean Mountain Dog was the breed selected for use, as the ITOVIC trials had already been conducted with the breed, and within the country, the APAP was breeding Pyrenean Mountain Dogs specifically for the purpose.

In the mid-1990s the French government began importing European brown bears from Slovenia into the Pyrenees, in order to save the species from extirpation from the region by genetic inbreeding, as the local population had been reduced to an estimated six bears. With the increased numbers of bears in the region, local shepherds reported increases of stock losses to bear predation, particularly in the summer months, when shepherds move their flocks into the mountains to graze the summer alpine pastures. To assist the shepherds, government funding was provided to implement the same protection measures as those employed for wolves, and Pyrenean Mountain Dogs were given to farmers in the Pyrenees to guard flocks from predators. Studies conducted in the mid-2000s found shepherds who employed Pyrenean Mountain Dogs across the Pyrenees reported 90% fewer stock losses to predators than shepherds who did not employ the dogs. The re-employment of Pyrenean Mountain Dogs within the Pyrenees has not been without issues, with reports of hikers traversing the mountains being attacked by the livestock guardians protecting their flocks, leading to a bilingual pamphlet being produced to warn walkers and bikers against risky behaviours in order to decrease incidents.

In 2009 there were over 1000 Pyrenean Mountain Dogs being used to protect flocks against wolves in the Alps, and 500 protecting flocks in the Pyrenees. In 2019, French government funding was being provided for the upkeep of 4258 livestock guardian dogs throughout the country, 92% of which were in the French Alps and Provence, although it is estimated the total number of dogs being employed at the time was around 5000.

===United States===
Beginning in the late 1970s, sheep farmers in the United States began employing livestock guardian dogs to protect their flocks from various predators, particularly coyotes and black bears, but also cougars and grizzly bears. Several factors influenced the move to integrate livestock guardian dogs into farming operations, including federal restrictions on the use of poisons to control predator numbers. A 1986 survey of over 400 farmers employing 763 livestock guardian dogs in the United States found 57% of them used Pyrenean Mountain Dogs, with Komondors, Akbashs, Anatolians and Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdogs being employed in fewer numbers.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance data found 58% of Pyrenees died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

The Irish Derby (Irish: Dearbaí na hÉireann) is a Group 1 flat horse race in Ireland open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies. It is run at the Curragh over a distance of 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late June or early July.

It is Ireland&#x27;s equivalent of the Derby Stakes, and it is usually held four weeks after the English race.

==History==
The earliest version of the Irish Derby was an event called the O&#x27;Darby Stakes. This was established in 1817, but it was discontinued after 1824. A subsequent race titled the Curragh Derby was inaugurated in 1848, but this was again short-lived.

The modern Irish Derby was created by the 3rd Earl of Howth, the 3rd Marquess of Drogheda and the 3rd Earl of Charlemont. It was first run in 1866, and it was initially contested over 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 3 yards. It was extended by 9 yards in 1869, and cut to its present distance in 1872. The first Epsom Derby winner to achieve victory in the Irish version was Orby, trained in Ireland by Fred McCabe, in 1907.

The Irish Derby became a major international race in 1962, when its prize money was substantially increased. Joe McGrath, a founder of the Irish Hospitals&#x27; Sweepstake, combined the race with the sweepstake, and it became known as the Irish Sweeps Derby. The event began to regularly attract the winners of the Epsom Derby, and Santa Claus became the second horse to win both races in 1964.

The Irish Derby was sponsored by Budweiser from 1986 to 2007, and it has been backed by Dubai Duty Free since 2008. It is currently staged on the second day of the Curragh&#x27;s three-day Irish Derby Festival meeting.

A total of nineteen horses have now completed the English-Irish Derby double, and the most recent was Auguste Rodin in 2023.

<text>Alf Poier (born 22 February 1967 in Judenburg, Styria) is an Austrian artist and stand-up comedian.

==Biography==
Born in Judenburg in Styria, he started doing cabaret in 1995 in Graz, and has won several prizes for his work, including the in 1998, the , , German Comedy Awards &quot;(Best Newcomer)&quot; in 2000, the Austrian in 2002 and the Austrian in 2009.

In 2003, Poier participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 and secured 6th place with his entry &quot;Weil der Mensch zählt&quot; (Because mankind are the ones who are counting). The song, and his stage act, which included references to different animals, were a parody of the contest&#x27;s excesses.

Although his result was considerably better than most of the pre-contest predictions, Poier spent several hours mischievously telling anyone that would listen that his &#x27;low&#x27; placing was an outrage, that Europe had demonstrably shown itself to have no musical taste, and that he wasn&#x27;t sure if the shame would permit him to return to Austria. This included an appearance on &quot;Liquid Eurovision&quot;, shown on the UK channel BBC Three immediately after the 2003 contest ended, where after saying the above he shouted &quot;I hate this contest! Fuck this contest!&quot;, causing much laughter from the presenters.

In 2005, his bid to represent Austria in the contest for a second time put him in the spotlight for more serious reasons, as some people took offence at the lyrics of one of his songs, &quot;Good Old Europe is Dying&quot;. Having deleted the offending lines, albeit while insisting they had been misinterpreted, Poier took the characteristically &#x27;oddball&#x27; song to the brink of securing the Austrian national selection, only to be &quot;narrowly&quot; beaten by folk band Global Kryner. In the end, he arguably only missed out because, in &quot;Y asi&quot;, Global Kryner had somehow succeeded in crafting a song that is even more colourful than anything Poier has yet attempted, featuring as it does Latin-style music liberally peppered with bouts of yodelling. Nevertheless, Poier was able to - very loudly - claim a moral victory after it emerged that his song had actually garnered the most votes (2nd place with 106.000 for Poier, 1st place with 60.000 for Global Kryner), and had only been thwarted by the regional points system that was used.

Alf Poiers statement after the show:
:&quot;Wer auf dieser Welt Gerechtigkeit fordert ist ein Idiot!
:Wer auf dieser Welt Verständnis fordert ist geistesgestört!
:Ich danke Euch allen im Namen der Wahrheit!
:Alf Poier Platz 2 mit 106.000 Stimmen
:Global Kryner Platz 1 mit 60.000 Stimmen

:Euer geistesgestörter Idiot Alf Poier&quot;

:&quot;Who demands justice in this world is an idiot!&quot;
:&quot;Who demands understanding in this world suffers on mental disorder!&quot;
:&quot;I thank you all in the name of truth!&quot;
:&quot;Alf Poier, 2nd place with 106.000 votes&quot;
:&quot;Global Kryner, 1st place with 60.000 votes&quot;

:&quot;Your mental disordered idiot, Alf Poier&quot;

<text>Borobudur, also transcribed Barabudur (, ), is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in Magelang Regency, near the city of Magelang and the town of Muntilan, in Central Java, Indonesia.

Constructed of gray andesite-like stone, the temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa. The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades. Borobudur has one of the world&#x27;s most extensive collections of Buddhist reliefs.

Built during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple design follows Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous tradition of ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining nirvāṇa. The monument is a shrine to the Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. Evidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 8th century and subsequently abandoned following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam. Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was completed in 1983 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, followed by the monument&#x27;s listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia. Borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage, with Buddhists in Indonesia celebrating Vesak Day at the monument. Among Indonesia&#x27;s tourist attractions, Borobudur is the most-visited monument.

==Etymology==

In Indonesian, ancient temples are referred to as &quot;candi&quot;; thus locals refer to &quot;Borobudur Temple&quot; as &quot;Candi Borobudur&quot;. The term &quot;candi&quot; also loosely describes ancient structures, for example, gates and baths. The origins of name &quot;Borobudur&quot;, is derived from Boro for big and Budur for Buddha. Dutch scholar J. L. Moens says the court poet Mpu Prapanca referred to a holy sanctuary at &quot;Budur&quot; in 1365. Stamford Raffles mentioned &quot;Bóro Bódo&quot; and described the temple in his 1817 book on Javan history. In a footnote, Raffles says, &quot;Bóro is the name of the district, and bódo means ancient.&quot; Most &quot;candi&quot; are named after a nearby village. If it followed Javanese language conventions and was named after the nearby village of &quot;Bore&quot;, the monument should have been named &quot;BudurBoro&quot;. Soekmono says Raffles thought that &quot;Budur&quot; might correspond to the modern Javanese word &quot;Buda&quot; (&quot;ancient&quot;)—i.e., &quot;ancient Boro&quot;. He also suggested that the name might derive from &quot;boro&quot;, meaning &quot;great&quot; or &quot;honorable&quot; and &quot;Budur&quot; for Buddha. However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name (&quot;Budur&quot;) comes from Javanese term &quot;bhudhara&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;).

Another possible etymology by Dutch archaeologist A. J. Bernet Kempers suggests that &quot;Borobudur&quot; is a corrupted simplified local Javanese pronunciation of &quot;Biara Beduhur&quot; written in Sanskrit as &quot;Vihara Buddha Uhr&quot;. The term &quot;Buddha-Uhr&quot; could mean &quot;the city of Buddhas&quot;, while another possible term &quot;Beduhur&quot; is probably an Old Javanese term, still surviving today in Balinese vocabulary, which means &quot;a high place&quot;, constructed from the stem word &quot;dhuhur&quot; or &quot;luhur&quot; (high). This suggests that Borobudur means vihara of Buddha located on a high place or on a hill.

The construction and inauguration of a sacred Buddhist building—possibly a reference to Borobudur—was mentioned in two inscriptions, both discovered in Kedu, Temanggung Regency. The Karangtengah inscription, dated 824, mentioned a sacred building named &quot;Jinalaya&quot; (the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment), inaugurated by Pramodhawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga. The Tri Tepusan inscription, dated 842, is mentioned in the &quot;sima&quot;, the (tax-free) lands awarded by Çrī Kahulunnan (Pramodhawardhani) to ensure the funding and maintenance of a &quot;Kamūlān&quot; called &quot;Bhūmisambhāra&quot;. &quot;Kamūlān&quot; is from the word &quot;mula,&quot; which means &quot;the place of origin&quot;, a sacred building to honor the ancestors, probably those of the Sailendras. Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis suggested that &quot;Bhūmi Sambhāra Bhudhāra&quot;, Sanskrit for a mountain of combined virtues after the ten stages of Boddhisattvahood, was the original name of Borobudur.

==Location==
===The three temples===
Approximately northwest of Yogyakarta and west of Surakarta, Borobudur is located in an elevated area between twin volcanoes, Sundoro-Sumbing and Merbabu-Merapi, and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as Kedu Plain is a Javanese &quot;sacred&quot; place and has been dubbed &quot;the garden of Java&quot; due to its high agricultural fertility.

During the restoration in the early 20th century, discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut, are positioned along a straight line. A ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed, although the exact ritual process is unknown.

===Ancient lake hypothesis===

Speculation about a surrounding lake&#x27;s existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century, and while the idea was explored, experts concluded that a lake was not present or never surrounded the temple. Advancing the lake hypothesis in 1931, Dutch painter W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp thought Borobudur represented a lotus flower floating on a lake in what is now the Kedu Plain. In 2004, others claimed that Borobudur was built above the floor of a dried-out paleolake. Examining samples from excavations in 1974 and 1977, Ganapathi Thanikaimoni could not find any pollen or spores that would indicate vegetation endemic to a water environment; Jacques Dumarçay published this work in 1977, as did Thanikaimoni in 1983. Caesar Voûte and J.J. Nossin made field studies in 1985–86 that confirmed the absence of a lake around Borobudur when it was built.

==History==
===Construction===
Hindu clerics appealed to the people of Java for generations, a fact that architect and author Jacques Dumarçay finds first mentioned in 450 AD. Influence of the Sailendra and Sanjaya dynasties followed. Dumarçay says that de Casparis concluded that Sanjaya and Sailendra shared power in central Java for a century and a half, and that de Casparis traced alternating succession from 732 until 882. During this time many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountains around the Kedu Plain. Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur, were erected around the same period as the Hindu Prambanan temple compound. In 732 AD, King Sanjaya commissioned a Shivalinga sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only east of Borobudur.

There are no known records of construction or the intended purpose of Borobudur. The duration of construction has been estimated by comparison of carved reliefs on the temple&#x27;s hidden foot and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Comparison of an Indian architectural process across temples, and acknowledgment of who was in power, enabled Dumarçay to approximately date the construction of Borobudur in five stages. Loosely, the Sailendra began , and continued stages two and three through to an unremarkable fourth stage during their decline . The Sanjaya completed Borobudur&#x27;s fifth stage .

Construction of Buddhist temples, including Borobudur, at that time was possible because Sanjaya&#x27;s immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 779 AD. This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise. The 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau was much after and was a political battle. There was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement existed in Prambanan.

===Abandonment===

Borobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and jungle growth. The facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery. It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King Mpu Sindok moved the capital of the Mataram Kingdom to the region of East Java after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment, but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment. The monument is mentioned vaguely as late as , in Mpu Prapanca&#x27;s &quot;Nagarakretagama,&quot; written during the Majapahit era and mentioning &quot;the vihara in Budur&quot;.

Raden Soekmono mentioned the assumption of the temple abandonment, which occurred after the population had converted to Islam in the 15th century. The monument was not forgotten completely, and folk stories gradually became superstitious beliefs associated with bad luck and misery, which Soekmono relates. According to the &quot;Babad Tanah Jawi&quot; (or the &quot;History of Java&quot;), the monument was a fatal factor for a rebel who revolted against the king of Mataram in 1709. The insurgent was defeated and sentenced to death. In the &quot;Babad Mataram&quot; (or the &quot;History of the Mataram Kingdom&quot;), the monument was associated with the misfortune of the crown prince of the Yogyakarta Sultanate in 1757. In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, the prince &quot;took such pity on &#x27;the knight who was captured in a cage&#x27; (i.e. the statue in one of the perforated stupas) that he could not help coming to see his &#x27;unfortunate friend. Upon returning to his palace, the prince fell ill and died one day later.

===Rediscovery===

Following its capture, Java was under British administration from 1811 to 1816. Britain&#x27;s representative and governor-general was Stamford Raffles, who took great interest in the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro. He sent , a Dutch engineer who, among other antiquity explorations had uncovered the Sewu complex in 1806–07, to investigate.
In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. Cornelius reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although Raffles mentioned the discovery in only a few sentences in his book, and did not visit the site himself, he has been credited with the monument&#x27;s rediscovery, as the one who had brought it to the world&#x27;s attention.

Christiaan Lodewijk Hartmann, the resident of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius&#x27;s work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa. In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.

The Dutch East Indies government then commissioned Frans Carel Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. Jan Frederik Gerrit Brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund&#x27;s study supplemented by Wilsen&#x27;s drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, Conradus Leemans, who compiled a monograph based on Brumund&#x27;s and Wilsen&#x27;s sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later. The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by the Dutch-Flemish engraver Isidore van Kinsbergen.
In 1882, the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that Borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument. As a result, the government appointed Willem Pieter Groeneveldt, curator of the archaeological collection of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex; his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact.

Borobudur was considered as the source of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.

===Restoration===


Borobudur attracted attention in 1885, when the Dutch engineer , chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, discovered that the temple base enclosed a hidden foot. Photographs made in 1890–1891 revealed reliefs on the hidden foot; the coverings were then replaced. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government to take steps to safeguard the monument. In 1900, a three-member commission formed to plan protection, and in 1902, the commission submitted a threefold proposal. First, collapse could be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, care should be maintained and water discharge should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared up to the first balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. In 1905, the proposal was approved, and the total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders (equivalent to ƒ in ).

The restoration began in 1907, led by , a Dutch army engineer. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, van Erp discovered more things he could do to improve the monument; he submitted another proposal in 1908, which was approved with the additional budget of 34,600 guilders (equivalent to ƒ in ). The restoration was completed in 1911 and at first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the &quot;chattra&quot; (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the &quot;chattra&quot;, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur&#x27;s pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled &quot;chattra&quot; now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.

Due to the limited budget, the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported into the rest of the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.

Small restorations had been performed since then, but not sufficient for complete protection. During World War II and Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, Borobudur restoration efforts were halted. The monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems, which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand, pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls. By 1950s some parts of Borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing. In 1965, Indonesia asked the UNESCO for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at Borobudur and other monuments. In 1968, Soekmono, then head of the Archeological Service of Indonesia, launched his &quot;Save Borobudur&quot; campaign, in an effort to organize a massive restoration project.

In the late 1960s, the Indonesian government had requested from the international community a major renovation to protect the monument. In 1973, a master plan to restore Borobudur was created. Through an &quot;Agreement concerning the Voluntary Contributions to be Given for the Execution of the Project to Preserve Borobudur&quot; (Paris, 29 January 1973), Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, France and Germany agreed to contribute to the restoration. The Indonesian government and UNESCO then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between 1975 and 1982.

In 1975, the actual work began. Over one million stones were dismantled and removed during the restoration, and set aside like pieces of a massive jig-saw puzzle to be individually identified, catalogued, cleaned and treated for preservation. Borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques, including new procedures to battle the microorganisms attacking the stone. The attempt was made to restore the structure as much as possible using reassembled original materials (anastylosis method), with new andesite stone blocks used sparingly to replaces some missing stones, only to ensure structural integrity. The foundation was stabilized, and all 1,460 panels were cleaned. The restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and the improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into the monument. Both impermeable and filter layers were added. This colossal project involved around 600 people to restore the monument and cost a total of US$6,901,243 (equivalent to US$ in ).

After the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a World Heritage Site in 1991. It is listed under Cultural criteria (i) &quot;to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius&quot;, (ii) &quot;to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design&quot;, and (vi) &quot;to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance&quot;.

In December 2017, the idea to reinstall &quot;chattra&quot; on top of Borobudur main stupa&#x27;s &quot;yasthi&quot; has been revisited. However, an expert said a thorough study is needed on restoring the umbrella-shaped pinnacle. By early 2018, the &quot;chattra&quot; restoration has not yet commenced.

===Contemporary events===

====Religious ceremony====

Following the major 1973 renovation funded by UNESCO, Borobudur is once again used as a place of worship and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the full moon in May or June, Buddhists in Indonesia observe Vesak () day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when Siddhārtha Gautama attained the perfect enlightenment to become the Buddha. Waisak is an official national holiday in Indonesia, and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from Mendut to Pawon and ending at Borobudur.

The rituals held in Borobudur including &quot;Pradakshina&quot; or circumabulating Borobudur clockwise while also ascending the stages of Borobudur through the galleries, meditation surrounding Borobudur, and might also include the release of sky lanterns.

====Tourism====
The monument is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia. In 1974, 260,000 tourists visited the monument; 36,000 of them were foreigners. The figure climbed to visitors annually (80% were domestic tourists) in the mid-1990s, before the country&#x27;s economic crisis. Tourism development, however, has been criticized for not including the local community, giving rise to occasional conflicts. In 2003, residents and small businesses around Borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests, objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three-storey mall complex, dubbed &quot;Java World&quot;.

In June 2012, Borobudur was recorded in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s largest Buddhist temple.

====Conservation====

UNESCO identified three specific areas of concern under the present state of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration.

====Rehabilitation====
Borobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately west-southwest of the crater. A layer of ash up to thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of 3–5 November, covering the reliefs and clogging the drainage-system, with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November to clean up the ashfall.

UNESCO donated US$3 million (equivalent to US$ in ) as a part of the costs towards the rehabilitation of Borobudur after Mount Merapi&#x27;s 2010 eruption. More than 55,000 stone blocks comprising the temple&#x27;s structure were dismantled to restore the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after the rain. The restoration was finished in November.

In January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent ten days at the site analyzing the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation. In June, Germany agreed to contribute US$130,000 (equivalent to US$ in ) to UNESCO for the second phase of rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, microbiology, structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.

On 14 February 2014, major tourist attractions in Yogyakarta and Central Java, including Borobudur, Prambanan and Ratu Boko, were closed to visitors, after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of Kelud volcano in East Java, located around 200 kilometers east from Yogyakarta. Workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of Borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with an explosion heard as far away as Yogyakarta.

====Security threats====

On 21 January 1985, nine stupas were badly damaged by nine bombs. In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, Husein Ali Al Habsyie, was sentenced to life imprisonment for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack. Two other members of the Islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.

On 27 May 2006, an earthquake of 6.2 magnitude struck the south coast of Central Java. The event caused severe damage around the region and casualties to the nearby city of Yogyakarta and Prambanan, but Borobudur remained intact.

In August 2014, Indonesian police and security forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of ISIS, citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia. The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of CCTV monitors and the implementation of a night patrol in and around the temple compound. The jihadist group follows a strict interpretation of Islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry.

====Visitor overload problem====

The high volume of visitors ascending the Borobudur&#x27;s narrow stairs, has caused a severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent, that are severely worn out.

To avoid further wear of stairs&#x27; stones, since November 2014, two main sections of Borobudur stairs – the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides – are covered with wooden structures. A similar method has been used in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover.

Due to vandalism and graffiti, access to the temple grounds was temporarily blocked in 2020. Since then, a maximum of 1200 visitors are allowed to enter the temple for one hour a day accompanied by tourist guides. Visitors are expected to wear bamboo slippers.

According to Statistics Indonesia, the number of domestic tourists rose from 422,930 in 2021 to 1.44 million in 2022. The Indonesian government is aiming to increase the number of tourists to 2 million per year.

==Architecture==
The archaeological excavation into Borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on Borobudur&#x27;s hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.

===Design===

Borobudur is built as a single large stupa and, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant tantric Buddhist &quot;mandala&quot;, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind. Some scholars reject the idea that it is a mandala because, in their view, no evidence is present to suggest that the Shailendras were followers of Tantric or Vajrayana Buddhism. Moreover, the Buddhas of the Borobudur do not identify as the Five Tathagatas. The original foundation is a square, approximately on each side. It has nine platforms, of which the lower six are square and the upper three are circular. The upper platform contains seventy-two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa. Each stupa is bell-shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings. Statues of the Buddha sit inside the pierced enclosures.

The design of Borobudur took the form of a step pyramid. Previously, the prehistoric Austronesian megalithic culture in Indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called &quot;punden berundak&quot; as discovered in Pangguyangan site near Cisolok and in Cipari near Kuningan. The construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode of ancestral spirits or hyangs.

The monument&#x27;s three divisions symbolize the three &quot;realms&quot; of Buddhist cosmology, namely &quot;Kamadhatu&quot; (the world of desires), &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; (the world of forms), and finally &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvāṇa. The liberation from the cycle of saṃsāra where the enlightened seeker is no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of sūnyatā, the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self. &quot;Kāmadhātu&quot; is represented by the base, &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; by the five square platforms (the body), and &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; disappear into plain circular platforms in the &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; to represent how the world of forms—where men are still attached with forms and names—changes into the world of the formless.

Congregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage. Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.

In 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered. The &quot;hidden footing&quot; contains reliefs, 160 of which depict narratives describing the world of desires. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved. The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill. There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to &quot;Vastu Shastra&quot;, the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning. Regardless of why it was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.

====Similarities with the Kesaria site====
There are quite a few design similarities between the Borobudur and Kesaria sites. Both sites have mandalas and life like Buddhas facing the sections of the universe. Both sites have hill-like mandala structures filled with Buddhist statues. This hints at the travel of ritualistic texts and ideas between the Pala and Srivijaya domains.

===Building structure===
Approximately of andesite stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries or from the bed of the
Progo River to build the monument. The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar. Knobs, indentations and dovetails were used to form joints between stones. The roof of stupas, niches and arched gateways were constructed in corbelling method. Reliefs were created &quot;in situ&quot; after the building had been completed.

The monument is equipped with a good drainage system to cater to the area&#x27;s high stormwater run-off. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at the corners, each with a unique carved gargoyle in the shape of a giant or makara.

Borobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar to the shape of pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a &quot;stupa&quot;, instead of a temple. A &quot;stupa&quot; is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument&#x27;s design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.

Little is known about Gunadharma, the architect of the complex. His name is recounted from Javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions.

The basic unit of measurement used during construction was the &quot;tala&quot;, defined as the length of a human face from the forehead&#x27;s hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur&#x27;s design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the &quot;tala&quot; have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, as is the case with the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

The main structure can be divided into three components: base, body, and top. The base is in size with walls. The body is composed of five square platforms, each of diminishing height. The first terrace is set back from the edge of the base. Each subsequent terrace is set back , leaving a narrow corridor at each stage. The top consists of three circular platforms, with each stage supporting a row of perforated &quot;stupas&quot;, arranged in concentric circles. There is one main dome at the center, the top of which is the highest point of the monument, above ground level. Stairways at the center of each of the four sides give access to the top, with a number of arched gates overlooked by 32 lion statues. The gates are adorned with Kala&#x27;s head carved on top of each and Makaras projecting from each side. This Kala-Makara motif is commonly found on the gates of Javanese temples. The main entrance is on the eastern side, the location of the first narrative reliefs. Stairways on the slopes of the hill also link the monument to the low-lying plain.

==Reliefs==
Borobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; circular terraces. The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are considered to be among the finest works of art in the Buddhist
world.

The bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also native vernacular architecture. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted spiritual beings in Buddhism such as asuras, gods, bodhisattvas, kinnaras, gandharvas and apsaras. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century Maritime Southeast Asia. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is Borobudur Ship. Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the Samudra Raksa Museum, located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.

Borobudur contains approximately 2,670 individual bas reliefs (1,460 narrative and 1,212 decorative panels), which cover the façades and balustrades. The total relief surface is , and they are distributed at the hidden foot (&quot;Kāmadhātu&quot;) and the five square platforms (&quot;Rupadhatu&quot;).

The narrative reliefs are arranged into 11 series over a length of around the hidden foot and the first four galleries of the monument. The hidden foot contains the first series with 160 narrative panels, and the remaining 10 series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left. Narrative panels on the wall read from right to left, while those on the balustrade read from left to right. This conforms with &quot;pradaksina&quot;, the ritual of circumambulation performed by pilgrims who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the sanctuary to their right.

The hidden foot depicts the workings of karmic law. The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 panels. The upper part depicts the biography of the Buddha, while the lower part of the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the Buddha&#x27;s former lives. The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana&#x27;s further wandering about his search, terminated by his attainment of the Perfect Wisdom.

===The law of karma (Karmavibhanga)===
The 160 hidden panels do not form a continuous story, but each panel provides one complete illustration of cause and effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was disassembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas between 1890 and 1891. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmavibhanga reliefs. Today, only the southeast corner of the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.

===The story of Prince Siddhartha and the birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)===
The story starts with the descent of the Buddha from the Tushita heaven and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath. The relief shows the birth of the Buddha as Prince Siddhartha, son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya of Kapilavastu.

The birth is preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in the heavens and on the earth, to welcome the final incarnation of the bodhisattva. Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth in the shape of a white elephant with six tusks, and penetrated to Queen Maya&#x27;s right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that her son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.

While Queen Maya felt that it was the time to give birth, she went to the Lumbini park near Kapilavastu. She stood under a sal tree (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;), holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha, from her side. The story on the panels continues until the Sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath, his first sermon after his Enlightenment.

===The stories of Buddha&#x27;s previous life (Jataka) and other legendary people (Avadana)===
Jatakas are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddhartha. They are the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates. Avadanas are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.

The first twenty lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the &quot;Sudhanakumaravadana,&quot; or the saintly deeds of Sudhana. The first 135 upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the 34 legends of the &quot;Jatakamala&quot;. The remaining 237 panels depict stories from other sources, as do the lower series and panels in the second gallery. Some jatakas are depicted twice, for example the story of King Sibhi (Rama&#x27;s forefather).

===Sudhana&#x27;s search for the ultimate truth (Gandavyuha)===

Gandavyuha is the story told in the final chapter of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; about the boy Sudhana&#x27;s tireless wandering in search of the Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels. The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of a rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a prologue to the story of the miracles during Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s &quot;samadhi&quot; in the Garden of Jeta at Sravasti.

Sudhana was instructed by Manjusri to meet the monk Megasri, his first spiritual friend and teacher. As his journey continues, Sudhana meets 53 teachers, such as Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the female lay follower Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightenment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the Brahmin Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, King Anala, the god Siva Mahadeva, Queen Maya, Bodhisattva Maitreya and then back to Manjusri. Each spiritual friend gives Sudhana specific teachings, knowledge, and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.

After a second meeting with Manjusri, Sudhana went to the residence of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, depicted in the fourth gallery. The entire series of the fourth gallery is devoted to the teaching of Samantabhadra. The narrative panels finally end with Sudhana&#x27;s achievement of the Supreme Knowledge and the Ultimate Truth.

==Buddha statues==
Apart from the story of the Buddhist cosmology carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas. The cross-legged statues are seated in a lotus position and distributed on the five square platforms (the &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; level), as well as on the top platform (the &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; level).

The Buddha statues are in niches at the &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; level, arranged in rows on the outer sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the &quot;Rupadhatu&quot; level. At the &quot;Arupadhatu&quot; level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated stupas. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas. 

Of the original 504 buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. Since the monument&#x27;s discovery, heads have been acquired by museums (mostly Western) or looted by personal collectors. Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, Musée Guimet in Paris, and The British Museum in London. Germany has in 2014 returned its collection and funded their reattachment and further conservation of the site.

At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, but there is a subtle difference between them in the &quot;mudras,&quot; or the position of the hands. There are five groups of &quot;mudra&quot;: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The buddha statues on the first four balustrades have the first four &quot;mudras&quot;: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding &quot;mudra&quot;. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades have the vitarka mudra and the buddhas inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same dharmachakra mudra. Each &quot;mudra&quot; represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.

Following the order of &quot;Pradakshina&quot; (clockwise circumumbulation) starting from the East, the &quot;mudras&quot; of the Borobudur buddha statues are: 
==Legacy==

The aesthetic and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked the sense of grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodia, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Indonesia&#x27;s first President Sukarno made a point of showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.

Several archaeological artifacts taken from Borobudur or its replica have been displayed in some museums in Indonesia and abroad. Other than Karmawibhangga Museum within Borobudur temple ground, some museums boast to host works of art from Borobudur, such as Indonesian National Museum in Jakarta, Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, British Museum in London, and Thai National Museum in Bangkok. Louvre museum in Paris, Malaysian National Museum in Kuala Lumpur, and Museum of World Religions in New Taipei also displayed the replica of Borobudur. The monument has drawn global attention to the classical Buddhist civilization of ancient Java.

The rediscovery and reconstruction of Borobudur has been hailed by Indonesian Buddhists as the sign of the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, Narada Thera, a missionary monk from Sri Lanka, visited Indonesia for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A Bodhi Tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks. Once a year, thousands of Buddhist from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national Waisak celebration.

The emblem of Central Java province and Magelang Regency bears the image of Borobudur. It has become the symbol of Central Java, and also Indonesia on a wider scale. Borobudur has become the name of several establishments, such as Borobudur University, Borobudur Hotel in Central Jakarta, and several Indonesian restaurants abroad. The monument inspired the architectural designs of two notable five-star hotels in Indonesia: the nearby Amanjiwo (from where the temple can be seen on a clear day), and Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta in Sleman. Borobudur has appeared on Rupiah banknotes and stamps and in numbers of books, publications, documentaries and Indonesian tourism promotion materials. The monument has become one of the main tourism attraction in Indonesia, vital for generating local economy in the region surrounding the temple. The tourism sector of the city of Yogyakarta for example, flourishes partly because of its proximity to Borobudur and Prambanan temples.

===In art and literature===
In her poetical illustration , to an engraving of a painting by W. Purser in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836, Letitia Elizabeth Landon reflects on Borobudur from a Christian perspective.

<text>The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an intergovernmental organisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members who died in the two World Wars. The commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War. The commission was founded by Sir Fabian Ware and constituted through royal charter in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.

The commission, as part of its mandate, is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally. To this end, the war dead are commemorated by a name on a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally, irrespective of military or civil rank, race or creed.

The commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries. Since its inception, the commission has constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries and numerous memorials. The commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide. In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members, the commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves. The commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. The current and first ever Patron of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is King Charles III. The current president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is Anne, Princess Royal.

==History==

===First World War===
At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Fabian Ware, a director of the Rio Tinto Company, found that he was too old, at age 45, to join the British Army. He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman, Viscount Milner, to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross. He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose. In March 1915, with the support of Nevil Macready, Adjutant-General of the British Expeditionary Force, Ware&#x27;s work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission. The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31,000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50,000 registered by May 1916.

When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries. Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government. Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land (under the law of 29 December 1915), grant it in perpetuity, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British. The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions, were accessible by public road, were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages. Similar negotiations began with the Belgian government.

As reports of the grave registration work became public, the commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the commission, with the support of the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate&#x27;s work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.

===Formal establishment===

As the war continued, Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post-war period. Following a suggestion by the British Army, the government appointed the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers&#x27; Graves in January 1916, with Edward, Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president. The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers&#x27; Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries after the war. The government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department.&lt;ref name=&quot;WO 32/9433&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1917, a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves. With the help of Edward, Prince of Wales, Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted. The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter, with the Prince of Wales serving as president, Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice-chairman. The commission&#x27;s undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War. Once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed, the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin. By 1918, some 587,000 graves had been identified and a further 559,000 casualties were registered as having no known grave.

The scale, and associated high number of casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to the First World War, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of a significant percentage of the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.
An article in &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the commission&#x27;s proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled &quot;War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling&#x27;s Survey&quot; was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, &quot;Graves of the Fallen&quot;. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon&#x27;s report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the commission&#x27;s principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles. The 1920 United States Public Law 66-175 ensured American citizens who were killed while in service of a Commonwealth nation were eligible for burial in national cemeteries in the United States However, the commission made no repatriation policy exception for American citizens and attempts to retrieve loved ones from Commonwealth cemeteries were not supported by the American Graves Registration Service.

===First cemeteries and memorials to the missing===

In 1918, three of the most eminent architects of their day, Sir Herbert Baker, Sir Reginald Blomfield, and Sir Edwin Lutyens were appointed as the organization&#x27;s initial Principal Architects. Rudyard Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions.
In 1920, the Commission built three experimental cemeteries at Le Treport, Forceville and Louvencourt, following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report. Of these, the Forceville Communal Cemetery and Extension was agreed to be the most successful. Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting, augmented by Blomfield&#x27;s Cross of Sacrifice and Lutyens&#x27; Stone of Remembrance. After some adjustments, Forceville became the template for the commission&#x27;s building programme. Cost overruns at all three experimental cemeteries necessitated some adjustments. To ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves, to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves, and to limit the height of cemetery walls to .

At the end of 1919, the commission had spent £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the commission had established 1,000 cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the commission was shipping 4,000 headstones a week to France. In many cases, the Commission closed small cemeteries and concentrated the graves into larger ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500 cemeteries had been built, with 400,000 headstones, a thousand Crosses of Sacrifice, and 400 Stones of Remembrance.
The commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave, which amounted to 315,000 in France and Belgium alone. The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front. After resistance from the French committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on French territory, the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials, and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures.

Reginald Blomfield&#x27;s Menin Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker&#x27;s Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial for the forces of India, the Vimy Memorial by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial by Australia, the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940. The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the Memorial Ophthalmic Laboratory at Giza, Egypt—complete with library, and bacteriology and pathology departments—as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps. Its erection was agreed with local political pressure.

===Second World War===
From the start of the Second World War in 1939, the Commission organised grave registration units and, planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War, earmarked land for use as cemeteries. When the war began turning in favour of the Allies, the commission was able to begin restoring its First World War cemeteries and memorials. It also began the task of commemorating the 600,000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War. As with the First World War, casualties were commemorated with uniform memorials and bodies should not be repatriated. Exceptionally, the American Graves Registration were permitted to repatriate the remains of an unknown number of American citizens who were in service of a Commonwealth nation during the Second World War.

In 1949, the Commission completed Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery, the first of 559 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials. Eventually, the Commission erected over 350,000 new headstones, many from Hopton Wood stone. The wider scale of the Second World War, coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries, meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer. In Albania the graves of 52 of the 54 graves of British SOE personnel had been reburied in Tirana before Major McIntosh from the CWGC Florence base was expelled by the new regime. Three-quarters of the original graves had been in &quot;difficult&quot; or remote locations. Following the war, the Commission implemented a five-year horticultural renovation programme which addressed neglect by 1950. Structural repairs, together with the backlog of maintenance tasks from before the war, took a further ten years to complete.

With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the First World War, Winston Churchill agreed to Ware&#x27;s proposal that the commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths. A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission&#x27;s charter on 7 February 1941, empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War, which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour. The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000 civilians. The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended. The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956; it added the final volume to the showcase in 1958.

===Post–Second World War===

Following the Second World War, the Commission recognised that the word &#x27;Imperial&#x27; within its name was no longer appropriate. In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organization changed its name to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960.

More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of the Second World War and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery. During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.

The commission also provides support for war graves outside its traditional mandate. In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the commission&#x27;s assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities for them. Since 2005, the commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War. In 2003, Veterans Affairs Canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility. As of 2011, the commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans&#x27; markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada.

In 2008, an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of Pheasant Wood outside of Fromelles. Two-hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery. This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years, the last such cemeteries having been built after the Second World War.

==Burial sites and memorials==
The commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67,000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War. Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. As a result, the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide. The vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the United Kingdom, however the commission has itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide. The commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave; the largest of these is the Thiepval Memorial.

===Qualifications for inclusion===
The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years, while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service. Death in service included not only those killed in combat but other causes such as those that died in training accidents, air raids and due to disease such as the 1918 flu pandemic. The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War. The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war, while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after VE Day as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice.

Civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service. They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George&#x27;s Chapel in Westminster Abbey. In addition to its mandated duties, the commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.

===Architects and sculptors===

As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium (Baker, Blomfield and Lutyens), there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well. Sir Robert Lorimer was Principal Architect for Italy, Macedonia and Egypt, while Sir John James Burnet was Principal Architect for Palestine and Gallipoli, assisted by Thomas Smith Tait. The Principal Architect for Mesopotamia was Edward Prioleau Warren.

As well as these senior architects, there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs. These architects were younger, and many of them had served in the war. The Assistant Architects were: George Esselmont Gordon Leith, Wilfred Clement Von Berg, Charles Henry Holden (who in 1920 became a Principal Architect), William Harrison Cowlishaw, William Bryce Binnie, George Hartley Goldsmith, Frank Higginson, Arthur James Scott Hutton, Noel Ackroyd Rew, and John Reginald Truelove. Other architects that worked for the commission, or won competitions for the Commission memorials, included George Salway Nicol, Harold Chalton Bradshaw, Verner Owen Rees, Gordon H. Holt, and Henry Philip Cart de Lafontaine.

In January 1944, Edward Maufe was appointed Principal Architect for the UK. Maufe worked extensively for the commission for 25 years until 1969, becoming Chief Architect and also succeeding Kenyon as Artistic Advisor. Together with Maufe, the other Principal Architects appointed during and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington, Louis de Soissons, Philip Hepworth and Colin St Clair Oakes.

Leading sculptors that worked on the memorials and cemeteries after the First World War included Eric Henri Kennington, Charles Thomas Wheeler, Gilbert Ledward, and Charles Sargeant Jagger. Other sculptors, both in the inter-war period and after the Second World War, included William Reid Dick, Ernest Gillick, Basil Gotto, Alfred Turner, Laurence A. Turner, Walter Gilbert, Henry Poole, Vernon Hill, Robert Anning Bell, Ferdinand Victor Blundstone, Joseph Armitage, and Gilbert Bayes.

===Cemetery design===

====Common architectural design features====

Structural design has always played an important part in the commission&#x27;s cemeteries. Apart from a few exceptions, due to local geological conditions, the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world. This makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries. 

A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.

The cemetery grounds are, except in drier climates, grass-covered with a floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises the nature of the war deaths.

====Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance====

Typically, cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice designed by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone Latin cross, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from . A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded on the face of the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.

Cemeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance, designed by Edwin Lutyens with the inscription &quot;Their name liveth for evermore&quot;. The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by Rudyard Kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively. In contrast to the Cross of Sacrifice, the design for the stone deliberately avoided &quot;shapes associated with particular religions&quot;. The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the Parthenon. Each stone is long and high. The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar. The feature was designed using the principle of entasis. The subtle curves in the design, if extended, would form a sphere in diameter.

====Headstones====
Every grave is marked with a headstone. Each headstone contains the national emblem or regimental badge, rank, name, unit, date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives. The headstones use a standard upper case lettering, Headstone Standard Alphabet, designed by MacDonald Gill. Individual graves are arranged, where possible, in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones, the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone. The original headstone dimensions were tall, wide, and thick.

Most headstones are inscribed with a cross, except for those deceased known to be atheist or non-Christian. In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients, the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem. Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because he was too young to serve or was sought by law enforcement; in such cases his primary name is shown along with the notation &quot;served as&quot;. Some American citizens who served with Commonwealth forces during the Second World War have the notation &quot;Of U.S.A.&quot;. Those whose exact burial location within a cemetery is not known will contain the superscript &quot;Buried elsewhere in this Cemetery&quot;, &quot;Known to be buried in this cemetery&quot; or &quot;Believed to be buried in this cemetery&quot;. Many headstones are for unidentified casualties; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body. The epitaph, developed by Rudyard Kipling, that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is &quot;A Soldier of the Great War known unto God&quot;. Some headstones bear the text &quot;believed to be buried in this cemetery&quot; when the grave&#x27;s exact location within the cemetery is not known. In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave. The headstone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date, and even then only if it is known, and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death.
Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone because it was in more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.

====Horticulture====
Commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating floriculture as an integral part of the cemetery design. Originally, the horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting, in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards. Recommendations given by Arthur William Hill, the assistant director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life. Combining structural and horticultural elements were not unfamiliar to the commission&#x27;s architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens furthered his long-standing working relationship with horticulturist Gertrude Jekyll, whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries. Where possible, indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home.

Variety in texture, height and timing of floral display were equally important horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted with a mixture of floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.

The absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs. Lawn paths add to the garden ambience and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain. Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical, dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission&#x27;s horticulturists, as is the case in Iraq. Drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns but also to plants and styles of planting. Similarly, there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates. When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area, like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula, mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base. Elsewhere, larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part-time.

==Organisation==
===Commissioners===
The affairs of the CWGC are overseen by a board of commissioners. The president of the board is HRH Princess Anne, Princess Royal, the chairman is the United Kingdom&#x27;s secretary of State for Defence, John Healey MP, and the vice chairman is Vice Admiral Peter Hudson CB CBE. Claire Horton was appointed Director-General of the CWGC in 2020

The members are: the High Commissioner for New Zealand to the United Kingdom, Phil Goff; the High Commissioner of Australia to the United Kingdom, Stephen Smith; the High Commissioner of the Republic of South Africa to the United Kingdom, Jeremiah Nyamane Mamabolo; the High Commissioner for India to the United Kingdom, Vikram Doraiswami; the High Commissioner for Canada to the United Kingdom, Ralph E. Goodale; Keryn James; Sir Tim Hitchens; Vice Admiral Peter Hudson; Hon Philip Dunne; Dame Diana Johnson; Vasuki Shastry; Dame Judith Mayhew Jonas; Lieutenant General Sir Ben Bathurst; Air Marshal Sir Stuart Atha.

===Functional structure===

The CWGC is headquartered in Maidenhead, England. Offices or agencies that are each responsible for a specific geographical area manage the worldwide affairs of the organisation. They are:

# &quot;United Kingdom and Northern Area - UKNA:&quot; responsible for United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Gibraltar, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia (West) / Ukraine
#&quot;Central and Southern Europe Area - C&amp;SEA:&quot; responsible for Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Malta, North Macedonia Republic, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Greece 
#&quot;France Area - FA:&quot; responsible for France, Switzerland, Monaco, Spain, Portugal, Azores, Madeira
#&quot;Canada, Americas and Pacific Area - CAPA:&quot; responsible for Canada, United States, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Falkland Islands, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Netherlands Antilles, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela, Virgin Islands, British China (including Hong Kong), Fiji, Japan, Philippines, Russia Vladivostok, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand
#&quot;Africa and Asia Area - AAA:&quot; responsible for Armenia, Bangladesh, Botswana, British Indian Ocean Territories, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Congo, Congo (Democratic Republic), Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Swasiland (Eswatini), Ethiopia, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia (including Somaliland), South Africa, Sri Lanka, St Helena and Ascension, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen, Azerbaijan, Israel and Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Bahrain

===Financing===
The CWGC&#x27;s work is funded predominantly by grants from the governments of the six member states. In the fiscal year 2020/21, these grants amounted to £66.1 million of the organisation&#x27;s £74.5 million of income. This equates to an approximate cost of per commemorated war dead. The contribution from each country is proportionate to the number of graves the CWGC maintains on behalf of that country. The percentage of total annual contributions for which each country is responsible is United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and India .

==Ongoing projects and issues==

===Reburials and identifications===

Immediately following the First World War, the British Army remained responsible for the exhumation of remains. The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man exhumation units. Between the Armistice and September 1921, the exhumation units reburied 204,695 bodies. After 1921, no further comprehensive search for bodies was undertaken, and in February 1921 responsibility for the cemeteries was transferred to the commission. Nevertheless, despite the rigour of the searches, bodies continued to be discovered in large numbers. In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38,000 bodies were discovered. In the mid-1920s, 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly.
The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence, with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually. For example, in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion (Winnipeg Grenadiers), CEF were discovered in a backyard in Hallu, France. In April 2013, the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with a metal detector in 2009 were re-interred at H.A.C. Cemetery near Arras, France. In March 2014, the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in Vendin-le-Vieil, France, with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at Loos British Cemetery. When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the commission is notified, and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artefacts that may help identify the individual. The details are then registered and archived at the commission&#x27;s headquarters. Evidence used for identification purposes may include artifacts found with the remains, anthropological data and DNA.

Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically results in the identification of previously buried casualties. The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918, and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date. As of July 2022, the In From The Cold Project has so far identified 7,255 individuals with either unmarked graves or names missing from the Roll of Honour maintained at Westminster Abbey. The majority of the casualties commemorated on the Brookwood 1914–1918 Memorial are servicemen and women identified by the In From The Cold Project as having died while in care of their families and were not commemorated by the Commission at the time.

===Vandalism===
Cemeteries, including those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting that the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.

The vandalism of Commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts. In the 1970s, during the Troubles, Commission cemeteries in Ireland experienced vandalism. Vandals defaced the central memorial of the Étaples Military Cemetery in northern France with anti-British and anti-American graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War. On 9 May 2004, thirty-three headstones were demolished in the Gaza cemetery, which contains 3,691 graves, allegedly in retaliation for the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. On 24 February 2012, during the Libyan Civil War, Islamist militia damaged over 200 headstones in the Benghazi war cemetery, as well as the central memorial.

===Inequalities in commemoration===
In April 2021, a special committee of the CWGC published a report on historical inequalities in commemoration, concerning &quot;failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops&quot; after the First World War. A set of public statements by CWGC and the Special Committee on the issue and the next steps to be taken were published on the CWGC website, and the defence secretary Ben Wallace made an official apology in the House of Commons.

<text>Beatification (from Latin , &quot;blessed&quot; and , &quot;to make&quot;) is a recognition accorded by the Catholic Church of a deceased person&#x27;s entrance into Heaven and capacity to intercede on behalf of individuals who pray in their name. &quot;Beati&quot; is the plural form, referring to those who have undergone the process of beatification; they possess the title of &quot;Blessed&quot; (abbreviation &quot;Bl.&quot;) before their names and are often referred to in English as &quot;a Blessed&quot; or, plurally, &quot;Blesseds&quot;.

It is third stage of the ordinary process of official recognitions for Catholic saints: Servant of God, Venerable, Blessed, Saint, Doctor.

== History ==
Local bishops had the power of beatifying until 1634, when Pope Urban VIII, in the apostolic constitution &quot;Cœlestis Jerusalem&quot; of 6 July, reserved the power of beatifying to the Holy See.

Since the reforms of 1983, as a rule, (for non-martyred Venerables) one miracle must be confirmed to have taken place through the intercession of the person to be beatified. Miracles are almost always unexplainable medical healings, and are scientifically investigated by commissions comprising physicians and theologians.

The requirement of a miracle for beatification is waived in the case of someone whose martyrdom is formally declared by the church.

The feast day for a beatified person is not universal, but is celebrated only by territories, religious institutes, or communities in which the person receives particular veneration. For instance, Kateri Tekakwitha was especially honored in the United States and Canada during her time as Blessed. John Duns Scotus was honored among the Franciscans, in the Archdiocese of Cologne and other places. Similarly, veneration of Chiara Badano is particular to the Focolare movement.

The blessed, elected by popular acclamation (the vox populi) enjoyed only local veneration. While the procedure of canonization was taken in hand from the twelfth century by the papacy in Rome, that of beatification continued on a local scale until the thirteenth century before settling at the Council of Trent, which reserved to the pope the right to say who could be venerated.

== Practices under the popes ==
Pope John Paul II (1978–2005) markedly changed the previous Catholic practice of beatification. By October 2004, he had beatified 1,340 people, more than the sum of all of his predecessors since Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590), who established a beatification procedure similar to that used today.

John Paul II&#x27;s successor, Pope Benedict XVI (2005–2013), personally celebrated the Beatification Mass for his predecessor at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, on the Second Sunday of Easter, or Divine Mercy Sunday, on 1 May 2011, an event that drew more than one million people.

<doc id="233729" wikidata="Q1784430" url="?curid=233729" title="Tijuana Cartel">
<text>The Tijuana Cartel (, ), formerly also known as the Arellano-Félix Cartel (, CAF), is a Mexican drug cartel based in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Founded by the Arellano-Félix family, the cartel once was described as &quot;one of the biggest and most violent criminal groups in Mexico&quot;. However, since the 2006 Sinaloa Cartel incursion into Baja California and the fall of the Arellano-Félix brothers, the Tijuana Cartel has been reduced to a few cells. In 2016, the organization became known as Cartel Tijuana Nueva Generación (New Generation Tijuana Cartel) and began to align itself under the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, along with the Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO) to create an anti-Sinaloa alliance, which the Jalisco New Generation Cartel heads. This alliance has since dwindled as the Tijuana, Jalisco New Generation, and Sinaloa cartels all now battle each other for trafficking influence in the city of Tijuana and the region of Baja California.

==History==
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the founder of the Guadalajara Cartel, was arrested in 1989. While incarcerated, he remained one of Mexico&#x27;s major traffickers, maintaining his organization via mobile phone until he was transferred to a new maximum security prison in the 1990s. At that point, his old organization broke up into three factions: the Tijuana Cartel led by his nephews, the Arellano Félix brothers, the Juarez Cartel, led by Amado Carrillo Fuentes, and the Sinaloa Cartel, run by former lieutenants Héctor Luis Palma Salazar and Joaquín Guzmán Loera, a.k.a. &quot;El Chapo&quot;.

Currently, the majority of Mexico&#x27;s smuggling routes are controlled by three key cartels: Gulf, Sinaloa and Tijuana—though Tijuana is the least powerful. The Tijuana cartel was further weakened in August 2006 when its chief, Javier Arellano Félix, was arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard on a boat off the coast of Baja California. Mexican army troops were sent to Tijuana in January 2007 in an operation to restore order to the border city and root out corrupt police officers, who mostly were cooperating with the Tijuana cartel. As a result of these efforts, the Tijuana cartel is unable to project much power outside of its base in Tijuana. Much of the violence that emerged in 2008 in Tijuana was a result of conflicts within the Tijuana cartel: on one side, the faction led by Teodoro García Simental (a.k.a. &quot;El Teo&quot;) favored kidnappings. The other faction, led by Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano (a.k.a. &quot;El Ingeniero&quot;), focused primarily on drug trafficking. The faction led by Sánchez Arellano demanded the reduction of the kidnappings in Tijuana, but his demands were rejected by García Simental, resulting in high levels of violence. Nonetheless, most of the victims in Tijuana were white-collar entrepreneurs, and the kidnappings were bringing &quot;too much heat on organized crime&quot; and disrupting the criminal enterprises and interests of the cartel.

The Mexican federal government responded by implementing &quot;Operation Tijuana&quot;, a coordination carried out between the Mexican military and the municipal police forces in the area. To put down the violence, InSight Crime states that a pact was probably created between military officials and members of the Sánchez Arellano faction to eliminate Simental&#x27;s group. The U.S. authorities speculated in 2009 that Tijuana&#x27;s former police boss, Julián Leyzaola, had made agreements with Sánchez Arellano to bring relative peace in Tijuana. With the arrest of &quot;El Teo&quot; in January 2010, much of his faction was eliminated from the city of Tijuana; some of its remains went off and joined with the Sinaloa Cartel. But much of the efforts done between 2008 and 2010 in Tijuana would not have been possible without the coordination of local police forces and the Mexican military – and possibly with a cartel truce – to put down the violence.

The relative peace in the city of Tijuana in 2010–2012 has raised speculations of a possible agreement between the Tijuana Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel to maintain peace in the area. According to Mexican and U.S. authorities, most of Tijuana is under the dominance of the Sinaloa cartel, while Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano of the Tijuana cartel remains the &quot;head of that puppet empire&quot;. To be exact, experts told InSight Crime that the peace exists because Joaquín Guzmán Loera wants it that way, and argued that his organization—the Sinaloa Cartel—has become spread too thin with its wars with Los Zetas and the Juárez Cartel and that opening a third war would be inconvenient. The Tijuana cartel, however, has something their rivals do not have: a long-time family with business and political connections throughout the city. InSight Crime believes that this could explain why the Sinaloa cartel has left Sánchez Arellano as the figurehead, since it might be too costly for &quot;El Chapo&quot; financially and politically to make a final push. Moreover, the Tijuana cartel charges a toll (&quot;piso&quot;) on the Sinaloa cartel for trafficking drugs in their territory, which serves as an illustration of the Tijuana cartel&#x27;s continued hegemony as a local group. Despite the series of high-ranking arrests the cartel suffered throughout 2011–2012, its ability to maintain a highly centralized criminal infrastructure shows how difficult it is to uproot cartels who have long-established their presence in a community.

Despite being a shell of what it once was in the early 2000s along with the capture of several top suspected members of the Tijuana Cartel, the group appears to retain significant control in the state of Baja California.

In June 2020, it was reported that the Sinaloa Cartel controlled much of the Tijuana Cartel&#x27;s former territory and that an alliance with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which also resulted in the cartel being rebranded as Tijuana Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Tijuana Nueva Generación), but this alliance disintegrated very quickly when the Jalisco Cartel showed it intended to take the place of the Sinaloa cartel rather than aid in helping the Tijuana Cartel reestablish dominance and independence. As a result, the Tijuana Cartel reversed their branding back to Cartel Arellano Félix and arranged the assassination of Cabo 33 the Jalisco Cartel&#x27;s head of operations in Baja California, after effectively removing the Jalisco Cartel&#x27;s influence in Baja California the Tijuana Cartel has further engaged the Sinaloa Cartel for control of Tijuana plaza and its surrounding areas. With the imminent release of El &quot;Ingeniero&quot; and the current consolidations with in Baja California as well as an alliance with Rafa Caro Quintero and the Sonora plaza its speculated the Tijuana Cartel may again rise and surpass both the Gulf and Juarez Cartel&#x27;s who along with the Sinaloa Cartel are suffering greatly from internal strife.

In November 2020 it was reported emissaries from the Los Chapitos faction of the Sinaloa Cartel had been seen in Tijuana attempting to form an alliance with the now resurgent Tijuana Cartel. Following the defection of El Mayo&#x27;s head of operations in Tijuana and the reintegration of its Cabo San Lucas branch it is evident that the Arellano Félix Organization has retaken control of its Tijuana hotbed from outside influences as well as other important hubs in Baja California leaving Mexicali and Rosarito as the last known Sinaloa Cartel outposts in Baja California though how long they will remain under Sinaloan control is debatable with the rapid defection of Sinaloa Cartel operators in traditionally Arellano Félix territories.
==Organization==
The Arellano Félix family was initially composed of seven brothers and four sisters, who inherited the organization from Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo upon his incarceration in Mexico in 1989 for his complicity in the murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena. The brothers&#x27; death and arrests during the 2000s did impact the Arellano Félix cartel, but they did not dismantle the organization.

The Tijuana Cartel has infiltrated the Mexican law enforcement and judicial systems and is directly involved in street-level trafficking within the United States. This criminal organization is responsible for the transportation, importation, and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine and marijuana, as well as large quantities of heroin and methamphetamine.

The organization has a reputation for extreme violence. Ramón Arellano Félix ordered a hit which resulted in the mass murder of 18 people in Ensenada, Baja California, on September 17, 1998. Ramón was eventually killed in a gun battle with police at Mazatlán in Sinaloa, on February 10, 2002.

The Arellano Félix family has seven brothers:
* Rafael Arellano Félix† (born 24 October 1949) – captured (1993), released (2008), murdered on 18 October 2013
* Benjamín Arellano Félix (born 12 March 1952) – captured on March 9, 2002, extradited on April 29, 2011
* Carlos Arellano Félix (born 20 August 1955) – not currently wanted
* Eduardo Arellano Félix (born 11 October 1956) – captured on October 26, 2008, extradited on August 31, 2012
* Ramón Arellano Félix† (born 31 August 1964) – deceased, shot by police in February 2002
* Luis Fernando Arellano Félix (believed to be born 26 January 1966) – not currently wanted
* Javier Arellano Félix (born 11 December 1969) – captured in August 2006

They also have four sisters, of whom Alicia and Enedina are most active in the cartel&#x27;s affairs.

Eduardo Arellano Félix was captured by the Mexican Army after a shootout in Tijuana on October 26, 2008; he had been the last of the Arellano Félix brothers at large. Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano took over the cartel&#x27;s operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratfor11/11/2008&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; His two top lieutenants were Armando Villareal Heredia and Edgardo Leyva Escandon. Fernando Sánchez Arellano was arrested by Mexican police in June 2014. Leyva remains at large and Villareal was captured in July 2011.

On November 5, 2011, Mexican troops arrested cartel lieutenant Francisco Sillas Rocha, who was reported to be the cartel&#x27;s number two leader, and some of his close associates. Observers argued that Rocha&#x27;s arrest put the Tijuana Cartel &quot;on the ropes&quot;, though some differed on whether or not the arrest put &quot;the final nail in the coffin&quot; for the Tijuana Cartel.

In February 2020, senior cartel operator Octavio Leal Hernández, also known as &quot;Chapito Leal,&quot; was arrested with seven others by Tijuana police for stealing cars from a used-car dealership at gunpoint and possessing marijuana.

==Activities==
The Tijuana cartel is present in at least 15 Mexican states, with important areas of operation in Tijuana, Mexicali, Tecate, and Ensenada in Baja California, in parts of Sinaloa, and in Zacatecas. After the death in 1997 of the Juárez Cartel&#x27;s Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the Tijuana Cartel attempted to gain a foothold in Sonora. The Oaxaca Cartel reportedly joined forces with the Tijuana Cartel in 2003.

Fourteen Mexican drug gang members were killed and eight others were injured in a gun battle in Tijuana near the U.S. border on Saturday, April 26, 2008, that was one of the bloodiest shootouts in the narco-war between the Tijuana Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel. On December 1, 2011, William R. Sherman, acting special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s office in San Diego, announced that the cartel had been annihilated and that the Sinaloa Cartel now controlled a large number of the drug routes the Tijuana Cartel once had. On December 12, 2011, Tijuana Police Chief Alberto Capella Ibarra announced that captured cartel lieutenant Francisco Sillas Rocha had confessed that the Tijuana Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel had formed a truce and that the Tijuana Cartel was seeking to merge with the Sinaloa Cartel. After Benjamin Arellano-Felix pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money on January 4, 2012, it was accepted that the Tijuana Cartel had greatly lost influence. It was also reported that the cartel had lost their former Tijuana hotbed to the Sinaloa Cartel. The clan of the Arellano Felix continues, although diminished after the capture of their leaders.

==Captures and trial==
In October 1997, a retired U.S. Air Force C-130A that was sold to the airline Aeropostal Cargo de México was seized by Mexican federal officials, who alleged that the aircraft had been used to haul drugs for the cartel up from Central and South America, as well as around the Mexican interior. Investigators had linked the airline&#x27;s owner, Jesús Villegas Covallos, to Ramón Arellano Félix.

On August 14, 2006, Francisco Javier Arellano Félix was apprehended by the United States Coast Guard off the coast of Baja California Sur. On November 5, 2007, Francisco was sentenced to life in prison, at ADX Florence, after pleading guilty in September 2007 to running a criminal enterprise and laundering money. It was later reduced to years in 2015 and he will be released soon.

Benjamin Arellano Felix, who was arrested on March 9, 2002, by the Mexican Army in the state of Puebla, was extradited to the United States on April 29, 2011, to face charges of trafficking cocaine into California. He later pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, and was sentenced to 25 years in jail on April 2, 2012. Once that is served, he will be sent back to Mexico to finish another 22 years for a conviction there.

On August 31, 2012, Eduardo Arellano Felix was extradited to the United States to face trial for racketeering, money laundering and narcotics trafficking charges in the Southern District of California. He pleaded guilty to money laundering and is serving 15 years.

On July 13, 2023, a nearly 20 year investigation against dozens of Tijuana Cartel defendants concluded when former cartel hitman Juan Francisco Sillas Rocha pled guilty to three charges, including conspiracy to commit murder, in a U.S. federal court in Fargo, North Dakota.

==Los Palillos==
Los Palillos (&quot;The Toothpicks&quot;) was a group operating within Tijuana Cartel, who worked as the armed wing of the Tijuana Cartel in the United States, for the control of the criminal activities in California and Nevada.

They were a criminal organization that operated from San Diego to Los Angeles and other California and Nevada cities. To avoid constant confrontations with the police and police interest reducing his wealth, Ramon Arellano Felix began bribing almost any official possible. Felix received money from members of the criminal group and local criminals to &quot;kick up&quot; money from their illegal activities such as kidnapping and contract killing take half of the money and give it to the Tijuana Cartel to launder it. That was way the Arellano Felix brothers operation included other clans in Tijuana, San Diego and Los Angeles.

==Presence in Colombia==
The Tijuana Cartel is believed to have ties with FARC, a Colombia guerrilla group that also has ties with other Mexican drug cartels. In the 1990s, the Tijuana Cartel decided to expand their market opportunities in Colombia, exchanging drugs for weapons. In the 1990s they formed an alliance with the Cali Cartel and Norte del Valle Cartel for the cocaine business.

== United States Involvement ==
The Arellano-Felix Organization, also known as &quot;The Tijuana Cartel,&quot; located in Tijuana, Mexico attested great influence and impact on the United States in its prime era of operation. So strongly, that Mexican authority proves not enough to control the infiltration of the American people. Its decentralized location in Mexico and proximity to the United States border allowed the Arellano-Felix brothers easy routes to control the illicit drug markets in Tijuana and southern California. The infamous drug cartel led by the Arellano-Felix family spent years transporting, importing, and distributing cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin into the United States.  In its most successful era of drug distribution, the Arellano-Felix Organization was solely responsible for a significant portion of the cocaine distribution to the United States. The impacts on the United States population were deemed so significant that Members of Congress proposed further changes to migrant policies in border cities like Tijuana. The Congressional Research Service identified the Tijuana Cartel as one of the four dominant drug trafficking organizations in 2020. The impact on the United States was so significant that heavy involvement by the American government was required. Action by the Mexican Authority alone could not maintain the needed control. Control was difficult as the Arellano-Felix Organization focused on strategic coordination, protection, and security. Their protection strategy and preparations have been described as &quot;paramilitary in nature&quot; by Mexican enforcement officials. International connections as well as internal communication centers provide the Tijuana Cartel with strong surveillance and awareness of government infiltration and plans. With such sophisticated precautionary measures, the Arellano-Felix brothers proved difficult to counter. American strategy included instituting a Joint Task Force in southern California. This task force included sectors of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. By 2008, the United States was able to capture the last of the five influential Arellano-Felix brothers. The story does not end here. Although one cartel was weakened, simple economics demonstrate how the illicit drug market and organized crime continues to prosper despite cartels coming and going. The downfall and desizing of one cartel, like the Tijuana Cartel, provides the opportunity for another to retake territory and expand their business. In this case, the Sinaloa Cartel outweighed the falling Arellano-Felix Organization and gained control of the Tijuana/ San Diego route. While the United States proved successful in minimizing and fighting the Arellano-Felix Organization, the effectiveness on combating the war on drugs also proved successful.

==Current status and new generation==
The Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano new generation organization of the cartel is believed to be one of the newest leaders in it to begin shipping cocaine from Colombia, particularly from Los Rastrojos and other Colombian dealers. The cartel was involved in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana in the Baja California area. Operating out of Tijuana, the cartel is now believed to make other activities such as kidnapping, people smuggling and bribery from a network of cells of local members within the Tijuana border region where the drugs are stored prior to shipment. The Tijuana Cartel has lost power but is growing more alliances in foreign countries.

== In popular culture ==

There are several Mexican-folk (&quot;norteño&quot;) ballads (&quot;narco-corridos&quot;) that narrate the Tijuana cartel exploits.

A fictional &quot;Tijuana cartel&quot; headed by a character named Obregon was featured battling a fictional &quot;Juarez cartel&quot; in the 2000 motion picture &quot;Traffic&quot;.

The cartel was portrayed as the Avendanos brothers in Univision&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;El Chapo&quot;.

The cartel and its origins have also been portrayed in the Netflix series &quot;&quot;.

<text>Ernest Charles Manning (September 20, 1908 – February 19, 1996) was a Canadian politician and the eighth premier of Alberta between 1943 and 1968 for the Social Credit Party of Alberta. He served longer than any other premier in the province&#x27;s history and was the second longest-serving provincial premier in Canadian history (after George Henry Murray of Nova Scotia).

Manning&#x27;s 25 consecutive years as premier were defined by strong social conservatism and fiscal conservatism. He was also the only member of the Social Credit Party of Canada to sit in the Senate and, with the party shut out of the House of Commons in 1980, was its last representative in Parliament when he retired from the Senate in 1983.

Manning&#x27;s son, Preston Manning, was the founder and leader of the Reform Party of Canada who served as the federal leader of the Official Opposition from 1997 to 2000.

==Early life and career==

Manning was born in Carnduff, Saskatchewan, in 1908 to George Henry Manning (1872–1956) and Elizabeth Mara Dixon (1870–1949). George had immigrated from England in 1900 and was followed by his fiancé in 1903. Their Carnduff homestead being inadequate, they moved to a new one in Rosetown, Saskatchewan, in 1909. In his childhood, Ernest was not especially religious and only occasionally attended a Methodist church in town.

Manning was among the first students of William Aberhart&#x27;s Calgary Prophetic Bible Institute (CPBI), which opened in 1927, and became its first graduate in April 1930, having heard of it over a radio broadcast. There he met his future wife, Muriel Preston, who was the institute&#x27;s pianist and later served as the National Bible Hour&#x27;s musical coordinator. As a student, Manning soon caught the attention of Aberhart and quickly became his assistant at CPBI. &quot;During his second and third years at the institute, Manning lived in the Aberhart home. After graduation, the Aberhart devotee became a teacher at the institute and played a role in the management of the organization&#x27;s business affairs.&quot; In 1930, he began preaching on Aberhart&#x27;s weekly &quot;Back to the Bible Hour&quot; radio program, a practice that he continued throughout his life, even after he had entered politics. The broadcasts were eventually aired on over 90 radio stations across Canada from Halifax to Vancouver and had a large listening audience.

In 1935, Manning went into the realm of provincial politics as Aberhart&#x27;s right-hand man. Together, they created the Social Credit Party with the aim of bringing financial relief to Albertans, who were suffering because of the Great Depression.

==Early provincial political career==

&quot;Manning followed Aberhart into politics, becoming a key Social Credit organizer, and platform speaker before the 1935 election.&quot; In the 1935 provincial election, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Social Credit MLA from Calgary. The Socreds won an unexpected landslide victory in that election by winning 56 of the 62 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The United Farmers of Alberta, which had governed the province for fourteen years, lost every one of its seats and would never return to the legislature. Manning was named to the provincial cabinet at just 26 years old, becoming Alberta&#x27;s provincial secretary and minister of trade and industry. Manning devoted himself wholly to his work, to such an extent that his health began to suffer. He eventually developed a bout of tuberculosis in November 1936, returning to work after just three month&#x27;s convalescence. At the 1940 election, he switched seats and was elected from Edmonton, where he would remain for the rest of his political career. In 1943, he became Socred leader.

At the outbreak of World War II, Manning joined the Edmonton Regiment of the Non-Permanent Active Militia, qualifying as a lieutenant. In 1943, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He had to discontinue his military duties when he was appointed Premier of Alberta.

==Premier of Alberta==
&quot;Manning&#x27;s take-over of the premiership at Aberhart&#x27;s sudden death in May 1943 was a foregone conclusion. He had been Aberhart&#x27;s religious protege and his closest associate in cabinet. He was regarded by Aberhart, who had two daughters, almost as a son.&quot; Manning twice honoured Aberhart&#x27;s 1935 promise to issue a Prosperity Certificate to Albertans. In 1957, his government announced a $20 Alberta Oil Royalty Dividend and issued a $17 dividend the next year. The policy was widely criticized, and the next year, Manning agreed to use oil royalties on public works and social programs instead.

In 1935, Manning had famously entered the Alberta Cabinet as Provincial Secretary at only 26 years old. He was the youngest cabinet minister in all of British parliamentary history since William Pitt the Younger, who had served as the prime minister of Great Britain 152 years earlier. When he became premier at the age of 35, he was the youngest first minister since Pitt. Besides serving as premier, he also held numerous other positions including Provincial Treasurer from 1944 to 1954, Minister of Mines and Minerals from 1952 to 1962, minister of trade and industry, attorney general from 1955 to 1968, and president of the executive council.

Under Manning, Alberta became a virtual one-party province. He led Social Credit to an incredible seven consecutive election victories between 1944 and 1967, usually with more than 50% of the popular vote, and only once had to face more than 10 opposition MLAs. The height of his popularity came in 1963, when the Socreds campaigned under the slogan &quot;63 in &#x27;63,&quot; a clean sweep of the then 63-seat legislature. They fell short of that goal, but still reduced the opposition to only three MLAs, two Liberals and one running with the support of both the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives, in total. It is still the biggest majority government, in terms of percentage of seats won, in Alberta&#x27;s history. Social Credit&#x27;s electoral success was based in part on what was viewed as its good government of the province. Manning himself always held the view that &quot;both God and the people had some say in how long he would be premier — and he was not about to argue with either.&quot;

However, an ominous sign came during Manning&#x27;s last victory, when the once-moribund Progressive Conservatives, led by Peter Lougheed won six seats, mostly in Calgary and Edmonton. More seriously, the PCs did well enough across the rest of the province to hold Social Credit to 45 percent of the vote, its lowest vote share since 1940. Manning retired in 1968, and Social Credit was knocked out of office three years later. It has never come within sight of power again. By the time Manning left the legislature, only he, Alfred Hooke, and William Tomyn were left from the original 1935 caucus. Of that trio, Hooke was the only MLA to see the government right through from its beginning to its very end in 1971 (Tomyn served a break from 1952 to 1959).

===Social Credit policy===
Under Manning, the party largely abandoned social credit theories. He had been a devoutly loyal supporter of Aberhart from the very beginning and so it is not clear why he was so willing to abandon his party&#x27;s traditional ideology. One likely explanation may have been pragmatic; many of Social Credit&#x27;s policy goals infringed on responsibilities reserved to the federal government under the British North America Act. Manning, however, honoured Aberhart&#x27;s 1935 promise to issue a Prosperity Certificate to Albertans twice. In 1957, his government announced a $20 Alberta Oil Royalty Dividend and issued a $17 dividend the next year. The policy was widely criticized, and the next year, Manning agreed to use oil royalties on public works and social programs instead.

===Development of oil sands===

In 1945 the Abasand plant again burned down; this time, it was not rebuilt. The huge discoveries of conventional oil at Leduc and Redwater cast even more doubt upon the development of the oil sands because of the difficulty in accessing and processing the bitumen and the numerous technical problems. Manning, however, was not dissuaded since he was convinced that the oil sands would grant the province incredible wealth. He even went so far as to convince the entire Alberta Legislature to visit the Bitumount plant in 1949 since he believed that they would agree to continue development after it had witnessed the success in separating the oil sands. Manning also commissioned a petroleum engineer by the name of Sidney Robert Blair to prepare a report on the economic feasibility of the separation process. With Pew&#x27;s support, Sun Oil&#x27;s majority-owned subsidiary, Great Canadian Oil Sands (GCOS), filed an application for a commercial oil sands project in Canada in 1962, the first-ever constructed.

At the opening ceremonies for the Great Canadian Oil Sands plant, Pew repeated Manning&#x27;s belief of the need for the oil sands. Telling his audience, &quot;No nation can long be secure in this atomic age unless it be amply supplied with petroleum... It is the considered opinion of our group that if the North American continent is to produce the oil to meet its requirements in the years ahead, oil from the Athabasca area must of necessity play an important role.&quot;

===Adopton of Albertan flag===

Around the time of the upcoming centennial celebration of Canadian Confederation, petitions were submitted in November 1966 to Manning by the Social Credit Women&#x27;s Auxiliaries of the Alberta Social Credit League to give Alberta its own unique flag. The flag was designed and approved as the official provincial flag by the Alberta legislature on June 1, 1968.

===Social conservatism and faith===
Manning&#x27;s deep Christian faith gave him a sense of charity to the poor and needy, but unlike the longtime premier of neighbouring Saskatchewan, Tommy Douglas, Manning was an outspoken critic of government involvement in society. Manning remained a staunch anti-communist, and encouraged strong religious, individual, and corporate initiatives in addressing and solving social issues. Manning believed that the &quot;government was there to motivate and give direction, not to intervene and carry the load.&quot;

His views on health care and social issues were heavily shaped by his elder son, Keith, who suffered from cerebral palsy. &quot;He and his wife Muriel lovingly raised. Keith had suffered oxygen deprivation at birth.&quot; Manning improved health services in his province but opposed universal public health insurance. Alberta only signed on to the national medicare system after Manning&#x27;s retirement as premier.

Mannings&#x27;s faith also heavily influenced his approach to politics. He was always prudent and careful in practicing politics by &quot;always practicing Christian-based reconciliation and conflict resolution.&quot;

===Anticommunism===
For the 1944 election, Manning campaigned on the labour protections that the party had implemented and used support from the Alberta Federation of Labour to fend off left-wing challenges from the socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour-Progressive Party. Though other unions, particularly those affiliated with the Canadian Congress of Labour, took issue with the Social Credit Party&#x27;s workers&#x27; protections, divisions within the unions and their leadership prevented any effective endorsement of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. 
During the campaign, Manning likened the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation to &quot;the socialism of Germany.&quot; Saying in one &quot;letter to a CCFer, who... had naively written to suggest CCF-Social Credit electoral co-operation: &#x27;it&#x27;s an insult to suggest to the Canadian people who are sacrificing their sons to remove the curse which the socialism of Germany has brought in the world that their own social and economical security can be attained only by introducing some form of socialism in Canada. the premise embodied in your proposed resolution, namely, that there is such a thing as democratic socialism, contradicts itself in that it attempts to associate two concepts of life which are diametrically opposed and opposite.&#x27;&quot; He also said that socialists were trying to &quot;enslave the ordinary people of the world, whose only real salvation lay in the issuance of Social Credit.&quot;

Manning argued the media and education system was sympathetic to the communist cause. He stated that it is &quot;evident, in my view, in the news media, which are very heavily slanted, as a general rule favorably slanted, to socialist philosophy. This isn&#x27;t by chance, it&#x27;s because communism has been smart enough to see... that there are always a goodly number of men in that field who are sympathetic to the socialistic and even communistic philosophy. You even have the same thing, to varying degrees, in the field of education. It isn&#x27;t by chance that you find these agitations of Marxism and so forth in many of our universities. It isn&#x27;t by chance.&quot;

The Manning administration, now re-elected with a resounding majority of seats as a result of the 1944 election, devoted itself to an antisocialist crusade. 
In 1946, Manning&#x27;s government extended censorship to included 16mm films in the hopes of &quot;eliminating communist thought from Alberta-shown movies.&quot;

In January 1948, a coal miners&#x27; strike broke out, with thousands of miners threatening the provincial electrical grid since most electricity was generated from coal. That strike alone accounted for 30% of all of the time that was lost to strikes in Canada in 1948. In Alberta, the time lost was even worse since it was responsible for well over 99% of all of the time lost by strikes for the entire year.
Manning acted swiftly to avert the crisis by rewriting the province&#x27;s labour laws in March to allow the government to shut down the strike. Labour was greatly weakened by the charges of communism, and Manning&#x27;s stalwart defiance of union threats caused the unions to attempt to persuade legislators, instead of protesting using strikes or violence, and halted the rise of militant unionism in Alberta.

==Federal politics==
Manning also used his strong provincial standing to influence the federal Socreds. He told the 1961 federal leadership convention that Alberta would never accept francophone Catholic Réal Caouette of Quebec as the party&#x27;s leader even though Caouette led the party&#x27;s strongest branch east of Manitoba. Robert N. Thompson of Alberta won the election, but Manning&#x27;s objections to Caouette led to suspicions that the vote was fixed. Indeed, Caouette later claimed that he had enough support to win, but all of the Quebec delegates voted for Thompson after Manning told him, &quot;Tell your people to vote for Thompson because the West will never accept a Roman Catholic French Canadian leader.&quot; By then, however, all but four members of the Social Credit federal caucus came from Quebec. In 1963, virtually all of the Socred MPs from Quebec followed Caouette into the Ralliement des créditistes and left behind a Social Credit rump in English Canada.

&quot;In 1967, Manning&#x27;s book Political Realignment: A Challenge to Thoughtful Canadians was published. This book is an outline of his views regarding the reorganization of the Canadian federal party system.&quot;

==Senate and death==
After retirement from provincial politics in 1968, Manning established his own consulting firm, Manning Consultants Limited, with his son Preston. In 1970, Ernest was appointed to the Senate, the only Socred ever to serve in that body. The same year, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He retired from the Senate in 1983 since he had reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. He died in Calgary in 1996.

==Personal life==
In 1936, Manning married Muriel Aileen Preston, the pianist at the Prophetic Bible Institute. They had two sons.

Their first son, William Keith, commonly called Keith, was born on May 2, 1939. Keith suffered from cerebral palsy. For stretches of time, he lived at a hospital in upstate New York, the Red Deer School Hospital, and a nursing home in Edmonton. He married fellow nursing home resident Marilyn Brownell, and died from cardiac arrest on June 29, 1986.

Their second son, Ernest Preston, commonly called Preston, was born on June 10, 1942. Preston went on to found the Reform Party of Canada, and was leader of the Official Opposition in parliament from 1997 to 2000.
==Legacy==
Manning was appointed as the first member of Alberta Order of Excellence on September 23, 1981. Manning was also invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada by Governor-General Michener in 1970.

A high school and a business park road in Calgary, a freeway road in Edmonton and town in Northern Alberta are named after Ernest Manning. A person with a similar name, Ernest Callaway Manning, is the namesake of E. C. Manning Provincial Park in British Columbia.

In 1980, the Ernest C. Manning Awards Foundation was created, and the Manning Innovation Awards were started in 1982, with the purpose of promoting and honouring Canadian innovation.

In 2013, the federal riding of Edmonton Manning was established in Manning&#x27;s name.

<text>William Aberhart (December 30, 1878 – May 23, 1943), also known as &quot;Bible Bill&quot; for his radio sermons about the Bible, was a Canadian politician and the seventh premier of Alberta from 1935 to his death in 1943. He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan $25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses.

During his premiership, Aberhart campaigned for and instituted several anti-poverty and debt relief programs, and other governmental reforms, such as consolidation of Alberta&#x27;s numerous small school districts into centralized school divisions, and natural resources conservation. His attempts at banking reform met with less success, facing strong opposition from the federal government, the courts, privately owned newspapers and a coalition of the Liberal and Conservative parties. Aberhart&#x27;s government did successfully establish the Alberta Treasury Branches (now ATB Financial), a government-owned financial institution to provide an alternative to existing banks, which continues to operate as a Crown corporation of the Alberta government.

== Early life ==

===Childhood, education, and family===

William Aberhart was born December 30, 1878, in Kippen, Ontario (now part of Bluewater, Ontario) to William (c. 1844 – 1910) and Louisa (c. 1850–1944) (née Pepper) Aberhart. William Aberhart Sr. had immigrated to Canada from Germany with his family at the age of seven, while Louisa Pepper was born in Perth County, Ontario. Historian Harold Schultz describes the Aberharts as &quot;prosperous&quot;, while biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller says they &quot;lived better than the average family&quot;. The fourth of eight children, William Aberhart Jr. delivered milk to his father&#x27;s customers before school each day. At school, he was a hard-working but average student. Mathematics was one of his strengths, though his approach involved more rote learning than reasoning. Elliott and Miller suggest that this tendency stayed with him his entire life, and that he &quot;never really acquired an appreciation for inductive intellectual analysis&quot;. Aberhart was not a social child. Though he excelled at soccer, he generally preferred solitary pursuits such as reading or teaching himself to play musical instruments.

In 1896, Aberhart attended three months of model school in Mitchell. Although this training qualified him to work as a schoolteacher, he instead enrolled in business college in Chatham, from which he withdrew after four months of successful study. In 1897–98, Aberhart attended Seaforth Collegiate Institute, where he was nicknamed &quot;Whitey&quot; (for his blond hair) and broadened his athletic prowess to include the long jump, shot put, 100-yard dash, high jump, cycling, and football.

On July 29, 1902, Aberhart married Jessie Flatt, whom he had met in 1901 at a football game. A daughter, Khona Louise Aberhart, was born in the winter of 1903, and a second, Ola Janet Aberhart, followed in August 1905.

On July 20, 1910, William Aberhart Sr. died in an accident at a pharmacy owned by his son (William Jr.&#x27;s brother) Charles. Prohibition was in effect, but pharmacists were permitted to provide alcohol for &quot;medicinal purposes&quot;. Charles kept a bottle of whiskey for William Sr. to drink whenever he was in the store. One day a clerk rearranged the bottles, and the illiterate William Sr. took a swallow of carbolic acid; he died within minutes. William Jr., by now in Calgary, did not make the trip east to his father&#x27;s funeral. Louisa Aberhart died February 20, 1944, outliving her son, William Aberhart Jr., by less than a year.

In 1911, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario.

===Teaching career===

In the fall of 1901 Aberhart was hired as a teacher at the Central Public School in Brantford, for which he was paid $60 per month. He fast won a reputation as a strict disciplinarian: he addressed his students by number rather than name and was liberal in his use of the strap. By his own account in a 1903 essay, he viewed the classroom as a battlefield, and admired Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s military organization. While his tactics divided his students—some loved him, while others recounted that &quot;he did everything he could to break the spirit of a child&quot;—his supervisors gave him uniformly positive reviews.

His school&#x27;s principal died in 1905, and Aberhart was selected to replace him; his salary increased to $1,000 per year. This figure had reached $1,200 by 1910 when, in response to glowing reviews from his colleagues, the Calgary Board of Education offered him a principalship at $1,400 per year. In response to a petition from his staff and students that this offer be matched by Brantford, Aberhart was offered a raise to $1,300; he declined it, and moved to Calgary that spring. His family followed later, after he purchased a two-storey wooden house and Khona finished her academic year in Brantford. 1910 Calgary was a frontier town that smelled of horse manure and in which public drunkenness was common; though Aberhart&#x27;s sensibilities were less shocked by this than his wife&#x27;s were, he also had to make some adjustments: in Brantford he had always attended church in a silk top hat and frock coat, but he quickly abandoned this custom after discovering that he was the only one in Calgary to do so.

Aberhart was to become principal of Mount Royal School, but it was not yet complete at the time of his arrival, so he became the principal of Alexandra Public School immediately on his arrival. Mount Royal was still not completed by the fall, so he took over the principalship of Victoria School, which he held until becoming principal of the new Crescent Heights High School in 1915.

Elliott and Miller write that Aberhart took a less rigid approach to discipline at Crescent Heights than he had in Ontario, though Schultz says that as principal he was &quot;authoritarian in manner and a strict disciplinarian&quot;. His love of organization persisted, and his penchant for it enhanced his reputation as &quot;an able administrator&quot;. Crescent Height&#x27;s students scored very well on departmental examinations, though some members of the school board believed that he achieved this at least partly by culling weaker students with a preliminary qualifying examination.

One way Aberhart applied his organizational prowess was in creating one of Calgary&#x27;s first and largest parent–teacher associations, which had an average of two hundred parents attend each meeting; Aberhart had a generally good relationship with parents. His standing with his staff was more mixed: he had a habit of &quot;talking down&quot; to them, dominated the school to the point that teachers were left with little initiative, and, as Elliott and Miller put it, &quot;never entered the staff room except to issue an order&quot;. Many of his teachers, while respecting his abilities as an administrator, thought very little of him as a man, and some believed that his domineering approach stemmed from a fear of people smarter than him. In 1919, eight Crescent Heights teachers wrote the school board requesting an investigation into Aberhart&#x27;s work; the resulting inspection led to the transfer of three male teachers—with whom Aberhart had a particularly poor rapport—to other schools, and stated that persisting problems would lead to a request for Aberhart&#x27;s resignation. A follow-up investigation two years later found a substantial improvement in conditions and reported favourably on Aberhart&#x27;s abilities. Despite this uneven relationship, Aberhart was not all together closed-minded, and would entertain—and sometimes even be convinced by—arguments from his staff.

Besides his administrative duties, Aberhart taught English and math. True to form, in doing so he emphasized rote memorization at the expense of independent reasoning, to the point that one of his teachers once likened him to a dog trainer. He cared for his students and provided extensive extra tutoring, especially for students in whom he saw a genuine interest in learning the material. Outside of the classroom, he applied his talents to organizing picnics and games, and in 1922 organized an elected student council years before the concept became widespread in Calgary. When some students wanted the school to purchase a movie projector not provided for in the school&#x27;s budget, Aberhart organized a company into which students could buy for ten cents per share; the company put on movies for which it charged admission, and at the end of its first year of operation it declared a dividend of 25 cents per share. He urged his students to adopt four axioms he followed in his own life: &quot;be enthusiastic, be ambitious, develop a distinctive personality, [and] have a hobby and ride it hard.&quot;

In the assessment of John Barr, a Social Credit staffer years after Aberhart&#x27;s death who later wrote one of the first histories of the party&#x27;s years in power, &quot;Aberhart generally had the respect and admiration of a broad following of parents, teachers, and students.&quot; Schultz states that the only area in which all 61 people he interviewed in researching Aberhart&#x27;s career agreed was that he was an excellent high school teacher.

==Ministry==

===Early religious views and adoption of Dispensationalism===

Though his parents were not churchgoers, as a child Aberhart attended Sunday school at a Presbyterian church. Under circumstances that are not clear to history, in high school he became a devout Christian. He initially adopted Biblical literalism, though while at normal school he was exposed to more liberal versions of Christianity that taught the existence of internal inconsistencies in the Bible; for several years he adopted the approach of a Bible teacher who counselled him to &quot;treat [the] Bible as ... a nice plate of fish&quot; and &quot;eat the meat and leave the bones for the dogs&quot;. Though at first he subscribed to the notion of unconditional election, and worried about whether he was destined for salvation, he later adopted the Arminian doctrine of conditional election, and became confident that, through his faith, he would be saved.

While in Brantford, Aberhart studied at Zion Presbyterian church, where he became interested in Biblical prophecy, which in turn led him to Dispensationalism. Dispensationalism held that history was divided into seven dispensations, during each of which God made a covenant with man, and during each of which man broke the covenant. That the terms of the covenant were different in each dispensation resolved Aberhart&#x27;s earlier concerns about the Bible&#x27;s internal inconsistencies. His views were heavily influenced by a correspondence course he took offered by American Dispensationalist Cyrus Scofield; Elliott and Miller speculate that such a course would have appealed to Aberhart by reducing &quot;difficult theological problems to a matter of memorizing questions and answers&quot;.

Aberhart had aspired to take ministerial training at the Presbyterian Knox College Divinity School, but the church in Brantford was reluctant to take on the support of both him and his family in the four-year training period. He became fascinated with prophetical teaching in the Bible and studied a correspondence course by Cyrus Scofield. He had been introduced to this system while attending a men&#x27;s Bible Class at Zion Presbyterian, taught by William Nichol, an elderly physician.

In 1910, Aberhart accepted a position as principal of Alexandra School in Calgary, Alberta. His initial Bible Study Teaching in Calgary commenced at the Grace Presbyterian Church at the Young Men&#x27;s Bible Class. Within a few weeks attendance was over 100 and he attracted the attendance of the senior minister Dr. Esler, but his views on prophecy did not jibe with senior minister&#x27;s reformed beliefs and his teaching privileges were cancelled. He then moved on to teach successively at the Wesley and Trinity Methodist Churches.

In 1915, he became an unpaid pastor of Westbourne Baptist Church in Calgary. In 1918, he founded a Bible study group in the church, which grew in attendance over the years. In 1920 he was baptized by immersion. In 1925, he broadcast his Sunday sermons on the radio station CFCN, which allowed him to broadcast his prophetic preaching to listeners throughout the Canadian prairies and part of the northern United States. In 1927 he made the decision to terminate the church&#x27;s affiliation with the Baptist Union of Western Canada due to theological differences with the teachings given at the union college. In 1927, he founded the Calgary Prophetic Bible Institute in a new building. The institute building also housed the Westbourne Baptist Church. In 1929, a section of church members who disagreed with his beliefs about the need for a baptism of the Holy Spirit separate from conversion, decided to return to the old building, prompting Aberhart to found Bible Institute Baptist Church. Towards the end of his life British Israelism became increasingly central to his theology. British Israelism had been an element of his theology from an early stage, but assumed further importance following the 1939 royal tour of Canada where he spoke with King George VI on the topic.

==Early political involvement==

Aberhart became interested in politics during the Great Depression in Canada, a time which was especially harsh on Albertan and Saskatchewan farmers. Particularly, he was drawn to the Social Credit theories of Major C. H. Douglas, a British engineer. From 1932 to 1935, Aberhart lobbied for the governing political party, the United Farmers of Alberta, to adopt these theories, but it never did.

It is doubtful that Aberhart fully understood the theories himself. The basis of Douglas&#x27;s A+B theorem is that prices rise faster than incomes when regarded as a flow, and individuals&#x27; purchasing power should be supplemented through issuance of new credits that have not derived from the productive system. After Aberhart&#x27;s lobbying of the United Farmers to adopt Social Credit principles was unsuccessful, he helped found the Social Credit Party of Alberta.

==Premier of Alberta (1935–1943)==
===Electoral record===
The Social Credit Party won the 1935 provincial election by a landslide with over 54% of the popular vote and all but seven of the 63 seats in the legislature.

Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. Indeed, its expectations were so low that it had not named a formal leader during the campaign. The party was now tasked with selecting a leader who would become the province&#x27;s new premier. Aberhart was the obvious choice, as he had been the party&#x27;s founder and guiding force. He initially said he did not want the job, but was finally prevailed to accept it.

He was sworn in as premier on September 3 (11 days after his August 22 victory). However, he was not yet a member of the legislature. The Social Credit MLA for Okotoks-High River, William Morrison, resigned to give Aberhart a chance to get a seat, per standard practice in the Westminster system when a leader or cabinet minister does not have a seat.

Aberhart won the November 4 by-election, held prior to the first sitting of the new legislature after the general election. Aberhart was elected by acclamation.

Aberhart served as premier and as his own minister of education and, starting in 1937, Attorney General. Aberhart&#x27;s government was re-elected in the 1940 election with a somewhat reduced mandate, with Aberhart being elected to a Calgary seat.

===Policy===

Aberhart&#x27;s government did not implement much of the Social Credit policies promised in the party&#x27;s election platform, because of the province&#x27;s very poor financial position in the depths of the Depression. The federal government&#x27;s opposition to Social Credit was a significant block to Aberhart&#x27;s policy goals. The federal government has jurisdiction over Canadian currency and banks, under the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. However, there was no constitutional barrier to Alberta producing its own currency, which Aberhart&#x27;s government did to a limited degree with its prosperity certificates. Aberhart did threaten the power of private banks with his government&#x27;s extension of the UFA government&#x27;s foreclosure moratorium and mandatory debt adjustment. But a law to tax banks was overturned on constitutional grounds. Later, the government started its own banks, which carry on as the Alberta Treasury Branch (ATB Financial).

Aberhart instituted a variety of relief programs to help people out of poverty, as well as public works programs and a debt relief program that froze some debt collections and mortgage foreclosures. This, like Tommy Douglas&#x27; similar program in Saskatchewan, was later overturned in the mid-1940s by the Supreme Court, although it aided people for a number of years during and (for a short time) after the Great Depression.

Alberta&#x27;s Social Credit government brought in legislation under which an MLA could be recalled by a portion of their constituents. Aberhart&#x27;s own constituents, including out-of-power UFA farmers and many oilworkers working for U.S. oil companies threatened by Aberhart&#x27;s Natural Resources Conservation legislation, gathered signatures for Aberhart&#x27;s own recall. He thus became the first Canadian politician to be threatened with recall from office. Aberhart&#x27;s government retroactively repealed the recall legislation rather than have Aberhart forced to give up his seat.

In keeping with his evangelical views, Aberhart added a heavy dose of social conservatism to Major Douglas&#x27;s ideas. Most notably, he enacted very tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol. Indeed, the only stricter law in Canada at the time was in Prince Edward Island, where the sale of alcohol remained completely banned until 1948. Well into the 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta.

Although Aberhart was unable to gain control of Alberta&#x27;s banks, his government gained a foothold in the province&#x27;s financial industry by creating the Alberta Treasury Branches in 1938. Its operations included special credit given for those who bought made-in-Alberta goods. ATB has become Aberhart&#x27;s legacy, operating as an orthodox financial institution and Crown corporation.

===Conflict with Lieutenant Governor===

Lieutenant Governor John C. Bowen refused to give royal assent to three government bills in 1937. Two of the bills would have put the province&#x27;s banks under the control of the provincial government, while a third, the &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot;, would have forced newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories the provincial cabinet deemed &quot;inaccurate&quot;. All three bills were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. For its leadership in the fight against the latter act, in 1938 the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize special citation and bronze plaque, the first time a special citation was awarded outside the United States, while 95 other newspapers including the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, the &quot;Red Deer News&quot;, &quot;Lethbridge Herald&quot; and the province&#x27;s weekly newspapers were recognized with engraved certificates.

By late 1937, relations with the lieutenant governor became so strained that Bowen even threatened to dismiss Aberhart&#x27;s government, which would have been an extraordinary use of his reserve powers. An analogous situation occurred in 1932 in Australia between Jack Lang and Sir Philip Game, the premier and governor, respectively, of New South Wales. However, Bowen did not follow through on his threat due in part to Social Credit&#x27;s immense popularity with the people. Had he dismissed Aberhart, it would have triggered a fresh election that Social Credit would have almost certainly won.

== Death and legacy ==

Aberhart died unexpectedly on May 23, 1943, during a visit to his adult daughters in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Burnaby as his widow intended to move to Vancouver to be close to her children. He was succeeded as the Premier of Alberta by his lifelong disciple, Ernest C. Manning, who gradually moved away from Douglas&#x27; monetary theories. Social Credit would remain in office until its defeat in the 1971 election—one of the longest-serving provincial governments in Canadian history, and one of the longest-serving in the Commonwealth.

The Aberhart Centre, a long-term medical care centre at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, is named in his honour, as is William Aberhart High School in Calgary.

In 1974, he was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada. A plaque commemorating this sits inside Crescent Heights High School at 1019 1st NW, Calgary, Alberta.

== Ideology ==

Elliott (1978) argues that the Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit ideology was clearly antithetical to his previous theology, which was highly sectarian, separatist, apolitical, other-worldly, and eschatologically oriented. Elliott challenges the arguments of Mann (1955) and Irving (1959) that there was a definite connection between Aberhart&#x27;s theology and political program. Elliott reports that Aberhart&#x27;s political support did not come from the sectarian groups as Mann and Irving suggest, but rather it came from the members of established churches and those with marginal religious commitment.

==Publications and articles about Aberhart==

Historian Harold J. Schultz&#x27;s 1964 &quot;Portrait of a Premier: William Aberhart&quot; was published in the &quot;Canadian Historical Review&quot;. A 1977 book edited by Lewis Herbert Thomas, traced Aberhart&#x27;s role in the development of Alberta&#x27;s Social Credit movement.

In his 1978 article published in the &quot;Canadian Historical Review&quot;, David R. Elliot examined Aberhart&#x27;s theological and political beliefs.

Elliot and Iris Miller published &quot;Bible Bill: A Biography of William Aberhart&quot; in 1987. A 2004 edited book —&quot;Alberta Premiers of the Twentieth Century&quot;, devoted a chapter to Aberhart.

A June 2020 in-depth article in &quot;Alberta Views&quot; magazine, compared Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to Aberhart.

Bruce Allen Powe in 1983 published a novel entitled &quot;The Aberhart Summer&quot; based on the events of 1935 when Aberhart swept into power. The novel was adapted as a stage play in 1999 by Conni Massing.

<doc id="233734" wikidata="Q1382650" url="?curid=233734" title="Richard Gavin Reid">
<text>Richard Gavin &quot;Dick&quot; Reid (17 January 1879 – 17 October 1980) was a Canadian politician who served as the sixth premier of Alberta from 1934 to 1935. He was the last member of the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) to hold the office, and that party&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the upstart Social Credit League in the 1935 election made him the shortest serving premier to that point in Alberta&#x27;s history.

Born near Glasgow, Scotland, Reid worked a number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He involved himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him to run in the 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus&#x27; unanimous choice to succeed him as premier.

When Reid took office, Alberta was experiencing the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans&#x27; suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery was beyond the capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid&#x27;s claims that Aberhart&#x27;s proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid&#x27;s party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.

==Early life==
Reid was born 17 January 1879 near Glasgow, Scotland, to George (1843–1913) and Margaret (Ogston) Reid (1850–1928). He attended school in Glasgow and worked for several years in the wholesale provisions business before enlisting in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He served in South Africa as a Lance-Sergeant from 1900 to 1902 during the Second Boer War, doing hospital duty, before returning to Scotland. There he began to plan his future, considering returning to South Africa to live before deciding on Canada.

He arrived in Killarney, Manitoba, in 1903, where he worked as a farmhand during the harvest. When winter came, he found work as a lumberjack in Fort William, Ontario. A voyage west followed, and he set up a homestead in east-central Alberta. Once there, he began to practice dentistry, drawing on his army experience. On 9 September 1919, he married Marion Stuart. They had three sons and two daughters.

==Early political career==

===Entry into politics===
Reid&#x27;s political career began with four years on the municipal council of Buffalo Coulee, around present-day Vermilion. He spent two of these as Reeve. He was instrumental in founding the Vermilion municipal hospital district, on whose board he served for many years. Federally, he was active with the United Farmers of Alberta Battle River Political Association, of which he became president.

Reid was nominated as the UFA candidate in Vermilion during the 1921 provincial election, the first in which the UFA ran candidates. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid&#x27;s great surprise, he defeated his Liberal opponent and was elected to the legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a majority government. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, at which it selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections.

===Cabinet career===
Reid occupied high-ranking cabinet positions in Greenfield&#x27;s government and that of his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the &quot;Sexual Sterilization Act&quot; of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old-age pensions paid to their residents.

In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid out of both of his portfolios and made him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets and that the government create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield&#x27;s Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago&#x27;s commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had little choice but to go along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.

With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, government deficits ceased: the budget showed a surplus in every year from 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was on the cusp of a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.

Though Brownlee was no more enthusiastic than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta&#x27;s long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta&#x27;s first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.

==Premier==
In 1934, Brownlee was implicated in a sex scandal, as a young family friend and her father sued him for seduction. By Reid&#x27;s account, he had to convince his premier not to quit &quot;hundreds of times&quot;. When the jury found in favour of the plaintiffs, however, Brownlee had no choice, and resigned effective 10 July 1934. Reid was the most prominent minister in the cabinet and among the most popular, and was the UFA caucus&#x27; unanimous choice to take over. He also replaced Brownlee as Provincial Secretary and installed himself in the newly created position of Treasury Board President.

The UFA was in an uncertain position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee&#x27;s resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson was in the midst of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer St. Germain had crossed the floor to the Liberals. Additionally, the province&#x27;s economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province&#x27;s next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province&#x27;s tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta&#x27;s taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.

In the meantime, Reid&#x27;s government took a number of policy initiatives. It passed legislation authorizing the government purchase of cattle from farmers who could no longer afford feed, and worked out a cost-sharing agreement with the federal government and the railways to relocate farmers fleeing the province&#x27;s dust belt. Reid also called for the creation of a federal wheat marketing board, and proposed legislation—the &quot;Agricultural Industry Stabilisation Act&quot;—that protected from creditors any portion of a farmer&#x27;s revenue that was used on operating costs for his farm or living expenses for his family. Despite these measures, Reid found himself at odds with his party&#x27;s membership, which was reacting to the Great Depression by following an increasingly socialist path. He found UFA President Robert Gardiner to be of the &quot;far left&quot;, and considered the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, in whose founding many UFA members had participated, to be an &quot;unholy amalgamation&quot;. Even so, his government experimented with a form of universal health insurance, to be jointly funded by government, employers, and employees, that would provide Albertans with free medical, dental, and hospital care; the project was to be launched as a pilot project in Camrose, but was never begun because of the intervention of the 1935 election. More controversially, Reid&#x27;s government reacted to McPherson&#x27;s divorce and its attendant coverage by proposing to ban newspapers from covering divorce proceedings, a proposal that prompted Liberal MLA Joseph Miville Dechene to compare Reid to Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin.

===Social credit===

A more dangerous opponent than Howson was William Aberhart, the Calgary preacher who was proposing a form of social credit to cure the province&#x27;s ills. Social credit, the brainchild of British engineer C. H. Douglas, purported to bridge the gap between a society&#x27;s production and its purchasing power; Aberhart maintained that this gap was the source of Alberta&#x27;s economic hardships. Reid was leery of Aberhart though he, like most politicians of the era, pronounced himself in favour of Douglas&#x27;s philosophy. T. C. Byrne suggests that this expressed support was dishonest, that Reid considered social credit in all of its forms to be &quot;complete nonsense&quot;, and paid it lip service only because of its popularity among voters.

Though he was gaining adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim was not to enter politics, but to persuade existing parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist in the midst of plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart&#x27;s characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.

The next day, the UFA began debate on a resolution that read
Resolved that a system of social credit as outlined by William Aberhart, Calgary, be put in as a plank in the UFA provincial platform to be brought before the electorate at the next provincial election.
Debate was vigorous. One delegate said that UFA members wanted social credit, and if they could not get it through the UFA they would find other means. After three hours, UFA Vice President Norman Priestly noted in frustration that delegates were debating the merits of &quot;a system of social credit as outlined by&quot; Aberhart without ever having heard Aberhart outline his proposed system. It was agreed to invite Aberhart to appear. Using the analogy of blood flowing through the human body, he argued that the of blood contained in the human body were sufficient for the heart to pump much more than that per day; so it was, he argued, with currency, whose circulation needed to be accelerated to enhance Albertans&#x27; purchasing power. He closed by expressing pessimism that the delegates would choose to support social credit, and this pessimism proved well-founded: though sources are inconsistent on the precise outcome—journalist John Barr reports that the exact vote was not recorded, while historian Bradford Rennie states there were 30 affirmative votes out of 400 delegates present—there is agreement that the resolution was handily defeated. While the vote appeared to be a decisive victory for Reid and his fellow traditionalists, Byrne suggests that many members abstained.

The threat from within apparently defeated, Reid and his government turned their attention to the threat from without: the convention&#x27;s repudiation had convinced Aberhart that his Social Credit League must run candidates in the next election. Reid&#x27;s defence took two forms. The first was an overt attack on Aberhart and his policies. He insisted that Aberhart&#x27;s proposed &quot;monthly credit dividends&quot; of Can$25 could not be issued unless taxes increased tenfold. He argued that Aberhart&#x27;s proposed means of raising revenue—&quot;unearned increments&quot; and &quot;production levies&quot;—were actually disguised taxes, which would be paid primarily by farmers, and that his claims that the necessary credit could be created &quot;at the stroke of a fountain pen&quot; on an accounting ledger were absurd. He further pointed out that elements of Aberhart&#x27;s plan, including the provincial government&#x27;s entry into banking and the creation of a provincial tariff, were &quot;ultra vires&quot; the province under the Canadian constitution. These themes were expounded on by Priestly and Brownlee, both of whom undertook speaking tours and radio addresses, and by legal and economic experts commissioned by the government.

The second element of Reid&#x27;s approach was to call into question Aberhart&#x27;s understanding of social credit by exposing inconsistencies between his statements and the theories advanced by Douglas. Douglas and Aberhart did not like each other, and Douglas did not believe that Aberhart fully understood his theories; though he declined to comment publicly, one of his deputies once called one of Aberhart&#x27;s pamphlets &quot;fallacious from start to finish&quot;. Hoping to capitalize on this rift, Reid invited Douglas to come to Alberta and serve as &quot;Economic Reconstruction Advisor&quot; at an annual fee of $2,500 plus a $2,000 expense allowance for each of his annual three-week trips to the province. Douglas accepted. Angered that the government had incurred this sizable expense without consulting the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan introduced a motion calling on Aberhart to be hired in a similar capacity. This suited Reid, who hoped that by inducing both men to submit detailed plans he would at last have something concrete from Aberhart to attack, and something equally concrete from Douglas with which to contrast it. Aberhart confounded Reid&#x27;s plan by declining his offer. Douglas, for his part, provided mixed results: on his way to Edmonton he publicly repudiated Aberhart&#x27;s impugned pamphlet and also pronounced himself against the creation of a provincial social credit political vehicle. On the other hand, shortly after his arrival he sent Aberhart a letter, gleefully released by Aberhart, asserting that there was no conflict between the &quot;Douglas&quot; and &quot;Aberhart&quot; versions of social credit. Moreover, his interim report to the government concerned itself primarily with political and legal, rather than economic, realities: he recommended setting up a provincially controlled media outlet to counter the anti-social credit propaganda he anticipated from the privately owned press, organizing a provincial government credit institution, and accumulating a stockpile of currency, stocks, and bonds. He also suggested that the UFA might need to form a coalition government to implement social credit. The report was of little use to Reid&#x27;s government, so he had his Attorney-General, John Lymburn, ask Douglas to critique one of Aberhart&#x27;s radio broadcasts. Douglas demurred, and made only vague comments about minor technical errors in the transcript.

Reid&#x27;s approach to combating Aberhart&#x27;s influence had failed. The first element, attacking the validity of Aberhart&#x27;s ideas directly, had failed because much of the Alberta public, in abject poverty, was not interested in hearing economic and legal arguments against social credit. This state of mind was illustrated by a voter&#x27;s comments to Brownlee on Aberhart&#x27;s proposals:
Mr. Brownlee, we have listened to you with a great deal of attention and the answers you have given seem pretty hard to meet. But I have one more question ... I&#x27;m selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel. If I tried to sell a steer tomorrow I&#x27;d probably hardly get enough to pay the freight. I get three cents a dozen for eggs. I&#x27;m lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. Will you tell me what I&#x27;ve got to lose?
The second part of the strategy, contrasting Aberhart&#x27;s proposals with Douglas&#x27;s, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.

===Electoral defeat===
When the election came in August 1935, Aberhart offered economic recovery while Reid offered criticisms of Aberhart. Highlighting the UFA&#x27;s record of clean government, low taxes, and fiscal responsibility, Reid committed himself and his government to bringing a sense of security. More tangibly, he promised to build a government oil refinery (predicting that &quot;the near future will witness the greatest explorations for oil which this province has ever known&quot;). Most of the campaign was conducted around Social Credit&#x27;s promise to pull the province out of depression with its monetary theories. Reid alleged that Aberhart&#x27;s policies would destroy the province&#x27;s credit and leave it unable to borrow the money it needed to carry on, but voters—even those sceptical of Social Credit&#x27;s promises—saw no alternative hopes offered by the UFA. On 11 August, election day, every UFA MLA was defeated; Reid himself finished third in his riding, barely ahead of the Communist candidate, and resigned as Premier effective 22 August.

Time would prove Reid correct in most of his criticisms of Aberhart: he did lack a specific economic agenda, much of his legislation was struck down by the courts, and the depression did continue for several more years in Alberta. This was of cold comfort to Reid, whose defeat was total: at 408 days, his time as Premier was the shortest in the province&#x27;s history to that point.

==Life after politics==
After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick transfer of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, and he wanted to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province&#x27;s financial problems were due to Social Credit&#x27;s policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.

Apart from these occasional forays defending his record, Reid withdrew from politics. He became a commission agent, and later the librarian for Canadian Utilities Limited. For this latter role, he was made an honorary member of the Edmonton Library Association. During World War II, he served on the Canadian government&#x27;s mobilisation board. Richard Reid died in Edmonton 17 October 1980 at the age of 101. He was cremated, and his ashes buried in Edmonton.

Historians generally view Reid as a victim of circumstance: like many governments across Canada, his was defeated by the Great Depression. Rennie argues that Reid&#x27;s approach to government, frugal and non-interventionist, was well-suited to the prosperous 1920s but less so to the 1930s, and highlights his lack of charisma. But he also writes that virtually nobody could have won the 1935 election for the UFA. Foster agrees, assessing Reid as &quot;a quietly competent, gentle man&quot; who &quot;merited the confidence of his colleagues&quot;, but who was in 1935 &quot;distinctly out of his element&quot;. As Rennie closes, &quot;In 1935 Albertans wanted a saviour. Richard Gavin Reid was a mere mortal.&quot;

<text>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited diseases whose main feature is a progressive gait disorder. The disease presents with progressive stiffness (spasticity) and contraction in the lower limbs. HSP is also known as hereditary spastic paraparesis, familial spastic paraplegia, French settlement disease, Strumpell disease, or Strumpell-Lorrain disease. The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons; therefore, the disease is an upper motor neuron disease. HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to treat HSP symptoms.

HSP is caused by defects in transport of proteins, structural proteins, cell-maintaining proteins, lipids, and other substances through the cell. Long nerve fibers (axons) are affected because long distances make nerve cells particularly sensitive to defects in these mentioned mechanisms.

The disease was first described in 1880 by the German neurologist Adolph Strümpell. It was described more extensively in 1888 by Maurice Lorrain, a French physician. Due to their contribution in describing the disease, it is still called Strümpell-Lorrain disease in French-speaking countries. The term &quot;hereditary spastic paraplegia&quot; was coined by Anita Harding in 1983.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.
Individuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders, which can be disabling. Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices. Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms.

More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.
In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.

Anita Harding classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form. Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs, associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity (pallhypesthesia). On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom.

This classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity, intellectual disability (with spasticity), or leukodystrophy. Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before. Therefore, some key genes overlap with other disease groups.

===Age of onset===
In the past, HSP has been classified as early onset beginning in early childhood or later onset in adulthood. The age of onsets has two points of maximum at age 2 and around age 40. New findings propose that an earlier onset leads to a longer disease duration without loss of ambulation or the need for the use of a wheelchair. This was also described earlier, that later onset forms evolve more rapidly. However, this is not always the case as De Novo Early Onset SPG4, a form of infantile HSP, involves loss of ambulation and other motor skills.

==Cause==

HSP is a group of genetic disorders. It follows general inheritance rules and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner. The mode of inheritance involved has a direct impact on the chances of inheriting the disorder. Over 70 genotypes had been described, and over 50 genetic loci have been linked to this condition. Ten genes have been identified with autosomal dominant inheritance. One of these, SPG4, accounts for ~50% of all genetically solved cases, or approximately 25% of all HSP cases. Twelve genes are known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Collectively this latter group account for ~1/3 cases.

Most altered genes have known function, but for some the function haven&#x27;t been identified yet. All of them are listed in the gene list below, including their mode of inheritance. Some examples are spastin (SPG4) and paraplegin (SPG7) are both AAA ATPases.

===Genotypes===

The genes are designated &quot;SPG&quot; (Spastic gait gene). The gene locations are in the format: chromosome - arm (short or &quot;p&quot;: long or &quot;q&quot;) - band number. These designations are for the human genes only. The locations may (and probably will) vary in other organisms.
Despite the number of genes known to be involved in this condition ~40% of cases have yet to have their cause identified. In the table below &quot;SPG?&quot; is used to indicate a gene that has been associated with HSP but has not yet received an official HSP gene designation.

== Pathophysiology ==
The major feature of HSP is a length-dependent axonal degeneration. These include the crossed and uncrossed corticospinal tracts to the legs and fasciculus gracilis. The spinocerebellar tract is involved to a lesser extent. Neuronal cell bodies of degenerating axons are preserved and there is no evidence of primary demyelination. Loss of anterior horn cells of the spinal cord are observed in some cases. Dorsal root ganglia, posterior roots and peripheral nerves are not directly affected.

HSP affects several pathways in motor neurons. Many genes were identified and linked to HSP. It remains a challenge to accurately define the key players in each of the affected pathways, mainly because many genes have multiple functions and are involved in more than one pathway .
=== Axon pathfinding ===
Pathfinding is important for axon growth to the right destination (e.g. another nerve cell or a muscle). Significant for this mechanism is the L1CAM gene, a cell surface glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Mutations leading to a loss-of-function in L1CAM are also found in other X-linked syndromes. All of these disorders display corticospinal tract impairment (a hallmark feature of HSP). L1CAM participates in a set of interactions, binding other L1CAM molecules as well as extracellular cell adhesion molecules, integrins, and proteoglycans or intracellular proteins like ankyrins.

The pathfinding defect occurs via the association of L1CAM with neuropilin-1. Neuropilin-1 interacts with Plexin-A proteins to form the Semaphorin-3A receptor complex. Semaphorin-a3A is then released in the ventral spinal cord to steer corticospinal neurons away from the midline spinal cord / medullary junction. If L1CAM does not work correctly due to a mutation, the cortiocospinal neurons are not directed to the correct position and the impairment occurs.

=== Lipid metabolism ===
Axons in the central and peripheral nervous system are coated with an insulation, the myelin layer, to increase the speed of action potential propagation. Abnormal myelination in the CNS is detected in some forms of hsp HSP. Several genes were linked to myelin malformation, namely PLP1, GFC2 and FA2H. The mutations alter myelin composition, thickness and integrity.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main organelle for lipid synthesis. Mutations in genes encoding proteins that have a role in shaping ER morphology and lipid metabolism were linked to HSP. Mutations in ATL1, BSCL2 and ERLIN2 alter ER structure, specifically the tubular network and the formation of three-way junctions in ER tubules. Many mutated genes are linked to abnormal lipid metabolism. The most prevalent effect is on arachidonic acid (CYP2U1) and cholesterol (CYP7B1) metabolism, phospholipase activity (DDHD1 and DDHD2), ganglioside formation (B4GALNT-1) and the balance between carbohydrate and fat metabolism (SLV33A1).

=== Endosomal trafficking ===
Neurons take in substances from their surrounding by endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles fuse to endosomes in order to release their content. There are three main compartments that have endosome trafficking: Golgi to/from endosomes; plasma membrane to/from early endosomes (via recycling endosomes) and late endosomes to lysosomes. Dysfunction of endosomal trafficking can have severe consequences in motor neurons with long axons, as reported in HSP. Mutations in AP4B1 and KIAA0415 are linked to disturbance in vesicle formation and membrane trafficking including selective uptake of proteins into vesicles. Both genes encode proteins that interact with several other proteins and disrupt the secretory and endocytic pathways.

=== Mitochondrial function ===
Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been connected with developmental and degenerative neurological disorders. Only a few HSP genes encode mitochondrial proteins. Two mitochondrial resident proteins are mutated in HSP: paraplegin and chaperonin 60. Paraplegin is a m-AAA metalloprotease of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It functions in ribosomal assembly and protein quality control. The impaired chaperonin 60 activity leads to impaired mitochondrial quality control. Two genes DDHD1 and CYP2U1 have shown alteration of mitochondrial architecture in patient fibroblasts. These genes encode enzymes involved in fatty-acid metabolism.

==Diagnosis==
Initial diagnosis of HSPs relies upon family history, the presence or absence of additional signs and the exclusion of other nongenetic causes of spasticity, the latter being particular important in sporadic cases.

Cerebral and spinal MRI is an important procedure performed in order to rule out other frequent neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, but also to detect associated abnormalities such as cerebellar or corpus callosum atrophy as well as white matter abnormalities. Differential diagnosis of HSP should also exclude spastic diplegia which presents with nearly identical day-to-day effects and even is treatable with similar medicines such as baclofen and orthopedic surgery; at times, these two conditions may look and feel so similar that the only &quot;perceived&quot; difference may be HSP&#x27;s hereditary nature versus the explicitly non-hereditary nature of spastic diplegia (however, unlike spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy, HSP cannot be reliably treated with selective dorsal rhizotomy).

Ultimate confirmation of HSP diagnosis can only be provided by carrying out genetic tests targeted towards known genetic mutations.

===Classification===
Hereditary spastic paraplegias can be classified based on the symptoms; mode of inheritance; the patient&#x27;s age at onset; the affected genes; and biochemical pathways involved.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment is known that would prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Available therapies mainly consist of symptomatic medical management and promoting physical and emotional well-being. Therapeutics offered to HSP patients include:
* Baclofen – a voluntary muscle relaxant to relax muscles and reduce tone. This can be administered orally or intrathecally. (Studies in HSP )
* Tizanidine – to treat nocturnal or intermittent spasms (studies available )
* Diazepam and clonazepam – to decrease intensity of spasms
* Oxybutynin chloride – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems
* Tolterodine tartrate – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems
* Cro System – to reduce muscle overactivity (existing studies for spasticity )
* Botulinum toxin – to reduce muscle overactivity (existing studies for HSP patients)
* Antidepressants (such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) – for patients experiencing clinical depression
* Physical therapy – to restore and maintain the ability to move; to reduce muscle tone; to maintain or improve range of motion and mobility; to increase strength and coordination; to prevent complications, such as frozen joints, contractures, or bedsores.

==Prognosis==
Although HSP is a progressive condition, the prognosis for individuals with HSP varies greatly. It primarily affects the legs although there can be some upperbody involvement in some individuals. Some cases are seriously disabling whilst others leave people able to do most ordinary activities to an ordinary extent without needing adjustments. The majority of individuals with HSP have a normal life expectancy.

==Epidemiology==
Worldwide, the prevalence of all hereditary spastic paraplegias combined is estimated to be 2 to 6 in 100,000 people. A Norwegian study of more than 2.5 million people published in March 2009 has found an HSP prevalence rate of 7.4/100,000 of population – a higher rate, but in the same range as previous studies. No differences in rate relating to gender were found, and average age at onset was 24 years. In the United States, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia is listed as a &quot;rare disease&quot; by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health which means that the disorder affects less than 200,000 people in the US population.
