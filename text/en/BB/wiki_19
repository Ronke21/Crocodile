<doc id="229072" wikidata="Q17955" url="?curid=229072" title="Criticism">
<text>Criticism is the construction of a judgement about the negative or positive qualities of someone or something. Criticism can range from impromptu comments to a written detailed response. Criticism falls into several overlapping types including &quot;theoretical, practical, impressionistic, affective, prescriptive, or descriptive&quot;.

Criticism may also refer to an expression of disapproval of someone or something. When criticism of this nature is constructive, it can make an individual aware of gaps in their understanding and it can provide distinct routes for improvement. Research supports the notion that using feedback and constructive criticism in the learning process is very influential.

Critique vs. criticism: In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between &#x27;critique&#x27; and &#x27;criticism&#x27;. The two words both translate as &quot;critique&quot;, &quot;Kritik&quot;, and &quot;critica&quot;, respectively. In the English language, philosopher Gianni Vattimo suggests that &quot;criticism&quot; is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism while &quot;critique&quot; refers to more general writing such as Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. Another distinction that is sometimes made is that &quot;critique&quot; is never personalized nor &quot;ad hominem&quot; and is presented in a way that encourages rebuttal or expansion of the ideas expressed. Nonetheless, the distinctions are subtle and ambiguous at best.
The term &quot;brickbat&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;an unfavourable criticism, unkind remark or sharp put-down&quot;. The term originated in the 17th century, derived from the practice of throwing bricks as projectiles at a person who was disapproved of.

In some contexts, such as &quot;literary criticism&quot; and &quot;art criticism&quot;, the word &quot;criticism&quot; is used as a neutral word that is synonymous with &quot;evaluation.&quot;

== Criticism of criticism ==
Journalist and writer H. L. Mencken argued that &quot;criticism is little more than a branch of homiletics. They judge a work of art, not by its clarity and sincerity, not by the force and charm of its ideas, not by the technical virtuosity of the artist, not by his originality and artistic courage, but simply and solely by his orthodoxy.&quot;

<doc id="229073" wikidata="Q13743387" url="?curid=229073" title="Congestion pricing">
<text>Congestion pricing or congestion charges is a system of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand, such as through higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, making it possible to manage congestion without increasing supply.

According to the economic theory behind congestion pricing, the objective of this policy is to use the price mechanism to cover the social cost of an activity where users otherwise do not pay for the negative externalities they create (such as driving in a congested area during peak demand). By setting a price on an over-consumed product, congestion pricing encourages the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, leading to more efficient outcomes.

Singapore was the first country to introduce congestion pricing on its urban roads in 1975, and was refined in 1998. Since then, it has been implemented in cities including London, Stockholm, Milan, Gothenburg, and in the central business district of Manhattan in New York City. It was also considered in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater awareness of the harms of pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change has recently created greater interest in congestion pricing.

Implementation of congestion pricing has reduced traffic congestion in urban areas, reduced pollution, reduced asthma, and increased home values, but has also sparked criticism and public discontent. Critics maintain that congestion pricing is not equitable, places an economic burden on neighboring communities, and adversely affects retail businesses and general economic activity.

There is a consensus among economists that congestion pricing in crowded transportation networks, and subsequent use of the proceeds to lower other taxes, makes citizens on average better off. Economists disagree over how to set tolls, how to cover common costs, what to do with any excess revenues, whether and how &quot;losers&quot; from tolling previously free roads should be compensated, and whether to privatize highways.

== Description ==

Congestion pricing is a concept from market economics regarding the use of pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply in the case of a tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.

According to the economic theory behind congestion pricing, the objective of this policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.

This pricing mechanism has been used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.

Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative demand side (as opposed to supply side) strategies offered by economists to address traffic congestion. Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to a third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a public good: for example, if manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air. Congestion pricing is an efficiency pricing strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.

Nobel-laureate William Vickrey is considered by some to be the father of congestion pricing, as he first proposed adding a distance- or time-based fare system for the New York City Subway in 1952. In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais, Gabriel Roth who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore. Also, it was considered by the Smeed Report, published by the British Ministry of Transport in 1964, but its recommendations were rejected by successive British governments.

The transport economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as &quot;one policy response to the problem of congestion&quot;, was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: &quot;congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users&#x27; willingness to pay for the resource&quot;.

As applied to traffic, there are technically two types of congestion pricing. Cordon or area pricing defines the boundaries of an affected area -- typically an area of dense travel demand such as a city center -- and charges for personal vehicles to cross its boundaries. Lane or facility pricing charges for access to a single facility, such as a segment of road or bridge. In practice, the term &quot;congestion pricing&quot; is often used to refer to cordon pricing but not facility pricing, as this is a newer idea.

== Roads ==
Practical implementations of road congestion pricing are found almost exclusively in urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Congestion pricing can be fixed (the same at all times of day and days of the week), variable (set in advance to be higher at typically high-traffic times), or dynamic (varying according to actual conditions).

As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.

=== Cordon area and area wide ===
Cordon area congestion pricing is a fee or tax paid by users to enter a restricted area, usually within a city center, as part of a demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.

The first implementation of such a scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012, was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.

Singapore and Stockholm charge a congestion fee every time a user crosses the cordon area, while London charges a daily fee for any vehicle driving in a public road within the congestion charge zone, regardless of how many times the user crosses the cordon. Stockholm has put a cap on the maximum daily tax, while in Singapore the charge is based on a pay-as-you-use principle, and rates are set based on traffic conditions at the pricing points, and reviewed on a quarterly basis. Through this policy, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) reports that the electronic road pricing &quot;has been effective in maintaining an optimal speed range of 45 to 65 km/h for expressways and 20 to 30 km/h for arterial roads&quot;.

==== Singapore ====

In an effort to improve the pricing mechanism, and, to introduce real-time variable pricing,
Singapore&#x27;s LTA together with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow conditions from several sources, in order to predict the levels of congestion up to an hour in advance. By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, together with improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment.

In 2010 the Land Transport Authority began exploring the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System as a technological option for a second generation ERP. LTA objective is to evaluate if the latest technologies available in the market today are accurate and effective enough for use as a congestion charging tool, especially taking into consideration the dense urban environment in Singapore. Implementation of such system is not expected in the short term.

==== London ====
A proposal by former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone would have resulted in a new pricing structure based on potential CO2 emission rates by October 2008. Livingstone&#x27;s successor as Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced in July 2008 that the new CO2 charging structure will no longer be implemented. Johnson decided to remove the 2007 Western Extension from the congestion charging zone beginning on January 4, 2011, to increase the basic charge to , and also to introduce an automated payment system called Congestion Charging Auto Pay (CC Auto Pay), which will charge vehicles based on the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month, and the drivers of these vehicles will pay a reduced daily charge. In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) presented a proposal to abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount, and the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013, limiting the free access to the congestion charge zone to selected vehicles. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.

A new toxicity charge, known as T-charge was introduced from 23 October 2017. Older and more polluting cars and vans that do not meet Euro 4 standards will have to pay an extra £10 charge within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ). On 8 April 2019, the T-charge was expanded into the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).

==== Milan ====
The Ecopass pollution charge ended on December 31, 2011, and was replaced by the Area C scheme, which went into effect on January 16, 2012, initially as an 18-month pilot program. The Area C scheme is a conventional congestion pricing scheme and is based on the same Ecopass geographic area. Vehicles entering the charging zone incur a charge of regardless of their pollution level. However, residents inside the area have 40 free entries per year and then a discounted charge of . Electric vehicles, public utility vehicles, police and emergency vehicles, buses and taxis are exempted from the charge. Hybrid electric and bi-fuel natural gas vehicles (CNG and LPG) were exempted until January 1, 2013, Exemption has been postponed until December 31, 2016.

The scheme was made permanent in March 2013. All net earnings from Area C are invested to promote sustainable mobility and policies to reduce air pollution, including the redevelopment, protection and development of public transport, &quot;soft mobility&quot; (pedestrians, cycling, Zone 30) and systems to rationalize the distribution of goods.

====Stockholm====

On 1 January 2016, congestion taxes were increased in the inner-city parts of Stockholm, and also the congestion tax was introduced on Essingeleden motorway. This was the first increase of the tax since it was introduced permanently in 2007.

The congestion tax is being introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden in order to reduce traffic jams in peak periods, and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.

The tax increase was implemented not only to improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance the extension of the Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.

==== Norway ====

Several cities in Norway have tolled entrances to the more central urban areas, the first being Bergen in 1986.
Starting with Trondheim in 2010, later in Kristiansand, Bergen and Oslo, time differing fees were introduced, so that rush hours (in Oslo 06.30 – 09.00 and 15.00 – 17.00) cost more. The price is (in 2020) typically NOK 28 (€2.37) per passage, but to enter Oslo to the inner city and leave means passing five stations which costs NOK 126 (€10,66).
====New York City====

Congestion pricing in New York City was implemented in 2025. Most vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street are charged a fee that varies throughout the day.

==== Old town centres ====
Around Europe several relatively small cities, such as Durham, England; Znojmo, Czech Republic; Riga, Latvia; and Valletta, Malta, have implemented congestion pricing to reduce traffic crowding, parking problems and pollution, particularly during the peak tourism season.

Durham introduced charges in October 2002, reducing vehicle traffic by 85% after a year; prior to this 3,000 daily vehicles had shared the streets with 17,000 pedestrians.

Valletta has reduced daily vehicles entering the city from 10,000 to 7,900; making 400 readily available parking places in the center. There has been a 60% drop in car stays by non-residents of more than eight hours, but there has been a marked increase of 34% in non-residential cars visiting the city for an hour or less.

==== Rejected proposals ====


Hong Kong conducted a pilot test on an electronic congestion pricing system between 1983 and 1985 with positive results. However, public opposition against this policy stalled its permanent implementation.

In 2002 Edinburgh, United Kingdom, initiated an implementation process; a referendum was conducted in 2005, with a majority of 74.4% rejecting the proposal.

Councils from across the West Midlands in the United Kingdom, including Birmingham and Coventry, rejected the idea of imposing congestion pricing schemes on the area in 2008, despite promises from central government of transport project funding in exchange for the implementation of a road pricing pilot scheme.

In 2007, New York City shelved a proposal for a three-year pilot program for implementation in Manhattan, and a new proposition was denied in 2008, with potential federal grants of being reallocated to other American cities.

Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, was considering a scheme with two cordons, one covering the main urban core of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre. The measure was supported by the government, but three local authorities rejected it (Bury, Trafford and Stockport); the support of two-thirds of Manchester&#x27;s 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented. A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester, which included the congestion pricing element, was released for further public consultation and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008. On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils by a public referendum.

==== Current proposals ====


===== United States =====

In August 2007, the United States Department of Transportation selected five metropolitan areas to initiate congestion pricing demonstration projects under the Urban Partnerships Congestion Initiative, for US$1 billion of federal funding. The five projects under this initiative are Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, State Route 520 serving downtown Seattle and communities to its east, Interstate 95 between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale, Interstate 35W serving downtown Minneapolis, and a variable rate parking meter system in Chicago plus Metro ExpressLanes in Los Angeles County, which replaced New York City after it left the program in 2008.

San Francisco transport authorities began a feasibility study in 2006 to evaluate the introduction of congestion pricing. The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction implementations, allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements and bike and pedestrian enhancements. The initial pricing scenarios were presented in public meetings conducted in December 2008, and the final study results were announced in November 2010, proposing modified alternatives based on the public&#x27;s feedbacks, and the updated proposal calls for implementing a six-month to one-year trial in 2015. 

Governor Andrew Cuomo reintroduced a congestion pricing proposal for New York City in 2017 in response to the New York City Subway&#x27;s state of emergency, a proposal that Mayor Bill de Blasio opposed. A commission to investigate the feasibility of congestion pricing, organized in late 2017, found that a congestion pricing scheme could benefit New York City. Cuomo&#x27;s congestion pricing plan was approved in March 2019, though congestion pricing in New York City would not go into effect until 2022 at the earliest. New York City&#x27;s congestion pricing zone will be the first in North America. The Federal Highway Administration gave its final approval on June 26, 2023, allowing the MTA to begin setting toll rates for the proposed congestion zone. Implementation was scheduled for 30 June 2024, but in an announcement by Governor Kathy Hochul on 5 June 2024, the plan was indefinitely postponed. In November 2024, Hochul announced an intent for the toll to go forward with a planned implementation in 5 January 2025, at a reduced rate.

===== China =====

In September 2011, local officials announced plans to introduce congestion pricing in Beijing. No details were provided regarding the magnitude of the congestion charges or the charge zone. The measure was initially proposed in 2010 and was recommended by the World Bank. A similar scheme was proposed for the city Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in early 2010. The city opened a public discussion on whether to introduce congestion charges. An online survey conducted by two local news outlets found that 84.4% of respondents opposed the charges.

In December 2015, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced plans to introduce congestion charges in 2016. According to city&#x27;s motor vehicle emission control plan 2013–2017, the congestion charge will be a real-time variable pricing scheme based on actual traffic flows and emissions data, and allow the fee to be charged for different vehicles and varying by time of the day and for different districts. The Dongcheng and Xicheng are among the districts that are most likely to firstly implement congestion charge. Vehicle emissions account for 31% of the city&#x27;s smog sources, according to Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The local government has implemented already several policies to address air quality and congestion, such as a driving restriction scheme based upon the last digits on their license plates. Also a vehicle quota system was introduced in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units set by the city authority for 2017. In May 2016, the Beijing city legislature announced it will consider to start levying traffic congestion charges by 2020 as part of a package of measures to reform the vehicle quota system. , the city&#x27;s environmental and transport departments are working together on a congestion pricing proposal.

===== Brazil =====
In January 2012, the federal government of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to encourage the use of public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies to transit fares. The law went into effect in April 2013.

In April 2012, one of the committees of the São Paulo city council approved a bill to introduce congestion pricing within the same area as the existing road space rationing () by the last digit of the license plate, which has been in force 1996. The proposed charge is R$4 (~ ) per day and it is expected to reduce traffic by 30% and raise about R$2.5 billion (~ billion) per year, most of which will be destined to the expansion of the São Paulo Metro system and bus corridors. The bill still needs approval by two other committees before going for a final vote at the city council. Since 1995, 11 bills have been presented in the city council to introduce congestion pricing. Opinion surveys have shown that the initiative is highly umpopular. A survey by &quot;Veja&quot; magazine found that 80% of drivers are against congestion pricing, and another survey by &quot;Exame&quot; magazine found that only 1% of São Paulo&#x27;s residents support the initiative, while 30% find that extending the metro system is a better solution to reduce traffic congestion. São Paulo&#x27;s strategic urban development plan &quot;SP 2040&quot;, approved in November 2012, proposes the implementation of congestion pricing by 2025, when the density of metro and bus corridors is expected to reach 1.25 km/km2. The Plan also requires ample consultation and even a referendum before beginning implementation.

===== Thailand =====

In October 2024, Thailand&#x27;s Ministry of Transport announced plans for a 40-50 Baht congestion charge for motorists who enter streets in inner Bangkok. The funds would be used to subsidize a 20 Baht fare for all railway lines in Greater Bangkok. The plans were supported by Governor of Bangkok Chadchart Sittipunt, who advocated for an expansion of Bangkok&#x27;s transit network, including electric train and bus service along with pedestrian infrastructure.

=== Urban corridors and toll rings ===

Congestion pricing has also been implemented in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours in order to maintain reasonable speeds within the city core.

Norway pioneered the implementation of electronic urban tolling in the main corridors of Norway&#x27;s three major cities: Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and Trondheim (1991). In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect is similar to a congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. The measure is intended to cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and relieve traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tønsberg.

The Norwegian electronic toll collection system is called AutoPASS and is part of the joint venture EasyGo.

=== Single facilities ===

==== Urban ====
Congestion pricing has also been applied to specific roadways. The first of this kind of specific schemes allowed users of low or single-occupancy vehicles to use a high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT) lanes, and it has been introduced mainly in the United States and Canada. The first practical implementations was California&#x27;s private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 in San Diego. There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called &quot;Lexus&quot; lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk to the rich. According to the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were in the United States 722 corridor-miles of HOV lanes, 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction.

Congestion pricing in the form of variable tolls by time-of-the-day have also been implemented in bridges and tunnels providing access to the central business districts of several major cities. In most cases there was a toll already in existence. Dynamic pricing is relatively rare compared to variable pricing. One example of dynamic tolling is Interstate 66 in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where at times of severe congestion tolls can reach almost . However, on average, round trip prices are much lower: $11.88 (2019), $5.04 (2020), $4.75 (2021).

In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) implemented a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an E-ZPass issued in New York State. These discount toll was implemented at several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey, including the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and Holland Tunnel, and at some other bridges administered by PANYNJ. Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles with a fuel economy of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass, which allows for a 50% discount during off-peak hours as compared to the regular full toll.

In January 2009, variable tolls were implemented at Sydney Harbour Bridge, two weeks after upgrading to 100% free-flow electronic toll collection. The highest fees are charged during the morning and afternoon peak periods; a toll 25% lower applies for the shoulder periods; and a toll lower than the previously existing is charged at nights, weekends, and public holidays. This is Australia&#x27;s first road congestion pricing scheme, and has had only a very minor effect on traffic levels, reducing them by 0.19%.

In July 2010 congestion tolls were implemented at the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. The Bay Bridge congestion pricing scheme charges a toll from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. During weekends cars pay . The toll remained at the previous toll of at all other times on weekdays. According to the Bay Area Toll Authority fewer users are driving during the peak hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge before and after the 5–10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect. The agency also reported that commute delays in the first six months have dropped by an average of 15 percent compared with 2009. When the congestion tolls were proposed, the agency expected the scheme to produce a 20 to 30 percent drop in commute traffic.

==== Non-urban ====
Autoroute A1 in Northern France is one of the few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings.

==== Measurement of effects ====

In a road network, congestion can be considered a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference. However, this technical definition of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind.

To measure the true effects of any traffic management scheme it is normally necessary to establish a baseline, or &quot;do nothing&quot; case, which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes. Notably this was not done for the London Congestion Charging Scheme, which has led to claims that it is not possible to determine the extent of the actual influence of the scheme. Regardless of the scheme&#x27;s impact, in a retrospective analysis Transport for London (TfL) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity. In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.

In 2013, ten years since its implementation, TfL reported that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network in order to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.

==== New York City Congestion Pricing Environmental Assessment Study ====
In May 2023, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) finalized and published the Environmental Assessment (EA) of the congestion program which included a public comment period of 30 days, ending on June 12, 2023. The EA included a comprehensive regional study of 22 million people taking 28.8 million journeys per average weekday in a 28-county area covering New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the regional study, the MTA along with other sponsoring organizations included data from local studies as well as county data and observed significant patterns if congestion pricing were implemented. By June 22, 2023, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) published its Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) decision of the project. Under the FONSI decision, the FHWA found that the EA addressed public input, considered the impacts, and appropriately mitigated adverse effects. In the EA, it showed potential improvements on regional air quality as some drivers will shift from vehicle transportation to transit within the New York Metropolitan region. 
 The EA reports 7 “alternative” scenarios for the congestion pricing project with the outlier differences where congestion pricing is fully implemented (known as “Scenario A”) and the scenario where no action is taken from the project. The result of congestion pricing (Scenario A) in relative to the “no action” alternative is a 7.1% to 9.2% reduction in daily vehicle miles traveled, a 15.4% to 19.9% reduction in the number of vehicles entering congestion zone, and would have an estimated $1.02 to $1.48 billion net revenue for the program. Nitrogen oxide emissions would have been estimated to drop by 9.54% within the zone and approximately 5.96% in New York County (Manhattan). Other pollutants such as carbon emissions would have been expected to drop by 11.48% as well as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 &amp; PM10) by 11.37% and 12.16% respectively.

The study also projects an increase in air pollutants in neighboring areas outside of the congestion zone. In particular, Bergen County in New Jersey would have been estimated to observe a 0.63% increase in nitrogen oxide emissions if congestion tolls are placed. Residents of the Bronx would have seen a 0.09% increase in nitrogen oxide emissions. Other areas with similar increasing air pollutant projections include Richmond and Putnam counties. Furthermore, the EA also indicated a slight significance on the number of vehicles on some highways if congestion pricing were implemented but showed a lack of significance in vehicle miles traveled. The EA data for a 2045 projection projected a 10.4% reduction in crossings from Brooklyn to the congestion zone which includes the BQE (Brooklyn-Queens Expressway) and other connected entryways such as the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge. Under congestion pricing, there will be a 5.4% decrease in vehicles on FDR Drive. These reductions represent 16,000 to 42,000 fewer people accessing the congestion zone in a private automobile on an average weekday.

The EA reported a lack of significant change in congestion (in vehicle miles traveled). For instance, the highway, FDR Drive would have been projected to experience a 0.2% increase in vehicle miles traveled. Nonetheless, some officials remain optimistic, citing that congestion pricing would have reduced the amount of traffic especially in areas like the BQE by around 7-10%.

====Academic debate and concerns====

Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by Cervero:
True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many.

Both Button and Small et al., have identified the following issues:
* The real-world demand functions for urban road travel are more complex than the theoretical functions used in transport economics analysis. Congestion pricing was developed as a first-best solution, based on the assumption that the optimal price of road space equals the marginal cost price if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced. In the real world this is not true, thus, actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second-best solution. Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing, the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers (such as extra delay) and on society as a whole (such as air pollution). The practical challenge of setting optimal link-based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link-specific speed-flow curves can be known precisely. Therefore, transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience.
* Inequality issue: A main concern is the possibility of undesirable distribution repercussions because of the diversity of road users. The use of the tolled road depends on the user&#x27;s level of income. Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worse off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. Road space rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing. However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site) are relatively more impacted.
* There are difficulties in deciding how to allocate the revenues raised. This is a controversial issue among scholars. The revenues can be used to improve public transport (as is the case in London), or to invest in new road infrastructure (as in Oslo). Some academics make the case that revenues should be disposed as a direct transfer payments to former road users. Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax, however this is precisely one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers.

One alternative, aimed at avoiding inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system would be similar to the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.

==== Public controversy ====
Experience from the few cities where congestion pricing has been implemented shows that social and political acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.

Congestion pricing remains highly controversial with the public both before and after implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted to those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.

Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity and land use, as the benefits are usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only. However, congestion pricing schemes have been used with the main objective of improving urban quality and to preserve historical heritage in the small cities.

The effects of a charge on business have been disputed; reports have shops and businesses being heavily impacted by the cost of the charge, both in terms of lost sales and increased delivery costs in London, while others show that businesses were then supporting the charge six months after implementation. Reports show business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both productivity and profitability and that the charge had a &quot;broadly neutral impact&quot; on the London wide economy, while others claim an average drop in business of 25% following the 2007 extension.

Other criticism has been raised concerning the environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone, with critics claiming that congestion pricing would create &quot;parking lots&quot; and add more traffic and pollution to those neighborhoods, and the imposition of a regressive tax on some commuters. Stockholm&#x27;s trial of congestion pricing, however, showed a reduction in traffic in areas outside the congestion zone. Other opponents argue that the pricing could become a tax on middle- and lower-class residents, since those citizens would be affected the most financially. The installation of cameras for tracking purposes may also raise civil liberties concerns.

=== Effects ===
A 2019 study of congestion pricing in Stockholm between 2006 and 2010 found that in the absence of congestion pricing that Stockholm&#x27;s air would have been 5 to 15 percent more polluted between 2006 and 2010&quot;, and that young children would have suffered substantially more asthma attacks. A 2020 study that analyzed driving restrictions in Beijing estimated that the implementation of congestion pricing would reduce total traffic, increase traffic speed, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce traffic accidents, and increase tax revenues. A 2020 study of London found that congestion pricing (introduced in 2003) led to reductions in pollution and reductions in driving, but it increased pollution from diesel vehicles (which were exempt from the congestion pricing). A 2021 study found that congestion pricing reduced emissions through downsizing commuting distances and housing sizes.

A 2013 study found that after congestion pricing was implemented in Seattle, drivers reported greater satisfaction with the routes covered by congestion pricing and reported lower stress.

A 2016 study found that more people used public transportation due to increases in congestion pricing in Singapore. A 2016 study found that real estate prices dropped by 19% within the cordoned-off areas of Singapore where congestion pricing was in place relative to the areas outside of the area.

== Waterways ==

=== Panama Canal booking system and auction ===
The Panama Canal has a limited capacity determined by operational times and cycles of the existing locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, and the need for permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.

Considering the high operational costs of the vessels (container ships have daily operational costs of approximately ), the long queues that occur during the high season (sometimes up to a week&#x27;s delay), and the high value of some of the cargo transported through the canal, the ACP implemented a congestion pricing scheme to allow a better management of the scarce capacity available and to increase the level of service offered to the shipping companies. The scheme gave users two choices: (1) transit by order of arrival on a first-come first-served basis, as the canal historically has operated or (2) booked service for a fee—a congestion charge.

The booked service allowed two options of fees. The Transit Booking System, available online, allowing customers who do not want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder. The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships, container ships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.

The highest toll for high priority passage paid through the Transit Slot Auction was charged on a tanker in August 2006, bypassing a 90-ship queue awaiting the end of maintenance works on the Gatun locks, thus avoiding a seven-day delay. The normal fee would have been just . The average regular toll is around .

== Airports ==

Many airports are facing extreme congestion, runway capacity being the scarcest resource. Congestion pricing schemes have been proposed to mitigate this problem, including slot auctions, such as with the Panama Canal, but implementation has been piecemeal. The first scheme was started in 1968 when higher landing fees for peak-hour use by aircraft with 25 seats or fewer at Newark, Kennedy, and LaGuardia airports in New York City. As a result of the higher charges, general aviation activity during peak periods decreased by 30%. These fees were applied until deregulation of the industry, but higher fees for general aviation were kept to discourage this type of operations at New York&#x27;s busiest airports. In 1988 a higher landing fee for smaller aircraft at Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport was adopted; with this measure much of the general aviation abandoned Logan for secondary airports. In both US cases the pricing scheme was challenged in court. In the case of Boston, the judge ruled in favor of general aviation users due to lack of alternative airports. In the case of New York, the judge dismissed the case because &quot;the fee was a justified means of relieving congestion&quot;.

Congestion pricing has also been implemented for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing for all types of commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.

In 1991, the Athens Airport charged a 25% higher landing fee for those aircraft arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee to the basic weight charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London&#x27;s main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft. For example, in the case of a Boeing 757, the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.

<text>John Derrick Mordaunt Snagge (8 May 190425 March 1996) was a British newsreader and commentator on BBC Radio.

==Life==
Born in Chelsea, London, Snagge was educated at Winchester College and Pembroke College, Oxford, where he obtained a degree in law. He then joined the BBC, taking up the position of assistant director at Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s new relay station 6ST. He broadcast his first sports commentary (of a Hull City versus Stoke City football match) in January 1927, after the BBC obtained the rights to cover major sporting events.

In 1928, Snagge was transferred to London to work as one of the BBC&#x27;s main announcers alongside Stuart Hibberd. From 1931 until 1980, he commentated on the annual Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. He provided commentary for the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and again in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He also announced on 6 February 1952 at 11:15 the Death of King George VI.

At the start of the Second World War, Snagge was made the BBC&#x27;s presentation director and delivered important radio announcements as the war unfolded. By the time of the D-Day landings in 1944, he was presenting the magazine programme &quot;War Report&quot; which featured regular news from the beaches of Normandy. He announced that Allied Armies have started landing &quot;on the northern coast of France&quot; at 9.32 am on 6 June, but without giving the actual location (Normandy).

In the early 1950s, Snagge played a role in negotiations that led to the radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; being commissioned by the BBC. He was also the subject of many running gags during the show, and provided many self-parodying announcements, usually recorded. He also featured as himself in the episode &quot;The Greenslade Story&quot;, alongside regular announcer Wallace Greenslade. He was a defender of the show against many efforts to cancel it, even to staking his career on it. Later, in the 1970s, he echoed his wartime role by appearing as the newsreader in the radio version of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, setting the scene at the beginning of each episode.

He appeared as himself in the 1960 TV &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; episode, &#x27;The East Cheam Centenary&#x27;, where he commentates on the street &#x27;procession&#x27;, from Hancock&#x27;s bedroom at 23 Railway Cuttings. He also played himself in a 1961 episode of &quot;Here&#x27;s Harry&quot; called &#x27;The Request&#x27;.

Snagge retired in 1965, but continued to provide commentaries for the Boat Race until 1980. The same year his wife Eileen died. Around this time he also appeared on Noel Edmonds&#x27;s Radio 1 show on Sunday mornings, a role subsequently taken up by Brian Perkins.

When BBC Radio Stoke-on-Trent (now BBC Radio Stoke) was launched in 1968 Snagge introduced the new station by apologising for the break in transmission that had occurred on 30 October 1928, i.e. the close of 6ST, and that it was &quot;due to circumstances beyond our control. Normal transmission has now been resumed&quot;.

He voiced the commentary on the Sex Pistols track, Pistols Propaganda, which appeared on the B-side of their single (I&#x27;m Not Your) Stepping Stone. The track is the soundtrack to the trailer for their film, The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle.

During the 1949 University Boat Race Snagge&#x27;s voice filled with excitement and he reported: &quot;I can&#x27;t see who&#x27;s in the lead but it&#x27;s either Oxford or Cambridge&quot;.

He was the guardian of Wally Hope, founder of the Stonehenge Free Festival, until his premature death in 1975.

John Snagge died in Slough from throat cancer in 1996, aged 91.

==Family==

Snagge was the son of Sir Thomas Mordaunt Snagge (1868–1955), also known as Judge Mordaunt Snagge, knighted in 1931, and Gwendaline Rose Emily Colomb (1876–1966).

His paternal grandfather was Sir Thomas William Snagge, KCMG (1837–1914). His mother&#x27;s father was the British naval strategist, Sir John Colomb, KCMG (1838–1909).

He was married twice: firstly, in 1936, to Eileen Mary Joscelyne (the daughter of Harry Percy Joscelyne). She died in 1980. He married, secondly, Joan Wilson in 1982. She predeceased him in 1992.

<text>In the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the Rules of Acquisition are a collection of sacred business proverbs of the ultra-capitalist race known as the Ferengi.

The first mention of rules in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe was in &quot;The Nagus&quot;, an episode of the TV series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (Season 1, Episode 10). In a later &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode, &quot;The Maquis: Part 1&quot;, Sakonna (a Vulcan) asks Quark (a Ferengi) to explain what a Rule of Acquisition is. He states, &quot;Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by 285 Rules of Acquisition to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned... well most of them anyway.&quot;

==Background==
The first Rule was made by Gint, the first Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, a role with political, economic, and even quasi-religious duties. The Rules were said to be divinely inspired and sacred (thus furthering the original marketing ploy).

Although it has been stated within &quot;Star Trek&quot; that there are 285 Rules, not all of them have been stated in canon. Most of the Rules were written by Ira Steven Behr, a writer for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, in a book &quot;The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition&quot; (). The book&#x27;s cover credits authorship as being &quot;By Quark as told to Ira Steven Behr.&quot; Additional rules were published in &quot;Legends of the Ferengi&quot; () by Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe, another writer for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; when Behr was the executive producer of the series.

The &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;False Profits&quot; mentions a book containing all of the Rules:

<doc id="229089" wikidata="Q1003655" url="?curid=229089" title="François Séverin Marceau">
<text>François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers (; 1 March 1769 – 21 September 1796) was a French general of the Revolutionary Wars.

==Early life==
Desgraviers was born on 1 March 1769 in Chartres, in the province of Orléanais, the son of a prosecutor. In December 1785, at the age of 16, he enlisted in the Angoulême Infantry Regiment, which later became the 34th Infantry Regiment of the French Army. While on furlough in Paris, Marceau participated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. After that event he took his discharge from the regular army and returned to Chartres, but the opposition of his family soon compelled him to seek new military employment.
==Revolutionary Wars==
In July 1792, Marceau was appointed captain of the Revolutionary Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion of Volunteers of Eure-et-Loir. He took part in the defence of Verdun later in the year, and it was his troop that was ordered to bear the proposals of capitulation to the Prussian camp. The defenders&#x27; lack of morale provoked the anger of the revolutionary authorities, and Marceau was fortunate to find re-employment as a captain in the regular service. However, early in 1793, he along with other officers under suspicion was arrested and imprisoned for a period.

===Vendée===
On his release, Marceau hurried to take part in the defence of Saumur against the Vendéean Royalists, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Saumur on 10 June 1793 by rescuing the representative Pierre Bourbotte from the hands of the insurgents. The National Convention voted him the thanks of the country and he received rapid promotion. His conduct at the Battle of Chantonnay on 5 September 1793 won him the provisional rank of general of brigade. On 17 October, he bore a great part in the victory at the Battle of Cholet, and on began his friendship with Jean Baptiste Kléber while on the field of battle.

Kléber was made a general of division, and Marceau confirmed as general of brigade. Marceau in turn became a &quot;général de division&quot; on 10 November; then succeeded to the commander-in-chief &quot;ad interim&quot;. With Kléber, he crushed the Vendean rebels at the Battle of Le Mans on 12–13 December and at the Battle of Savenay on 23 December 1793.

In the wake of Le Mans, Marceau had rescued and protected a young Royalist lady, Angélique des Mesliers, with whom it has been supposed Marceau fell in love – however, even his help could not save her from the guillotine.

He and Kléber themselves were saved from arrest and execution only by the intervention of Bourbotte. Around this time Marceau became engaged to Agathe Leprêtre de Châteaugiron, but the marriage was prevented by his constant military employment, his broken health and the opposition of both Auguste-Félicité Le Prestre de Châteaugiron and Marceau&#x27;s devoted half-sister Emira, wife of the Republican politician Antoine Joseph Sergent.

===Battles of 1795–96===
After spending the winter of 1793–94 in Paris, Marceau accepted a command in the army under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan alongside Kléber and took part in the various battles near Charleroi. During the battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794 he had a horse shot from under him. He distinguished himself at Jülich, at Aldenhoven and at Koblenz, where he stormed the enemy lines on 23 October.

He took part in the 1795-1796 campaign with the armies of the Sambre and Meuse, fighting on the Rhine and the Lahn and distinguishing himself alongside Kléber and future king of Sweden and marshal of France Charles XIV John (Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) near Neuwied and Sulzbach.

He became a close companion of Jean Baptiste Bernadotte and they shared many victories, often working together as an effective duo. At Neuwied he held Kléber and Bernadotte&#x27;s rear, going so far as to threaten to &quot;shoot himself from mortification&quot; if his men were to fail to hold. It was effective, and the retreat was successful.

===Death===

After Jourdan and Jean Victor Marie Moreau&#x27;s Rhine Campaign of 1796 ended in defeat, Marceau&#x27;s men covered Jourdan&#x27;s retreat over the Rhine. Marceau fought in the desperate Battle of Limburg on the Lahn River (16–19 September 1796). While conducting a successful rear guard action near Altenkirchen on 19 September, he received a mortal wound. He died two days later in the early morning, aged only twenty-seven.

The Austrians competed with Marceau&#x27;s own countrymen to honour the dead general. His body was burned and the ashes placed under a pyramid in Koblenz designed by Kléber. They were transferred to the Panthéon in 1889.

Marceau was immortalized in Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;:

:LVI

:By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
:There is a small and simple pyramid,
:Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
:Beneath its base are heroes&#x27; ashes hid,
:Our enemy&#x27;s – but let not that forbid
:Honour to Marceau! o&#x27;er whose early tomb
:Tears, big tears, gush&#x27;d from the rough soldier&#x27;s lid,
:Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
:Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.

:LVII

:Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career, —
:His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
:And fitly may the stranger lingering here
:Pray for his gallant spirit&#x27;s bright repose;
:For he was Freedom&#x27;s champion, one of those,
:The few in number, who had not o&#x27;erstept
:The charter to chastise which she bestows
:On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
:The whiteness of his soul, and thus men o&#x27;er him wept.

<text>Hot-dip galvanization is a form of galvanization. It is the process of coating iron and steel with zinc, which alloys with the surface of the base metal when immersing the metal in a bath of molten zinc at a temperature of around . When exposed to the atmosphere, the pure zinc (Zn) reacts with oxygen (O2) to form zinc oxide (ZnO), which further reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), a usually dull grey, fairly strong material that protects the steel underneath from further corrosion in many circumstances. Galvanized steel is widely used in applications where corrosion resistance is needed without the cost of stainless steel, and is considered superior in terms of cost and life-cycle. It can be identified by the crystallization patterning on the surface (often called a &quot;spangle&quot;).

Galvanized steel can be welded; however, one must exercise caution around the resulting toxic zinc fumes. Galvanized fumes are released when the galvanized metal reaches a certain temperature. This temperature varies by the galvanization process used. In long-term, continuous exposure, the recommended maximum temperature for hot-dip galvanized steel is , according to the American Galvanizers Association. The use of galvanized steel at temperatures above this will result in peeling of the zinc at the &quot;inter-metallic&quot; layer
. Electrogalvanized sheet steel is often used in automotive manufacturing to enhance the corrosion performance of exterior body panels; this is, however, a completely different process which tends to achieve lower coating thicknesses of zinc.

Like other corrosion protection systems, galvanizing protects steel by acting as a barrier between steel and the atmosphere. However, zinc is a more electropositive (active) metal in comparison to steel. This is a unique characteristic for galvanizing, which means that when a galvanized coating is damaged and steel is exposed to the atmosphere, zinc can continue to protect steel through galvanic corrosion (often within an annulus of 5 mm, above which electron transfer rate decreases).

== Process ==
The process of hot-dip galvanizing results in a metallurgical bond between zinc and steel, with a series of distinct iron-zinc alloys. The resulting coated steel can be used in much the same way as uncoated.

A typical hot-dip galvanizing line operates as follows:

* Steel is cleaned using a caustic solution. This removes oil/grease, dirt, and paint.
* The caustic cleaning solution is rinsed off.
* The steel is pickled in an acidic solution to remove mill scale.
* The pickling solution is rinsed off.
* A flux, often zinc ammonium chloride is applied to the steel to inhibit oxidation of the cleaned surface upon exposure to air. The flux is allowed to dry on the steel and aids in the process of the liquid zinc wetting and adhering to the steel.
* The steel is dipped into the molten zinc bath and held there until the temperature of the steel equals that of the bath.
* The steel is cooled in a quench tank to reduce its temperature and inhibit undesirable reactions of the newly formed coating with the atmosphere.

Lead is often added to the molten zinc bath to improve the fluidity of the bath (thus limiting excess zinc on the dipped product by improved drainage properties), help prevent floating dross, make dross recycling easier and protect the kettle from uneven heat distribution from the burners. Environmental regulations in the United States disapprove of lead in the kettle bath. Lead is either added to primary Z1 grade zinc or already contained in used secondary zinc. A third, declining method is to use low Z5 grade zinc.

Steel strip can be hot-dip galvanized in a continuous line. Hot-dip galvanized steel strip (also sometimes loosely referred to as galvanized iron) is extensively used for applications requiring the strength of steel combined with the resistance to corrosion of zinc, such as roofing and walling, safety barriers, handrails, consumer appliances and automotive body parts. One common use is in metal pails. Galvanised steel is also used in most heating and cooling duct systems in buildings

Individual metal articles, such as steel girders or wrought iron gates, can be hot-dip galvanized by a process called batch galvanizing. Other modern techniques have largely replaced hot-dip for these sorts of roles. This includes &quot;electrogalvanizing&quot;, which deposits the layer of zinc from an aqueous electrolyte by electroplating, forming a thinner and much stronger bond.

In some cases, it may be desirable to have designated parts of the metal as non-galvanized. This is often desired when metal will be welded after galvanization. To accomplish this, a galvanizer will typically use a masing compound to coat the areas that will not be galvanized during the hot dip process.

== History ==
In 1742, French chemist Paul Jacques Malouin described a method of coating iron by dipping it in molten zinc in a presentation to the French Royal Academy.

In 1772, Luigi Galvani, for whom galvanizing was named, discovered the electrochemical process that takes place between metals during an experiment with frog legs.

In 1801, Alessandro Volta furthered the research on galvanizing when he discovered the electro-potential between two metals, creating a corrosion cell.

In 1836, French chemist Stanislas Sorel obtained a patent for a method of coating iron with zinc, after first cleaning it with 9% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and fluxing it with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).

==Specification==
A hot-dip galvanized coating is relatively easier and cheaper to specify than an organic paint coating of equivalent corrosion protection performance. The British, European and International standard for hot-dip galvanizing is BS EN ISO 1461, which specifies a minimum coating thickness to be applied to steel in relation to the steels section thickness e.g. a steel fabrication with a section size thicker than 6 mm shall have a minimum galvanized coating thickness of 85 μm.

Further performance and design information for galvanizing can be found in BS EN ISO 14713-1 and BS EN ISO 14713-2. 
The durability performance of a galvanized coating depends solely on the corrosion rate of the environment in which it is placed. Corrosion rates for different environments can be found in BS EN ISO 14713-1, where typical corrosion rates are given, along with a description of the environment in which the steel would be used.

<text>Barry Gray (born John Livesey Eccles; 18 July 1908 – 26 April 1984) was a British musician and composer best known for his collaborations with television and film producer Gerry Anderson.

==Life and career==
Born into a musical family in Blackburn, Lancashire, Gray was encouraged to pursue a musical career from an early age. Starting at the age of five – with piano lessons – he studied diligently and became a student at the Manchester Royal College of Music and at Blackburn Cathedral. He studied composition under the Hungarian born émigré composer Matyas Seiber. Gray&#x27;s first professional job was for B. Feldman &amp; Co. in London, where he gained experience in scoring for theatre and variety orchestras. From there, he joined Radio Normandy as a composer-arranger. After serving for six years with the Royal Air Force during World War II he returned to the music industry to work with such names as Vera Lynn and Hoagy Carmichael.

In 1956 Gray joined Gerry Anderson&#x27;s AP Films and scored its first marionette puppet television series, &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Torchy The Battery Boy&quot; and &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, a puppet Western based on a concept suggested by Gray. His association with Anderson lasted throughout the 1960s. Although best known for his score to &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (in particular the &quot;March of the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;&quot; title music), Gray&#x27;s work also included the themes to all the other &quot;Supermarionation&quot; productions, including &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot;, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Joe 90&quot;. Recording sessions were held at Olympic Studios, Pye Studios and CTS Studios in London, Anvil Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire and Gray&#x27;s own studios at his residence in Esher, Surrey.

Additionally, Gray is known as the composer for the Anderson live-action series of the 1970s, such as &quot;UFO&quot; and &quot;&quot; (though he was not involved in scoring &quot;The Protectors&quot;). His work in cinema included the scores to the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; feature films &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; (1966) and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; (1968), and the live-action science-fiction drama &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (1969). Gray&#x27;s professional association with Anderson and his career in TV and film scoring ended when he decided to leave the production of &quot;Space: 1999&quot; after the completion of the first series. His replacement for the second series was Derek Wadsworth, who composed new title music.

In 1970, Gray moved from Esher to St Peter Port, Guernsey. Later, after his retirement, he served as resident pianist at the Old Government House Hotel. Gray died in hospital on Guernsey on 26 April 1984. He had a son, Simon.

==Composing style==
Gray&#x27;s music is characterised by the use of brass and percussion sections. It made extensive use of leitmotifs, with each machine in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; having its own theme and the eponymous title character of &quot;Joe 90&quot; being accompanied on-screen by a wordless representation of his name. The ensembles required for Gray&#x27;s scoring in series such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Stingray&quot; dwarfed those used in the production of most contemporary television programmes; even the orchestra employed for the first Anderson-produced series to carry the &quot;Supermarionation&quot; label, &quot;Supercar&quot;, comprised some forty instrumentalists. A standout example is &quot;Stingray: March of the Oysters&quot; (1964), which was later recorded by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Nic Raine.

Besides composing and conducting orchestral scores for television and film, Gray developed an interest in the ondes Martenot, which he used to produce unconventional musical notes as well as electronic sound effects in several of his scores, including those for &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (1969). Gray&#x27;s knowledge and recognition in the field resulted in commissions to provide electronic music and sound effects for such films as &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965), &quot;Island of Terror&quot; (1966), and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966), and uncredited work on &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966).

Gray believed that the score for the live action &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; was his best. It was recorded in three studio sessions between 27 and 29 March 1969. The first of these sessions used a 55-member orchestra, the second 44 and the third 28. The scenes of Ross and Kane&#x27;s journey to the Counter-Earth are accompanied by a piece titled &quot;Sleeping Astronauts&quot; featuring the Ondes Martenot, played by French ondiste Sylvette Allart. Archer and Hearn describe this piece as &quot;one of the most enchanting&quot; ever written by Gray, adding that the soundtrack as a whole evokes a &quot;traditional Hollywood feel&quot; in contrast with the film&#x27;s future setting.

Fanderson, the official appreciation society dedicated to the productions of Gerry Anderson, has gained access to all Gray&#x27;s original studio tapes and undertaken a major re-issue project, compiling the theme and incidental music from Gray&#x27;s various collaborations with Anderson onto a series of re-mastered CDs. Silva Screen Records has released several single-disc versions of the tv series soundtracks (&quot;Supercar&quot;, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;) and feature film &quot;Thunderbirds are Go&quot;. Unlike the Fanderson releases (members-only) the Silva Screen discs are available to the general public.

==Centenary concert==
On the evening of 8 November 2008, to mark the centenary year of Gray&#x27;s birth, a concert was held in the Royal Festival Hall at London&#x27;s South Bank Centre. Ralph Titterton, restorer of the Gray archive and co-producer of the original soundtrack CDs, and Cathy Ford, a librarian, researcher and biographer, joined film composer, conductor and arranger François Evans to produce the event in aid of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.

<doc id="229100" wikidata="Q17164755" url="?curid=229100" title="Hearsay in United States law">
<text>Hearsay is testimony from a witness under oath who is reciting an out-of-court statement that is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. 
The Federal Rules of Evidence prohibit introducing hearsay statements during applicable federal court proceedings, unless one of nearly thirty exemptions or exceptions applies. The Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as:

The &quot;declarant&quot; is the person who makes the out-of-court statement. (F.R.E. 801(b)).

The Federal Rules define a &quot;statement&quot; as &quot;a person’s oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion&quot;. (F.R.E. 801(a)). The Supreme Court has further clarified that a &quot;statement&quot; refers to &quot;a single declaration or remark, rather than a report or narrative&quot;. Thus, a trial court must separately analyze each individual statement, &quot;sentence-by-sentence&quot;, rather than analyzing the narrative as whole for hearsay content or exceptions.

&quot;The truth of the matter asserted&quot; means the statement itself is being used as evidence to prove the substance of that statement. For example, if a witness says, &quot;Margot told me she loved Matt&quot; to prove that Margot &quot;did in fact&quot; love Matt, the witness&#x27;s statement is hearsay. Thus, the &quot;reason&quot; a party offers a statement is central to determining whether it qualifies as excludable hearsay.

If a statement is being used to prove something other than the truth of what the statement asserts, it is not inadmissible because of the hearsay rule. A good example is the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Tennessee v. Street&quot; (1985), in which a co-defendant&#x27;s confession was properly admitted against the defendant—not for the hearsay purpose of directly proving that both men jointly committed a robbery and murder—but for the nonhearsay purpose of rebutting the defendant&#x27;s claim that his own confession was elicited through the sheriff&#x27;s coercive tactic of reading his co-defendant&#x27;s confession to him.

In cases where a statement is being offered for a purpose other than the truth of what it asserts, trial judges have discretion to give the jury a limiting instruction, mandating the jury consider the evidence only for its intended, non-hearsay purpose.

Although the Federal Rules of Evidence govern federal proceedings only, 38 states have adopted the Uniform Rules of Evidence, which closely track the Federal Rules.

== Rationale for excluding hearsay ==
The rule excluding hearsay arises from a concern regarding the statement&#x27;s reliability. Courts have four principal concerns with the reliability of witness statements: the witness may be lying (sincerity risk), the witness may have misunderstood the situation (narration risk), the witness&#x27;s memory may be wrong (memory risk), and the witness&#x27;s perception was inaccurate (perception risk). Despite these risks, courts allow testimonial evidence because of in-court safeguards &quot;calculated to discover and expose in detail its possible weaknesses, and thus to enable the tribunal (judge or jury) to estimate it at no more than its actual value&quot;.

These three safeguards reveal possible weaknesses in a statement:

# Witnesses must testify under oath
# Witnesses must be subject to cross-examination
# Witnesses must be present in court for the fact-finder to assess their demeanor and credibility

Thus, courts prohibit hearsay because of the three missing safeguards intended to assuage reliability concerns of testimonial statements.

In the above example, the witness&#x27;s statement &quot;Margot told me she loves Matt&quot; is unreliable because Margot is not under oath, she is not subject to cross-examination, and she is not present in court for the fact-finder to assess her credibility. The statement is just too unreliable to be permitted as evidence in court.

== Non-hearsay statements ==
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement that meets one of the two following conditions is considered not hearsay, and thus admissible. (F.R.E. 801(d)(1))

=== 1. Prior statement of a witness ===
A prior statement by a witness is not hearsay if:

For these circumstances to apply, a witness (the &quot;declarant&quot;) must be presently testifying in the proceeding and available for cross-examination.

If the prior statement is inconsistent with the current statement, the prior statement may be used both for impeachment (to prove the witness is lying) and substantively (for the truth of what the first statement asserts). Similarly, prior consistent statements being used to rebut an attack on the declarant&#x27;s credibility, e.g. that the declarant is lying or biased, can be used for rehabilitation and substantively. The drafters of this section of the rules &quot;felt that the jury should not be required to do mental gymnastics here—the jurors should not be asked to separate credibility use from substantive use.&quot;

The identification exemption applies, for example, where a witness previously identified someone but cannot remember that identification while testifying during trial. In United States Supreme Court Case &quot;United States v. Owens&quot;, 484 U.S. 554 (1988), the Court held a victim&#x27;s previous identification of the defendant as his assailant was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(c), despite memory problems like being unable to remember seeing his attacker. The rationale of this rule is that prior identifications are more reliable because they happened closer in time to the event than to the court proceeding, and thus are more likely to be accurate than an identification (or lack thereof) in court.

=== 2. Opposing party&#x27;s statement ===

Any statement made by one party is admissible as non-hearsay if offered by their opposing party. In civil cases, the plaintiff can introduce all statements made by the defense, and the defense can enter all statements made by the plaintiff into evidence.

The Rules list five circumstances in which an opposing party&#x27;s statement is admissible as non-hearsay:
Bootstrapping. The Rules further explain that the offered statement &quot;does not by itself establish the declarant&#x27;s authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the conspiracy or participation in it under (E).&quot; This requires the offering party to introduce some independent, corroborative evidence proving the circumstances of C, D, or E are met (as opposed to permitting &quot;bootstrapping&quot;, where the statement itself can prove the existence of the conditions). The trial judge then decides, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether these conditions have been proven by evaluating the statement itself and the independent evidence.

Rationale. Unlike other hearsay rules which are concerned principally with reliability, this rule extends common law ideals of adversarial fairness.

== Exceptions to the hearsay rule ==
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain statements that qualify as hearsay are nevertheless admissible as exceptions to the hearsay exclusion rule. Some of these exceptions apply regardless of the declarant&#x27;s availability to testify in court. &quot;See&quot; F.R.E. 803(1)-(23). Others apply only when the declarant is unavailable to testify at the trial or hearing. &quot;See&quot; F.R.E. 804.

Many of the exceptions listed below are treated more extensively in individual articles.

===Exceptions where the declarant&#x27;s availability is irrelevant===

*Excited utterances: Statements relating to startling events or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the &#x27;police officer&#x27; scenario described below. The victim&#x27;s cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, and the victim is still under the stress of the event, as is evidenced by the victim&#x27;s crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance does not have to be made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant&#x27;s statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.
*Present sense impression: A statement expressing the declarant&#x27;s impression of a condition existing at the time the statement was made, such as &quot;it&#x27;s hot in here&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re going really fast.&quot; Unlike an excited utterance, it need not be made in response to a startling event. Instead, it is admissible because it is a condition that the witness would likely have been experiencing at the same time as the declarant, and would instantly be able to corroborate.
*Declarations of present state of mind (then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition): Much like a present-sense impression describes the outside world, declarant&#x27;s statement to the effect of &quot;I am angry!&quot; or &quot;I am Napoleon!&quot; will be admissible to prove that the declarant was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant&#x27;s mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements also includes statements about plans or intent (e.g., &quot;I&#x27;m gonna go buy some groceries and get the oil changed in my car on my way home from work&quot;), which can be used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the declarant. However, this exception does not apply to statements about memory or belief that are used to prove the fact remembered, unless the memory/belief is about the validity of terms in the declarant&#x27;s will.
*Statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment: Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. However, the statement must be reasonably related to the treatment, such as medical history, past or present symptoms or sensations, their inception, or their general cause.
*Business records exception: business records created during the ordinary course of business are considered reliable and can usually be brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John&#x27;s speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer&#x27;s daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the business records exception.
*Prior inconsistent statements: Many states have departed from the approach of the federal rules with respect to inconsistent statements. Under current law in these jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness (even when not made under oath at a judicial proceeding or deposition) is admissible as substantive evidence provided the declarant signed the statement.
*Other exceptions, declarant&#x27;s availability immaterial: In the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, separate exceptions are made for public records, family records, and records in ancient documents of established authenticity. When regular or public records are kept, the &quot;absence&quot; of such records may also be used as admissible hearsay evidence.

===Exceptions where the declarant is unavailable===

*Dying declarations and other statements under belief of impending death: often depicted in films; the police officer asks the person on his deathbed, &quot;Who attacked you?&quot; and the victim replies, &quot;The butler did it.&quot; In reality, case law has ruled out this exception in criminal law, because the witness should always be cross-examined in court; however, there is an exception to this exception for criminal cases: even though generally inadmissible to matters relating to criminal law, the exception has been carved out for actions relating to homicide cases [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)].
*Declaration against interest: A statement that would incriminate or expose the declarant to liability to such an extent that it can be assumed he would only make such a statement if it were true. It would be assumed that one would lie to further one&#x27;s interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing oneself to criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.
**Admission of guilt: if a declarant makes a statement, verbal or otherwise, as an admission of guilt of &quot;the matter at hand&quot;, that statement is admissible. Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.
*Prior testimony: if the testimony was given under oath and the party against whom the testimony is being proffered was present and had the opportunity to cross examine the witness at that time. Often used to enter depositions into the court record at trial.
*Forfeiture by wrongdoing: the party against whom the statement is now offered (1) intentionally made the declarant unavailable; (2) with intent to prevent declarant&#x27;s testimony; (3) by wrongdoing.

===Theories supporting exceptions===
In some jurisdictions, such as Canada, the limited exceptions format to the rule have been replaced by a more general theory of exceptions to the hearsay rule that allows courts to decide when documents, testimony or other evidentiary proof can be used that might not otherwise be considered. 

The underlying rationale for many of the hearsay exceptions is that the circumstances of a particular statement make them reliable enough to be heard by a trier of fact. Statements made during the course of medical treatment, for example, are considered reliable because patients typically have little reason to lie to a doctor while they are being treated, and will generally be accurate in describing their ailments.

This, of course, is not always true. Patients do sometimes lie to their doctors (to get painkillers to which they are not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.

== Hearsay-within-hearsay ==
Hearsay-within-hearsay, or &quot;double hearsay&quot;, occurs when multiple out-of-court assertions appear in one statement. For example, if a witness testifies, &quot;Officer Lincoln told me that he interviewed the defendant Claire, who admitted that she committed the robbery.&quot; There are two layers of hearsay here; two out-of-court declarants. The first layer is what Officer Lincoln told the witness about conducting an interview. Officer Lincoln is the first declarant: &quot;I interviewed the defendant.&quot; The second layer is what the defendant Claire told Officer Lincoln during that interview. Defendant Claire is the second declarant: &quot;I committed the robbery.&quot;

The Federal Rules clarify that each layer of hearsay must have an exemption or exception for the entire statement to be admissible. (F.R.E. 805). The second layer of hearsay, what Defendant Claire said about the robbery, can be admitted as an opposing party&#x27;s statement. But the first layer, Officer Lincoln&#x27;s statement to the witness, still needs an exception or exemption for the entire statement to be admissible under the hearsay rules.

Rationale. As legal evidence scholar Paul F. Rothstein describes the double-hearsay problem:

==Application==
Generally in common law courts the &quot;hearsay rule&quot; applies, which says that a trier of fact (judge or jury) cannot be informed of a hearsay statement unless it meets certain strict requirements. However, the rules for admissibility are more relaxed in court systems based on the civil law system. In the civil law system, the courts, whether consisting only of judges or featuring a jury, have wide latitude to appreciate the evidence brought before them.

[Note: Louisiana, a civil-law jurisdiction, does not share the above referenced feature generally found in civil-law jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Louisiana follows rules predicated upon the Federal Rules of Evidence.]

Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the hearsay rule only applies to actual trials. Hearsay is admissible as evidence in many other judicial proceedings, such as grand jury deliberations, probation hearings, parole revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.

In criminal law, &quot;Crawford v. Washington&quot;, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated the standard for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. &quot;Crawford&quot; gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the declarant knows that the statement is likely to be used in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest. When statements are directly accusatory, the defense needs an opportunity to explore the accuser&#x27;s motives. Where statements are the product of police interrogation, there is a need to ensure that the testimony is not the product of improper coercion or intimidation.

&quot;Ohio v. Roberts&quot;, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), set forth a two-pronged test in order for hearsay to be admissible against a criminal defendant: (1) the declarant generally must be shown to be unavailable; and (2) the statement must have been made under circumstances providing sufficient &quot;indicia of reliability&quot;. With respect to the second prong, a reliability determination may assume that hearsay is sufficiently reliable for constitutional purposes if it satisfies a &quot;firmly rooted&quot; hearsay exception. In practice this means that lower courts need to make reliability determinations only for hearsay that is offered under a &quot;catchall&quot; exception, such as Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 807, or under new or non-traditional hearsay exceptions that are not &quot;firmly rooted&quot;. However, &quot;Crawford v. Washington&quot; overruled &quot;Ohio v. Roberts&quot;.

==Common misconceptions==
One major misconception about the hearsay rule is that hearsay is never admissible in court. While the general rule is that such evidence is inadmissible, there are many exceptions.

There are two other common misconceptions concerning the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The hearsay rule applies to all out-of-court statements whether oral, written or otherwise. The Federal Rules of Evidence defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion. Even written documents made under oath, such as affidavits or notarized statements, are subject to the hearsay rule.

The second common misconception is that all out-of-court statements are hearsay. This is not the case. An out of court statement may or may not be hearsay depending on the purpose for which it is offered. If the statement is being offered to prove the truth of what it asserts, then it becomes hearsay. When offered for any other purpose the statement is not hearsay. For example: Witness testifies that yesterday he spoke to Jim (who was in Vermont) on the phone and that Jim made the following statement, &quot;It&#x27;s raining in Vermont!&quot; If the attorney is seeking to use this statement to prove that it was in fact raining in Vermont, then it is hearsay. But, if the attorney is seeking to use the statement to prove that the phone lines were working that day, or that Jim had not lost the power of speech, or for any other purpose, then the statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.

Consider an additional example:

If the witness testifies, &quot;The truck that struck the yellow car was blue&quot;, the statement is &quot;not&quot; hearsay. The witness is not testifying about a past statement. He is not relating in court what someone outside of court said, but is merely relating an observation.

The rule that a person&#x27;s own statements can be considered hearsay may be confusing. By &quot;forgetting&quot; who is testifying on the stand and merely looking for statements like &quot;I said&quot;, &quot;I wrote&quot;, &quot;I testified before that&quot;, &quot;The document says&quot;, and the like, most confusion can be eliminated.

In this example, simple logic tells that there is a difference: while the first statement may be true, it does not assert anything about the truth of the matter stated. The witness may have told the officer that the truck was blue, but that may not have been the truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.

<doc id="229103" wikidata="Q2327972" url="?curid=229103" title="Spot welding">
<text>Spot welding (or resistance spot welding) is a type of electric resistance welding used to weld various sheet metal products, through a process in which contacting metal surface points are joined by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current.

The process uses two shaped copper alloy electrodes to concentrate welding current into a small &quot;spot&quot; and to simultaneously clamp the sheets together. Work-pieces are held together under pressure exerted by electrodes. Typically the sheets are in the thickness range. Forcing a large current through the spot will melt the metal and form the weld. The attractive feature of spot welding is that a large amount of energy can be delivered to the spot in a very short time (approximately 10–100 milliseconds). This permits the welding to occur without excessive heating of the remainder of the sheet.

The amount of heat (energy) delivered to the spot is determined by the resistance between the electrodes and the magnitude and duration of the current. The amount of energy is chosen to match the sheet&#x27;s material properties, its thickness, and type of electrodes. Applying too little energy will not melt the metal or will make a poor weld. Applying too much energy will melt too much metal, eject molten material, and make a hole rather than a weld. Another feature of spot welding is that the energy delivered to the spot can be controlled to produce reliable welds.

== Process and equipment ==
Spot welding involves three stages; the first of which involves the electrodes being brought to the surface of the metal and applying a slight amount of pressure. The current from the electrodes is then applied briefly after which the current is removed but the electrodes remain in place for the material to cool. Weld times range from 0.01 sec to 0.63 sec depending on the thickness of the metal, the electrode force and the diameter of the electrodes themselves.

The equipment used in the spot welding process consists of tool holders and electrodes. The tool holders function as a mechanism to hold the electrodes firmly in place and also support optional water hoses that cool the electrodes during welding. Tool holding methods include a paddle-type, light duty, universal, and regular offset. The electrodes generally are made of a low resistance alloy, usually copper, and are designed in many different shapes and sizes depending on the application needed.

The two materials being welded together are known as the workpieces and must conduct electricity. The width of the workpieces is limited by the throat length of the welding apparatus and ranges typically from . Workpiece thickness can range from .

After the current is removed from the workpiece, it is cooled via the coolant holes in the center of the electrodes. Both water and a brine solution may be used as coolants in spot welding mechanisms.

In the case of resistance spot welding, there are two main parts of the tooling system, the features of which fundamentally influence the whole process: the gun and its type, and the size and shape of the electrode. In such application, where the gun layout should be as rigid as possible due to the high applying forces (e.g. welding of thick materials), the C-type gun is widely used. As well as the high resulting rigidity, this arrangement leads to a high tooling flexibility, as the motion of the electrodes is collinear. Unlike the C-type, the so-called X-type arrangement provides less rigidity, although the reachable workspace is far larger than with the C-type, thus this layout is very common, where thin and flat objects are being processed (e.g. manufacturing of floor pan or roof panel). However, it offers less flexibility in terms of tooling, because the paths of the moving electrodes are not collinear (like the tips of a scissor), so a dome-shaped electrode tip should be used. 

Electrodes used in spot welding can vary greatly with different applications. Each tool style has a different purpose. Radius style electrodes are used for high heat applications, electrodes with a truncated tip for high pressure, eccentric electrodes for welding corners, offset eccentric tips for reaching into corners and small spaces, and finally offset truncated for reaching into the workpiece itself.

== Characteristics ==
The spot welding process tends to harden the material, causing it to warp. This reduces the material&#x27;s fatigue strength, and may stretch the material as well as anneal it. The physical effects of spot welding include internal cracking, surface cracks and a bad appearance. The crack around the weld nugget will be extended under an external load or fatigue to produce a different type of failure. The chemical properties affected include the metal&#x27;s internal resistance and its corrosive properties.

Welding times are often very short, which can cause problems with the electrodes—they cannot move fast enough to keep the material clamped. Welding controllers will use a double pulse to get around this problem. During the first pulse, the electrode contact may not be able to make a good weld. The first pulse will soften the metal. During the pause between the two pulses, the electrodes will come closer and make better contact.

During spot welding, the large electric current induces a large magnetic field, and the electric current and magnetic field interact with each other to produce a large magnetic force field too, which drives the melted metal to move very fast at a velocity up to 0.5 m/s. As such, the heat energy distribution in spot welding could be dramatically changed by the fast motion of the melted metal. The fast motion in spot welding can be observed with high-speed photography.

The basic spot welder consists of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn&#x27;t needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding electrodes are part of the transformer&#x27;s secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the welding electrode voltage or current.

The resistance presented to the welder is complicated. There is the resistance of secondary winding, the cables, and the welding electrodes. There is also the contact resistance between the welding electrodes and the workpiece. There is the resistance of the workpieces, and the contact resistance between the workpieces.

At the beginning of the weld, the contact resistances are usually high, so most of the initial energy will be dissipated there. That heat and the clamping force will soften and smooth out the material at the electrode-material interface and make better contact (that is, lower the contact resistance). Consequently, more electrical energy will go into the workpiece and the junction resistance of the two workpieces. As electrical energy is delivered to the weld and causes the temperature to rise, the electrodes and the workpiece are conducting that heat away. The goal is to apply enough energy so that a portion of material within the spot melts without having the entire spot melt. The perimeter of the spot will conduct away much heat and keep the perimeter at a lower temperature. The interior of the spot has less heat conducted away, so it melts first. If the welding current is applied too long, the entire spot melts, the material runs out or otherwise fails, and the &quot;weld&quot; becomes a hole.

The voltage needed for welding depends on the resistance of the material to be welded, the sheet thickness and desired size of the nugget. When welding a common combination like 1.0 + 1.0 mm sheet steel, the voltage between the electrodes is only about 1.5 V at the start of the weld but can fall as low as 1 V at the end of the weld. This decrease in voltage results from the reduction in resistance caused by the workpiece melting. The open circuit voltage from the transformer is higher than this, typically in the 5 to 22 volt range.

The resistance of the weld spot changes as it flows and liquefies. Modern welding equipment can monitor and adjust the weld in real time to ensure a consistent weld. The equipment may seek to control different variables during the weld, such as current, voltage, power, or energy.

Welder sizes range from 5 to 500 kVA. Micro spot welders, used in a variety of industries, can go down to 1.5 kVA or less for precision welding needs.

It is common for a spray of molten metal droplets (sparks) to be ejected from the area of the weld during the process.

Resistance spot welding generates no bright arc, so UV protection is not required. OSHA requires transparent face shields or goggles for splatter protection, but does not require any filter lens.

== Applications ==
Spot welding is typically used when welding particular types of sheet metal, welded wire mesh or wire mesh. Thicker stock is more difficult to spot weld because the heat flows into the surrounding metal more easily. Spot welding can be easily identified on many sheet metal goods, such as metal buckets. Aluminium alloys can be spot welded, but their much higher thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity requires higher welding currents. This requires larger, more powerful, and more expensive welding transformers.

Perhaps the most common application of spot welding is in the automobile manufacturing industry, where it is used almost universally to weld the sheet metal to form a car. Spot welders can also be completely automated, and many of the industrial robots found on assembly lines are spot welders (the other major use for robots being painting).

Spot welding is also used in the orthodontist&#x27;s clinic, where small-scale spot welding equipment is used when resizing metal &quot;molar bands&quot; used in orthodontics.

Another application is spot welding straps to nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride or Lithium-ion battery cells to make batteries. The cells are joined by spot welding thin nickel straps to the battery terminals. Spot welding can keep the battery from getting too hot, as might happen if conventional soldering were done.

Good design practice must always allow for adequate accessibility. Connecting surfaces should be free of contaminants such as scale, oil, and dirt, to ensure quality welds. Metal thickness is generally not a factor in determining good welds.

== Modifications ==

&quot;Projection welding&quot; is a modification of spot welding in which the weld is localized by means of raised sections, or projections, on one or both of the workpieces to be joined. Heat is concentrated at the projections, which permits the welding of heavier sections or the closer spacing of welds. The projections can also serve as a means of positioning the workpieces. Projection welding is often used to weld studs, nuts, and other threaded machine parts to metal plate. It is also frequently used to join crossed wires and bars. This is another high-production process, and multiple projection welds can be arranged by suitable designing and jigging.

<text>Matter waves are a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics, being half of wave–particle duality. At all scales where measurements have been practical, matter exhibits wave-like behavior. For example, a beam of electrons can be diffracted just like a beam of light or a water wave.

The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by French physicist Louis de Broglie () in 1924, and so matter waves are also known as de Broglie waves.

The &quot;de Broglie wavelength&quot; is the wavelength, , associated with a particle with momentum through the Planck constant, :
formula_1

Wave-like behavior of matter has been experimentally demonstrated, first for electrons in 1927 and for other elementary particles, neutral atoms and molecules in the years since.

Matter waves have more complex velocity relations than solid objects and they also differ from electromagnetic waves (light). Collective matter waves are used to model phenomena in solid state physics; standing matter waves are used in molecular chemistry. 

Matter wave concepts are widely used in the study of materials where different wavelength and interaction characteristics of electrons, neutrons, and atoms are leveraged for advanced microscopy and diffraction technologies.

== History ==
=== Background ===
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (see history of wave and particle duality). In 1900, this division was questioned when, investigating the theory of black-body radiation, Max Planck proposed that the thermal energy of oscillating atoms is divided into discrete portions, or quanta. Extending Planck&#x27;s investigation in several ways, including its connection with the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein proposed in 1905 that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta, now called photons. These quanta would have an energy given by the Planck–Einstein relation:
formula_2
and a momentum vector formula_3
formula_4
where (lowercase Greek letter nu) and (lowercase Greek letter lambda) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, the speed of light, and the Planck constant. In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein&#x27;s postulate was verified experimentally by K. T. Compton and O. W. Richardson and by A. L. Hughes in 1912 then more carefully including a measurement of the Planck constant in 1916 by Robert Millikan.

=== De Broglie hypothesis ===


De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, electrons also have wave-like properties.
His thesis started from the hypothesis, &quot;that to each portion of energy with a proper mass one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency , such that one finds: . The frequency is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory.&quot; (This frequency is also known as Compton frequency.)

To find the wavelength equivalent to a moving body, de Broglie set the total energy from special relativity for that body equal to :
formula_5

(Modern physics no longer uses this form of the total energy; the energy–momentum relation has proven more useful.) De Broglie identified the velocity of the particle, , with the wave group velocity in free space:
formula_6

(The modern definition of group velocity uses angular frequency and wave number ). By applying the differentials to the energy equation and identifying the relativistic momentum:
formula_7

then integrating, de Broglie arrived at his formula for the relationship between the wavelength, , associated with an electron and the modulus of its momentum, , through the Planck constant, :
formula_1

=== Schrödinger&#x27;s (matter) wave equation ===

Following up on de Broglie&#x27;s ideas, physicist Peter Debye made an offhand comment that if particles behaved as waves, they should satisfy some sort of wave equation. Inspired by Debye&#x27;s remark, Erwin Schrödinger decided to find a proper three-dimensional wave equation for the electron. He was guided by William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s analogy between mechanics and optics (see Hamilton&#x27;s optico-mechanical analogy), encoded in the observation that the zero-wavelength limit of optics resembles a mechanical system – the trajectories of light rays become sharp tracks that obey Fermat&#x27;s principle, an analog of the principle of least action.

In 1926, Schrödinger published the wave equation that now bears his name – the matter wave analogue of Maxwell&#x27;s equations – and used it to derive the energy spectrum of hydrogen. Frequencies of solutions of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation differ from de Broglie waves by the Compton frequency since the energy corresponding to the rest mass of a particle is not part of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a wavefunction, a function that assigns a complex number to each point in space. Schrödinger tried to interpret the modulus squared of the wavefunction as a charge density. This approach was, however, unsuccessful. Max Born proposed that the modulus squared of the wavefunction is instead a probability density, a successful proposal now known as the Born rule.
The following year, 1927, C. G. Darwin (grandson of the famous biologist) explored Schrödinger&#x27;s equation in several idealized scenarios. For an unbound electron in free space he worked out the propagation of the wave, assuming an initial Gaussian wave packet. Darwin showed that at time formula_9 later the position formula_10 of the packet traveling at velocity formula_11 would be
formula_12
where formula_13 is the uncertainty in the initial position. This position uncertainty creates uncertainty in velocity (the extra second term in the square root) consistent with Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty relation The wave packet spreads out as show in the figure.

=== Experimental confirmation ===

In 1927, matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid&#x27;s diffraction experiment and the Davisson–Germer experiment, both for electrons.
The de Broglie hypothesis and the existence of matter waves has been confirmed for other elementary particles, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

The first electron wave interference patterns directly demonstrating wave–particle duality used electron biprisms (essentially a wire placed in an electron microscope) and measured single electrons building up the diffraction pattern.
Recently, a close copy of the famous double-slit experiment using electrons through physical apertures gave the movie shown.
==== Electrons ====

In 1927 at Bell Labs, Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer fired slow-moving electrons at a crystalline nickel target. The diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have a similar angular dependence to diffraction patterns predicted by Bragg for x-rays. At the same time George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid at the University of Aberdeen were independently firing electrons at thin celluloid foils and later metal films, observing rings which can be similarly interpreted. (Alexander Reid, who was Thomson&#x27;s graduate student, performed the first experiments but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned.) Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any diffraction effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. The matter wave interpretation was placed onto a solid foundation in 1928 by Hans Bethe, who solved the Schrödinger equation, showing how this could explain the experimental results. His approach is similar to what is used in modern electron diffraction approaches.

This was a pivotal result in the development of quantum mechanics. Just as the photoelectric effect demonstrated the particle nature of light, these experiments showed the wave nature of matter.

==== Neutrons ====

Neutrons, produced in nuclear reactors with kinetic energy of around , thermalize to around as they scatter from light atoms. The resulting de Broglie wavelength (around ) matches interatomic spacing and neutrons scatter strongly from hydrogen atoms. Consequently, neutron matter waves are used in crystallography, especially for biological materials. Neutrons were discovered in the early 1930s, and their diffraction was observed in 1936. In 1944, Ernest O. Wollan, with a background in X-ray scattering from his PhD work under Arthur Compton, recognized the potential for applying thermal neutrons from the newly operational X-10 nuclear reactor to crystallography. Joined by Clifford G. Shull, they developed neutron diffraction throughout the 1940s. 
In the 1970s, a neutron interferometer demonstrated the action of gravity in relation to wave–particle duality. The double-slit experiment was performed using neutrons in 1988.

==== Atoms ====
Interference of atom matter waves was first observed by Immanuel Estermann and Otto Stern in 1930, when a Na beam was diffracted off a surface of NaCl. The short de Broglie wavelength of atoms prevented progress for many years until two technological breakthroughs revived interest: microlithography allowing precise small devices and laser cooling allowing atoms to be slowed, increasing their de Broglie wavelength. The double-slit experiment on atoms was performed in 1991.

Advances in laser cooling allowed cooling of neutral atoms down to nanokelvin temperatures. At these temperatures, the de Broglie wavelengths come into the micrometre range. Using Bragg diffraction of atoms and a Ramsey interferometry technique, the de Broglie wavelength of cold sodium atoms was explicitly measured and found to be consistent with the temperature measured by a different method. 

==== Molecules ====
Recent experiments confirm the relations for molecules and even macromolecules that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in Vienna demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as fullerenes. The researchers calculated a de Broglie wavelength of the most probable C60 velocity as .
More recent experiments prove the quantum nature of molecules made of 810 atoms and with a mass of . As of 2019, this has been pushed to molecules of .

In these experiments the build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity.
Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to some aspects of the quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms.

==== Others ====
Matter wave was detected in van der Waals molecules, rho mesons, Bose-Einstein condensate.

== Traveling matter waves ==

Waves have more complicated concepts for velocity than solid objects.
The simplest approach is to focus on the description in terms of plane matter waves for a free particle, that is a wave function described by
formula_14
where formula_15 is a position in real space, formula_16 is the wave vector in units of inverse meters, is the angular frequency with units of inverse time and formula_9 is time. (Here the physics definition for the wave vector is used, which is formula_18 times the wave vector used in crystallography, see wavevector.) The de Broglie equations relate the wavelength to the modulus of the momentum formula_19, and frequency to the total energy of a free particle as written above:
formula_20
where is the Planck constant. The equations can also be written as
formula_21
Here, is the reduced Planck constant. The second equation is also referred to as the Planck–Einstein relation.

=== Group velocity ===
In the de Broglie hypothesis, the velocity of a particle equals the group velocity of the matter wave.
In isotropic media or a vacuum the group velocity of a wave is defined by:
formula_22
The relationship between the angular frequency and wavevector is called the dispersion relationship. For the non-relativistic case this is:
formula_23
where formula_24 is the rest mass. Applying the derivative gives the (non-relativistic) matter wave group velocity:
formula_25
For comparison, the group velocity of light, with a dispersion formula_26, is the speed of light formula_27.

As an alternative, using the relativistic dispersion relationship for matter waves
formula_28
then
formula_29
This relativistic form relates to the phase velocity as discussed below.

For non-isotropic media we use the Energy–momentum form instead:
formula_30

But (see below), since the phase velocity is formula_31, then
formula_32
where formula_33 is the velocity of the center of mass of the particle, identical to the group velocity.

=== Phase velocity ===
The phase velocity in isotropic media is defined as:
formula_34
Using the relativistic group velocity above:
formula_35
This shows that formula_36 as reported by R.W. Ditchburn in 1948 and J. L. Synge in 1952. Electromagnetic waves also obey formula_36, as both formula_38 and formula_39. Since for matter waves, formula_40, it follows that formula_41, but only the group velocity carries information. The superluminal phase velocity therefore does not violate special relativity, as it does not carry information.

For non-isotropic media, then
formula_42

Using the relativistic relations for energy and momentum yields
formula_43
The variable formula_33 can either be interpreted as the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave—the two are the same. Since the particle speed formula_45 for any particle that has nonzero mass (according to special relativity), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds &quot;c&quot;, i.e.,
formula_46
which approaches &quot;c&quot; when the particle speed is relativistic. The superluminal phase velocity does not violate special relativity, similar to the case above for non-isotropic media. See the article on &quot;Dispersion (optics)&quot; for further details.

=== Special relativity ===
Using two formulas from special relativity, one for the relativistic mass energy and one for the relativistic momentum
formula_47
allows the equations for de Broglie wavelength and frequency to be written as
formula_48
where formula_49 is the velocity, formula_50 the Lorentz factor, and formula_27 the speed of light in vacuum. This shows that as the velocity of a particle approaches zero (rest) the de Broglie wavelength approaches infinity.

=== Four-vectors ===
Using four-vectors, the de Broglie relations form a single equation:
formula_52
which is frame-independent.
Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:
formula_53
where
* Four-momentum formula_54
* Four-wavevector formula_55
* Four-velocity formula_56

== General matter waves ==
The preceding sections refer specifically to free particles for which the wavefunctions are plane waves. There are significant numbers of other matter waves, which can be broadly split into three classes: single-particle matter waves, collective matter waves and standing waves.

=== Single-particle matter waves ===
The more general description of matter waves corresponding to a single particle type (e.g. a single electron or neutron only) would have a form similar to
formula_57
where now there is an additional spatial term formula_58 in the front, and the energy has been written more generally as a function of the wave vector. The various terms given before still apply, although the energy is no longer always proportional to the wave vector squared. A common approach is to define an effective mass which in general is a tensor formula_59 given by
formula_60
so that in the simple case where all directions are the same the form is similar to that of a free wave above.formula_61In general the group velocity would be replaced by the probability current
formula_62
where formula_63 is the del or gradient operator. The momentum would then be described using the kinetic momentum operator,
formula_64
The wavelength is still described as the inverse of the modulus of the wavevector, although measurement is more complex. There are many cases where this approach is used to describe single-particle matter waves:
* Bloch wave, which form the basis of much of band structure as described in Ashcroft and Mermin, and are also used to describe the diffraction of high-energy electrons by solids.
* Waves with angular momentum such as electron vortex beams.
* Evanescent waves, where the component of the wavevector in one direction is complex. These are common when matter waves are being reflected, particularly for grazing-incidence diffraction.

=== Collective matter waves ===

Other classes of matter waves involve more than one particle, so are called collective waves and are often quasiparticles. Many of these occur in solids – see Ashcroft and Mermin. Examples include:
* In solids, an electron quasiparticle is an electron where interactions with other electrons in the solid have been included. An electron quasiparticle has the same charge and spin as a &quot;normal&quot; (elementary particle) electron and, like a normal electron, it is a fermion. However, its effective mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron. Its electric field is also modified, as a result of electric field screening.
* A hole is a quasiparticle which can be thought of as a vacancy of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the valence band of a semiconductor. A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
* A polaron is a quasiparticle where an electron interacts with the polarization of nearby atoms.
* An exciton is an electron and hole pair which are bound together.
* A Cooper pair is two electrons bound together so they behave as a single matter wave.

=== Standing matter waves ===
The third class are matter waves which have a wavevector, a wavelength and vary with time, but have a zero group velocity or probability flux. The simplest of these, similar to the notation above would be
formula_65
These occur as part of the particle in a box, and other cases such as in a ring. This can, and arguably should be, extended to many other cases. For instance, in early work de Broglie used the concept that an electron matter wave must be continuous in a ring to connect to the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition in the early approaches to quantum mechanics. In that sense atomic orbitals around atoms, and also molecular orbitals are electron matter waves.

== Matter waves vs. electromagnetic waves (light) ==
Schrödinger applied Hamilton&#x27;s optico-mechanical analogy to develop his wave mechanics for subatomic particles Consequently, wave solutions to the Schrödinger equation share many properties with results of light wave optics. In particular, Kirchhoff&#x27;s diffraction formula works well for electron optics and for atomic optics. The approximation works well as long as the electric fields change more slowly than the de Broglie wavelength. Macroscopic apparatus fulfill this condition; slow electrons moving in solids do not.

Beyond the equations of motion, other aspects of matter wave optics differ from the corresponding light optics cases.

Sensitivity of matter waves to environmental condition.
Many examples of electromagnetic (light) diffraction occur in air under many environmental conditions. Obviously visible light interacts weakly with air molecules. By contrast, strongly interacting particles like slow electrons and molecules require vacuum: the matter wave properties rapidly fade when they are exposed to even low pressures of gas. With special apparatus, high velocity electrons can be used to study liquids and gases. Neutrons, an important exception, interact primarily by collisions with nuclei, and thus travel several hundred feet in air.

Dispersion. Light waves of all frequencies travel at the same speed of light while matter wave velocity varies strongly with frequency. The relationship between frequency (proportional to energy) and wavenumber or velocity (proportional to momentum) is called a dispersion relation. Light waves in a vacuum have linear dispersion relation between frequency: formula_66. For matter waves the relation is non-linear:
formula_67
This non-relativistic matter wave dispersion relation says the frequency in vacuum varies with wavenumber (formula_68) in two parts: a constant part due to the de Broglie frequency of the rest mass (formula_69) and a quadratic part due to kinetic energy. The quadratic term causes rapid spreading of wave packets of matter waves.

Coherence The visibility of diffraction features using an optical theory approach depends on the beam coherence, which at the quantum level is equivalent to a density matrix approach. As with light, transverse coherence (across the direction of propagation) can be increased by collimation. Electron optical systems use stabilized high voltage to give a narrow energy spread in combination with collimating (parallelizing) lenses and pointed filament sources to achieve good coherence. Because light at all frequencies travels the same velocity, longitudinal and temporal coherence are linked; in matter waves these are independent. For example, for atoms, velocity (energy) selection controls longitudinal coherence and pulsing or chopping controls temporal coherence.

Optically shaped matter waves
Optical manipulation of matter plays a critical role in matter wave optics: &quot;Light waves can act as refractive, reflective, and absorptive structures for matter waves, just as glass interacts with light waves.&quot; Laser light momentum transfer can cool matter particles and alter the internal excitation state of atoms.

Multi-particle experiments
While single-particle free-space optical and matter wave equations are identical, multiparticle systems like coincidence experiments are not.

== Applications of matter waves ==
The following subsections provide links to pages describing applications of matter waves as probes of materials or of fundamental quantum properties. In most cases these involve some method of producing travelling matter waves which initially have the simple form formula_70, then using these to probe materials.

As shown in the table below, matter wave mass ranges over 6 orders of magnitude and energy over 9 orders but the wavelengths are all in the picometre range, comparable to atomic spacings. (Atomic diameters range from 62 to 520 pm, and the typical length of a carbon–carbon single bond is 154 pm.) Reaching longer wavelengths requires special techniques like laser cooling to reach lower energies; shorter wavelengths make diffraction effects more difficult to discern. Therefore, many applications focus on material structures, in parallel with applications of electromagnetic waves, especially X-rays. Unlike light, matter wave particles may have mass, electric charge, magnetic moments, and internal structure, presenting new challenges and opportunities.

=== Electrons ===
Electron diffraction patterns emerge when energetic electrons reflect or penetrate ordered solids; analysis of the patterns leads to models of the atomic arrangement in the solids.

They are used for imaging from the micron to atomic scale using electron microscopes, in transmission, using scanning, and for surfaces at low energies.

The measurements of the energy they lose in electron energy loss spectroscopy provides information about the chemistry and electronic structure of materials. Beams of electrons also lead to characteristic X-rays in energy dispersive spectroscopy which can produce information about chemical content at the nanoscale.

Quantum tunneling explains how electrons escape from metals in an electrostatic field at energies less than classical predictions allow: the matter wave penetrates of the work function barrier in the metal.

Scanning tunneling microscope leverages quantum tunneling to image the top atomic layer of solid surfaces.

Electron holography, the electron matter wave analog of optical holography, probes the electric and magnetic fields in thin films.

=== Neutrons ===
Neutron diffraction complements x-ray diffraction through the different scattering cross sections and sensitivity to magnetism.

Small-angle neutron scattering provides way to obtain structure of disordered systems that is sensitivity to light elements, isotopes and magnetic moments.

Neutron reflectometry is a neutron diffraction technique for measuring the structure of thin films.

=== Neutral atoms ===
Atom interferometers, similar to optical interferometers, measure the difference in phase between atomic matter waves along different paths.

Atom optics mimic many light optic devices, including mirrors, atom focusing zone plates.

Scanning helium microscopy uses He atom waves to image solid structures non-destructively.

Quantum reflection uses matter wave behavior to explain grazing angle atomic reflection, the basis of some atomic mirrors.

Quantum decoherence measurements rely on Rb atom wave interference.

=== Molecules ===
Quantum superposition revealed by interference of matter waves from large molecules probes the limits of wave–particle duality and quantum macroscopicity.

Matter-wave interfererometers generate nanostructures on molecular beams that can be read with nanometer accuracy and therefore be used for highly sensitive force measurements, from which one can deduce a plethora or properties of individualized complex molecules.

<text>Robert Francis Vaughn (November 22, 1932 – November 11, 2016) was an American actor and political activist, whose career in film, television and theater spanned nearly six decades and who was best known for his role as secret agent Napoleon Solo on &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964–68). He was a Primetime Emmy Award winner, and was nominated for the Academy Award, the BAFTA Award and four times for the Golden Globe Award. 

Vaughn had his breakthrough role as disabled, drunken war veteran Chester A. Gwynn in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot;, earning him a 1960 Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He subsequently appeared in scores of films, notably as gunman Lee in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), Walter Chalmers in &quot;Bullitt,&quot; Major Paul Krueger in &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; (1969), the voice of Proteus IV in &quot;Demon Seed&quot; (1977) and Ross Webster in &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983).

To television audiences, in addition to his role as Solo Vaughn was known for his roles as private detective Harry Rule on &quot;The Protectors&quot; (1972–74), Morgan Wendell in the miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978–79), and Albert Stroller on the BBC Television drama &quot;Hustle&quot; (2004–12). He won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of the White House Chief of Staff in the miniseries &quot;&quot;. He also appeared in the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Milton Fanshaw from January until February 2012.

Aside from his acting career, Vaughn was active in Democratic Party politics. He was chair of the California Democratic State Central Committee speakers bureau during the 1960s, and publicly campaigned against the Vietnam War as a member of the peace group Another Mother for Peace. A PhD in communications, his 1970 doctoral thesis &quot;The Influence of the House Committee on Un-American Activities on the American Theater 1938–58&quot; is considered &quot;the most complete and intelligent treatment of the virulent practice of blacklisting now available.&quot;

==Early life==
Robert Vaughn was born on November 22, 1932, to Gerald Walter and Marcella Frances (née Gaudel) Vaughn at Charity Hospital in New York City. Vaughn&#x27;s father was a radio actor and his mother was a stage actress. His parents divorced, and Vaughn lived with his grandparents Frank and Mary Gaudel in Minneapolis while his mother traveled and performed.

Discussing his childhood in a 1965 &quot;New York Sunday News&quot; interview, Vaughn said “I was a complete wreck as a child, emotionally unstable, excessively prideful” and that he often felt miserable. “I cried all the time and I was always getting beat up”.

==Education==

Vaughn attended Lowell Elementary, Jordan Junior High School and North High School in Minneapolis, graduating in 1950. Nicknamed &quot;Nobby&quot;, Vaughn&#x27;s activity in high school included the &quot;Polaris Weekly&quot; school newspaper, the student council and various sports, including being named captain of the cross-country team.

After high school, he enrolled in the University of Minnesota as a journalism major. However, he dropped out after a year and moved to Los Angeles with his mother.

He studied theater arts at Los Angeles City College in 1956 and transferred to Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences earning a master&#x27;s degree in theater in 1960.

===Doctoral thesis published as a book===
Vaughn earned a PhD in communications from the University of Southern California in 1970. His doctoral dissertation &quot;The Influence of the House Committee on Un-American Activities on the American Theater 1938–58&quot; was an appraisal of the effect the committee&#x27;s activities had on American theater. Vaughn&#x27;s original research included data from questionnaires and interviews he conducted with witnesses who had been labeled &quot;uncooperative&quot; by the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1972, he published his dissertation as a book titled &quot;Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting&quot;. Kirkus Reviews lists the book as &quot;the most complete and intelligent treatment of the virulent practice of blacklisting now available&quot;. Still in print, the book is regularly assigned to law students.

==Military service==
Vaughn was inducted into the U.S. Army Reserve on November 29, 1955, and entered active duty on December 18, 1956, at Fort Ord, California. During his first leave, he discovered his mother had been diagnosed with Berger&#x27;s disease, an often fatal kidney disorder. Vaughn applied for an Honorable Hardship discharge. While waiting for a decision, Vaughn was held over at Fort Ord and served as a drill instructor. Discharged from active duty on May 26, 1957, he again served in the U.S. Army Reserve until November 1962.

==Acting career==

===Early encouragement===
Vaughn&#x27;s mother encouraged his becoming an actor early in his life. She taught Vaughn to recite Shakespeare&#x27;s “To be or not to be” soliloquy from &quot;Hamlet&quot; when he was five.

Vaughn&#x27;s mother assisted him in being cast on radio shows in the Chicago area. He debuted on radio playing the part of Billy on Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy broadcast on WBBM (AM) radio.

In 1950 Vaughn worked as a page at Minneapolis&#x27; WCCO (AM). &quot;My job was a kind of glorified page boy position, but I was allowed to wear civvies rather than the silly uniforms often sported by studio guides and messengers in those days&quot;.

His first film appearance was as an extra in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), playing a golden calf idolator. Vaughn is also visible during a chariot scene behind Yul Brynner.

Vaughn&#x27;s first credited movie role was the Western &quot;Hell&#x27;s Crossroads&quot; (1957), in which he played Bob Ford, the murderer of outlaw Jesse James. Seen by Burt Lancaster in Calder Willingham&#x27;s play &quot;End as a Man&quot;, Vaughn was signed with Lancaster&#x27;s film company and was to have played the Steve Dallas role in &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;. Vaughn appeared as Stan Gray in the episode &quot;The Twisted Road&quot; of the western syndicated series &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;.
Vaughn played in at least one episode of The Rifleman. He played Dan, a West Point dropout who was appointed temporary Marshall of North Fork.

===Helped by Paul Newman===
Vaughn&#x27;s first notable appearance was in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; (1959). Vaughn credited Paul Newman with helping him earn his first major film role. &quot;The person who launched my career into A-list movies was Paul Newman. When my agent called and said Warner Bros. had a role for me in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot;, I mentioned it to Paul, who belonged to the same health club I did. He told me it was the perfect role for me and offered to do the screen test with me. That was unheard of. In a screen test, you run your lines with a script girl who is off camera. I had never done one before, but Paul did it with me and the result was wonderful&quot;.

In the film Vaughn portrayed alcoholic Chet Gwynn who lost his arm in the Korean War and was falsely accused of murder. His acting in the film earned Vaughn nominations for both the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

===&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;===
Vaughn&#x27;s next role was the gun for hire Lee in director John Sturges&#x27; 1960 film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. The film was an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1954 Japanese samurai epic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; set in the American frontier.

Vaughn recalled the morning in January when he arrived in Sturges’ office for his audition, &quot;...an ax was hanging over every movie project in Hollywood. Unless the casting for a picture was completed by noon on a particular Friday, production couldn’t begin&quot;. Telling Vaughn he wanted to cast him based on his performance in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot;, Sturges said, &quot;We don’t have a script, just Kurosawa’s picture to work from. You’ll have to go on faith. But we’ll be filming in Cuernavaca. Never been there? You’ll love it — it’s the &#x27;Palm Springs of Mexico&#x27; &quot;. Vaughn told Sturges, “I&#x27;m in”. Saying, &quot;Good decision, young man&quot;, Sturges asked, &quot;And do you know any other good young actors? I’ve got four other slots to fill&quot;. Vaughn suggested James Coburn, a former classmate and friend. Sturges hired Coburn.

Vaughn&#x27;s portrayal of hired gunslinger Lee included wearing black gloves throughout the film, signifying his reluctance to &quot;get his hands dirty&quot; even while continuing to kill for hire.

Vaughn&#x27;s acting showed Lee&#x27;s internal struggle with cowardice. Having lost his nerve, he could not fight until he finally summoned the internal courage to face certain death while freeing hostages.
 When offered the chance to run, Vaughn’s Lee is told, &quot;Go ahead, Lee, you don’t owe anything to anybody&quot;. His answer? &quot;Except to myself&quot;.

Vaughn died in 2016, the last of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; actors.

===&quot;Bullitt&quot;===
After &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; series ended, Vaughn landed a major film role playing Walter Chalmers, a U.S. Senator in the film &quot;Bullitt&quot; starring Steve McQueen; he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role.

===&quot;Superman III&quot;===
In 1983, he starred as villainous multi-millionaire Ross Webster in &quot;Superman III&quot;.

==Television career==
===Debut===
Vaughn made his television debut on the November 21, 1955, &quot;Black Friday&quot; episode of the American television series &quot;Medic&quot;, the first of Vaughn&#x27;s over two hundred episodic television roles through the mid-2000s.

===&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;===
In 1956, Vaughn made his first guest appearance on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in the episode entitled “Cooter.” The following year, he made his second guest appearance on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; opposite Barbara Eden in a Romeo-Juliet role, in the episode &quot;Romeo&quot;, which turned out okay for the bride and groom.

===&quot;The Boston Terrier&quot;===
In 1962, Vaughn starred as Boston based private detective A. Dunster Lowell in &quot;The Boston Terrier&quot; episode of the NBC network’s anthology series &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;. The episode was a pilot episode of a proposed Blake Edwards TV series. Edwards had created the popular &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; television show.

===&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;===
In 1963, Vaughn appeared in an episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; as Jim Darling, a successful businessman and an old flame of Laura Petrie in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame She Married Me&quot;.

===&quot;The Lieutenant&quot;===
During the 1963–64 season of &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, Vaughn appeared as Captain Raymond Rambridge alongside Gary Lockwood, who played a Marine second lieutenant at Camp Pendleton. Vaughn had guest-starred on Lockwood&#x27;s 1961–62 series &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;.

===&quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;===
His dissatisfaction with the somewhat diminished aspect of the Rambridge character led Vaughn to request an expanded role. During the conference, his name came up in a telephone call and he ended up being offered a series of his own—as Napoleon Solo, title character in a series originally to be called &quot;Solo&quot;, but which became &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; after the pilot was reshot with Leo G. Carroll in the role of Solo&#x27;s boss. This was the role which would make Vaughn a household name even behind the Iron Curtain.

From 1964 to 1968, Vaughn played Solo with Scottish co-star David McCallum playing his fellow agent, Illya Kuryakin. This production spawned a spinoff show, large amounts of merchandising, overseas theatrical movies of re-edited episodes, and a sequel, &quot;Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. 

Explaining the two &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; characters&#x27; appeal, Vaughn said, “Girls age 9 to 12 liked David McCallum because he was so sweet, but the old ladies and the 13- to 16-year-olds liked me because I was so detached”.

At the height of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; show’s popularity, Vaughn reported receiving 70,000 fan letters a month. &quot;I was bombarded with house and apartment keys labeled with the addresses of the adoring girls who lived behind those doors,&quot; he wrote in his 2008 memoir, &quot;A Fortunate Life&quot;. &quot;At the end of our first season, I had to put up an electric fence around my house to keep out the girls. I even tried using recorded animal noises to fend off my visitors, but I could never operate the sound system.&quot;

Vaughn said the success of the show boosted his career. &quot;Not only was it a great deal of fun, it changed me from being a working actor to a negotiating actor. After &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, I never accepted the first offer: if I wanted more money, I asked for it. A better dressing room? Four first-class tickets instead of two? I’d ask for them, and I’d often get them.&quot;

In 1966, during the initial &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; broadcast run, Vaughn appeared as a bachelor on the premiere episode of the nighttime version of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; which aired on October 6, 1966. Karen Carlson, the 1964 Miss America pageant first runner-up, chose Vaughn as her date, which included a trip to London, England.

After &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; was canceled in 1968, Vaughn continued to appear on television and in films.

===&quot;The Protectors&quot;===
Vaughn starred in two seasons of the British detective series &quot;The Protectors&quot; from 1972 through 1974.

===Daytime television===
Vaughn first appeared on daytime television in 1995 as a guest-star playing Rick Hamlin on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Vaughn later appeared in 1996 on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; playing the role of Bishop Corrington.

In 2012 Vaughn appeared for three weeks in the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as wealthy American Milton Fanshaw.

===&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;===
Vaughn played Judge Oren Travis on the 1998–2000 syndicated television series &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

===&quot;Hustle&quot;===
Vaughn experienced a resurgence in 2004. He began co-starring in the British TV drama series &quot;Hustle&quot;, made for BBC One. The series was also broadcast in the United States on the AMC cable network. In the series, Vaughn played elder-statesman American con artist Albert Stroller, a father figure to a group of younger grifters. He ultimately appeared in all eight series aired from 2004 to 2012.

When show producer Simon Crawford Collins met Vaughn, he recognized &quot;straight away that he could bring a whole new dimension to the part of Albert&quot;. He later called Vaughn, offering him the role. Vaughn said during the call he was &quot;told to get on a plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day.&quot;

In 2006, Vaughn said &quot;I imagined that Napoleon Solo had retired from U.N.C.L.E., whatever U.N.C.L.E. was. What could he do now to use his talents and to supplement his government pension? I imagined Stroller as &quot;Napoleon Solo, The Later Years&quot;&quot;.

===Other appearances===
He also appeared in two episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot; during the mid-1970s, &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1975) and &quot;Last Salute to the Commodore&quot; (1976). The latter episode is one of the few in the series where the identity of the murderer is not known until the end. Vaughn won an Emmy for his portrayal of Frank Flaherty in &quot;&quot; (ABC, 1977) and during the 1980s starred with friend George Peppard in the final season of &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Vaughn played Morgan Wendell, opponent to Paul Garrett played by David Janssen in the 1978–79 miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;.

Vaughn portrayed Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, in addition to Woodrow Wilson (in the 1979 television mini-series &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;). He additionally played Roosevelt in the 1982 HBO telefilm &quot;FDR: That Man in the White House&quot;. In 1983–1984, he appeared as industrialist Harlan Adams in the short-lived series &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot;, replacing Patrick O&#x27;Neal. In the mid-1990s, he made several cameo appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; as an audience member who berates the host and his guests beginning with &quot;you people make me sick.&quot;

After a string of guest roles on series such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (in which he had a recurring role during season eight as Carl Anderton, a wealthy businessman who vows revenge on the NYC DA&#x27;s office and longtime friend Adam Schiff for sending his grandson to juvenile correction for murdering his stepsister). In September 2006, he guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

Vaughn also appeared as himself narrating and being a character in a radio play broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in 2007 about making the film &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; in Prague, during the Russian invasion of 1968. 

==Production company==
In 1966, Vaughn founded a film production company, Ferdporqui Productions with his lifelong best friend actor Sherwood Price. The company was headquartered at the M.G.M. Studios in Culver City, California.
They purchased production options on books and scripts in the 1960s. In 1966 they acquired the production rights to Joseph Sargent&#x27;s &quot;story idea&quot; &quot;Bridge on the River Hudson&quot; and hired Peter Allan Fields to produce a script treatment. Vaughn was reportedly to star in their first independent film venture. They also acquired the rights to Robert Laxalt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man in the Wheatfield&quot; in 1966 and sought investors in the proposed film&#x27;s production.

In 1968, the company opened a branch office in Great Britain. In the 1970s Ferdporqui Productions provided production management on &quot;The Protectors&quot; which starred Vaughn.

==Other investments==
Vaughn&#x27;s investments included profitable livestock herds and west Texas gas wells which made him a millionaire. In 1967, one of his wells saw an increase in production output from $13 per week to $270 per day, a $98,550 annual output (). The reportedly frugal Vaughn said, &quot;If it went tomorrow, it wouldn&#x27;t visibly change my life.&quot; Vaughn said he had lived on one-quarter of his salary for the past ten years and that his business manager allowed him $25 spending money per week.

==Advertising pitch man==
In later years, Vaughn appeared in syndicated advertisements marketed by Commercial Pro, Inc. for various personal injury and workers compensation law firms, using the catchphrase, &quot;Tell them you mean business&quot;.

Vaughn was also an infomercial pitchman from 1985 through 1990 for the Helsinki Formula, a claimed baldness cure. In 1994 the Federal Trade Commission sued, blocking the product&#x27;s bogus claims, but $100 million of the product had already been sold.

In 1993, Vaughn told &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; he had no problem promoting the Helsinki Formula &quot;cure&quot;. He said, “That was about the most profitable thing I’ve ever done in my life. Every call that came in on the 800 number, I got a piece of that”.

The &quot;Seinfeld&quot; TV show mentioned Vaughn&#x27;s Helsinki Formula ad during the show&#x27;s second season May 2, 1991, episode:

==Personal life==
During the late 1960s Joyce Jameson was a girlfriend of Vaughn&#x27;s. She acted opposite Vaughn as a guest star on a 1966 &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Dippy Blond Affair&quot;.

Vaughn married actress Linda Staab in 1974. They appeared together in a 1973 episode of &quot;The Protectors&quot;, called &quot;It Could Be Practically Anywhere on the Island&quot;. They adopted two children, Cassidy (born 1976) and Caitlin (born 1981). They resided in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

For many years, it was believed Vaughn was the biological father of English film director and producer Matthew Vaughn, born when the actor was in a relationship with early 1970s socialite Kathy Ceaton. However, a paternity investigation identified the father as George de Vere Drummond, an English aristocrat and godson of King George VI. Early in Matthew&#x27;s life, when all believed Vaughn was the father, he asked for &quot;his&quot; child&#x27;s surname to be Vaughn, which Matthew continues to use professionally, still seeing Vaughn as his social father, even if not biologically.

===Recordings===
In 1967 Vaughn released the MGM Records spoken word album &quot;Readings From Hamlet&quot;, which featured him performing seven excerpts from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; accompanied with incidental music. The MGM Records E/SE-4488 lp was released in both mono and stereo formats.

===Books===
Vaughn published &quot;Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting&quot; in 1972. 

His second book, &quot;A Fortunate Life&quot;, was an autobiography published in 2008 in which Vaughn said of his life, &quot;With a modest amount of looks and talent and more than a modicum of serendipity, I&#x27;ve managed to stretch my 15 minutes of fame into more than half a century of good fortune&quot;. &quot;The breaks all fell my way&quot;.

== Political views ==
Vaughn was a longtime member of the Democratic Party. His family was also Democratic and was involved in politics in Minneapolis. Early in his career, he was described as a &quot;liberal Democrat&quot;. He was opposed to the Hollywood Blacklist of suspected Communists on freedom of speech principles, but Vaughn also was opposed to Communism as a totalitarian system. Vaughn campaigned for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 United States presidential election. He was the chair of the California Democratic State Central Committee speakers bureau and actively campaigned for candidates in the 1960s.

Vaughn was the first popular American actor to take a public stand against the Vietnam War and was active in the peace group Another Mother for Peace. Vaughn debated with William F. Buckley Jr. on his program &quot;Firing Line&quot; on the Vietnam War. With Dick Van Dyke and Carl Reiner, he was a founder of Dissenting Democrats. Early in the 1968 presidential election, they supported the candidacy of Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, who was running for president as an alternative to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who had supported President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s escalation of the war in Vietnam.

Vaughn was reported to have political ambitions of his own, but in a 1973 interview, he denied having had any political aspirations. In a conversation with historian Jack Sanders, he stated that after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, &quot;I lost heart for the battle.&quot;

==Death==
Vaughn died in a hospice in Danbury, Connecticut, on November 11, 2016, after undergoing a year-long treatment for leukemia.

<doc id="229106" wikidata="Q375950" url="?curid=229106" title="Velvet Acid Christ">
<text>Velvet Acid Christ (VAC) is an electro-industrial band based in Denver, Colorado. The band was formed in 1990 by its leader vocalist, musician, and producer Bryan Erickson (aka Disease Factory), and later featured various ex-members of Toxic Coma. The project gained limited popularity in Europe&#x27;s underground nightclub scenes during the mid-1990s with the compilation &quot;Church of Acid&quot; (1996) before expanding into other markets in the goth and industrial subcultures. The band&#x27;s discography includes 14 albums, the latest being &quot;Ora Oblivionis&quot; (2019).

==History==

===Early projects, early changes, and first albums (1990–1995)===
In the early 1990s, Erickson and Gregory, both residents of Colorado, brought together their shared interest in creating music to record a series of demos in Erickson&#x27;s mom&#x27;s basement. With the addition of Gary Slaughter and Chris Workman, the group attempted several bands, including Disease Disco Factory, a parody of then-popular Dance group C+C Music Factory. Following a turbulent period for Erickson and Slaughter, Workman left the group. Slaughter and Erickson experimented with two new side-projects, Cyber Christ and Vortex. Cyber Christ explored a harsh and melancholy sound that was a sharp contrast to the group&#x27;s other projects. When Erickson discovered that the term &quot;Cyber Christ&quot; had been used in the 1992 film &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;, he renamed the band &quot;Velvet Acid Christ&quot; &quot;in honor of a bad acid trip&quot;. The Vortex project was merged into Velvet Acid Christ to form one body of work.

In 1994, Workman returned to assist with the band&#x27;s self-produced Gothic-styled demo tape, &quot;Fate&quot;. Given encouraging response from friends, the band followed up with other self-produced albums, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Pestilence&quot;, a dance-oriented album, and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Neuralblastoma&quot;, a harder-sounding album.

Erickson, along with friends and minor contributors Steve Bird and Dan Olson, started the brief-lived record label Electro Death Trip (EDT) Records to better promote these recordings. In 1995, the three began distributing hand-made CD copies of &quot;Fate&quot;, &quot;Pestilence,&quot; and &quot;Neuralblastoma&quot; for resale in local music shops.

===Label interest, touring, and a troubled rise (1996–2000)===
Slaughter and Workman temporarily left the band during the first half of 1996 as Erickson continued the project alone, handing out copies of Velvet Acid Christ&#x27;s recordings to industry representatives, including musician Bill Leeb of industrial pioneers Front Line Assembly. Leeb passed the CD on to Thorsten Stroht, a media promoter with European label Off-Beat Records. Off-Beat A&amp;R negotiated a deal with the band.

For their first Off-Beat release, the group submitted 1996&#x27;s &quot;Church of Acid&quot;, a compilation of selected tracks from Velvet Acid Christ&#x27;s first three albums with an additional two new tracks, &quot;Disflux&quot; and &quot;Futile&quot;. &quot;Church of Acid&quot; was well received in Europe, and &quot;Futile&quot; became a regularly played track in many nightclubs across the continent. In 1997, United States label Pendragon Records released &quot;Church of Acid&quot; in America, though the two new tracks were removed due to a lack of trademark clearance for television samples used in the songs. The album hit #15 on the CMJ RPM chart in the U.S.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Calling Ov the Dead&quot;, was rejected by Off-Beat for not sounding edgy enough, prompting Slaughter&#x27;s permanent departure. The band addressed the label&#x27;s concerns and released &quot;Calling Ov the Dead&quot; in late 1997, with American distribution following through Pendragon in 1998. In the process, Erickson had accumulated a substantial financial debt.

With a line-up consisting of Erickson, Stroht and German musician Ingo Beitz, the band toured Europe in 1998 with Off-Beat label-mate Suicide Commando, which attracted the attention of Metropolis Records, the largest industrial label in United States. The parent label of Pendragon, Metropolis distributed the album &quot;Neuralblastoma&quot;, as a partnership that would endure.

Velvet Acid Christ spent the majority of 1999 in the studio, first collaborating with Germany&#x27;s Funker Vogt on a remix EP entitled &quot;Velvet Acid Christ Vs Funker Vogt: The Remix Assault&quot;, then shifting to Velvet Acid Christ&#x27;s next full-length recording, &quot;Fun With Knives&quot;. With Workman an occasional contributor, Erickson sought production assistance on &quot;Fun With Knives&quot; from the bands Luxt and New 4th Army (Josh and Lisa Wilson.) &quot;Fun with Knives&quot;, released by Metropolis and new Off-Beat sub-label Dependent, became the band&#x27;s best-selling album peaking at #6 on the CMJ RPM Charts and ranked #18 Album on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) for 1999. Sales were propelled by the singles &quot;Decypher&quot; and &quot;Fun with Drugs&quot;, and by the track &quot;Slut&quot;, which featured vocals from Luxt&#x27;s Anna Christine. &quot;Fun with Drugs&quot; was the #7 single on the DAC top 50 singles chart for 1999.

In spite of the success of the band, stress had led Erickson into depression and increased drug abuse, which channeled into the creation of the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Twisted Thought Generator&quot;, which peaked at #9 on the CMJ RPM Charts. Simultaneously, the band toured Europe with industrial acts Project X and Stromkern and toured the United States and Canada with bands Din_Fiv and Haujobb. The line-up of the band during this period was unstable. Workman, citing a conversion to Christianity, resigned from the band with a request that his name be retracted from all previous albums. The first leg of the European tour consisted of Erickson, Bird and Stroht; the second leg, Erickson and Olson. The North American tour was performed by Erickson, Stroht and drummer Paul Lipman. With various contributors, Erickson completed &quot;Twisted Thought Generator&quot;. Due to lingering disputes, he withdrew the band from Dependent Records and submitted the album to Metropolis.

===Change of pace, new early material, and beyond (2001–)===
Erickson placed Velvet Acid Christ on a short hiatus in 2001, as he abandoned his dependence on drugs in favour of exercise and a vegan raw foodist diet. Newly clean, Erickson created the 2003 album &quot;Hex Angel: Utopia/Dystopia&quot;. Though critical response was mixed, &quot;Hex Angel: Utopia/Dystopia&quot; ranked #1 on Germany&#x27;s Deutsche Alternative Charts (DAC) for four weeks after its release, and the album&#x27;s single &quot;Pretty Toy&quot; peaked at #4 on the DAC during the same year. The album also marked the band&#x27;s short-lived return to Dependent Records.

Erickson spent 2004 releasing and reissuing some of Velvet Acid Christ&#x27;s earliest material. With the four-volume compilation series &quot;Between the Eyes&quot;, the band published a collection of its singles and B-sides, then followed with subsequent re-releases of &quot;Fate&quot; (&quot;Vol. 2&quot;), &quot;Pestilence&quot; (&quot;Vol. 3&quot;), and &quot;Neuralblastoma&quot; (&quot;Vol. 4&quot;). The band also offered free MP3 downloads of &quot;Dimension 8&quot; and &quot;Oblivion Interface&quot; on its website until early 2005. &quot;Dimension 8&quot;, which had been available as a hidden bonus on &quot;Twisted Thought Generator&quot;, and &quot;Oblivion Interface&quot; (informally known as &quot;Between the Eyes, Vol. 5&quot;) provided fans with previously unheard work from the Cyber Christ-Vortex era of 1991–1994.

In 2005, Erickson collaborated with guitarist Todd Loomis on a new album, &quot;Lust for Blood&quot;, which was released on September 26, 2006. With &quot;Lust for Blood&quot;, the crew labored intensively to create a new overall sound while maintaining the band&#x27;s original characteristics. Following its release, &quot;Lust for Blood&quot; peaked at #1 on Germany&#x27;s DAC and ranked #5 on the DAC Top 50 Albums of 2006; the album&#x27;s single release, &quot;Wound&quot;, ranked on the DAC&#x27;s singles chart for eight weeks, peaking at #1 and ranking #5 on the year&#x27;s singles chart.

In October 2009, Velvet Acid Christ, Erickson wrote most of the LP, Loomis did a little work on it and was busy working on his project &quot;The Twilight Garden&quot;, released &quot;The Art of Breaking Apart&quot;. This LP was a tribute to bands like Current 93 and Death in June and brought VAC many new fans while distancing some of his previous fans. It was the first album to feature an acoustic guitar and untreated vocals redefining what Velvet Acid Christ could sound like. 2010 saw the release of the &quot;Caustic Disco&quot; EP featuring remixes of the original song.

In 2010–2011, Bryan Erickson teamed up with William Anderson of Louisiana. William did a ton of sampling, Bryan made a bunch of VAC B-sides and turned them into Toxic Coma tracks. The project is very old with a revolving door of members, again Bryan being the main constant. This LP fuses the techno sound of &quot;Fun With Knives&quot; and the brutal black humor of Toxic Coma. This VAC side project is known as Toxic Coma &quot;Satan Rising&quot;, on Metropolis Records. Erickson then began to write more music for future VAC LPs.

In October 2012, Velvet Acid Christ released their latest LP entitled &quot;Maldire&quot;. Moving back to Renoise for the album which was also used on &quot;Toxic Coma&quot;. Due to a lack of funding for the album it features the &quot;most software vsts to date&quot;. The release marked a return to the darker electronic sound with aggressive vocals that VAC is renowned for. Erickson formed a live band and toured extensively (2012–2014) to support the album.

On October 28, 2014, the &quot;Subconscious Landscapes&quot; LP was released, containing all the B-sides from &quot;Maldire&quot;. It features &quot;densely layered, complex, and atmospheric tracks calling on influences in the ranges of Juno Reactor, Massive Attack, and Delerium&quot;. As a natural progression from the hypnotic grooves of past songs, the first half of the album highlights guest vocals from Sabine Theroni and Margolzata Wacht, while the second half takes a darker turn. &quot;Dire Land&quot; released in June 2015 was a remix LP meant to serve as a singles companion for &quot;Maldire&quot; and &quot;Subconscious Landscapes&quot;, with remixes from God Module, Decoded Feedback, Assemblage 23, Dead Hand Project and others. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album featuring newly remastered songs built to feature &quot;more bass and tame the high [frequencies]&quot; was released in 2016. A webstore was launched in 2017 on the site.

==Musical style==

The majority of the band&#x27;s work is categorized among the genres of industrial, gothic rock, electro-industrial, and EBM. The band&#x27;s tone ranges between angry, upbeat, sad, and psychedelic. The band&#x27;s lyrical content offers a varied focus, including such topics as IRC, love, hate, depression, misanthropy, drugs, and religion. Erickson is the group&#x27;s main songwriter.

Much of Velvet Acid Christ&#x27;s musical composition has been produced with synthesizers and computer software. Other instruments used by the band include sequencers such as drum machines and electric guitars with effects pedals. Sampling is another technique commonly employed by the band.

===Influences===
The band cites many musical influences, including among many others Aphex Twin, Rush, Skinny Puppy, Cocteau Twins, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Astral Projection.

<text>William David Trimble, Baron Trimble, (15 October 1944 – 25 July 2022) was a Northern Irish politician who was the inaugural First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2002, and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from 1995 to 2005. He was also Member of Parliament (MP) for Upper Bann from 1990 to 2005 and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Upper Bann from 1998 to 2007.

Trimble began his career teaching law at The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in the 1970s, during which time he began to get involved with the paramilitary-linked Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party (VPUP). He was elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, and joined the UUP in 1978 after the VPUP disbanded. Remaining at Queen&#x27;s University, he continued his academic career until being elected as the MP for Upper Bann in 1990. In 1995 he was unexpectedly elected as the leader of the UUP. He was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and (along with John Hume) won the Nobel Peace Prize that year for his efforts. He was later elected to become the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, although his tenure was turbulent and frequently interrupted by disagreements over the timetable for Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning.

Trimble resigned the leadership of the UUP soon after being defeated at the 2005 general election. In June 2006, he accepted a life peerage in the House of Lords, taking the title of &quot;Baron Trimble&quot;, &quot;of Lisnagarvey in the County of Antrim&quot;. He did not stand again for the Assembly, which finally reconvened in 2007, instead leaving the UUP to join the Conservative Party.

==Early life and education==
Trimble was born in Belfast on 15 October 1944. He was the son of William and Ivy Trimble, lower-middle class Presbyterians who lived in Bangor, County Down. He attended Bangor Grammar School from 1956 to 1963. He then studied at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (QUB) from 1964 to 1968, where he was awarded the McKane Medal for Jurisprudence. He received a first class honours degree (the first at Queen&#x27;s in three years), becoming a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B).

Trimble&#x27;s paternal grandfather George was born in Easkey, County Sligo, to parents William Trimble and Mary Burns.

==Early career==
===Academic career===
Trimble qualified as a barrister in 1969. He began that year as a Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast lecturer, subsequently becoming Assistant Dean of the law faculty from 1973 to 1975, a Senior Lecturer in 1977, and Head of the Department of Commercial and Property Law from 1981 to 1989. He resigned from the university in 1990 when he was elected to Parliament.

In 1983, as he sat in his office at the university, he heard gunshots which turned out to be those of the IRA killers of Edgar Graham, a friend and fellow law lecturer. He was asked to identify the body. In 1994 he was told by the Royal Ulster Constabulary that he had been targeted for assassination.

===Political career===
Trimble became involved with the right-wing, paramilitary-linked Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party (known as Vanguard) in the early 1970s. He ran unsuccessfully for the party in the 1973 Assembly election for North Down, coming last. In 1974, he was a legal adviser to the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council during the successful UWC strike against the Sunningdale Agreement.

Trimble was elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975 as a Vanguard member for Belfast South, and for a time he served as the party&#x27;s joint deputy leader, along with the Ulster Defence Association&#x27;s Glenn Barr. The party had been established by Bill Craig to oppose sharing power with Irish Nationalists, and to prevent closer ties with the Republic of Ireland; however Trimble was one of those to back Craig when the party split over Craig&#x27;s proposal to allow voluntary power sharing with the SDLP.

Trimble joined the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1978 after Vanguard disbanded, and was elected one of the four party secretaries. He served as Vice Chairman of the Lagan Valley Unionist Association from 1983 to 1985, and was named chairman in 1985. He served as chairman of the UUP Legal Committee from 1989 to 1995 and as honorary secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council in 1990–96.

Trimble was elected to Parliament with 58% of the vote in a by-election in Upper Bann in 1990. He was one of the few British politicians who urged support for the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the civil war in the 1990s.

==Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party==
On 8 September 1995, Trimble unexpectedly won election as leader of the UUP, defeating the front-runner John Taylor and three other candidates.

Trimble&#x27;s election as Leader came in the aftermath of his role in the Drumcree conflict, in which he led a controversial 1995 Orange Order Protestant march, amidst Nationalist protest, down the predominantly Catholic nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown, County Armagh. Trimble and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley walked hand-in-hand as the march, banned since 1997, proceeded down the road. Many Irish Catholics viewed it as insensitive, while many Protestants felt that it was a sign that Trimble was defending them.

Shortly after the election, Trimble became the first UUP Leader in 30 years (since Terence O&#x27;Neill) to meet with the Taoiseach in Dublin. In 1997, he became the first unionist leader since the partition of Ireland in 1921 to agree to negotiate with Sinn Féin.

In the subsequent All-Party negotiations, Trimble led the UUP delegation and sat at the table with Sinn Féin, though in the eight months of the negotiations he never spoke directly to their leader, Gerry Adams. Trimble at first opposed the appointment of former US Senator George Mitchell as the chairman of the all-party talks, but eventually accepted him. The talks were successful, culminating in the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998, which resulted in power-sharing with Nationalists. Trimble was subsequently seen as instrumental in getting his party to accept the accord. On 22 May 1998, voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement, with 71 per cent in favour.

Trimble was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in the 1998 New Year Honours.

==First Minister of Northern Ireland==
Trimble was elected on 25 June 1998 as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for Upper Bann. He was elected First Minister of Northern Ireland on 1 July 1998.

Arguments over the extent of Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning led to repeated disruptions during Trimble&#x27;s tenure as First Minister. In particular:
* The office of First Minister was suspended from 11 February 2000 to 30 May 2000. During this time, Trimble attempted to reassure party members who were sceptical of the post-Good Friday Agreement institutions, saying, &quot;Unionists won the war... The Agreement gave unionism the opportunity to take control of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constitutional future and to take a major stake in the government of our country... Does anyone really think Gerry Adams wanted this?&quot;.
* Trimble resigned as First Minister on 1 July 2001 due to the continuing impasse arising from the IRA&#x27;s refusal of his demands that it decommission its arms, as per the commitments all parties had signed up to in section 7 pt. 3 (page 25) of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement but he was re-elected on 5 November 2001
* The Assembly was suspended from 14 October 2002 until 2007 due to accusations of an IRA spy ring being operated there (the so-called Stormontgate Affair), which Trimble described as ten times worse than Watergate.

In 1998, Tony Blair announced a new judicial inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, into the killing of 13 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During the debate in the House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said: &quot;I am sorry to have to say to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the Honourable Member for Foyle that this will be part of the healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute.&quot; Reporting in 2010, the Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 13 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.

==Peerage==
At the general elections of 2005, Trimble was defeated in Upper Bann by the DUP&#x27;s David Simpson in his bid for re-election to Parliament in Westminster. The Ulster Unionist Party retained only one seat in Parliament (out of 18 in Northern Ireland) after the 2005 general election, and Trimble resigned the party leadership on 7 May 2005.

On 11 April 2006, it was revealed that Trimble would take a seat in the House of Lords as a working life peer. On 21 May 2006 it was announced that he had chosen the geographical designation Lisnagarvey, the original name for his adopted home town of Lisburn. Subsequently, on 2 June 2006, he was created &quot;Baron Trimble&quot;, &quot;of Lisnagarvey in the County of Antrim&quot;. Eight months later, he confirmed that he would be standing down from the Northern Ireland Assembly at the next election.

Trimble announced on 17 April 2007 that he had decided to join the Conservative Party in order to have greater influence in politics in the United Kingdom. At the same time, however, he stated that he did not intend to campaign against the Ulster Unionist Party, and proposed the idea of a future alliance between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists, similar to that which had existed prior to 1974 and the fallout of the Sunningdale Agreement. This idea became reality with the formation of the electoral alliance of Ulster Conservatives and Unionists in late 2008. It was reported that if the Conservatives won the 2010 general election, Trimble would receive a &quot;significant&quot; ministerial role, possibly in the Cabinet. In the end, however, Trimble was not offered any governmental or front bench position following the formation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government.

In May 2010, Trimble joined the Friends of Israel Initiative, a non-Jewish international project supporting Israel&#x27;s right to exist. The initiative, started by former prime minister of Spain José María Aznar, also included former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John R. Bolton, British historian Andrew Roberts, and former Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo. On 29 January 2013, Trimble and Aznar co-wrote an article in &quot;The Times&quot; condemning Hezbollah and calling on European governments to list it as a terrorist organisation.

In 2016, Trimble supported the Leave side in the UK referendum on EU membership. He said that if he had ever had any doubts about the issue, &quot;his eight years on the EU Select Committees in the House of Lords – which scrutinise the EU&#x27;s operations – had convinced him of the need to cut ties with Brussels&quot;. He cited a study which found that economic growth in the UK reduced after the decision to enter the Common Market, and reduced further when the UK went into the Single Market.

===Turkel Commission of Inquiry===
On 14 June 2010, Trimble was appointed an observer to the Israeli special independent public Turkel Commission of Inquiry into the Gaza flotilla raid.

The Commission investigated whether Israel&#x27;s actions in preventing the arrival of ships in Gaza were in accordance with international law. It focused among other things on the security considerations for imposing a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip and the conformity of the naval blockade with the rules of international law; the conformity of the actions during the raid to principles of international law; and the actions taken by those who organised and participated in the flotilla, and their identities.

On the commission were former Israeli Supreme Court Justice, Jacob Turkel, and former Technion University President, Amos Horev, as well two other members added in July 2010. (Bar Ilan University Professor of International Law Shabtai Rosenne also served on the commission from its establishment until his death on 21 September 2010.) In addition, the commission had two foreign observers, Trimble and former head of the Canadian military&#x27;s judiciary, Judge Advocate General, Ken Watkin, who took part in hearings and discussions, but did not vote on the final conclusions. The panel, in January 2011, concluded both Israel&#x27;s naval blockade of Gaza and the interception of the flotilla &quot;were found to be legally pursuant to the rules of international law&quot;.

==Personal life==
Trimble married his first wife, Heather McComb, in 1968. They did not have children, having had a stillbirth of twin sons. In 1976 the couple divorced. Two years later he married a former student of his, Daphne Elizabeth (née Orr). They had two sons and two daughters (Richard, Victoria, Nicholas, and Sarah). Richard Trimble is a maths teacher and head of the sixth form at Graveney School in Tooting, South West London. Lady Trimble served as a member of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, and later the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, before standing unsuccessfully in the UK parliamentary election of May 2010 for the Conservatives and Unionists.

His son Nicholas was active within the Ulster Unionist Party and serving on the Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council at the time of his father&#x27;s death. Nicholas Trimble was co-opted in 2016 to replace Alexander Redpath as a Councillor representing Downshire West on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.

Trimble admitted in July 2019 that he was &quot;forced&quot; to change his position on same-sex marriage and partnerships after voting against them, because of his lesbian daughter Vicky, who married her girlfriend Rosalind Stephens in Scotland in 2017. He told peers in the House of Lords &quot;I cannot change that, and I cannot now go around saying that I am opposed to it because I acquiesced to it. There we are.&quot; His nephew Andrew played professional rugby for Ireland.

Trimble died on 25 July 2022 after a brief illness. He was 77 years old.

==Honours==
In October 1998, Trimble and John Hume were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. The Nobel Institute noted: As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage when, at a critical stage of the process, he advocated solutions which led to the [Belfast (Good Friday)] peace agreement.

At a ceremony in Paris on 8 December 1999, Trimble was appointed an Officier in the Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the French Government.

In 2002, Trimble was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<text>Edgar Henry Schein (March 5, 1928 – January 26, 2023) was a Swiss-born American business theorist and psychologist who was professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He was a foundational researcher in the discipline of organizational behavior, and made notable contributions in the field of organizational development in many areas, including career development, group process consultation, and organizational culture. He was the son of former University of Chicago professor Marcel Schein.

==Model of organizational culture==
Schein&#x27;s model of organizational culture originated in the 1980s. Schein (2004) identifies three distinct levels in organizational cultures:

# artifacts and behaviours
# espoused values
# assumptions

The three levels refer to the degree to which the different cultural phenomena are visible to the observer.

* Artifacts include any tangible, overt or verbally identifiable elements in any organization. Architecture, furniture, dress code, office jokes, all exemplify organizational artifacts. Artifacts are the visible elements in a culture and they can be recognized by people not part of the culture.
* Espoused values are the organization&#x27;s stated values and rules of behavior. It is how the members represent the organization both to themselves and to others. This is often expressed in official philosophies and public statements of identity. It can sometimes often be a projection for the future, of what the members hope to become. Examples of this would be employee professionalism, or a &quot;family first&quot; mantra. Trouble may arise if espoused values by leaders are not in line with the deeper tacit assumptions of the culture.
* Shared basic assumptions are the deeply embedded, taken-for-granted behaviours which are usually unconscious, but constitute the essence of culture. These assumptions are typically so well integrated in the office dynamic that they are hard to recognize from within.

== Career anchors ==
The career anchor is a part of what one finds as they clarify their self-image surrounding one&#x27;s (1) needs and motives, (2) talents, and (3) values, the anchor being set of needs, values, and talents that a person is least willing to give up when forced to make a choice. The concept is Schein&#x27;s attempt to reflect the lifelong search of every human to find themselves.

Schein&#x27;s original research in the mid-1970s identified five possible career anchor groups: (1) autonomy/independence, (2) security/stability, (3) technical-functional competence, (4) general managerial competence, and (5) entrepreneurial creativity. Follow-up studies in the 1980s identified three additional constructs: (6) service or dedication to a cause, (7) pure challenge, and (8) life style.

A 2008 study distinguishes between entrepreneurship and creativity to form nine possible constructs.

<text>John Julius Angerstein (1735 – 22 January 1823) was a London businessman and Lloyd&#x27;s underwriter, a patron of the fine arts and a collector. It was the prospect that his collection of paintings was about to be sold by his estate in 1824 that suddenly galvanised the King, George IV, and the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, into purchasing his collection for the nation and led to the founding of the British National Gallery in Angerstein&#x27;s house at 100 Pall Mall.

==Parentage==
John Julius Angerstein was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1735. It has wrongly been suggested that he was a natural son of Empress Catherine II or of Elizabeth, Empress of Russia. Family tradition holds that his true parents were Empress Anna of Russia, then 42, and the London businessman Andrew Poulett Thompson; his first position after arriving in London at the age of fifteen was in Thompson&#x27;s counting-house.

==Family==
In 1771 Angerstein married Anna Crockett (widow of Charles Crockett and daughter of Henry Muilman [1700–1772], a South Sea Company director, banker, Danish consul in London and Russia Company consul, and Anne, née Darnall) at St Peter-le-Poer, Old Broad Street. They had two children – Juliana, who married General Nikolai Sablukov of the Russian service, and John Angerstein (1773–1858).

Anna died in 1783, and in 1785 John Julius Angerstein married Eliza Lucas (daughter of the Rev. Joseph Payne and widow of Thomas Lucas, a director of the South Sea Company, president of Guy&#x27;s Hospital and West Indies merchant). A portrait of Angerstein and his second wife, Eliza, by Thomas Lawrence was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1792 (now held by The Louvre museum, Paris).

==Life and art collection==

In his role as a merchant Angerstein has been said to have owned a third share in slave estates in Grenada, but this assertion is incorrect. Although Angerstein almost certainly insured vessels involved in the slave trade, the only evidence of his involvement in slave-owning plantations (and the likely basis of the fallacy) was indirect, and not financial. Angerstein&#x27;s friend and client, George Peters, was owed money by the merchant Israel Wilkes. Angerstein and two others were made trustees for the creditors over Wilkes&#x27; assets, including two sugar estates in Grenada. 

Angerstein was chairman of Lloyd&#x27;s from 1790 to 1796 and counted King George III, British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and artist Sir Thomas Lawrence among his friends. He was also on the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor, an organisation with strong abolitionist connections.
After a number of knife attacks on women by the so-called &quot;London Monster&quot;, Angerstein promised a reward of £100 for capture of the perpetrator.

Among his earliest art purchases was &quot;The Rape of the Sabines&quot; by Rubens. Later acquisitions included works by Rembrandt, Velázquez, Titian, Raphael, Correggio and Hogarth, plus early drawings by J. M. W. Turner. From the sale in London of the French Orleans Collection he bought &quot;The Raising of Lazarus&quot; by Sebastiano del Piombo and other works. After his death, thirty-eight of his finest paintings were bought by the British government for £60,000 to form the nucleus of the collection of the British National Gallery. Until the National Gallery was built in Trafalgar Square in London, the 38 works from Angerstein&#x27;s collection were displayed in Angerstein&#x27;s town house in Pall Mall.

He lived for some years in Greenwich in south-east London, leasing a estate from Sir Gregory Page in 1774 and over the next two years building a house, Woodlands (designed by local architect George Gibson). This area is now known as Westcombe Park, part of a wide area on the north-eastern fringes of Blackheath that he sought to enclose in 1801. The house fell empty in 1870 when John&#x27;s grandson William Angerstein relinquished the lease.

In 1806 Angerstein served as vice-president of the newly formed London Institution, and the previous year became a founding governor of the British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom. Following the death of William Pitt the Younger in 1806, he commissioned Thomas Lawrence to paint a portrait of the former Prime Minister which is now in the Waterloo Chamber of Windsor Castle. As an active church-goer, he worshipped at St Alfege&#x27;s Church, Greenwich, where he was also churchwarden.

His family&#x27;s connections with Greenwich are still commemorated. Angerstein Lane, near the heath at Blackheath, bears the family name. A public house, The Angerstein Hotel, is on Woolwich Road, Greenwich, close to the Woolwich Road flyover (Blackwall Tunnel A102 southern approach) – on the opposite side of which lies the Angerstein Business Park (owned by Greenwich Enterprise Board). East of this is the Angerstein Railway Line (almost solely used for commercial freight, mainly sea-dredged aggregate landed at Angerstein Wharf, operated by Aggregate Industries), linking the peninsula at North Greenwich with the main railway network; as a result, an area of largely industrial land in between the lines, and to the east of the A102 road, is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Angerstein Triangle.&quot;

<text>Career development refers to the process an individual may undergo to evolve their occupational status. It is the process of making decisions for long term learning, to align personal needs of physical or psychological fulfillment with career advancement opportunities. Career Development can also refer to the total encompassment of an individual&#x27;s work-related experiences, leading up to the occupational role they may hold within an organization.

Career development can occur on an individual basis or an organizational level.

==Career development planning==
On an individual basis, career planning encompasses a process in which the individual is self-aware of their personal needs and desires for fulfilment in their personal life, in conjunction with the career they hold. While every person&#x27;s experiences are unique, this contributes to the different careers that people will acquire over their lifespan.

===Long-term careers===
Careers that are long-term commitments throughout an individual&#x27;s life are referred to as &quot;steady-state careers&quot;. The person will work towards their retirement with specialized skillsets learned throughout their entire life. For example, somebody would be required to complete a steady process of graduating from medical school and then working in the medical profession until they have retired. Steady-state careers may also be referred to as holding the same occupational role in an organization for an extended period and becoming specialized in the area of expertise. For example, a retail manager who has worked in the sales industry for an extended period of their life would have the knowledge, skills, and attributes regarding managing non-managerial staff and coordinating job tasks to be fulfilled by subordinates.

A career that requires new initiatives of growth and responsibility upon accepting new roles can be referred to as &quot;linear careers&quot;, as every unique opportunity entails a more significant impact of responsibility and decision-making power on an organizational environment. A linear career path involves a vertical movement in the hierarchy of management when one is promoted. For example, a higher-level management position in a company would entail more responsibility regarding decision-making and allocation of resources to effectively and efficiently run a company. Mid-level managers and top-level managers/CEOs would be referred to as having linear careers, as their vertical movement in the organizational hierarchy would also entail more responsibilities for planning, controlling, leading, and organizing managerial tasks.

===Short-term careers===
When individuals take on a short-term or temporary work, these are &quot;transitory careers&quot; and &quot;spiral careers&quot;. &quot;Transitory careers&quot; occur when a person undergoes frequent job changes, in which each task is not similar to the preceding one. For example, a fast-food worker who leaves the food industry after a year to work as an entry-level bookkeeper or an administrative assistant in an office setting is a Transitory Career change. The worker&#x27;s skills and knowledge of their previous job role will not be relevant to their new role.

A &quot;spiral career&quot; is any series of short term jobs that are non-identical to one another, but still contribute to skill-building of a specific attribute that individuals will accept over their lifetime.

==Career development perspectives: individual versus organizational needs==
An individual&#x27;s personal initiatives that they pursue for their career development are primarily concerned with their personal values, goals, interests, and the path required to fulfill these desires. A degree of control and sense of urgency over a personal career development path can require an individual to pursue additional education or training initiatives to align with their goals. In relation, John L. Holland&#x27;s 6 career anchors categorizes people to be investigative, realistic, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional, in which the career path will depend on the characteristic that an individual may embody.

The factors that influence an individual to make proper career goal decisions also relies on the environmental factors that are directly affecting them. Decisions are based on varying aspects affecting work-life balance, desires to align career options with their personal values, and the degree of stimulation or growth.

A corporate organization can be sufficient in providing career development opportunities through the Human Resources functions of Training and Development. The primary purpose of Training and Development is to ensure that the strategic planning of the organizational goals will remain adaptable to the demands of a changing environment. Upon recruiting and hiring employees, an organization&#x27;s Human Resource department is responsible for providing clear job descriptions regarding the job tasks at hand required for the role, along with the opportunities of job rotation, transfers, and promotions. Hiring managers are responsible for ensuring that the subordinates are aware of their job tasks, and ensure the flow of communication remains efficient. In relation, managers are also responsible for nurturing and creating a favorable work environment to work in, to foster the long term learning, development, and talent acquisition of their subordinates. Consequently, the extent to which a manager embraces the delegation of training and developing their employees plays a key factor in the retention and turnover of employees. 
==Relative context of social identity in career planning==
As the process of career planning is relational to balancing the varying factors of demands in an individual&#x27;s life, socio-demographics factors relating to an individual&#x27;s age, race, gender, and socio-economic status may influence the extent to which they pursue career planning or other opportunities for training and development of skills. The varying aspects of social identity in relation to the context of finding a balance to the demands in personal life will influence individuals to make decisions to change, adapt, or abandon their career path.

Both men and women for example, will make different types of decisions based on the situational factors that require balance. Women tend to make more choices to balance work and non-work priorities such as child or elder care. This may also discourage some women to pursue their career path, and focus on prioritizing assistance for others. Men will make decisions based on not only having to balance work and non-work priorities, but for advancement and added income.

<doc id="229116" wikidata="Q202883" url="?curid=229116" title="Veterinarian">
<text>A veterinarian (vet) or veterinary surgeon is a medical professional who practices veterinary medicine. They manage a wide range of health conditions and injuries in non-human animals. Along with this, veterinarians also play a role in animal reproduction, health management, conservation, husbandry and breeding and preventive medicine like nutrition, vaccination and parasitic control as well as biosecurity and zoonotic disease surveillance and prevention.

==Description==

In many countries, the local nomenclature for a veterinarian is a regulated and protected term, meaning that members of the public without the prerequisite qualifications and/or license are not able to use the title. This title is selective in order to produce the most knowledgeable veterinarians that pass these qualifications. In many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a veterinarian (such as treatment of illness or surgery in animals) are restricted only to those professionals who are registered as a veterinarian. For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may only be performed by registered veterinarians (with a few designated exceptions, such as paraveterinary workers), and it is illegal for any person who is not registered to call themselves a veterinarian, prescribe any drugs, or perform treatment.

Most veterinarians work in a clinical setting or bricks and mortar practice, treating animals directly. Other vets work as mobile vets offering veterinary services and treating patients in their clients home. Veterinarians may be involved in general practice, treating animals of all types; they may be specialized in a specific group of animals such as companion animals, livestock, zoo animals or equines; or may specialize in a narrow medical discipline such as surgery, dermatology or internal medicine. As with other healthcare professionals, veterinarians face ethical decisions about the care of their patients. Current debates within the profession include the ethics of certain procedures believed to be purely cosmetic or unnecessary for behavioral issues, such as declawing of cats, docking of tails, cropping of ears and debarking on dogs.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word &quot;veterinary&quot; comes from the Latin meaning &quot;working animals&quot;. &quot;Veterinarian&quot; was first used in print by Thomas Browne in 1646. Although &quot;vet&quot; is commonly used as an abbreviation in all English-speaking countries, the occupation is formally referred to as a veterinary surgeon in the United Kingdom and Ireland and now as a veterinarian in most of the rest of the English-speaking world.

==History==

Ancient Indian sage and veterinarian Shalihotra (mythological estimate c. 2350 BCE), the son of a sage, Hayagosha, is considered the founder of veterinary sciences.

The first veterinary college was founded in Lyon, France, in 1762 by Claude Bourgelat. According to Lupton, after observing the devastation being caused by cattle plague to the French herds, Bourgelat devoted his time to seeking out a remedy. This resulted in his founding a veterinary college in Lyon in 1761, from which establishment he dispatched students to combat the disease; in a short time, the plague was stayed and the health of stock restored, through the assistance rendered to agriculture by veterinary science and art.
The Odiham Agricultural Society was founded in 1783 in England to promote agriculture and industry, and played an important role in the foundation of the veterinary profession in Britain. A 1785 Society meeting resolved to &quot;promote the study of Farriery upon rational scientific principles.&quot;

The professionalization of the veterinary trade was finally achieved in 1790, through the campaigning of Granville Penn, who persuaded the Frenchman Charles Vial de Sainbel to accept the professorship of the newly established Veterinary College in London. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was established by royal charter in 1844.

Veterinary science came of age in the late 19th century, with notable contributions from Sir John McFadyean, credited by many as having been the founder of modern Veterinary research.

==Roles and responsibilities==
Veterinarians treat disease, disorder or injury in animals, which includes diagnosis, treatment and aftercare. The scope of practice, specialty and experience of the individual veterinarian will dictate exactly what interventions they perform, but most will perform surgery (of differing complexity).

Unlike in human medicine, veterinarians must rely primarily on clinical signs, as animals are unable to vocalize symptoms as a human would. In some cases, owners may be able to provide a medical history and the veterinarian can combine this information along with observations, and the results of pertinent diagnostic tests such as radiography, CT scans, MRI, blood tests, urinalysis and others.

Veterinarians must consider the appropriateness of euthanasia (&quot;putting to sleep&quot;) if a condition is likely to leave the animal in pain or with a poor quality of life, or if treatment of a condition is likely to cause more harm to the patient than good, or if the patient is unlikely to survive any treatment regimen. Additionally, there are scenarios where euthanasia is considered due to the constraints of the client&#x27;s finances.

As with human medicine, much veterinary work is concerned with prophylactic treatment, in order to prevent problems occurring in the future. Common interventions include vaccination against common animal illnesses, such as distemper or rabies, and dental prophylaxis to prevent or inhibit dental disease. This may also involve owner education so as to avoid future medical or behavioral issues.

Additionally, veterinarians can play important roles in public health and the prevention of zoonoses.

==Employment==

The majority of veterinarians are employed in private practice treating animals (75% of vets in the United States, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association).

Small animal veterinarians typically work in veterinary clinics, veterinary hospitals, or both. Large animal veterinarians often spend more time travelling to see their patients at the primary facilities which house them, such as zoos or farms.

Other employers include charities treating animals, colleges of veterinary medicine, research laboratories, animal food companies, and pharmaceutical companies. In many countries, the government may also be a major employer of veterinarians, such as the United States Department of Agriculture or the Animal and Plant Health Agency in the United Kingdom. State and local governments also employ veterinarians.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a greater demand for veterinary services. Many people are home with extra time on their hands, and adoption agencies and animals shelters have seen a surge in pet purchases as a result. The American Veterinary Medical Association has provided COVID-19 resources for veterinarians on prevention measures, animal testing, and wellbeing.

=== Focus of practice ===
Veterinarians and their practices may be specialized in certain areas of veterinary medicine. Areas of focus include:

* Exotic animal veterinarian – Specializes in treating animals other than common pets and livestock. Includes reptiles, exotic birds such as parrots and cockatoos, and small mammals such as ferrets, rabbits, and chinchillas.
* Conservation medicine – The study of the relationship between animal and human health and environmental information.
* Small animal practice – Usually dogs, cats, and other companion animals/household pets such as hamsters and gerbils. Some practices are canine-only or feline-only practices.
* Laboratory animal practice – Some veterinarians work in a university or industrial laboratory and are responsible for the care and treatment of laboratory animals of any species (often involving bovines, porcine species, felines, canines, rodents, and even exotic animals). Their responsibility is not only for the health and well-being of the animals, but also for enforcing humane and ethical treatment of the animals in the facility.
* Large animal practice – Usually referring to veterinarians that work with, variously, livestock and other large farm animals, as well as equine species and large reptiles.
* Equine medicine – Some veterinarians are specialists in equine medicine. Horses are different in anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and husbandry to other domestic species. Specialization in equine veterinary practice is something that is normally developed after qualification, even if students do have some interest before graduation.
* Food supply medicine – Some veterinarians deal exclusively or primarily with animals raised for food (such as meat, milk, and eggs). Livestock practitioners may deal with ovine (sheep), bovine (cattle) and porcine (swine) species; such veterinarians deal with management of herds, nutrition, reproduction, and minor field surgery. Dairy medicine practice focuses on dairy animals. Poultry medicine practice focuses on the health of flocks of poultry; the field often involves extensive training in pathology, epidemiology, and nutrition of birds. The veterinarian treats the flock and not the individual animals.
* Food safety practice – Veterinarians are employed by both the food industry and government agencies to advise on and monitor the handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illness.
* Wildlife medicine – A relatively recent branch of veterinary medicine, focusing on wildlife. Wildlife medicine veterinarians may work with zoologists and conservation medicine practitioners and may also be called out to treat marine species such as sea otters, dolphins, or whales after a natural disaster or oil spill.
* Aquatic medicine – mostly refers to veterinary care of fish in aquaculture (like salmon, cod, among other species), but can also include care of aquatic mammals. For certain countries with high economic income from aquaculture, this is an important part of the veterinary field (like Norway, Chile). Other countries (particularly those which are landlocked), might have little or no emphasis on aquatic medicine.
* Dentistry – Many practices are incorporating dentistry into their daily medical services. Veterinary dentistry can extend the life of the patient by preventing oral disease and keeping the teeth and gums of the patient in healthy condition.

===Veterinary specialties===

Veterinary specialists are in the minority compared to general practice veterinarians, and tend to be based at points of referral, such as veterinary schools or larger animal hospitals. Unlike human medicine, veterinary specialties often combine both the surgical and medical aspects of a biological system.

Veterinary specialties are accredited in North America by the AVMA through the American Board of Veterinary Specialties, in Europe by the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation and in Australia and New Zealand by the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council. While some veterinarians may have areas of interest outside of recognized specialties, they are not legally specialists.

Specialties can cover general topics such as anesthesiology, dentistry, and surgery, as well as organ system focus such as cardiology or dermatology. A full list can be seen at veterinary specialties.

=== Mobile practice ===
Many veterinarians, especially in large animal practice, offer house calls and farm calls through a mobile practice. The start-up and operating costs of a mobile practice are typically lower than those of a traditional brick and mortar hospital, which can cost millions of dollars or more for equipment and surgical supplies. Costs associated with mobile units can range from as low as $5,000 for a utility box in an SUV to around $250,000 for a fully equipped custom built chassis. The potential advantages to the client are not having to transport the animal, lower stress for the animal, a lower risk of disease transmission from other animals, and convenience. A 2015 study published in the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association proved that blood pressure readings, pulse rates and body temperature rates were increased by 11–16% when those readings were done in the clinic versus in the home. However, mobile practices often lack the facilities and equipment to provide advanced care, surgery, or hospitalization. Some mobile practices maintain a relationship with a traditional hospital for referral of cases needing more comprehensive care.

=== Salary ===
The last AVMA Report on Veterinary Compensation, published in 2018, indicated private practice associate veterinarians who had board certification earned a mean of $187,000. A veterinarian&#x27;s salary can easily exceed $300,000 depending on the specialty. The median starting salary for new veterinary graduates without specialization in 2018 was $103,800 in the United States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the lowest paid earned less than $89,540 annually. States and districts with the highest mean salary are California ($398,340), Michigan ($325,100), Illinois ($324,870), New York ($322,500), and Hawaii ($221,150). Veterinarians who own their own clinics are typically paid a much higher salary. The average owner payout is $400,000 for every $1,000,000 of clinic income. In 2021 there were practices sold with $8–10,000,000 in yearly revenue with the owners drawing salaries of several million dollars. Over 90% of practice owners do not regret purchasing or starting their own practice, according to a 2020 survey of clinic owners.

==Education and regulation==

In order to practice, vets must complete an appropriate degree in veterinary medicine, and in most cases must also be registered with the relevant governing body for their jurisdiction.

===Veterinary science degrees===
Degrees in veterinary medicine culminate in the award of a veterinary science degree, although the title varies by region. For instance, in North America, graduates will receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris; DVM or VMD), whereas in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand or India they would be awarded a Bachelor of Veterinary Science, Surgery or Medicine (BVS, BVSc, BVetMed or BVMS), and in Ireland graduates receive a Medicinae Veterinariae Baccalaureus (MVB). 
In continental Europe, the degree of Doctor Medicinae Veterinariae (DMV, DrMedVet, Dr. med. vet., MVDr.) or Doctor Veterinariae Medicinae (DVM, DrVetMed, Dr. vet. med.) is granted.

The award of a bachelor&#x27;s degree was previously commonplace in the United States, but the degree name and academic standards were upgraded to match the &#x27;doctor&#x27; title used by graduates.

Comparatively few universities have veterinary schools that offer degrees which are accredited to qualify the graduates as registered vets. For example, there are 30 in the United States, 5 in Canada, 1 in New Zealand, 7 in Australia (4 of which offer degrees accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)), and 8 in the United Kingdom (4 of which offer degrees accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)).

Due to this scarcity of places for veterinary degrees, admission to veterinary school is competitive and requires extensive preparation. In the United States in 2007, approximately 5,750 applicants competed for the 2,650 seats in the 28 accredited veterinary schools, with an acceptance rate of 46%.

With competitive admission, many schools may place heavy emphasis and consideration on a candidate&#x27;s veterinary and animal experience. Formal experience is a particular advantage to the applicant, often consisting of work with veterinarians or scientists in clinics, agribusiness, research, or some area of health science. Less formal experience is also helpful for the applicant to have, and this includes working with animals on a farm or ranch or at a stable or animal shelter and basic overall animal exposure.

In the United States, approximately 80% of admitted students are female. In the early history of veterinary medicine of the United States, most veterinarians were males. However, in the 1990s this ratio reached parity, and now it has been reversed.

Preveterinary courses should emphasize the sciences. Most veterinary schools typically require applicants to have taken one year equivalent classes in organic, inorganic chemistry, physics, general biology; and one semester of vertebrate embryology and biochemistry. Usually, the minimal mathematics requirement is college level calculus. Individual schools might require introduction to animal science, livestock judging, animal nutrition, cell biology, and genetics. However, due to the limited availability of these courses, many schools have removed these requirements to widen the pool of possible applicants.

===Registration and licensing===
Following academic education, most countries require a vet to be registered with the relevant governing body, and to maintain this license to practice.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, veterinarians must be licensed to practice in the United States. Licensing entails passing an accredited program, a national exam, and a state exam. For instance, in the United States, a prospective vet must receive a passing grade on a national board examination, the North America Veterinary Licensing Exam. This exam must be completed over the course of eight hours, and consists of 360 multiple-choice questions, covering all aspects of veterinary medicine, as well as visual material designed to test diagnostic skills.

===Postgraduate study===
The percentage electing to undertake further study following registration in the United States has increased from 36.8% to 39.9% in 2008. About 25% of those or about 9% of graduates were accepted into traditional academic internships. Approximately 9% of veterinarians eventually board certify in one of 40 distinct specialties from 22 specialty organizations recognized by the AVMA American Board of Veterinary Specialties (ABVS).

=== Curriculum comparison with human medicine ===
The first two-year curriculum in both veterinary and human medical schools are very similar in course names, but in certain subjects are relatively different in content. Considering the courses, the first two-year curriculum usually includes biochemistry, physiology, histology, anatomy, pharmacology, microbiology, epidemiology, pathology and hematology.

Some veterinary schools use the same biochemistry, histology, and microbiology books as human medical students; however, the course content is greatly supplemented to include the varied animal diseases and species differences. In the past, many veterinarians were trained in pharmacology using the same text books used by physicians. As the specialty of veterinary pharmacology has developed, more schools are using pharmacology textbooks written specifically for veterinarians. Veterinary physiology, anatomy, and histology is complex, as physiology often varies among species. Microbiology and virology of animals share the same foundation as human microbiology, but with grossly different disease manifestation and presentations. Epidemiology is focused on herd health and prevention of herd borne diseases and foreign animal diseases. Pathology, like microbiology and histology, is very diverse and encompasses many species and organ systems. Most veterinary schools have courses in small animal and large animal nutrition, often taken as electives in the clinical years or as part of the core curriculum in the first two years.

The final two-year curriculum is similar to that of human medicine only in clinical emphasis. A veterinary student must be well prepared to be a fully functional veterinarian on the day of graduation, competent in both surgery and medicine. The graduating veterinarian must be able to pass medical board examination and be prepared to enter clinical practice on the day of graduation, while most human medical doctors in the United States complete 3 to 5 years of post-doctoral residency before practicing medicine independently, usually in a very narrow and focused specialty. Many veterinarians do also complete a post-doctoral residency, but it is not nearly as common as it is in human medicine.

In the last years, curricula in both human and veterinary medicine have been adapted with the aim of incorporating competency-based teaching. Furthermore, the importance of institutionalized systematic teacher feedback has been recognized and tools such as clinical encounter cards are being implemented in clinical veterinary education.

==Impact on human medicine==
Some veterinarians pursue post-graduate training and enter research careers and have contributed to advances in many human and veterinary medical fields, including pharmacology and epidemiology. Research veterinarians were the first to isolate oncoviruses, &quot;Salmonella&quot; species, &quot;Brucella&quot; species, and various other pathogenic agents. Veterinarians were in the forefront in the effort to suppress malaria and yellow fever in the United States. Veterinarians identified the botulism disease-causing agent, developed propofol; a widely used anesthetic induction drug, produced an anticoagulant used to treat human heart disease, and developed surgical techniques for humans, such as hip-joint replacement, limb and organ transplants.

== Occupational hazards ==
Veterinarians work with a wide variety of animal species typically in hospitals, clinics, labs, farms, and zoos. Veterinarians face many occupational hazards including zoonotic diseases, bites and scratches, hazardous drugs, needlestick injuries, ionizing radiation, and noise. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 12% of workers in the veterinary services profession reported a work-related injury or illness in 2016.

Veterinary practices need a health and safety plan that addresses infection prevention and other hazards. Workplaces should utilize engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment to keep their employees safe. PPE such as gloves, safety goggles, lab coats, and hearing protection should be readily available with mandatory training on proper usage. Raising awareness is the most important step in promoting workplace health and safety.

=== Biological and chemical hazards ===
Needlestick injuries are the most common accidents among veterinarians, but they are likely underreported. Needlesticks can result in hazardous drug or bloodborne-pathogen exposures.

Unlike human medical professionals, veterinarians receive minimal training on safe handling of hazardous drugs in school. Also, a large percentage of veterinarians are women of reproductive age and drug exposures put them at risk of infertility or other adverse health outcomes. Additionally, some antibiotics, steroids, and chemotherapy drugs are known to have negative effects on male fertility. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has issued guidance on the safe handling of hazardous drugs for veterinary workers. Animal bites and scratches are another common injury in veterinary practice.

The close interactions with animals put veterinarians at increased risk of contracting zoonoses. A systematic review of veterinary students found that between 17% and 64% had acquired a zoonotic disease during their studies. The animal species, work setting, health and safety practices, and training can all affect the risk of injury and illness.

=== Physical hazards ===
Noise can be a prominent exposure, in which case a hearing loss prevention program may be recommended. A NIOSH study on kennel noise found that noise levels often exceeded OSHA&#x27;s permissible exposure limit. Reducing noise is beneficial for animal and human health.

=== Psychosocial hazards ===

Veterinarians have high suicide rates in comparison to the general population. A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that male veterinarians are 2.1 times and female veterinarians are 3.5 times as likely as the general population to die by suicide. Some reasons for this could be long hours, work overload, client expectations and complaints, poor remuneration, euthanasia procedures, and poor work-life balance. A survey of more than 11,000 vets found 9% had serious psychological distress, 31% experienced depressive episodes, and 17% had suicidal ideation. Online support groups, such as Not One More Vet, have been established to help veterinarians who may be experiencing suicidal thoughts. NOMV educates veterinarians and vet techs about other ways to help themselves with mental health. Another driver of stress can be student loan debt. A 2013 national survey found that average debt for veterinary medicine graduates was as high as $162,113. Veterinarian lifelong earning potential is less than a physician, so it can take a lot longer to break even.

==In popular culture==

Reality televisions shows featuring veterinarians include:
*&quot;Bondi Vet&quot;, an Australian factual television series documenting the work of veterinary surgeon Chris Brown at the Bondi Junction Veterinary Hospital.
*&quot;Dr. Oakley, Yukon Vet&quot;, about a Canadian veterinarian in the Yukon two of whose daughters assist her.
*&quot;The Incredible Dr. Pol&quot;, a US veterinarian reality show. Produced by National Geographic Wild, a Disney channel. It follows the life of Dr. Jan Pol and Pol Veterinarian Service in Michigan.
*&quot;E-Vet Interns&quot; (1998–2002), a US show filmed at Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, Colorado.
*&quot;Emergency Vets&quot;, filmed at Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, Colorado.
*&quot;Rookie Vets&quot; (2005), featuring students at Massey University in New Zealand.
*&quot;Vet School Confidential&quot; (2001), following students at Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine in the US.
*&quot;Vets in Practice&quot; (1997–2002), a British series.

Fictional works featuring a veterinarian as the main protagonist include:
*James Herriot&#x27;s series of books containing fictionalized stories of his career as a farm animal veterinarian in England, which was adapted as the BBC television series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;.
*&quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; about Andrew MacDhui, a veterinarian in a village in Scotland.
* The Doctor Dolittle series of children&#x27;s books, which have thrice been adapted into movies, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998), and &quot;Dolittle&quot; (2020).
*The movie &quot;Beethoven&quot;, featuring the evil veterinarian Dr. Herman Varnick.

== Veterinary malpractice ==
Most states in the US allow for malpractice lawsuit in case of death or injury to an animal from professional negligence. Usually the penalty is not greater than the value of the animal. Some states allow for punitive penalty, loss of companionship, and suffering, likely increasing the cost of veterinary malpractice insurance and the cost of veterinary care. Most veterinarians carry business, worker&#x27;s compensation, and facility insurance to protect their clients and workers from injury inflicted by animals.

<doc id="229119" wikidata="Q5874974" url="?curid=229119" title="Hobbyist operating system">
<text>The development of a hobbyist operating system is one of the more involved and technical options for a computer hobbyist. The definition of a hobby operating system can sometimes be vague. It can be from the developer&#x27;s view, where the developers do it just for fun or learning; it can also be seen from the user&#x27;s view, where the users are only using it as a toy; or it can be defined as an operating system which doesn&#x27;t have a very big user base.

Development can begin from existing resources like a kernel, an operating system, or a bootloader, or it can also be made completely from scratch. The development platform could be a bare hardware machine, which is the nature of an operating system, but it could also be developed and tested on a virtual machine. Since the hobbyist must claim more ownership for adapting a complex system to the ever-changing needs of the technical terrain, much enthusiasm is common amongst the different groups attracted to operating system development.

==Development==
Elements of operating system development include:

* Kernel:
** Bootstrapping
** Memory management
** Process management and scheduling
** Device driver management
** Program API
* External programs
* User interface

The C programming language is frequently used for hobby operating system programming, as well as assembly language, though other languages can be used as well.

The use of assembly language is common with small systems, especially those based on eight bit microprocessors such as the MOS Technology 6502 family or the Zilog Z80, or in systems with a lack of available resources because of its small output size and low-level efficiency.

==User interface==
Most hobby operating systems use a command-line interface or a simple text user interface due to ease of development. More advanced hobby operating systems may have a graphical user interface. For example, AtheOS was a hobby operating system with a graphical interface written entirely by one programmer.

===Examples===
==Use of BIOS==
This section is predominantly x86 oriented.

The term BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) refers to firmware that initialises computer hardware and has provisions to load an operating system. The BIOS also sets up a standard interface for several low-level device drivers at boot time. BIOS resources are often used by hobbyist operating systems, especially those written on 16-bit x86 machines, as many hobby operating systems developers lack the time to write complex low level drivers themselves or they simply want to get into writing software for the system as soon as possible.

The most commonly used BIOS functions are VideoBIOS and Disk services. These are used because video cards and disk drives vary significantly on different machines and specialised drivers are often difficult to write.

The use of the BIOS is uncommon in operating systems that operate in Protected mode or Long mode, because the system must switch back to real mode which BIOS drivers run in.

<doc id="229122" wikidata="Q683837" url="?curid=229122" title="Perching duck">
<text>The term perching ducks is used colloquially to mean any species of ducks distinguished by their readiness to perch high in trees.

Until the late 20th century, perching ducks meant &quot;Cairinini&quot;, a tribe of ducks in the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, grouped together on the basis of their readiness to perch high in trees. It has been subsequently shown that the grouping is paraphyletic and their apparent similarity results from convergent evolution, with the different members more closely related to various other ducks than to each other.

Perching duck species include: 

[[Plectropterinae]]
*Spur-winged goose &quot;Plectropterus gambensis&quot;

[[Tadorninae]]
*Salvadori&#x27;s teal &quot;Salvadorina waigiuensis&quot; (initially placed in Anatinae)
*Blue duck &quot;Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos&quot;
*Torrent duck &quot;Merganetta armata&quot;

[[Anatinae]]
*Brazilian teal &quot;Amazonetta brasiliensis&quot;

Species that were formerly in the Cairinini tribe, and do not have an identified current subfamily include:

*Comb duck &quot;Sarkidiornis melanotos&quot;: Tadorninae or basal Anatinae?
*Pink-eared duck &quot;Malacorhynchus membranaceus&quot;: Tadorninae or Oxyurinae?
*Hartlaub&#x27;s duck &quot;Pteronetta hartlaubi&quot;: Anatinae or a very distinct clade?
*Green pygmy goose &quot;Nettapus pulchellus&quot;: Anatinae or a Gondwanan clade?
*Cotton pygmy goose &quot;Nettapus coromandellanus&quot;: Anatinae or a Gondwanan clade?
*African pygmy goose &quot;Nettapusre auritus&quot;: Anatinae or a Gondwanan clade?
*Muscovy duck &quot;Cairina moschata&quot;: Anatinae or Tadorninae?
*White-winged duck &quot;Cairina scutulata&quot;: Anatinae or closer to Aythyinae?
*Wood duck &quot;Aix sponsa&quot;: Anatinae or Tadorninae?
*Mandarin duck &quot;Aix galericulata&quot;: Anatinae or Tadorninae?
*Ringed teal &quot;Callonetta leucophrys&quot;: Anatinae or Tadorninae?
*Maned duck &quot;Chenonetta jubata&quot;: Anatinae or Tadorninae?

<text>The Golden Raspberry Awards (also known as the Razzies and Razzie Awards) is a parody award show honoring the worst of cinematic failures. Co-founded by UCLA film graduates and film industry veterans John J. B. Wilson and Mo Murphy, the Razzie Awards&#x27; satirical annual ceremony is preceded by its progenitor, the Academy Awards, by four decades. The term &quot;&quot; is used in its irreverent sense, as in &quot;blowing a raspberry&quot;. The statuette is a golf ball-sized raspberry atop a Super 8mm film reel atop a 35-millimeter film core with brown wood shelf paper glued and wrapped around it—sitting atop a jar lid spray-painted gold. The Golden Raspberry Foundation has claimed that the award &quot;encourages well-known filmmakers and top-notch performers to own their bad.&quot;

The first Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony was held on March 31, 1981, in John J. B. Wilson&#x27;s living-room alcove in Hollywood, to honor the perceived worst films of the 1980 film season. Sylvester Stallone has the most Razzies ever, with 12.

==History==

American publicist John J. B. Wilson had been seeing a 99-cent double feature of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot; and thought in his drive home that those movies deserved awards for their low quality, and subsequently started thinking of all the other films that disappointed him in 1980, particularly as he had watched hundreds of productions in his job making trailers. So, the following year, in the potluck parties he usually held at his home in Hollywood on the night of the Academy Awards, after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson passed ballots regarding the worst in film to the attendees, and invited his friends to give random award presentations in his living room. Wilson stood at a lectern made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; as the first Golden Raspberry Award Winner for Worst Picture. The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; with the headline: &quot;Take These Envelopes, Please&quot;.

Approximately three dozen people came to the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the attendance, and the 3rd awards ceremony had doubled that number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: &quot;We finally figured out you couldn&#x27;t compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on,&quot; he said to &quot;BBC News&quot;.

In 2022, a dedicated award category, Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 Movie, was created after Bruce Willis starred in a number of poorly received low-budget films. On March 30 of that year, Willis&#x27;s family announced that he had been diagnosed with aphasia. The Golden Raspberry Awards subsequently retracted the award category, saying it was inappropriate to award a Golden Raspberry to someone whose performance was affected by a medical condition. At the same time, the Awards retroactively retracted their 1980 Worst Actress nomination of Shelley Duvall in &quot;The Shining&quot;, stating &quot;We have since discovered that Duvall&#x27;s performance was impacted by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s treatment of her throughout the production&quot;. In 2023, following backlash for nominating 12-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong for Worst Actress, the Golden Raspberry Awards rescinded the nomination and said individuals under age 18 would no longer be nominated. The Razzies themselves later won the category for the blunder.

==Format==
Members of the Golden Raspberry Award Organization pay for membership, and number 650 from 19 countries. After three editions held during Wilson&#x27;s potluck Oscar parties, Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage, and the fourth edition happened at Los Angeles&#x27; Third Street Elementary School. The ceremonies have generally been scheduled in this way, with both nominations and awards revealed in the day before the Academy Awards, ever since, with only two exceptions; the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards had the nominees announced the day before the Academy Award nominees, but the ceremony took place on April 1, April Fool&#x27;s Day. In 2020, there were plans for the milestone 40th Golden Raspberry Awards to be celebrated with a bigger, televised ceremony in March, but the ceremonies were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the winners revealed online.

==Recipients who have accepted their award==

Paul Verhoeven was the first person to go to the ceremony to receive his awards for the movie &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Other recipients who have accepted their Golden Raspberry Award include Tom Green (Worst Actor/Worst Director), Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock (Worst Actress), Michael Ferris and J. D. Shapiro (Worst Screenplay), Alan Menken, Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, and &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; producers Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca.

==Contenders for worst and best==
Several people and/or films have received Razzie nominations while simultaneously receiving award nominations and other cultural honors from different organizations, sometimes for the same work or role.

===Razzie and Oscar===
Three people have won both a Razzie and an Oscar the same weekend: composer Alan Menken in 1993, screenwriter Brian Helgeland in 1997, and actress Sandra Bullock in 2010, though all three won for different films (e.g., Helgeland won a Razzie for &quot;The Postman&quot; and an Oscar for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;). Three actors have received Oscar and Razzie acting nominations for the same role: James Coco (&quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;), Amy Irving (&quot;Yentl&quot;), and Glenn Close (&quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot;).

19 Worst Picture nominees have been nominated for an Oscar (with only four of them &quot;winning&quot; the Worst Picture Razzie), with &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; being the only film in 2002 that won in any Oscars category: Best Sound Editing.

Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; became the first, and so far, only animated film to be nominated for an Oscar and a Razzie. The film was nominated for Worst Written Film Grossing Over $100 Million at the 17th ceremony, but it was also nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 69th Academy Awards.

&quot;Blonde&quot; became the first NC-17 rated film to be nominated for an Oscar and a Razzie. The film was nominated for the most Razzies with eight at the 43rd ceremony: winning only two (including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay), while the film&#x27;s main star Ana de Armas was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 95th Academy Awards.

As of 2024, 77 films have been nominated for both an Oscar and a Razzie.

===Razzie and Tony===
&quot;Newsies&quot; was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1993 ceremony, and Alan Menken won Worst Original Song for &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot;&quot;.&quot; The 2011 stage adaptation, which did not include &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot;, was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical, and Menken won Best Original Score.

==Criticism==
The Razzies have received criticism, including from news sources such as &quot;IndieWire&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, for several issues, including that members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation are not required to watch the nominated films. The awards follow a different set of rules from the invitation-only Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Critics take issue with the Razzies picking &quot;easy targets&quot; and critically panned mainstream films instead of those perceived as less popular but more deserving of notice, and continuing to appeal to celebrities, seemingly for publicity and attention.

Sam Adams of &quot;IndieWire&quot; has said the Razzies are &quot;like hecklers hurling insults at comedians or a concertgoer yelling out &#x27;Whoo!&#x27; during a quiet song, they&#x27;re not-so-secretly crying out to be noticed. The Razzies, properly enough, avoid pouncing on the little guy; they don&#x27;t trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound&quot;. Robbie Collin of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, however, that &quot;the Razzies&#x27; ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year&quot;. CraveOnline&#x27;s William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow &quot;a cheap shot of pranksterism&quot;, and &quot;with only a handful of exceptions, the Razzies have only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year, and not necessarily the worst.&quot; In 2018, Scott Meslow, writing for &quot;GQ&quot;, accused the Razzies of being &quot;pretty lazy, very sexist, and a little racist&quot; in their choices, reiterating criticism that voters were overreliant on films already widely perceived as notorious, and further asserting they disproportionally nominated films directed by and starring Tyler Perry and films marketed towards women.

In 2021, Liam Gaughan of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;It’s easy to find fault in any awards nominations, be it Oscars or Razzies, but the greater issue that the Razzies face is that making fun of bad movies is no longer original. Film criticism, essays and satire all live in abundance on the internet, from both established publications and non-professionals.&quot; Daniel Cook Johnson of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; echoed a similar sentiment, writing, &quot;Wilson and Murphy&#x27;s insulting event may have been a wonderfully snarky and skewering enterprise back in the &#x27;80s when there was much less film criticism and audience reactions to recent movies. But now, there&#x27;s little reason for such an invalid vehicle, and the retirement option should be recognized before their relevance and shaky reputation are completely gone.&quot;

The Razzies have also seen significant criticism from both within the industry and its own voting body for including underage actors and actresses in their ballots and nominations, with many noting the outcome of their careers and later personal and legal issues. Among those who were nominated or won include Aileen Quinn (at age 11) for &quot;Annie&quot; (winner), Gary Coleman (at age 14) for &quot;On the Right Track&quot; in 1982, Macaulay Culkin (at age 14) for &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot;, &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;, and &quot;Richie Rich&quot; in 1995, Jake Lloyd (at age 11) for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, Jaden Smith (age 15) for &quot;After Earth&quot; (winner), and Ryan Kiera Armstrong (at age 12) for &quot;Firestarter&quot;. Maddie Ziegler, though 18 years old when nominated, won Worst Supporting Actress for &quot;Music&quot;, released in 2021, for a role she played at 14 years old during filming in 2017. After backlash in 2023, the Razzies announced they would no longer nominate individuals under age 18.

<text>George Stubbs (25 August 1724 – 10 July 1806) was an English painter, best known for his paintings of horses. Self-trained, Stubbs learnt his skills independently from other great artists of the 18th century such as Reynolds and Gainsborough. Stubbs&#x27; output includes history paintings, but his greatest skill was in painting animals (such as horses, dogs and lions), perhaps influenced by his love and study of anatomy. His series of paintings on the theme of a lion attacking a horse are early and significant examples of the Romantic movement that emerged in the late 18th century. He enjoyed royal patronage. His painting &quot;Whistlejacket&quot; hangs in the National Gallery, London.

==Biography==

Stubbs was born in Liverpool, the son of a currier, or leather-dresser, John Stubbs, and his wife Mary. Information on his life until the age of 35 or so is sparse, relying almost entirely on notes made by Ozias Humphry, a fellow artist and friend; Humphry&#x27;s informal memoir, which was not intended for publication, was based on a series of private conversations he had with Stubbs around 1794, when Stubbs was 70 years old, and Humphry 52.

Stubbs worked at his father&#x27;s trade until the age of 15 or 16, at which point he told his father that he wished to become a painter. While initially resistant, Stubbs&#x27;s father (who died not long afterward in 1741), eventually acquiesced in his son&#x27;s choice of a career path, on the condition that he could find an appropriate mentor. Stubbs subsequently approached the Lancashire painter and engraver Hamlet Winstanley, and was briefly engaged by him in a sort of apprenticeship relationship, probably not more than several weeks in duration. Having initially demonstrated his abilities and agreed to do some copying work, Stubbs had access to and opportunity to study the collection at Knowsley Hall near Liverpool, the estate where Winstanley was then residing; however, he soon left when he came into conflict with the older artist over exactly which pictures he could work on copying.

Thereafter, as an artist Stubbs was self-taught. He had had a passion for anatomy from his childhood, and in or around 1744, he moved to York, in the North of England, to pursue his ambition to study the subject under experts. In York, from 1745 to 1753, he worked as a portrait painter, and studied human anatomy under the surgeon Charles Atkinson, at York County Hospital, One of his earliest surviving works is a set of illustrations for a textbook on midwifery by John Burton, &quot;Essay towards a Complete New System of Midwifery&quot;, published in 1751.

In 1754 Stubbs visited Italy. Forty years later he told Ozias Humphry that his motive for going to Italy was, &quot;to convince himself that nature was and is always superior to art whether Greek or Roman, and having renewed this conviction he immediately resolved upon returning home&quot;. In 1756 he rented a farmhouse in the village of Horkstow, Lincolnshire, and spent 18 months dissecting horses, assisted by his common-law wife, Mary Spencer. He moved to London in about 1759 and in 1766 published &quot;The anatomy of the Horse&quot;. The original drawings are now in the collection of the Royal Academy.

Even before his book was published, Stubbs&#x27;s drawings were seen by leading aristocratic patrons, who recognised that his work was more accurate than that of earlier horse painters such as James Seymour, Peter Tillemans and John Wootton. In 1759 the 3rd Duke of Richmond commissioned three large pictures from him, and his career was soon secure. By 1763 he had produced works for several more dukes and other lords and was able to buy a house in Marylebone, a fashionable part of London, where he lived for the rest of his life.

A famous work, &quot;Whistlejacket&quot;, a painting of the thoroughbred race horse rising on his hind legs, commissioned by the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, is now in the National Gallery in London. This and two other paintings carried out for Rockingham break with convention in having plain backgrounds. Throughout the 1760s he produced a wide range of individual and group portraits of horses, sometimes accompanied by hounds. He often painted horses with their grooms, whom he always painted as individuals. Meanwhile, he also continued to accept commissions for portraits of people, including some group portraits. From the inaugural Exhibition of 1761 onwards he exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain at Spring Gardens, but in 1775 he switched his allegiance to the recently founded but already more prestigious Royal Academy of Arts. He served as President of the Society of Artists for a year from October 1772, when it was already beset by financial problems and defections to the Royal Academy.

Stubbs also painted more exotic animals including lions, tigers, giraffes, monkeys, and rhinoceroses, which he was able to observe in private menageries. His painting of a kangaroo was the first glimpse of this animal for many 18th-century Britons. He became preoccupied with the theme of a wild horse threatened by a lion and produced several variations on this theme. These and other works became well known at the time through engravings of Stubbs&#x27;s work, which appeared in increasing numbers in the 1770s and 1780s.

Stubbs also painted historical pictures, but these are much less well regarded. From the late 1760s he produced some work on enamel. In the 1770s Josiah Wedgwood developed a new and larger type of enamel panel at Stubbs&#x27;s request. Stubbs hoped to achieve commercial success with his paintings in enamel, but the venture left him in debt. Also in the 1770s he painted single portraits of dogs for the first time, while also receiving an increasing number of commissions to paint hunts with their packs of hounds. He remained active into his old age. In the 1780s he produced a pastoral series called &quot;Haymakers&quot; and &quot;Reapers&quot;, and in the early 1790s he enjoyed the patronage of the Prince of Wales, whom he painted on horseback in 1791. His last project, begun in 1795, was &quot;A comparative anatomical exposition of the structure of the human body with that of a tiger and a common fowl&quot;, fifteen engravings from which appeared between 1804 and 1806. The project was left unfinished upon Stubbs&#x27;s death. He died at the age of 81 on 10 July 1806 at the home he had lived in since 1763, No.24 Somerset Street, near Portman Square, Marylebone, central London. He was buried on 18 July in the graveyard of St Marylebone Parish Church, now a garden of rest.

Stubbs&#x27;s son George Townly Stubbs was an engraver and printmaker.

==A lion attacking a horse==

Stubbs began an informal series of works on the subject of a lion attacking a horse around 1762 or 1763, and he continued to explore and reinterpret the theme in at least 17 images over a period of about 30 years. These paintings are among his most celebrated and influential works. One art historian wrote &quot;The appearance of the monumental picture now in the Mellon Collection [&quot;A Lion Attacking a Horse&quot;, ca. 1762-63] must be treated as one of the outstanding events in English eighteenth-century art for within the context of painting at that date its singularity as well as its inherent originality is most striking. Not since the publication of Hogarth&#x27;s Harlot&#x27;s Progress thirty years before had there occurred such an innovation.&quot; The iconic paintings are in fact among the earliest manifestations of Romanticism in painting, predating the work of more familiar masters of the movement such as William Blake, Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, William Turner, and Théodore Géricault, who was known to be an admirer of both horses, and the work of George Stubbs. Jean Clay, professor of art history at the University of Paris, perceptively observed that not only does the energy and terror of the animals foreshadow the spirit of romanticism but, as Stubbs&#x27;s series progressed, the horror seemed to diffuse and expand throughout the whole of the landscape: &quot;an image that would fertilize the Romantic imagination and come to full flower a half-century later.&quot;

The series are mostly oil paintings on canvas, but also include examples of enamel on copper, original engravings, and even a relief model in Wedgwood clay. The white horse was painted from one of the Kings Horses in the Mews, secured for the artist by an architect friend, Mr. Payne. Stubbs was able to study a lion in life that was in the menagerie of Lord Shellburne at Hounslow Heath. The earliest work is a life-size painting of &quot;A Lion Attacking a Horse&quot; (ca. 1762-63), which was commissioned by the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham and now in the Yale Center for British Art. Art historian Basil Taylor postulated the theme was treated in three distinct episodes: Episode A, a lion prowling at some distance from a terrified horse; Episode B, a lion close to a terrified horse; Episode C a lion on the horse&#x27;s back biting its flank. Interestingly, Stubbs first painted &quot;Episode C&quot;, and it was not until later that he was inspired to go back and paint the moments leading up to the climatic event.

An anecdote regarding the origin of the subject matter emerged soon after the artist death, originally published in &quot;The Sporting Magazine&quot; in 1808, and reiterate often for well over a century and a half. Art historian H. W. Janson repeated it &quot;On a visit to North Africa, he had seen a horse killed by a lion; this experience haunted his imagination, and from it he developed a new type of animal picture full of Romantic feeling for the grandeur and violence of nature.&quot; However, research published in 1965 produced a rather persuasive argument that Stubbs in fact never traveled to Africa, and the actual inspiration for the painting was an antique sculpture he had seen in a well documented 1754 stay in Rome. The sculpture, &quot;Lion Seizing a Horse&quot;, in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, is a restored Roman copy of a Hellenistic original. It has been a celebrated work since the Renaissance, admired by Michelangelo, included in guidebooks of Stubbs&#x27;s day, and copied any number of times by various artist in marble, bronze, and prints, including an 18th century marble copy in the collection of Stubbs&#x27;s patron Henry Blundell, who also acquired one of the paintings by Stubbs.

==Legacy==

Stubbs remained a secondary figure in British art until the mid-twentieth century. The art historian Basil Taylor and art collector Paul Mellon both championed Stubbs&#x27;s work. Stubbs&#x27;s &quot;Pumpkin with a Stable-lad&quot; was the first painting that Mellon bought in 1936. Basil Taylor was commissioned in 1955 by Pelican Press to write the book &quot;Animal Painting in England – From Barlow to Landseer&quot;, which included a large segment on Stubbs. In 1959 Mellon and Taylor first met and bonded over their appreciation of Stubbs. This led Mellon to create the Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art (the predecessor of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art) with Taylor as the director. Mellon eventually amassed the largest collection of Stubbs paintings in the world which would become a part of his larger collection of British art that would become the Yale Center for British Art in Connecticut, USA. In 1971, Taylor published the seminal catalogue, &quot;Stubbs&quot;.

The record price for a Stubbs painting was set by the sale at auction of &quot;Gimcrack on Newmarket Heath, with a Trainer, a Stable-Lad, and a Jockey&quot; (1765) at Christie&#x27;s in London in July 2011 for £22.4 million. It was sold by The Woolavington Collection of sporting art at Cottesbrooke Hall, Northamptonshire; the buyer was unidentified.
The Royal Collection of the British royal family holds 16 paintings by Stubbs.

Two paintings by Stubbs were bought by the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London after a public appeal to raise the £1.5 million required. The two paintings, &quot;The Kongouro from New Holland&quot; and &quot;Portrait of a Large Dog&quot; were both painted in 1772. Depicting a kangaroo and a dingo respectively, they are the first depictions of Australian animals in Western art.

His work was shown in a retrospective exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, 27 February – 7 April 1957. The Tate Britain, in conjunction with the Yale Center for British Art, organized the largest exhibition ever devoted to Stubbs (up to that time) in 1984, which travelled to New Haven in 1985.

==In popular culture==

A fictional painting by Stubbs plays a key role in the Robert Galbraith novel Lethal White.

Anthony Jennings&#x27; 2024 novel &quot;Mister Stubbs&quot; explores the painter&#x27;s early years, focusing on his time in York during Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s rebellion of 1745, and his mysterious trip to Rome, where Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s father, the exiled Jacobite King James III, had his court.

<doc id="229127" wikidata="Q2901761" url="?curid=229127" title="Netherlands Carillon">
<text>The Netherlands Carillon is a 127-foot (39-m) tall campanile housing a 53-bell carillon located in Arlington County, Virginia. The instrument and tower were given in the 1950s &quot;From the People of the Netherlands to the People of the United States of America&quot; to thank the United States for its contributions to the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945 and for its economic aid in the years after. The Netherlands Carillon is a historic property listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of Arlington Ridge Park, which is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. It is owned and operated by the National Park Service. 

The carillon is situated on a ridge overlooking the Potomac River and Washington, D.C., and it provides expansive views of the National Mall, West Potomac Park (its original, temporary location), and Arlington National Cemetery. Its adjacency to the Marine Corps War Memorial to the north and Arlington National Cemetery to the south draws 1.2 million visitors annually, including recreational visitors from Rosslyn&#x27;s residential areas. Throughout the day, the carillon automatically plays the Westminster Quarters. On significant days of the year in Dutch and American culture, it plays automated concerts, and from June to August, the director-carillonist Edward Nassor hosts a concert series whereby visiting carillonists perform weekly concerts on the instrument.

==History==

In late 1951, Govert L. Verheul, press officer of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs in The Hague, proposed that the Netherlands present a gift to the United States to commemorate their actions during and after World War II and as a symbol of the two countries&#x27; lasting friendship. He came up with the idea of gifting a carillon when washing dishes one night and accidentally clinking wine glasses together. Consequently, a large-scale fundraising campaign was launched, and it received an enthusiastic response. It was eventually endorsed by Queen Juliana. On April 4, 1952, she visited the United States to present a small silver bell to President Harry S. Truman as a token of the carillon that was to come. In ceremonies at Meridian Hill Park in Washington, D.C., the queen spoke of the importance of the small bells of the future instrument:
Two years later, 49 bells arrived and were installed in West Potomac Park, where they were formally accepted by the United States. The Netherlands did not initially have the money to provide a proper campanile for the carillon, so it was housed in a temporary structure. Gerrit Rietveld, a Dutch furniture designer and architect, was approached to design the campanile, but he was eventually removed from the project because of his perceived communist sympathies. Instead, Dutch architect Joost W. C. Boks designed the carillon&#x27;s permanent home. The tower was erected just north of Arlington National Cemetery and south of the Marine Corps War Memorial and was completed by early 1960. The carillon and new tower received a formal dedication ceremony on May 5, 1960, or the fifteenth anniversary of Dutch Liberation Day. The inaugural concert was performed by renowned carillonist Charles T. Chapman.

A tulip garden was planted in a circular bed immediately to the east of the plaza in 1964, also a gift from the Netherlands. A small successional woodland to the southwest forms the backdrop to the carillon as a result of the 1960s National Capital Parks Planting Plan. Additional landscaped beds in the form of musical notes were planted in 1967 and 1972 as part of Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s Beautification Program, with a variety of annuals and perennials, in addition to tulips. The program also planted the horseshoe of trees for the campanile&#x27;s backdrop.

After its dedication in 1960, the carillon was seldom played. It only performed for Easter Sunday services sponsored by the Arlington Ministerial Association. The few performances were by Frank Péchin Law. He assumed the position of director-carillonist after his instrumental involvement in establishing the &quot;Summer Series of Recitals on the Netherlands Carillon&quot; in July 1963, sponsored by the US Department of the Interior. Every Saturday from July through August, the carillon is played by a guest carillonist, invited by the director-carillonist. In the early 1970s, the Netherlands Carillon was repainted from a dark bronze to a gray blue color. In 1983, less than twenty-five years after the carillon&#x27;s construction and after years of pressure from Mr. Law, a major renovation was undertaken to address deterioration of the tower&#x27;s steel panels. The National Park Service announced a $300,000 () renovation plan for the instrument in 1981, but budget issues delayed the project. Again, the tower was repainted the light gray blue color, neither time with the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts. Upon Mr. Law&#x27;s death in 1985, the Netherlands Carillon fell silent until Edward M. Nassor took over the position of director-carillonist in 1987.

In the years before the fiftieth anniversary of Dutch Liberation Day in 1995, a group of prominent Dutch businessmen established a foundation to assist in the refurbishment of the carillon and tower, which had not seen major care since 1970. They were motivated by the significance of the meaning behind the Netherlands Carillon to lead this effort. By teaming up with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the United States, the Netherland-America Foundation, and the government of the Netherlands, approximately $1,400,000 () was raised for the project to move forward. The tower was closed for modernization changes, and the original dark bronze color of the tower was restored. The bells were transported to the Netherlands to be repaired by Royal Eijsbouts, except for the largest thirteen, which remained in the tower and were repaired in place. The original playing keyboard was replaced. Royal Eijsbouts also cast a fiftieth bell in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Dutch liberation. It was presented by the Dutch prime minister Wim Kok to the U.S. president Bill Clinton on February 28, 1995, and the renovated carillon was dedicated on May 5, 1995. After receiving the new bell, President Clinton commented on its significance:

The Netherlands Carillon found itself in bad shape again less than twenty years later. Due to severe rusting and fears of structural instability, the tower was closed to the public in the early 2010s. In 2016, the National Park Service and Royal Netherlands Embassy launched a campaign to fundraise money for a $5,800,000 () restoration of the carillon. The Park Service committed $4 million. In October 2019, the third renovation of the carillon was officially launched. The National Park Service was tasked with work on the tower, while the Royal Netherlands Embassy was tasked with work on the carillon. The carillon was transported to the Royal Eijsbouts foundry and arrived on December 3, 2019. In celebration of the Dutch &quot;75 Years of Freedom&quot; campaign, the carillon received three new bells with each dedicated to an American who had a significant impact on Dutch and American society: General George C. Marshall, Martin Luther King Jr., and Eleanor Roosevelt. The addition of these three bells converted the carillon to a concert pitch instrument and upgraded it to &quot;grand carillon&quot; status. The tower required extensive restorative work to the steel plates and inner structure of the tower. Additional supports were installed to account for the added weight of the three new bells.

The first carillon at the Arlington National Cemetery was installed by Amvets in 1949 and dedicated by President Truman.

==Design and symbolism==
===Carillon===
In the early 1950s, there were three major Dutch bell founders: Van Bergen, Royal Eijsbouts and Petit &amp; Fritsen. In order to avoid showing favoritism, all three founders were asked to cast the original forty-nine bells jointly and anonymously between 1952 and 1953. The total weight of the bells is , ranging from for the bourdon bell and for the smallest. The bells are constructed of a bronze alloy of approximately four-fifths copper and one-fifth tin. Each bell carries an emblem signifying a group within Dutch society. The verses cast on the bells were composed by the Dutch poet, Ben van Eysselsteijn.

A fiftieth bell, cast by Royal Eijsbouts, was added following Dutch- and American-sponsored renovations in 1995, and dedicated on May 5, the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands. It is two semitones higher in pitch than the lightest of the original 49 bells. The years &quot;1945&quot; and &quot;1995&quot; and the words &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;friendship&quot; are inscribed on this bell.

The 2019–21 renovation increased the size of the carillon to 53 bells, all cast by Royal Eijsbouts, and converted the instrument to concert pitch. These three additional bells are dedicated jointly to &quot;75 Years of Freedom&quot; and individually to people who had a major impact on the Netherlands and the United States during and after World War II: 1) General George C. Marshall for his role in the Marshall Plan, from which the Netherlands received over $1 billion for post-war reconstruction efforts; 2) the Martin Luther King Jr., for his role as the voice of the American civil rights movement; and 3) Eleanor Roosevelt, for her role as an advocate for social justice and human rights.

===Tower===
The carillon&#x27;s bells hang dead in a tower approximately high, long, and wide. The original plans had called for the structure to be tall, but was then reduced after receiving concerns about its height in relationship to the Lincoln Memorial from the Commission of Fine Arts. The tower is an open steel structure reinforced by steel plates and a bronze baked-enamel finish. It was designed by renowned Dutch architect Joost W. C. Boks (1904–1986) and constructed in 1960. At the base of the tower, a rectangular staircase leads to an observation deck off the ground. From there, a spiral staircase winds further upward to a second observatory off the ground. The playing cabin sits in the center of the upper observation deck. At the base of the tower, a large inscription reads &quot;From the People of the Netherlands to the People of the United States of America.&quot; The interconnecting lines and rectangles of the structure&#x27;s frame echo the work of Dutch abstract painter Piet Mondrian. The tower&#x27;s design also reflects the rejection of classical European architecture, which, in the years immediately following World War II, was associated with fascist regimes. The Netherlands Carillon is the first modernist steel memorial associated with the otherwise classical stone architecture found on the National Mall.

===Grounds===

The Netherlands Carillon stands on a quartzite plaza and is enclosed by a low lava stone wall. Two bronze lions, which represent the Dutch royal family, guard the entrance to the plaza. They were designed by Dutch sculptor Paul Philip Koning. The Netherlands Carillon is located just north of Arlington National Cemetery and south of the Marine Corps War Memorial. It is administered by the National Park Service as part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway complex in Arlington Ridge Park.

A tulip library was planted in a circular bed immediately to the east of the plaza in 1964. As they are culturally and economically significant to the Netherlands, ten thousand tulips are planted in these gardens each year. In 1967 and 1972, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s Beautification Program embellished the carillon grounds with new flower gardens in the shape of musical notes. These gardens are planted with tulips and other perennials and annuals. The program also planted the horseshoe of trees surrounding the backdrop of the campanile.

==Concerts==
The Netherlands Carillon keeps time throughout the day by playing the Westminster Quarters on the hours and quarters. The carillon plays several automated concerts each day and on significant days in Dutch and American culture:

<text>A solecism is a phrase that transgresses the rules of grammar. The term is often used in the context of linguistic prescription; it also occurs descriptively in the context of a lack of idiomaticness.

==Etymology==
The word originally was used by the Greeks for what they perceived as grammatical mistakes in their language. Ancient Athenians considered the dialect of the inhabitants of Soli, Cilicia to be a corrupted form of their pure Attic dialect and labelled the errors in the form as &quot;solecisms&quot; (Greek: σολοικισμοί, &quot;soloikismoí&quot;; sing.: σολοικισμός, &quot;soloikismós&quot;). Therefore, when referring to similar grammatical mistakes heard in the speech of Athenians, they described them as &quot;solecisms&quot; and that term has been adopted as a label for grammatical mistakes in any language; in Greek there is often a distinction in the relevant terms in that a mistake in semantics (i.e., a use of words with other-than-appropriate meaning or a neologism constructed through application of generative rules by an outsider) is called a &quot;barbarism&quot; ( &quot;barbarismos&quot;), whereas &quot;solecism&quot; refers to mistakes in syntax, in the construction of sentences.

<doc id="229134" wikidata="Q209684" url="?curid=229134" title="John Field (composer)">
<text>John Field (26 July 1782, Dublin – 23 January 1837, Moscow) was an Irish pianist, composer and teacher widely credited as the creator of the nocturne. While other composers were writing in a similar style at this time, Field was the first to use the term &#x27;Nocturne&#x27; specifically to apply to a character piece featuring a cantabile melody over an arpeggiated accompaniment. 

He was born into a musical family, in Dublin, and received his early education there, in particular with the Italian composer Tommaso Giordani. The family moved to London in 1793, where Field studied under Muzio Clementi, and under whose tutelage Field soon became a famous and sought-after concert pianist. Together, master and pupil visited Paris, Vienna, and St. Petersburg. Ambiguity surrounds Field&#x27;s decision to remain in the former Russian capital (Saint Petersburg), but it is likely that Field acted as a sales representative for the Clementi Pianos.

Field was very highly regarded by his contemporaries and his playing and compositions influenced many major composers, including Felix Mendelssohn, Frédéric Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt. Although little is known of Field in Russia, he undoubtedly contributed substantially to concerts and teaching, and to the development of the Russian piano school.

Notable students include Prussian pianist and composer Charles Mayer, the Russian composer Alexandre Dubuque, and Polish pianist and composer Antoine de Kontski.

==Biography==
===1782–1801: Early life===
Field was born 26 July 1782 in Golden Lane, Dublin, the eldest son of Irish parents who were members of the Church of Ireland. He was baptised on 30 September. His father, Robert Field, earned his living by playing the violin in Dublin theatres. Field first studied the piano under his grandfather (also named John Field), who was a professional organist, and later under Tommaso Giordani. He made his debut at the age of nine, a performance that was well-received, on 24 March 1792 in Dublin. According to an early biographer, W. H. Grattan Flood, Field started composing in Ireland, but no evidence exists to support his claim. Flood also asserted that Field&#x27;s family moved to Bath, Somerset, in 1793 and lived there for a short time, and this too is considered unlikely by modern researchers. By late 1793, though, the Fields had settled in London, where the young pianist started studying with Muzio Clementi. This arrangement was made possible by Field&#x27;s father, who was perhaps able to secure the apprenticeship through Giordani, who knew Clementi.

Field continued giving public performances and soon became famous in London, attracting favourable comments from the press and the local musicians. Around 1795 his performance of a Dussek piano concerto was praised by Haydn. Field continued his studies with Clementi, also helping the Italian with the making and selling of instruments. He also took up violin playing, which he studied under J. P. Solomon. His first published compositions were issued by Clementi in 1795; the first historically important work, Piano Concerto No. 1, H 27, was premiered by the composer in London on 7 February 1799, when he was aged 16. Field&#x27;s first official opus was a set of three piano sonatas published by (and dedicated to) Clementi in 1801.

===1802–1829: Settling in Russia===
In summer 1802 Field and Clementi left London and went to Paris on business. They soon travelled to Vienna, where Field took a brief course in counterpoint under Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and had meetings with both Haydn and Beethoven, the latter whom Field played for in October, and Beethoven highly praised him. In early winter he arrived in Saint Petersburg. Field was inclined to stay, impressed by the artistic life of the city. Clementi left in June 1803, but not before securing Field a teaching post in Narva and &quot;appointing&quot; the young man as his deputy, so that Field would receive similarly high fees. After Clementi&#x27;s departure, Field had a busy concert season, eventually performing at the newly founded Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Society. In 1805 Field embarked on a concert tour of the Baltic states, staying in Saint Petersburg during the summer. The following year he gave his first concert in Moscow. Clementi arranged the publication of some of Field&#x27;s old works in Russia in late 1806; he evidently sold Field a piano in exchange for music. Field returned to Moscow in April 1807 and apparently did not revisit Saint Petersburg until 1811 (but he kept his apartment at Vasilievsky Island). In 1810 he married Adelaide Percheron, a French pianist and former pupil.

Up to 1808, almost all publications of Field&#x27;s music were reissues of old works. In 1808–9 he finally began publishing newly composed music, starting with piano variations on Russian folksongs: &quot;Air russe varié&quot; for piano 4 hands, H 10, and &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; for piano, H 22. In 1811 the composer returned to Saint Petersburg. He spent the next decade of his life here, more productive than ever before, publishing numerous new pieces and producing corrected editions of old ones. He was successful in establishing a fruitful collaboration with both H. J. Dalmas, the most prominent Russian publisher of the time, and Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, one of the most important music publishing houses of Europe. In 1815 Field fathered an illegitimate son, Leon Charpentier (later ), but remained with his wife. They had a son, Adrien, in 1819; Leon would later become a famous tenor, active in Russia, while Adrien followed his father&#x27;s steps and became a pianist. By 1819 Field was sufficiently wealthy to be able to refuse the position of court pianist that was offered to him. His lifestyle and social behaviour were becoming more and more extravagant.

In 1818 Field revisited Moscow on business, prompted by his collaboration with the publisher Wenzel. He and his wife gave a series of concerts in the city in 1821, the last of which marked their last appearance in public together. Adelaide left Field soon afterwards (taking Adrien with her) and attempted a solo career, which was not particularly successful. Field stayed in Moscow and continued performing and publishing his music. In 1822 he met Johann Nepomuk Hummel; the two collaborated on a performance of Hummel&#x27;s Sonata for Piano 4-Hands, Op. 92.

===1830–1837: Last years and death===
Partly as a result of his extravagant lifestyle, Field&#x27;s health began deteriorating by the mid-1820s. From about 1823 his concert appearances started decreasing; by the late 1820s he was suffering from rectal cancer. Field left for London to seek medical attention. He arrived in September 1831 and, after an operation, gave concerts there and in Manchester. He stayed in England for some time, meeting distinguished figures such as Mendelssohn and Moscheles. In March 1832 his former teacher and friend Clementi died, and Field served as pallbearer at his funeral. On Christmas Day 1832 Field was in Paris, performing his 7th Piano Concerto, which received a mixed reaction, just as at his recent concerts in England. After a series of concerts in various European cities, Field spent nine months (1834–5) in a Naples hospital. His Russian patrons rescued him. He briefly stayed with Carl Czerny in Vienna, where he gave three recitals, and then returned to Moscow with his son Adrien. He gave his last concert in March 1836 and died in Moscow almost a year later, on 23 January 1837, from pneumonia. He was buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery. According to an eyewitness report, when asked on his deathbed what his religion was, Field replied with a characteristic pun: &quot;I am not a Calvinist, but a &quot;Claveciniste&quot; (French for harpsichordist).&quot;

==Music==

Field became well-known for his post-London style, probably developed in Moscow around 1807. The characteristic texture is that of a chromatically decorated melody over sonorous left-hand parts supported by sensitive pedalling. Field also had an affinity for ostinato patterns and pedal points, rather unusual for the prevailing styles of the day. Entirely representative of these traits are Field&#x27;s 18 nocturnes and associated pieces such as &quot;Andante inedit&quot;, H 64. These works were some of the most influential music of the early Romantic period: they do not adhere to a strict formal scheme (such as the sonata form), and they create a mood without text or programme. These pieces were admired by Frédéric Chopin, who subsequently made the piano nocturne famous, and Franz Liszt, who published an edition of the nocturnes based on rare Russian sources that incorporated late revisions by Field. Liszt&#x27;s preface to the said edition was an extensive eulogy for Field and his nocturnes.
Field also gave a few lessons to the young Mikhail Glinka, who was to become the first notable Russian composer.

Similarly influential were Field&#x27;s early piano concertos, which occupied a central place in the development of the genre in the 19th century. Already the earliest of these works show competent and imaginative orchestration, and bold, original piano writing. One interesting trait of his piano concertos is their limited choice of keys: they all use either E-flat major or C major at some point (or both, in the last concerto&#x27;s case). Composers such as Hummel, Kalkbrenner, Mendelssohn and Moscheles were influenced by these works, which are particularly notable for their central movements, frequently nocturne-like. Some of the less-known works were also historically important: particularly the piano fantasies, in which Field pioneered the Romantic large-scale episodic structure.

None of his piano sonatas, and only two of his seven piano concertos, have a formal slow movement. In performance, Field would interpolate an existing nocturne in a related key or improvise one.

==List of works==
This list is arranged according to Hopkinson numbers, introduced in the 1961 catalogue by Cecil Hopkinson. Many of these works were arranged for other instruments and/or revised by the composer himself; such arrangements and revised versions are not listed.

==Ephemera==
In the Dublin suburb of Walkinstown there is a road called Field Avenue, one of a number of so-called &#x27;musical roads&#x27; named after prominent Irish musicians.

He is mentioned in passing in &quot;War and Peace&quot; when Countess Rostova calls on the Rostov household musician to play her favourite nocturne.

Also, in Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Childhood&quot;, Field is said to have taught the narrator&#x27;s mother to play: &quot;Mamma was playing Field&#x27;s second concerto. Field had been her master.&quot; (Everyman Library, trans. C. J. Hogarth.)

<doc id="229136" wikidata="Q1321978" url="?curid=229136" title="Linguistic prescription">
<text>Linguistic prescription is the establishment of rules defining publicly preferred usage of language, including rules of spelling, pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, etc. Linguistic prescriptivism may aim to establish a standard language, teach what a particular society or sector of a society perceives as a correct or proper form, or advise on effective and stylistically apt communication. If usage preferences are conservative, prescription might appear resistant to language change; if radical, it may produce neologisms. Such prescriptions may be motivated by consistency (making a language simpler or more logical); rhetorical effectiveness; tradition; aesthetics or personal preferences; linguistic purism or nationalism (i.e. removing foreign influences); or to avoid causing offense (etiquette or political correctness).

Prescriptive approaches to language are often contrasted with the descriptive approach of academic linguistics, which observes and records how language is actually used (while avoiding passing judgment). The basis of linguistic research is text (corpus) analysis and field study, both of which are descriptive activities. Description may also include researchers&#x27; observations of their own language usage. In the Eastern European linguistic tradition, the discipline dealing with standard language cultivation and prescription is known as &quot;language culture&quot; or &quot;speech culture&quot;.

Despite being apparent opposites, prescriptive and descriptive approaches have a certain degree of conceptual overlap as comprehensive descriptive accounts must take into account and record existing speaker preferences, and a prior understanding of how language is actually used is necessary for prescription to be effective. Since the mid-20th century some dictionaries and style guides, which are prescriptive works by nature, have increasingly integrated descriptive material and approaches. Examples of guides updated to add more descriptive material include &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; (1961) and the third edition &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; (2009) in English, or the &quot;Nouveau Petit Robert&quot; (1993) in French. A partially descriptive approach can be especially useful when approaching topics of ongoing conflict between authorities, or in different dialects, disciplines, styles, or registers. Other guides, such as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, are designed to impose a single style and thus remain primarily prescriptive ().

Some authors define &quot;prescriptivism&quot; as the concept where a certain language variety is promoted as linguistically superior to others, thus recognizing the standard language ideology as a constitutive element of prescriptivism or even identifying prescriptivism with this system of views. Others, however, use this term in relation to any attempts to recommend or mandate a particular way of language usage (in a specific context or register), without, however, implying that these practices must involve propagating the standard language ideology. According to another understanding, the prescriptive attitude is an approach to norm-formulating and codification that involves imposing arbitrary rulings upon a speech community, as opposed to more liberal approaches that draw heavily from descriptive surveys; in a wider sense, however, the latter also constitute a form of prescriptivism.

Mate Kapović makes a distinction between &quot;prescription&quot; and &quot;prescriptivism&quot;, defining the former as &quot;a process of codification of a certain variety of language for some sort of official use&quot;, and the latter as &quot;an unscientific tendency to mystify linguistic prescription&quot;.

==Aims==
Linguistic prescription is a part of a language standardization process. The chief aim of linguistic prescription is to specify socially preferred language forms (either generally, as in Standard English, or in style and register) in a way that is easily taught and learned. Prescription may apply to most aspects of language, including spelling, pronunciation, vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and semantics.

Prescription is useful for facilitating inter-regional communication, allowing speakers of divergent dialects to understand a standardized idiom used in broadcasting, for example, more readily than each other&#x27;s dialects. While such a lingua franca may evolve by itself, the tendency to formally codify and normalize it is widespread in most parts of the world. Foreign language instruction is also considered a form of prescription, since it involves instructing learners how to speak, based on usage documentation laid down by others.

Linguistic prescription may also be used to advance a social or political ideology. Throughout history, prescription has been created around high-class language, and therefore it degeneralizes lower-class language. This has led to many justifications of classism, as the lower-class can easily be portrayed to be incoherent and improper if they do not speak the standard language. This also corresponds to the use of prescription for racism, as dialects spoken by what is seen as the superior race are usually standardized in countries with prominent racism. A good example of this is the demeaning of AAVE in the United States, as the idea that the &quot;lower race&quot; speaks improperly is propagated by people with an opposing ideology. Later, during the second half of the 20th century, efforts driven by various advocacy groups had considerable influence on language use under the broad banner of &quot;political correctness&quot;, to promote special rules for anti-sexist, anti-racist, or generically anti-discriminatory language (e.g. &quot;people-first language&quot; as advocated by disability rights organizations).

==Authority==

Prescription presupposes authorities whose judgments may come to be followed by many other speakers and writers. For English, these authorities tend to be books. H. W. Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; was widely taken as an authority for British English for much of the 20th century; Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; has done similarly for American English. The &quot;Duden&quot; grammar (first edition 1880) has a similar status for German.

Although lexicographers often see their work as purely descriptive, dictionaries are widely regarded as prescriptive authorities. Books such as Lynne Truss&#x27;s &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot; (2003), which argues for stricter adherence to prescriptive punctuation rules, also seek to exert an influence.

=== Formal regulation ===

Linguistic prescription is imposed by regulation in some places. The &quot;French Academy&quot; in Paris is the national body in France whose recommendations about the French language are often followed in the French-speaking world (francophonie), though not legally enforceable. In Germany and the Netherlands, recent spelling and punctuation reforms, such as the German orthographic reform of 1996, were devised by teams of linguists commissioned by the respective governments and then implemented by statutes, some met with widespread dissent.

Examples of national prescriptive bodies and initiatives are:
* Afrikaans: The &quot;Taalkommissie&quot; (Language Commission) is responsible for the compilation of the &quot;Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls&quot; (Afrikaans Word-list and Spelling Rules), an orthography of formal, standardized Afrikaans. 
* Albanian: The Social Sciences and Albanological Section of the Academy of Sciences of Albania for the Tosk variety of the Albanian standard language.
* Canadian French: The in the Canadian province of Québec, where French is perceived to be particularly threatened by the incursion of English.
* Dutch: In the Netherlands and the Flanders region of Belgium, standardized spelling norms are compulsory for government publications and in education (see Wordlist of the Dutch language). The Flemish press and other media also adhere to these rules. In the Netherlands, however, some media apply a slightly adapted spelling, as outlined in the White Booklet.
* French: The recommendations of the , a national body, are legally unenforceable, but they are often followed by standard French speakers.
* German: The German orthography reform of 1996 established statutory national normative spelling usages for each of the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Belgium). It has, however, been comprehensively disregarded by many people; in relevance, it became so controversial in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein that in a plebiscite held there in 1998 56.4% of voters opposed its implementation. Notwithstanding, the Schleswig-Holstein parliament reversed the referendum outcome in 1999. Many major German newspapers chose to implement the reforms only partially (e.g. Axel Springer AG, Der Spiegel) or to reject it entirely, ending a period when combined German spelling, although officially only necessary in government and educational use, was the widespread &quot;de facto&quot; standard.
* Italian: The &quot;Academy of the Bran (Accademia della Crusca)&quot;, the Italian language academic body.
* Polish: The Polish Language Council for standard Polish, which aims to popularize Polish language knowledge, provide guidance on standard usage, as well as formulate the rules of orthography. The Polish prescriptive policy recognizes two subvarieties of standard Polish: the &quot;model/official norm&quot; () and the &quot;colloquial/vernacular norm&quot; (), with the former being a highly traditionalistic idiom for written language and public usage, and the latter being a more liberal idiom for private contexts that is more permissive for loanwords and deviations from &quot;traditional&quot; usage. The latter is also considered to include certain &quot;educated&quot; regional forms, known as &quot;regionalizmy&quot;. The term &quot;standard Polish&quot; is not much used in Poland; instead, the name &quot;polszczyzna ogólna&quot; (&quot;General [Common] Polish&quot;) is preferred, with the codified standard dialect being prescribed as &quot;correct Polish&quot;.
* Portuguese: The Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990 sets a standard orthography for the language, it has been made into law in both Brazil (2009) and Portugal (2008).
* Romanian: The Romanian Academy for standard Romanian, whose interpretations and instructions are approved by the Romanian state and other substances where Romanian is authoritatively recognized (e.g. the European Union and Vojvodina). In the Moldovan Republic, the only country besides Romania where Romanian is the state language, it is officially called &quot;Moldovan&quot; and is monitored by the Institute of Linguistics of Academy of Sciences of Moldova.
* Russian: In 1783, the Russian Academy was founded; in 1841, it merged to the Russian Academy of Sciences and became its Department of the Russian Language and Literature, which existed until 1927. The Union of Soviet Writers policed the Russian language with linguistic prescription to establish a standardized Russian language during the era of the Soviet Union. In 1952, a department of speech culture was formed at the Institute of Linguistics of the USSR Academy of Sciences; since 1958, Russian language norms have been regulated by the V.V. Vinogradov Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
* Spanish: The &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; in affiliation with the Association of Spanish Language Academies for standard Spanish in 21 countries.
*Turkish: The Turkish Language Association, founded in 1932 by Atatürk, regulates the Turkish language.

=== Style manuals ===

Other kinds of authorities exist in specific settings, most commonly in the form of style guidebooks (also called style guides, manuals of style, style books, or style sheets). Style guides vary in form, and may be alphabetical usage dictionaries, comprehensive manuals divided into numerous subsection by the facet of language, or very compact works insistent upon only a few matters of particular importance to the publisher. Some aim to be comprehensive only for a specific field, deferring to more general-audience guides on matters that are not particular to the discipline in question. There are different types of style guides, by purpose and audience. Because the genres of writing and the audiences of each manual are different, style manuals often conflict with each other, even within the same vernacular of English.

Many publishers have established an internal house style specifying preferred spellings and grammatical forms, such as serial commas, how to write acronyms, and various awkward expressions to avoid. Most of these are internal documentation for the publisher&#x27;s staff, though various newspapers, universities, and other organizations have made theirs available for public inspection, and sometimes even sell them as books, e.g. &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; and &quot;The Economist Style Guide&quot;.

In a few cases, an entire publishing sector complies with a publication that originated as a house style manual, such as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and &quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot; in non-fiction book publishing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, and &quot;The Associated Press Stylebook&quot; in American news style. Others are by self-appointed advocates whose rules are propagated in the popular press, as in &quot;proper Cantonese pronunciation&quot;. The aforementioned Fowler, and Strunk &amp; White, were among the self-appointed, as are some modern authors of style works, like Bryan A. Garner and his &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; (formerly &quot;Modern American Usage&quot;).

Various style guides are used for academic papers and professional journals and have become &quot;de facto&quot; standards in particular fields, though the bulk of their material pertains to formatting of source citations (in mutually conflicting ways). Some examples are those issued by the American Medical Association, the Modern Language Association, and the Modern Humanities Research Association; there are many others. &quot;Scientific Style and Format&quot;, by the Council of Science Editors, seeks to normalize style in scientific journal publishing, based where possible on standards issued by bodies like the International Standards Organization.

None of these works have any sort of legal or regulatory authority (though some governments produce their own house style books for internal use). They still have authority in the sense that a student may be marked down for failure to follow a specified style manual; a professional publisher may enforce compliance; a publication may require its employees to use house style as a matter of on-the-job competence. A well-respected style guide, and usually one intended for a general audience, may also have the kind of authority that a dictionary does consult as a reference work to satisfy personal curiosity or settle an argument.

==Origins==
Historically, linguistic prescriptivism originates in a standard language when a society establishes social stratification and a socio-economic hierarchy. The spoken and written language usages of the authorities (state, military, church) is preserved as the standard language. Departures from this standard language may jeopardize social success (see social class). Sometimes, archaisms and honorific stylizations may be deliberately introduced or preserved to distinguish the prestige form of the language from contemporary colloquial language. Likewise, the style of language used in ritual also differs from everyday speech. Special ceremonial languages known only to a select few spiritual leaders are found throughout the world; Liturgical Latin has served a similar function for centuries.
When a culture develops a writing system, orthographic rules for the consistent transcription of culturally important transactions (laws, scriptures, contracts, poetry, etc.) allow a large number of discussants to understand written conversations easily, and across multiple generations.

Early historical trends in literacy and alphabetization were closely tied to the influence of various religious institutions. Western Christianity propagated the Latin alphabet. Eastern Orthodoxy spread the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets. Judaism used the Hebrew alphabet, and Islam the Arabic script. Hinduism used the Devanagari script. In certain traditions, strict adherence to prescribed spellings and pronunciations was and remains of great spiritual importance. Islamic naming conventions and greetings are notable examples of the linguistic prescription being a prerequisite to spiritual righteousness. Another commonly cited example of prescriptive language usage closely associated with social propriety is the system of Japanese honorific speech.

Most, if not all, widely spoken languages demonstrate some degree of social codification in how they conform to prescriptive rules. Linguistic prestige is a central research topic within sociolinguistics. Notions of linguistic prestige apply to different dialects of the same language and also to separate, distinct languages in multilingual regions. Prestige level disparity often leads to &quot;diglossia&quot;: speakers in certain social contexts consciously choose a prestige language or dialect over a less prestigious one, even if it is their native tongue.
Government bureaucracy tends toward prescriptivism as a means of enforcing functional continuity. Such prescriptivism dates from ancient Egypt, where bureaucrats preserved the spelling of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt into the Ptolemaic period through the standard usage of Egyptian hieroglyphics.

==Sources==
From the earliest attempts at prescription in classical times grammarians have based their norms on observed prestige use of language. Modern prescriptivist textbooks draw heavily on descriptive linguistic analysis.

The prescription may privilege some existing forms over others for the sake of maximizing clarity and precision in language use. Others are subjective judgments of what constitutes good taste. Some reflect the promotion of one class or region within a language community over another, which can become politically controversial.

Prescription can also reflect ethical considerations, as in prohibiting swear words. Words referring to elements of sexuality or toilet hygiene may be regarded as obscene. Blasphemies against religion may be forbidden. In the 21st century, political correctness objects to the use of words perceived as offensive.

Some elements of prescription in English are sometimes thought to have been based on the norms of Latin grammar. Robert Lowth is frequently cited as having done so, but he specifically objected to &quot;forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language&quot;.

==Criticisms==
Prescriptivism is often subject to criticism. Many linguists, such as Geoffrey Pullum and other posters to Language Log, are highly skeptical of the quality of advice given in many usage guides, including highly regarded books like Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;. In particular, linguists point out that popular books on English usage written by journalists or novelists (e.g. Simon Heffer&#x27;s &quot;Strictly English: The Correct Way to Write ... and Why It Matters&quot;) often make basic errors in linguistic analysis.

A frequent criticism is that prescription has a tendency to favor the language of one particular area or social class over others, and thus militates against linguistic diversity. Frequently, a standard dialect is associated with the upper class, for example the United Kingdom&#x27;s Received Pronunciation (RP). RP has now lost much of its status as the Anglophone standard, and other standards are now alternative systems for English as a foreign language. Although these have a more democratic base, they still exclude the vast majority of the English-speaking world: speakers of Scottish English, Hiberno-English, Appalachian English, Australian English, Indian English, Nigerian English or African-American English may feel the standard is arbitrarily selected or slanted against them. Therefore, prescription has political consequences; indeed, it can be—and has been—used consciously as a political tool.

A second issue with prescriptivism is that it tends to explicitly devalue non-standard dialects. It has been argued that prescription, apart from formulating standard language norms, often attempts to influence speakers to apply the proposed linguistic devices invariably, without considering the existence of different varieties and registers of language. While some linguists approve the practical role of language standardization in modern nation states, certain models of prescriptive codification have been criticized for going far beyond mere norm-setting, i.e. by promoting the sanctioned language variety as the only legitimate means of communication and presenting it as the only valid baseline of correctness, while stigmatizing non-standard usages as &quot;mistakes&quot;. Such practices have been said to contribute to perpetuating the belief that non-codified forms of language are innately inferior, creating social stigma and discrimination toward their speakers. In contrast, modern linguists would generally hold that all forms of language, including both vernacular dialects and different realizations of a standardized variety, are scientifically equal as instruments of communication, even if deemed socially inappropriate for certain situational contexts. Resulting in standard language ideology, normative practices might also give rise to the conviction that explicit formal instruction is an essential prerequisite for acquiring proper command of one&#x27;s native language, thus creating a massive feeling of linguistic insecurity. Propagating such language attitudes is characteristic of the prescriptivists in Eastern Europe, where normativist ideas of correctness can be found even among professional linguists.

Another serious issue with prescription is that prescriptive rules quickly become entrenched and it is difficult to change them when the language changes. Thus, there is a tendency for prescription to lag behind the vernacular language. In 1834, an anonymous writer advised against the split infinitive, reasoning that the construction was not a frequent feature of English as he knew it. Today the construction is in everyday use and generally considered standard usage, yet the old prohibition can still be heard.

A further problem is a challenge of specifying understandable criteria. Although prescribing authorizations may have clear ideas about why they make a particular choice, and their choices are seldom entirely arbitrary, there exists no linguistically sustainable metric for ascertaining which forms of language should be considered standard or otherwise preferable. Judgments that seek to resolve ambiguity or increase the ability of the language to make subtle distinctions are easier to defend. Judgments based on the subjective associations of a word are more problematic.

Finally, there is the problem of inappropriate dogmatism. Although competent authorities tend to make careful statements, popular pronouncements on language are apt to condemn. Thus, wise prescriptive advice identifying a form as colloquial or non-standard and suggesting that it be used with caution in some contexts may – when taken up in the classroom – become converted into a ruling that the dispreferred form is automatically unacceptable in all circumstances, a view academic linguists reject. (Linguists may accept that a construction is ungrammatical or incorrect in relation to a certain lect if it does not conform to its inherent rules, but they would not consider it absolutely wrong simply because it diverges from the norms of a prestige variety.) A classic example from 18th-century England is Robert Lowth&#x27;s tentative suggestion that preposition stranding in relative clauses sounds colloquial. This blossomed into a grammatical rule that a sentence should never end with a preposition. 
For these reasons, some writers argue that linguistic prescription is foolish or futile. Samuel Johnson commented on the tendency of some prescription to resist language change:

<text>William Thomas Beckford (29 September 1760 – 2 May 1844) was an English novelist, art critic, planter and politician. He was reputed at one stage to be England&#x27;s richest commoner.

He was the son of William Beckford and Maria Hamilton, daughter of the Hon. George Hamilton, and he served as a member of parliament for Wells in 1784–1790 and Hindon in 1790–1795 and 1806–1820. Beckford is best known for writing the 1786 Gothic novel &quot;Vathek&quot;, for building Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire and Beckford&#x27;s Tower in Bath, and for his extensive art collection.

==Biography==
Beckford was born in the family&#x27;s London home at 22 Soho Square on 29 September 1760. At the age of ten, he inherited a fortune from his father William Beckford, who had been twice a Lord Mayor of London. It consisted of £1 million in cash, an estate at Fonthill in Wiltshire (including the Palladian mansion Fonthill Splendens), several sugar plantations in Jamaica, and about 3,000 black enslaved people.

This fortune allowed him to indulge his interest in art and architecture, as well as writing. He was briefly trained in music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but his drawing master, Alexander Cozens, was a greater influence, and Beckford continued to correspond with him for some years until they fell out.

On 5 May 1783 Beckford married Lady Margaret Gordon, a daughter of the fourth Earl of Aboyne. However, he was bisexual and after 1784 chose self-exile from British society when his letters to William Courtenay, later 9th Earl of Devon, were intercepted by the boy&#x27;s uncle, who advertised the affair in the newspapers. Courtenay was just ten years old on first meeting Beckford, who was eight years older. About six years later, Beckford was discovered (according to a house guest at the time) to be &quot;whipping Courtenay in some posture or another&quot; after finding a letter penned by Courtenay to another lover. Although Beckford was never charged with child molestation, fornication or attempted buggery, he subsequently chose to exile himself on the continent with his long-suffering wife, who died in childbirth aged 24.

For many years Beckford was believed to have conducted a simultaneous affair with his cousin Peter&#x27;s wife Louisa Pitt (c. 1755–1791).

Having studied under Sir William Chambers and Cozens, Beckford journeyed in Italy in 1782 and wrote a book about his travels: &quot;Dreams, Waking Thoughts and Incidents&quot; (1783). Soon came his best-known work, the Gothic novel &quot;Vathek&quot; (1786), written originally in French; he boasted that it took a single sitting of three days and two nights, though there is reason to believe that this was a flight of imagination.

His other main writings were &quot;Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters&quot; (1780), a satirical work, and &quot;Letters from Italy with Sketches of Spain and Portugal&quot; (1834), with brilliant descriptions of scenes and manners. In 1793 he visited Portugal, where he settled for a while, and conducted an affair with a young male musician called Gregorio Franchi.

Following an appeal in 1817 by legal philosopher Jeremy Bentham that Beckford collaborate with him in advocating for the abolition of the death penalty for sodomy, Beckford may also have been the author, or one of the authors, of &quot;Don Leon&quot;, a poetic tract of homosexual advocacy.

Beckford&#x27;s fame, however, rests as much on his eccentricities as a builder and collector as on his literary efforts. In undertaking his buildings he managed to dissipate his fortune, which was estimated by his contemporaries to give him an income of £100,000 a year. The loss of one of his Jamaican sugar plantations to James Beckford Wildman was particularly costly. Only £80,000 of his capital remained at his death.

==Art collection==

Beckford was a compulsive and restless collector, who also frequently sold works, sometimes later repurchasing them. His collection was notable for its many Italian Quattrocento paintings, then little collected and relatively inexpensive. Despite his interest in Romantic medievalism, he owned few medieval works, though many from the Renaissance. He was also interested in showy Asian objects such as Mughal hardstone carvings. Although he avoided the classical marbles typically sought by well-educated English collectors, much of his collection was of 18th-century French furniture and decorative arts, then priced enormously high compared with paintings, by modern standards. He bought a single Turner in 1800, when the artist was only 25 (&quot;The Fifth Plague of Egypt&quot;, £157.10s), in 1828 William Blake&#x27;s drawings for Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot;, and several works by Richard Parkes Bonington, but in general he preferred older works.

By 1822 Beckford was short of funds and in debt. He put Fonthill Abbey up for sale, for which 72,000 copies of Christie&#x27;s illustrated catalogue were sold at a guinea apiece; the pre-sale view filled every farmhouse in the neighbourhood with visitors from London. Fonthill, with part of his collection, was sold before the sale for £330,000 to John Farquhar, who had made a fortune selling gunpowder in India.

Farquhar at once auctioned the art and furnishings in the &quot;Fonthill sale&quot; of 1823, at which Beckford and his son-in-law, the Duke of Hamilton, bought much, often more cheaply than the first price Beckford had paid, as the market was somewhat depressed. What remained of the collection, as maintained and added to at Lansdown Tower, amounting virtually to a second collection, was inherited by the Dukes of Hamilton. Much of that was dispersed in the &quot;Hamilton Palace sale&quot; of 1882, one of the major sales of the century.

The Fonthill sale precipitated William Hazlitt&#x27;s scathing review of Beckford&#x27;s taste for &quot;idle rarities and curiosities or mechanical skill,&quot; fine bindings, &quot;bijouterie&quot; and highly finished paintings, &quot;the quintessence and rectified spirit of &quot;still-life&quot;&quot;, republished in Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;Sketches of the Picture Galleries of England (1824)&quot;, and richly demonstrating his own prejudices. Beckford pieces are now in museums all over the world. Hazlitt was unaware that the sale had been salted with lots inserted by Phillips the auctioneer that had never passed Beckford&#x27;s muster: &quot;I would not disgrace my house by Chinese furniture,&quot; he remarked later in life. &quot;Horace Walpole would not have suffered it in his toyshop at Strawberry Hill&quot;.

==Fonthill Abbey==
 The opportunity to purchase the complete library of Edward Gibbon gave Beckford the basis for his own library, and James Wyatt built Fonthill Abbey in which to house this and the owner&#x27;s art collection. Lord Nelson visited Fonthill Abbey with the Hamiltons in 1800. The house was completed in 1807. Beckford entered parliament as member for Wells and later for Hindon, quitting by taking the Chiltern Hundreds; but he lived mostly in seclusion, spending much of his father&#x27;s wealth without adding to it.

In 1822 he sold Fonthill, and a large part of his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000 and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, joining them with a one-storey arch thrown across a driveway. In 1836 he also bought Nos. 18 and 19 Lansdown Crescent (leaving No 18 empty to ensure peace and quiet).

Most of Fonthill Abbey collapsed under the weight of its poorly built tower on the night of 21 December 1825. The wreckage was slowly removed, leaving only a fragment that survives as a private home. This is the first part, which included the shrine to St Anthony, Beckford&#x27;s patron when he was living in Lisbon.
==Lansdown Crescent and Lansdown Tower (Beckford&#x27;s Tower)==

Beckford spent his later years in his home at Lansdown Crescent, Bath, during which time he commissioned architect Henry Goodridge to design a spectacular folly at the northern end of his land on Lansdown Hill: Lansdown Tower, now known as Beckford&#x27;s Tower, in which he kept many of his treasures. The tower is now owned by the Bath Preservation Trust and managed by the Beckford Tower Trust as a museum to William Beckford; part of the property is rented to the Landmark Trust which makes it available for public hire as a spectacular holiday home.

The museum contains numerous engravings and chromolithographs of the Tower&#x27;s original interior as well as furniture commissioned specifically for the Tower by Beckford and gradually reassembled through the efforts of the Bath Preservation Trust and others. There is also a great deal of information at the Tower about Beckford, including objects related to his life in Bath, at Fonthill and elsewhere.
After his death at Lansdown Crescent on 2 May 1844, aged 84, his body was laid in a sarcophagus and placed on an artificial mound, as was the custom of Saxon kings from whom he claimed to be descended. Beckford had wished to be buried in the grounds of Lansdown Tower, but his body was interred at Bath Abbey Cemetery in Lyncombe Vale on 11 May 1844 (accessible from Ralph Allen Drive). The Tower was sold to a local publican who turned it into a beer garden. Eventually it was bought back by Beckford&#x27;s younger daughter, Susan Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton, who gave the land round it to Walcot parish for consecration as a cemetery in 1848. This allowed Beckford&#x27;s remains to be reinterred near the Tower he loved.

Beckford&#x27;s self-designed tomb, a massive sarcophagus of polished pink granite with bronze armorial plaques, now stands on a hillock in the cemetery surrounded by an oval ditch. On one side is a quotation from &quot;Vathek&quot;: &quot;Enjoying humbly the most precious gift of heaven to man – Hope&quot;, and on another lines from his poem, &quot;A Prayer&quot;: &quot;Eternal Power! Grant me, through obvious clouds one transient gleam of thy bright essence in my dying hour.&quot;

Henry Goodridge designed a Byzantine entrance gateway to the cemetery, flanked by bronze railings which had surrounded Beckford&#x27;s original tomb in Bath Abbey Cemetery.

Walcot Cemetery is closed for burials but still open to the public, as is the Tower on regular days in the year. (See the Bath Preservation Trust website.)

==Other works==
As a writer, Beckford is remembered for &quot;Vathek&quot;, of which the reception from every quarter may have satisfied his ambitions for a career in &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, and for his travel memoir, &quot;Italy: with some Sketches of Spain and Portugal&quot;. He followed &quot;Vathek&quot; with two parodies of current cultural fashions, the formulaic sentimental novel, in &quot;Modern Novel Writing, or, The Elegant Enthusiast&quot; (1796) and &quot;Azemia&quot;, a satire on the Minerva Press novels, written as &quot;Jacquetta Agneta Mariana Jenks, of Belgrove Priory in Wales&quot;; and also published &quot;Biographical Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters&quot; (1780), a literary prank burlesquing serious biographical encyclopaedias. Towards the end of his life he published collected travel letters, under the title &quot;Recollections of an Excursion to the Monasteries of Alcobaca and Batalha&quot; (1835), the memoir of a trip made in 1794.

==Legacy==
Beckford left two daughters, the younger of whom (Susanna Euphemia, sometimes called Susan) was married to Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton, and inherited the majority of his collection, which was then moved north to Hamilton Palace, now demolished. The elder, Margaret Maria Elizabeth Beckford, married Lt-Gen. James Orde.

Beckford was portrayed by Daniel Massey in the 1982 Central Television production &quot;I Remember Nelson&quot;, and has been the subject of several biographies in recent decades.

Beckford wrote a considerable amount of music, much of it with the assistance of his amanuensis, John Burton, with whom he collaborated on his largest composition: &quot;Arcadian Pastoral&quot;. The music manuscripts, which had lain among Beckford&#x27;s effects at Hamilton Palace, were bought and presented to Basil Blackwell as a leaving present. He in turn bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library. In 1998, Michael Maxwell Steer edited and published all Beckford&#x27;s music, including the collection of &quot;Modinhas Brasileiras&quot; which had been copied for him during his stay at Sintra in 1787. These are particularly interesting as they are the second surviving example of this Portuguese song form. The edition is available in six volumes from The Beckford Edition. It can be consulted in the Bodleian, and elsewhere.

==Cultural references==
According to E. H. Coleridge, Beckford is the person referred to in Lord Byron&#x27;s short poem &quot;To Dives – A Fragment&quot;. Byron describes a person of great wealth, &quot;of Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first&quot;, who feels &quot;Wrath&#x27;s vial on thy lofty head burst&quot; when he is &quot;seduced to deeds accurst&quot; and &quot;smitten with th&#x27; unhallowed thirst of Crime unnamed&quot;. Byron also refers to him in &quot;Childe Harold&quot;, Canto I, stanza 22.

In 1974, Aubrey Menen published &quot;Fonthill: A Comedy&quot;, a satirical portrait of Beckford.

<doc id="229142" wikidata="Q1403946" url="?curid=229142" title="Marine Corps War Memorial">
<text>The United States Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) is a national memorial located in Arlington Ridge Park in Arlington County, Virginia. The memorial was dedicated in 1954 to all Marines who have given their lives in defense of the United States since 1775. It is located in Arlington Ridge Park within the George Washington Memorial Parkway, near the Ord-Weitzel Gate to Arlington National Cemetery and the Netherlands Carillon. The memorial was turned over to the National Park Service in 1955.

The war memorial was inspired by the iconic 1945 photograph of six Marines raising a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II taken by Associated Press combat photographer Joe Rosenthal. Upon first seeing the photograph, sculptor Felix de Weldon created a maquette for a sculpture based on the photo in a single weekend at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, where he was serving in the Navy. He and architect Horace Peaslee designed the memorial. Their proposal was presented to Congress, but funding was not possible during the war. In 1947, a federal foundation was established to raise funds for the memorial.

==History==

The centerpiece of the memorial is a colossal sculpture group depicting the six Marines who raised the second and largest of two U.S. flags that were both raised atop Mount Suribachi located at the south end of Iwo Jima, on February 23, 1945. The first flag flown over the mountain was regarded to be too small to be seen by all the American troops on the other side of it where most of the fighting would take place, so it was replaced by a larger flag.
The flag-raising also was recorded by Marine Sergeant Bill Genaust, a combat motion picture cameraman. He filmed the event in color while standing beside Rosenthal. Genaust&#x27;s footage established that the second flag raising was not staged. On March 4, 1945, he was killed by the Japanese after entering a cave on Iwo Jima and his remains have never been found. The subjects of Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph (identification changes were made in 1947, 2016, and 2019), from right to left, are as follows:
* Position 1: Corporal Harlon H. Block
* Position 2: Corporal Harold P. Keller
* Position 3: Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley
* Position 4: Sergeant Michael Strank
* Position 5: Private First Class Harold H. Schultz
* Position 6: Private First Class Ira H. Hayes

The Memorial was approved by the United States Congress and commission for the memorial was awarded in 1951, after it was approved and accepted by the Marine Corps League who also selected De Weldon as the sculptor. De Weldon spent three years creating a full-sized master model in plaster, with figures tall. This was disassembled like a giant puzzle, and each piece was separately cast in bronze. Peaslee&#x27;s base for the memorial is made of black diabase granite from a quarry in Lönsboda, a small town in the southernmost province of Sweden. It features a number of inscriptions. The Groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 19, 1954, exactly nine years after the Marines landed on Iwo Jima. General Lemuel Shepherd, 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps, did the groundbreaking. Construction of the memorial began in September. The bronze pieces of the sculpture were assembled to Brooklyn, New York for casting in bronze. This took about 3 months to complete. After that, they were reassembled into a dozen pieces and were shipped back to Arlington, Virginia in a 3 truck convoy, to which was added a flagpole. The total cost of the memorial was $850,000, including the development of the site. It was paid for with donations mostly from active duty Marines and Marine Reservists. Other donors included former Marines and friends of the Marine Corps and members of the Naval Service; no public funds were used.

The memorial was dedicated on Wednesday, November 10, 1954, the 179th anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps. The presiding officials included President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Orme Lewis, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd. Besides the words and prayers said by three military chaplains, remarks during the dedication were given by Robert Anderson, Chairman of the Day, Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation, Orme Lewis, and General Lemuel Shepherd who presented the monument to the people of the United States. Following that, a U.S. flag was raised up the Memorial&#x27;s flagpole. Felix de Weldon also spoke, and Richard Nixon gave the dedicatory address. The dedication ceremony ended with the playing of taps. The Memorial was under the stewardship of the Marine Corps Memorial Foundation until the monument was dedicated.

President John F. Kennedy issued a proclamation on June 12, 1961, that a Flag of the United States should fly over the memorial 24 hours a day, which is one of the few official sites where this is required. Despite being mounted on the staff of the sculpture, which depicts an event that occurred when the U.S. flag had 48 stars, the flag used is a modern one (specifically, one featuring the number and arrangement of stars prescribed as of when the flag is being flown) in keeping with both the text of the proclamation and the memorial&#x27;s dedication to all Marines who died in defense of the United States regardless of when their deaths occurred.

The memorial is located on a high ridge, overlooking the national capital. The Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. uses the memorial as the centerpiece of its weekly Sunset Parade, featuring the Drum and Bugle Corps and the Silent Drill Platoon.

== Memorial marker and inscriptions ==
The memorial consists of front and rear inscriptions, and inscribed in gold letters around the polished black granite upper base of the memorial is the date and location of every United States Marine Corps major action up to the present time.

Front (west side): &quot;Uncommon Valor Was a Common Virtue&quot; – &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;

Rear (east side): &quot;In Honor and Memory of the Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives to Their Country Since 10 November 1775&quot;

The &quot;uncommon valor&quot; remark was made by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, USN on 17 March 1945. A fuller version of his comment is &quot;The battle of Iwo Island has been won. The United States Marines, by their individual and collective courage, have conquered a base which is as necessary to us in our continuing forward movement toward final victory as it was vital to the enemy in staving off ultimate defeat... Among the Americans who served on Iwo Island, uncommon valor was a common virtue.&quot;

Felix de Weldon&#x27;s and Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s names are also inscribed on the bottom left and bottom right base of the front side of the memorial. Rosenthal&#x27;s name was added in 1982.

== Memorial rumor and criticism ==
A persistent rumor has attributed the existence of a thirteenth hand from the six statues of the men depicted on the memorial, and speculation about the possible reasons for it. When informed of the rumor, de Weldon exclaimed, &quot;Thirteen hands. Who needed thirteen hands? Twelve were enough.&quot;

In discussing the site for the United States Air Force Memorial, originally to be near de Weldon&#x27;s work, J. Carter Brown, chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts in 1998, described the Marine Corps Memorial as kitsch. &quot;It was taken from a photograph, it is by a sculptor, even though he was a member of this commission at one point, who is not going to go down as a Michelangelo in history—and yet it is very effective, largely because of its site,&quot; he said. Brown&#x27;s remark was met with calls for his resignation from the commission, and disagreement over his categorization from the commission&#x27;s staff.

== Refurbishment ==
On April 29, 2015, philanthropist David Rubenstein pledged over five million dollars to refurbish the memorial in honor of his father, a Marine veteran from World War II who died in 2013, &quot;and all Marines who have died in service to the United States.&quot; The $5.37 million donation, made through the National Park Foundation, supported cleaning and waxing the statue, polishing the black granite panels, regilding inscriptions, relandscaping, and making repairs to the pavement, lighting and flagpole. While the Park Service performs regular routine maintenance, this was the first comprehensive refurbishment of the memorial since its dedication in 1954. The work was done in three phases with completion in 2018.

===Prototype===

When there were no government funds for sculpture during the war, de Weldon self-financed a cast stone version of similar design in a one-third size that was placed on a parcel of land in Washington, D.C. until 1947, when it was put into storage. It later was restored and displayed at a museum on an aircraft carrier and again, returned to storage. This small concrete statue of the second U.S. flag raising at Iwo Jima in 1945 was scheduled to be auctioned in February 2013 at a New York auction dedicated to World War II artifacts, but it failed to receive the minimum bid required for the auction of it to begin.

===Replicas and related memorials===
* The original plaster working model used to cast the Marine Corps War Memorial currently stands in Harlingen, Texas, at the Marine Military Academy, a private Marine Corps-inspired youth military academy. The academy is the final resting place of Corporal Harlon Block, one of the flag raisers who was killed in action on Iwo Jima.
* A small model stands in the lobby of Spruance Hall, U.S. Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island. It was presented by the sculptor, a resident of Newport.
* There are scaled-down replicas at three Marine bases:
** At Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia just outside the front gate.
** At Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kāne&#x27;ohe Bay.
** At Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina on the Peatross Parade Deck, where the replica is steel that is one-third scale and also sculpted by Weldon. For the final act of The Crucible, the Marines&#x27; 54-hour final training test, Marine recruits at Parris Island hike 9 miles to the statue as the sun rises and the flag is raised. They then are addressed on the flag raising and its meaning and are then awarded their Eagle, Globe and Anchor emblems by their drill instructors signifying them as full-fledged Marines.
* A similar (though not identical) statue was erected located at Cape Coral, Florida, in 1964
* On 18 May 1973, a bronze relief of the memorial was placed along Cedar Point Road near St. Nicholas&#x27;s Chapel at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland.
* A version of the memorial dedicated in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of World War II stands in the Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania.
* A similar design is used for the National Iwo Jima Memorial in Newington, Connecticut, which was dedicated in 1995 to the 6,821 U.S. servicemen who died in the battle.
* A copy was dedicated at Fall River&#x27;s Bicentennial Park, along the banks of the Taunton River, in Massachusetts in 2005.
* The tilted spire above the National Museum of the Marine Corps is a visual allusion to the original sculpture. 
* A plywood cutout version is found along Highway 62 ca. from the center of Twentynine Palms, California.
* Iwo Jima Sculpture and Memorial Wall at Foster Park in Young Harris, Georgia

<doc id="229143" wikidata="Q21071528" url="?curid=229143" title="H-dropping">
<text>&quot;H&quot;-dropping or aitch-dropping is the deletion of the voiceless glottal fricative or &quot;&quot;H&quot;-sound&quot;, . The phenomenon is common in many dialects of English, and is also found in certain other languages, either as a purely historical development or as a contemporary difference between dialects. Although common in most regions of England and in some other English-speaking countries, and linguistically speaking a neutral evolution in languages, H-dropping is often stigmatized as a sign of careless or uneducated speech, due to its strong association with the lower class.

The reverse phenomenon, H&quot;-insertionor H&quot;-adding, is found in certain situations, sometimes as an allophone or hypercorrection by H-dropping speakers, and sometimes as a spelling pronunciation or out of perceived etymological correctness. A particular example of this is the spread of &#x27;haitch&#x27; for &#x27;&#x27;.

==In English==
===Historical /h/-loss===
In Old English phonology, the sounds , , and (described respectively as glottal, velar and palatal voiceless fricatives) are taken to be allophones of a single phoneme . This phoneme occurred at the start of syllables, alone or clustered with an approximant, and in coda position. The sound appeared in most onsets (except those with an and cluster, which had ) and the other two allophones in syllable codas ( after back vowels and after front vowels).

The instances of in coda position were lost during the Middle English and Early Modern English periods, although they are still reflected in the spelling of words such as &quot;taught&quot; (now pronounced like &quot;taut&quot;) and &quot;weight&quot; (now pronounced in most accents like &quot;wait&quot;). Most of the initial clusters involving also disappeared (see H-cluster reductions). As a result, in the standard varieties of Modern English, the only position in which can occur is at the start of a syllable, either alone (as in &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;behind&quot;, etc.), in the cluster (as in &quot;&quot;), or (for a minority of speakers) in the cluster (as in &quot;&quot; if pronounced differently from &quot;wine&quot;). The usual realizations of the latter two clusters are and (see English phonology).

===Contemporary H-dropping===
The phenomenon of H-dropping considered as a feature of contemporary English is the omission, in certain accents and dialects, of this syllable-initial , either alone or in the cluster . (For the cluster and its reduction, see Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩.)

H-dropping, in certain accents and dialects of Modern English, causes words like &quot;harm&quot;, &quot;heat&quot;, &quot;home&quot; and &quot;behind&quot; to be pronounced &quot;arm&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;ome&quot; and &quot;be-ind&quot; (though in some dialects an [h] may appear in &quot;behind&quot; to prevent hiatus – see below).

Cases of H-dropping occur in all English dialects in the weak forms of function words like &quot;he&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;had&quot;, and &quot;have&quot;. The pronoun &quot;it&quot; is a product of historical H-dropping – the older &quot;hit&quot; survives as an emphatic form in a few dialects such as Southern American English, and in the Scots language. Because the of unstressed &quot;have&quot; is usually dropped, the word is usually pronounced in phrases like &quot;should have&quot;, &quot;would have&quot;, and &quot;could have&quot;. These can be spelled out in informal writing as &quot;should&#x27;ve&quot;, &quot;would&#x27;ve&quot;, and &quot;could&#x27;ve&quot;. Because is also the weak form of the word &quot;of&quot;, these words are often erroneously spelled as &quot;should of&quot;, &quot;would of&quot; and &quot;could of&quot;.

====History====
There is evidence of h-dropping in texts from the 13th century and later. It may originally have arisen through contact with the Norman language, where h-dropping also occurred. Puns which rely on the possible omission of the sound can be found in works by William Shakespeare and in other Elizabethan era dramas. It is suggested that the phenomenon probably spread from the middle to the lower orders of society, first taking hold in urban centers. It started to become stigmatized, being seen as a sign of poor education, in the 16th or 17th century.

====Geographical distribution====
H-dropping occurs (variably) in most of the dialects of the English language in England and Welsh English, including Cockney, West Country English, West Midlands English (including Brummie), East Midlands English, most of northern England (including Yorkshire and Lancashire), and Cardiff English. It is not generally found in Scottish English and Irish English. It is also typically absent in certain regions of England and Wales, including Northumberland, East Anglia and parts of North and West Wales.

H-dropping also occurs in some Jamaican English, and perhaps in other Caribbean English (including some of The Bahamas). It is not generally found in North American English, although it has been reported in Newfoundland (outside the Avalon Peninsula). However, dropping of /h/ from the cluster /hj/ (so that &quot;human&quot; is pronounced ) is found in some American dialects, as well as in parts of Ireland – see reduction of /hj/.

====Social distribution and stigmatization====
H-dropping, in the countries and regions in which it is prevalent, occurs mainly in working-class accents. Studies have shown it to be significantly more frequent in lower than in higher social groups. It is not a feature of RP (the prestige accent of England), or even of &quot;Near-RP&quot;, a variant of RP that includes some regional features. This does not always apply, however, to the dropping of /h/ in weak forms of words like &quot;his&quot; and &quot;her&quot;.

H-dropping in English is widely stigmatized, being perceived as a sign of poor or uneducated speech, and discouraged by schoolteachers. John Wells writes that it seems to be &quot;the single most powerful pronunciation shibboleth in England.&quot;

====Use and status of the H-sound in H-dropping dialects====
In fully H-dropping dialects, that is, in dialects without a phonemic , the sound may still occur but with uses other than distinguishing words. An epenthetic may be used to avoid hiatus, so that for example &quot;the egg&quot; is pronounced &quot;the hegg&quot;. It may also be used when any vowel-initial word is emphasized, so that &quot;horse&quot; (assuming the dialect is also non-rhotic) and &quot;ass&quot; may be pronounced and in emphatic utterances. That is, has become an allophone of the zero onset in these dialects.

For many H-dropping speakers, however, a phonological appears to be present, even if it is not usually realized – that is, they know which words &quot;should&quot; have an , and have a greater tendency to pronounce an [h] in those words than in other words beginning with a vowel. Insertion of [h] may occur as a means of emphasis, as noted above, and also as a response to the formality of a situation. Sandhi phenomena may also indicate a speaker&#x27;s awareness of the presence of an – for example, some speakers might say &quot;a edge&quot; (rather than &quot;an edge&quot;) for &quot;a hedge&quot;, and might omit the linking R before an initial vowel resulting from a dropped H.

It is likely that the phonemic system of children in H-dropping areas lacks a /h/ entirely, but that social and educational pressures lead to the incorporation of an (inconsistently realized) /h/ into the system by the time of adulthood.

===H-insertion===
The opposite of H-dropping, called &quot;H-insertion&quot; or &quot;H-adding&quot;, sometimes occurs as a hypercorrection in English accents that typically drop H. It is commonly noted in literature from late Victorian times to the early 20th century that some lower-class people consistently drop &quot;h&quot; in words that should have it, while adding &quot;h&quot; to words that should not have it. An example from the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is, &quot;In &#x27;Artford, &#x27;Ereford, and &#x27;Ampshire, &#x27;urricanes &#x27;ardly hever &#x27;appen&quot;. Another is in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;: &quot;Three cheers for the Hempress of Colney &#x27;Atch&quot;. In practice, however, it would appear that &quot;h&quot;-adding is more of a stylistic prosodic effect, being found in highly emphasized words, regardless of whether those words are h-initial or vowel-initial in the standard language.

Some English words borrowed from French may begin with the letter but not with the sound . Examples include &quot;heir&quot;, and, in many regional pronunciations, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;hono(u)r&quot; and &quot;honest&quot;. In some cases, spelling pronunciation has introduced the sound into such words, as in &quot;humble&quot;, &quot;human&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot; and (for most speakers) &quot;historic&quot;. Spelling pronunciation has also added to the British English pronunciation of &quot;herb&quot;, , while American English retains the older pronunciation . Etymology may also serve as a motivation for H-addition, as in the words &quot;horrible&quot;, &quot;habit&quot; and &quot;harmony&quot;: these were borrowed into Middle English from French without an (&quot;orrible, abit, armonie&quot;), but as all three derive from Latin words with an , they would later acquired an in English as an etymological &quot;correction&quot;. The name of the letter H itself, &quot;aitch&quot;, is subject to H-insertion in some dialects, where it is pronounced &quot;haitch&quot;. (In Hiberno-English, &quot;haitch&quot; has come to be considered standard, consistent with their not being H-dropping dialects). Various dialects of Newfoundland English exhibit the same pattern.

==In other languages==
Processes of H-dropping have occurred in various languages at certain times, and in some cases, they remain as distinguishing features between dialects, as in English. Some Dutch dialects, especially the southern ones, feature H-dropping. The dialects of Zeeland, West and East Flanders, most of Antwerp and Flemish Brabant, and the west of North Brabant have lost /h/ as a phonemic consonant but use [h] to avoid hiatus and to signal emphasis, much as in the H-dropping dialects of English. H-dropping is also found in some North Germanic languages, for instance Elfdalian and the dialect of Roslagen, where it is found already in Old East Norse. Also the Low Saxon speaking area around Zwolle, Kampen, Steenwijk, Meppel and Hoogeveen have h-dropping, the former island of Urk has it too as do some regions in Groningen.

When dealing with Greek, this process is called psilosis. The phoneme in Ancient Greek of Classical Athens, occurring predominantly at the beginnings of words and originally written with the letter H and later as a rough breathing, had been lost by that period in most Ionic dialects and from all Greek dialects during the late Hellenistic/Roman era. Hence it not a phoneme of Modern Greek being approximated in foreign loanwords by or (or ).

The phoneme was lost in Vulgar Latin, the ancestor of the modern Romance languages. Already in the Imperial period, there is attested evidence for early h-loss. French, Spanish, and Romanian have acquired new initial in medieval times, but they were later lost in the first two languages in a &quot;second round&quot; of H-dropping. Some dialects of Spanish have yet again acquired from , which as of now is stable.

It is hypothesized in the laryngeal theory that the loss of or similar sounds played a role in the early development of the Indo-European languages.

In Maltese, existed as a phoneme until the 19th century. It was then lost in most positions, sometimes lengthening the adjacent vowel. Chiefly word-finally it was merged with //. The latter phoneme, in turn, may now be pronounced by some speakers, chiefly in the syllable onset.

Modern Hebrew is in the process of losing ; the phoneme is either replaced by (word-initially) or entirely absent (in all other positions) in the speech of contemporary young speakers.

In Tagalog, is sometimes elided into an immediately succeeding vowel, such as &quot;huwag&quot; from /huˈwaɡ/ to /ˈwag/ and &quot;sabihin&quot; from /saˈbihin/ to /saˈbin/.

Many dialects of Persian spoken in Afghanistan (i.e. Dari) do not realize the phoneme , except in high-prestige literary words or in hyper formal speech. The deletion of the phoneme may cause a preceding short vowel to be reinterpreted as a long vowel, likely due to phonological rules in Dari prohibiting short vowels and long vowels from being equal in length. For example, &lt;قهر&gt; (qahr /qahɾ/, &quot;anger&quot;) is often realized as &quot;qār&quot; /qɑːɾ/ (as if it was written like &lt;قار&gt;), and &lt;فهمیدن&gt; (fahmīdan /fahmiːdan/, to understand) is often realized as &lt;فامیدن&gt; (&quot;fāmīdan&quot; /fɑːmiːdan/). Between vowels, the phoneme may be replaced by a glide ( or ) resulting in words like &lt;خواهش&gt; (x(w)āhiš /xɑːhɪʃ/, &quot;I want&quot;) being realized as &lt;خایش&gt; (&quot;xāyš&quot; /xɑːjʃ/) or, in dialects that no longer distinguish āy and ay, this may be further reduced to &quot;xayš&quot; /xajʃ/ (as if spelt &lt;خیش&gt;).

The modern Javanese language typically does not have initial and intervocalic in its native words, except between the same vowels. For instance, in modern Javanese, the word for &quot;rain&quot; is &quot;udan&quot;, from Old Javanese &quot;hudan&quot;, which ultimately comes from Proto-Austronesian &quot;*quzaN&quot;. The letter &quot;ꦲ&quot; in traditional Javanese script, which had the value in Old Javanese is now used in most cases to represent and in its base form. In modern Javanese, initial and intervocalic appears only in loanwords from Indonesian and English. Since the Javanese people have been exposed to Dutch for far longer than they are with Indonesian or standard literary Malay (which only started somewhere after 1900 and amplified after 1945, excluding Surinamese Javanese), many of the words borrowed from Dutch have also lost the phoneme, such as &quot;andhuk&quot; /aɳˈɖ̥(ʰ)ʊʔ/ &quot;towel&quot; from Dutch &quot;handdoek&quot;.

<text>A bandersnatch is a fictional creature in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1871 novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; and his 1874 poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;. Although neither work describes the appearance of a bandersnatch in great detail, in &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;, it has a long neck and snapping jaws, and both works describe it as ferocious and extraordinarily fast. &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; implies that bandersnatches may be found in the world behind the looking-glass, and in &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;, a bandersnatch is found by a party of adventurers after crossing an ocean. Bandersnatches have appeared in various adaptations of Carroll&#x27;s works; they have also been used in other authors&#x27; works and in other forms of media.

==Description==
Carroll&#x27;s first mention of a Bandersnatch, in the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (which appears in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;), is very brief: the narrator of the poem admonishes his son to &quot;shun / The frumious Bandersnatch&quot;, the name describing the creature&#x27;s &quot;fuming&quot; and &quot;furious&quot; character. Later in the novel, the White King says of his wife (the White Queen): &quot;She runs so fearfully quick. You might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch!&quot;

In &quot;The Hunting of the Snark,&quot; while the party searches for the Snark, the Banker runs ahead and encounters a Bandersnatch:
&lt;poem&gt;
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new 
::It was matter for general remark, 
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
::In his zeal to discover the Snark.

But while he was seeking with thimbles and care, 
::A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh 
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
::For he knew it was useless to fly.

He offered large discount — he offered a cheque
::(Drawn &quot;to bearer&quot;) for seven-pounds-ten: 
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck 
::And grabbed at the Banker again.

Without rest or pause — while those frumious jaws 
::Went savagely snapping around —
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped, 
::Till fainting he fell to the ground.

The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
::Led on by that fear-stricken yell: 
And the Bellman remarked &quot;It is just as I feared!&quot; 
::And solemnly tolled on his bell.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==In other media==
===Literature===
* Anna Matlack Richards&#x27; &quot;A New Alice in the Old Wonderland&quot; (1895) contains a broader description given of the Bandersnatch within the poem &quot;Bandersnatchy&quot;. In this poem, another hero sets out to slay the frumious Bandersnatch so as to gain respect from his people against the hero who slew the Jabberwock (a story he would sit and tell till after ten o&#x27;clock). The author writes that it is necessary to be armed with a vorpal sword or a pistol, because one never can tell what a Bandersnatch might do. The hero describes the creature as being extremely long-legged with a long tail and the ability to fly. It could be understood that the Bandersnatch perhaps camouflages itself as a tree. There is an illustration by the author&#x27;s daughter, Anna Richards Brewster, of the hero&#x27;s encounter with the Bandersnatch.
* In a letter from 1959, C. S. Lewis wrote, &quot;No one ever influenced Tolkien – you might as well try to influence a bandersnatch.&quot;
* In Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot; series (1965 to present), there is a heavy-gravity species somewhat resembling a giant slug; upon their discovery they were immediately given the genus and species &quot;&quot;Frumious bandersnatch&quot;.&quot;
* In Roger Zelazny’s (1987) &quot;Sign of Chaos&quot; (part of &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot;) the protagonist encounters a Bandersnatch. The creature is described as segmented, with a side-to-side gait, leaving a trail of steaming saliva, and hissing like a leaky pressure cooker. The Bandersnatch suffered a heart-attack after having a cardiac arrest spell cast on it, implying that its general anatomy is analogous to normal animals. The episode takes place in a reality created by the mind of one of the characters while under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug.
* In Wilfrid Blunt&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;Omar&quot;, the character &quot;Omar&quot; is a hyrax who speaks English and certain dialects of horses and rhinoceroses. Omar claims that the word &quot;bandersnatch&quot; refers to hyraxes, and that the warning to &quot;shun a bandersnatch&quot; only pertains if it happens to be &quot;frumious&quot;.
* &quot;The Frumious Bandersnatch&quot; is the title of a 2003 police procedural novel by Ed McBain, one of the last in his 87th Precinct series of detective crime fiction.
* In Eric Nylund&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Ghosts of Onyx&quot;, the code-name &#x27;Bandersnatch&#x27; is used to warn UNSC troops for a radiological or energy-based disaster. It was previously used on occasions where Covenant troops had &#x27;glassed&#x27; former human colonies.

===Television and film===
* In &quot;Pandora Hearts&quot; (2006), Lily&#x27;s chain is a large black dog named Bandersnatch.
* In the &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Earthling,&quot; Adam Strange improvises a performance of the second verse of Jabberwocky in order to distract a patrol while on the planet Rann. &quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!&quot; He soon scurries away saying &quot;No time to say hello, goodbye! I&#x27;m late! I&#x27;m late! I&#x27;m late!&quot; &quot;... and down the rabbit hole I go!&quot; Strange&#x27;s mission accomplices include a pet from his alien hosts&#x27; household with an appearance not unlike some illustrations of a Jubjub bird.
* In the 2010 film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the Bandersnatch appears as a large white beast somewhat resembling a mix of bulldog, snow leopard and bear with long fur, black spots, a long tail, and multiple rows of sharp teeth. It is a creature under the control of the Red Queen until Alice returns its eye (which it had lost to the Dormouse). It helps Alice to escape and joins the White Queen&#x27;s forces. In the video game adaptation of the film, it serves a similar role.
* The Bandersnatch appears in the &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot; episode &quot;Forget-Me-Not.&quot; This version is a monstrous wild boar. In the past, Alice had faced the Bandersnatch before. In the present, Jafar and the Red Queen send the female Bandersnatch after Alice and the Knave of Hearts in order to get Alice to use up one of her wishes from Cyrus. Jafar gives the Bandersnatch the magic message response that Alice made for Cyrus so that it can pick up her scent. The Bandersnatch tracks Alice to the Grendel&#x27;s house and attacks where it knocks out the Grendel. As Alice restrains the Bandersnatch, the Knave of Hearts stabs it. The Red Queen states to Jafar that the Bandersnatch mates for life and that the male Bandersnatch in their possession is now dead.
* In the adult animated movie &quot;Mardock Scramble: The First Compression&quot; (2010), a dockside warehouse owned by the livestock export company &quot;Bander Snatch&quot; is used as a clandestine meeting location (visible at 45:34).
*In &quot;Date A Live&quot; season 2, the robotic creatures of Deus Ex Machina are called the Bandersnatch.
*In the television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, the Bandersnatch is mentioned by Alice in the episode &quot;The Girl in the Tower&quot; as a reference to Alice&#x27;s speed: &quot;I once outran a Bandersnatch.&quot;
* &quot;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&quot; is a standalone interactive film released in between the fourth and fifth seasons of the Netflix anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;.

===Music===
* San Francisco psychedelic rock band Frumious Bandersnatch named themselves after Carroll&#x27;s work.
* Seattle rock band Forgive Durden released a single entitled &quot;Beware the Jubjub Bird and Shun the frumious Bandersnatch!&quot; (2006) from the album Wonderland.
* Dutch composer Theo Verbey wrote a piece called &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; for cello and pianola, which was premiered during the 2010 Amsterdam Cello Biennale.

===Comics===
* In the 2010 graphic novel &quot;Calamity Jack&quot;, sequel to &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (published in 2006), the giant Blunderboar has a pet Bandersnatch named Lewis, presumably after Lewis Carroll. This Bandersnatch appears as a giant toadlike being with a massive mouth, two small mouths in place of eyes, a long froglike tongue, and the ability to spit acid. It was killed when the Jabblewocky bit it.
* In the visual novel &quot;Sekien no Inganock - What a Beautiful People&quot;, Bandersnatch appears as a fantastic Creature that manifests itself inside the &quot;engine space&quot; within the City&#x27;s computer network and preys upon hackers who access the virtual reality.
* In Ursula Vernon&#x27;s webcomic &quot;Digger&quot;, a bandersnatch appears as a two-headed, sentient, exiled draft animal.
* In the online comic &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, the Bandersnatch is shown to be a harmless creature.

===Games===
* &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;, a 1984 vaporware game project by Imagine Software that led to the 1986 game Brataccas.
* &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;, a name used many times in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series (1987–present). The name is given to various enemies in many installments of the game in both the Japanese and English-language versions. In most of the games, it is a common enemy that does not create much difficulty for the player, and it usually has qualities of wolves or lions in appearance. In &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, however, the Bandersnatch is a slightly stronger enemy with a strange appearance that seems to be a large, demonic poodle with an expansive toothy grin. It is summoned by the antagonists during an important story scene in the game. The Bandersnatch of &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; is a major enemy, an enormous bipedal reptile vaguely resembling a Tyrannosaurus, its body covered in brutal, jagged spines, and an unusual mouth with two massive vertical jaws and rows of man-sized fangs.
* In the massively multiplayer online role-playing games &quot;Mabinogi&quot; (2004) and &quot;LaTale&quot; (2006), the Bandersnatch makes an appearance. In &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, a Bandersnatch is an ice monster located in &quot;Par Dungeon&quot;. A normal Bandersnatch can only be killed with one of the fire spells, or a giant&#x27;s stomp ability, due to their high defense. The Giant Bandersnatch can be killed as a normal monster and is the boss of the dungeon. Both normal and Giant Bandersnatches move slowly and will not normally attack unless first hit is activated. In &quot;Latale&quot;, the Bandersnatch is a dog-like creature with strange markings and a massive jaw. It is an auto-aggressive monster that either lunges at the player or headbutts when its close to the player. It can be found in the first two rooms of the Treasure Vault Instance or King&#x27;s Room.
* Bandersnatches are a powerful type of enemy in &quot;Kingdom Rush: Origins&quot;, appearing as a large, blue and purple monster with a spiny back and the ability to roll into a ball and move extraordinarily quickly.
* The indie game &quot;Welcome to the Fells&quot; depicts Bandersnatches as small, brown, feline creatures with matted fur. If the player gets close the Bandersnatch will wake up, revealing glowing orange eyes, and will chase the player at very high speed. Defeating a bandersnatch often drops treasure.
* In the &quot;Shadowrun&quot; universe, bandersnatches are humanoid creatures whose bodies can refract light. They can blend in almost perfectly with their surroundings, making them difficult to see, even with the use of thermal detectors, since the radiation of their body heat is also masked. They can usually be found in the Salish-Sidhe wilderness, sometimes in abandoned buildings, and tend to attack in small groups.
*Bandersnatch is the name of an enemy in &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;. It shares nothing in common with the source material other than an extendable arm, giving it the &#x27;long reach&#x27; of its namesake.
*Frumious Bandersnatch is the name of a familiar in the browser-based multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;, obtained by buying a special monthly item in March 2009.
* In the &quot;Tera&quot; universe, &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; is a name given to the last boss in &quot;Wonderholme&quot;&#x27;s dungeon.
* In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the bandersnatch, along with the Jub-Jub Bird and Jabberwock, is one of a group of monsters called &quot;The Tane&quot; invented by the fey lords as living weapons.
* In &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, Alice Kuonji summons a Bandersnatch using her Noble Phantasm Great Three, Wandersnatch to attack the enemies.

===Computer science===
* Bandersnatches are the subject of a difficult algorithm design project for an apparently NP-complete problem in the academic theoretical computer science book by M. R. Garey and D. S. Johnson, &quot;Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness&quot;.

===Physical locations===
* In Ashland, OR, USA there is a hiking trail above Lithia Park named Bandersnatch Trail.
* Denison University in Granville, OH, USA has a student-run cafe called The Bandersnatch.
* Previously a student-run cafe at the University of Chicago (circa late 1960s-early 1970s).
* The minor planet is named for the Bandersnatch.

<text>In propositional calculus, a propositional function or a predicate is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of true or false, except that within the sentence there is a variable (&quot;x&quot;) that is not defined or specified (thus being a free variable), which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. &quot;n&quot; variables, in which case the function takes &quot;n&quot; arguments).

==Overview==
As a mathematical function, &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms. As an example, consider the predicate scheme, &quot;x is hot&quot;. The substitution of any entity for &quot;x&quot; will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though &quot;&quot;x&quot; is hot&quot; on its own has no value as either a true or false statement. However, when a value is assigned to &quot;x&quot;, such as lava, the function then has the value &quot;true&quot;; while one assigns to &quot;x&quot; a value like ice, the function then has the value &quot;false&quot;.

Propositional functions are useful in set theory for the formation of sets. For example, in 1903 Bertrand Russell wrote in &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (page 106):
:&quot;...it has become necessary to take &quot;propositional function&quot; as a primitive notion.

Later Russell examined the problem of whether propositional functions were predicative or not, and he proposed two theories to try to get at this question: the zig-zag theory and the ramified theory of types.

A Propositional Function, or a predicate, in a variable &quot;x&quot; is an open formula &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) involving &quot;x&quot; that becomes a proposition when one gives &quot;x&quot; a definite value from the set of values it can take.

According to Clarence Lewis, &quot;A proposition is any expression which is either true or false; a propositional function is an expression, containing one or more variables, which becomes a proposition when each of the variables is replaced by some one of its values from a discourse domain of individuals.&quot; Lewis used the notion of propositional functions to introduce relations, for example, a propositional function of &quot;n&quot; variables is a relation of arity &quot;n&quot;. The case of &quot;n&quot; = 2 corresponds to binary relations, of which there are homogeneous relations (both variables from the same set) and heterogeneous relations.

<text>Jessie Margaret Matthews (11 March 1907 – 19 August 1981) was an English actress, dancer and singer of the 1920s and 1930s, whose career continued into the post-war period.

After a string of hit stage musicals and films in the mid-1930s, such as &quot;Evergreen&quot;, Matthews developed a following in the USA, where she was dubbed &quot;The Dancing Divinity&quot;. Her British studio was reluctant to let go of its biggest name, however, which resulted in offers for her to work in Hollywood being repeatedly rejected.

After the decline of her film career, Matthews achieved a comeback in her native Britain when she took over the role of Mary Dale in the popular BBC Radio serial &quot;The Dales&quot; (previously known as &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot;).

== Early life ==
Jessie Margaret Matthews was born on 11 March 1907 to Jane Matthews (née Townshend) in a flat above a butcher&#x27;s shop at 94 Berwick Street, Soho, London, in relative poverty, the seventh of sixteen children (of whom eleven survived). Jessie&#x27;s father, George Ernest Matthews, was a fruit-and-vegetable seller. Shortly after her birth, the family moved around the corner to 5 Livonia Street. Aged five, the family again moved, this time to 11 Carlos Street, Camden Town, where she attended St Matthew&#x27;s School. In 1915, Matthews and her family returned to live in Soho, at 9 William and Mary Yard, a flat above stables, which was at the top of Great Windmill Street; the buildings were later demolished. She then attended Pulteney Street London County Council School for Girls.

== Career ==

===Beginnings===
Matthews took dancing lessons as a child in a room above a local public house at 22 Berwick Street. She first went on stage on 29 December 1919, aged 12, in &quot;Bluebell in Fairyland&quot;, by Seymour Hicks, with music by Walter Slaughter and lyrics by Charles Taylor, at The Metropolitan Music Hall, Edgware Road, London, as a child dancer.

She made her cinema debut in 1923 in the silent film &quot;The Beloved Vagabond&quot;. She also had a small part in &quot;Straws in the Wind&quot;, released the following year, in which her sister Rosie also appeared. 1923 also saw Jessie make her West End debut when she appeared in C. B. Cochran&#x27;s production of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Music Box Revue&quot; at the Palace Theatre. This was followed by a part in the chorus of &quot;London Calling!&quot;, a revue by Noël Coward and Ronald Jeans presented by André Charlot.

Matthews was then in the chorus in &quot;Charlot&#x27;s Review of 1924&quot; in London. She went with the show to New York, where she was also understudy to the star, Gertrude Lawrence. The show moved to Toronto, and when Lawrence fell ill, Matthews took over the role, and received glowing reviews.

===Early fame===

Matthews first achieved star status in &quot;The Charlot Show of 1926&quot;, a show which saw her dance in ballet with Anton Dolin, and in musical comedy with Henry Lytton Jr. Matthews and Lytton married the same year, but they were divorced after only a few years. During this period, she was given a £25,000 contract with Cochran, equivalent to over £1m in 2022. She made her debut as a leading lady on Broadway in &quot;The Charlot Show of 1927&quot;, a production coupled with &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Vanities&quot;.

In 1927, Matthews starred in &quot;One Dam Thing After Another&quot; by Ronald Jeans, a West End revue with music by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, which featured Matthews introducing their hit song &quot;My Heart Stood Still&quot;. It was in this show that she first met her co-star Sonnie Hale. The following year, they introduced Coward&#x27;s romantic duet &quot;A Room with a View&quot; in &quot;This Year of Grace&quot;, and her performance in the revue was acclaimed by critics. She was similarly successful in another revue &quot;Wake up and Dream&quot; (1929), in which she and Hale introduced Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It, Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;.

Matthews&#x27; fame reached its initial height with her lead role in Cochran&#x27;s 1930 stage production of &quot;Ever Green&quot;, which premiered at the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow. The musical, by Rodgers and Hart, was partly inspired by the life of music hall star Marie Lloyd and her daughter&#x27;s tribute act resurrection of her mother&#x27;s acclaimed Edwardian stage show as Marie Lloyd Junior. At its time, &quot;Ever Green&quot;, which included the first major revolving stage in Britain, was the most expensive musical ever mounted on a British stage. The show saw Matthews introduce another Rodgers and Hart standard, &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;.

===Film star===
Matthews&#x27; first major film role was in the musical &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1931), but it was a commercial failure. However, the following year, she starred in &quot;There Goes the Bride&quot;, directed by Albert de Courville, which was a success. This was followed by &quot;The Man from Toronto&quot;, released the same year, and another film for de Courville, &quot;The Midshipmaid&quot;.

Matthews enjoyed great success with her appearance in the ensemble film &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1933), an adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s novel and play directed by Victor Saville. 1933 also saw her starring in &quot;Waltzes from Vienna&quot;, an operetta telling the story behind the production of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; by Johann Strauss II, directed by a young Alfred Hitchcock. This was followed by another ensemble film, &quot;Friday the Thirteenth&quot; (1933), in which she appeared on screen with Hale, who was by then her husband, for the first time.

She then starred in the film version of &quot;Evergreen&quot; (1934), which featured the newly composed song &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;; it would to go on to become Matthews&#x27; personal signature song, later giving its title to her autobiography and to a 21st-century musical stage show of her life.

This was followed by &quot;First a Girl&quot; (1935), in which she appears as a cross dresser, and then &quot;It&#x27;s Love Again&quot; (1936), where she had an American co-star, Robert Young. Exhibitors voted her the sixth biggest star in the country that year.

Matthews then began to appear in films directed by husband: &quot;Gangway&quot; (1937), &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (1937) and &quot;Sailing Along&quot; (1938). Following the end of Hale&#x27;s contract with Gaumont British, she starred in her last film for the studio, &quot;Climbing High&quot; (1938) directed by Carol Reed. In 1938, she was the fourth biggest British star at the box office.

Matthews and Hale returned to the stage in 1939 in their own musical production, &quot;I Can Take It&quot;, which had a successful provincial tour. It was due to open at the London Coliseum on 12 September, but the outbreak of the war on 3 September meant the show was cancelled.

===World War II===
Her warbling voice and round cheeks made her a familiar and much-loved personality to British theatre and film audiences at the beginning of World War II. She was one of many British-born stars in the Hollywood film &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943) (in whose cast Matthews was virtually unique, by virtue of not being an expat: while in New York City preparing for a Broadway role, Matthews had been recruited to film a role originally intended for Greer Garson in Hollywood over three days). She returned to the West End stage in Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Wild Rose&quot;, a revival of &quot;Sally&quot;, in 1942.

Matthews&#x27; popularity waned in the 1940s after several years&#x27; absence from the screen, followed by an unsatisfactory thriller, &quot;Candles at Nine&quot; (1944). She directed and featured in the short film, &quot;Victory Wedding&quot; (1944), starring John Mills and Dulcie Gray.

During the war, she entertained troops in Continental Europe as a member of ENSA.

===Post-war career===
Post-war audiences associated Matthews with a world of hectic pre-war luxury that was now seen as obsolete in austerity-era Britain. She appeared in variety tours, and returned to musical theatre in &quot;Maid to Measure&quot;, which began touring in 1947 before coming to the Cambridge Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. However, it closed after only four and a half weeks. Matthews began to venture into straight theatre, and appeared in a two-week run of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Playbill&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Hammersmith in 1949. This was a double bill in which she took parts in &quot;Harlequinade&quot; and &quot;The Browning Version&quot;. Matthews then starred in the revue &quot;Sauce Tartare&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre, which ran for several months and would prove to be her last West End role until 1966. In 1950, she undertook a tour of Britain playing Eliza Doolittle in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.

Matthews toured Australia from 1952 to 1953 in &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;, a play adapted from Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;Theatre&quot;. Back in the UK, 1954 saw her touring the country in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;, playing the leading female role of Amanda. The following year, she was reunited with Sonnie Hale to star in a comedy, &quot;Nest of Robins&quot;, which toured British theatres. The duo also went on tour with the play in 1957, in what would be their final appearance on stage together.

Matthews was back on cinema screens when she played Tom Thumb&#x27;s mother in the 1958 children&#x27;s film &quot;tom thumb&quot;. Following the completion of the film, she moved to Melbourne, where she opened a drama school. She continued to work as an actress, appearing in &quot;Dinner with the Family&quot; (1959), made for Australian television. Matthews returned to live in the UK in 1960.

In the 1960s, Matthews found new fame when she took over the leading role of Mary Dale in the BBC&#x27;s long-running daily radio serial &quot;The Dales&quot;, formerly known &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot;. Despite a campaign by the show&#x27;s fans, who included the Queen Mother, the series ended in 1969 after 21 years on air.

===Later career===
Matthews was awarded an OBE in 1970. She continued to make cabaret and occasional film and television appearances throughout the 1970s, including a one-off guest role in the popular BBC TV drama series &quot;Angels&quot;. Her final appearance in a stage musical was playing Mrs Doasyouwouldbedoneby in &quot;The Water Babies&quot; (1973), an adaptation of the Charles Kingsley children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby&quot;.

She also played Wallis Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Aunt Bessie&quot; Merriman in the 1978 Thames TV series &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot;, which told the story of Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication. The same year, she returned to the theatre in &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;. 

She took her one-woman stage show to Los Angeles in 1979 and won the United States Drama-Logue Award for the year&#x27;s best performance in concert. Matthews&#x27; last appearance was in &quot;Night of One Hundred Stars&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre, on 14 December 1980.

==Personal life and death==
On 17 February 1926, aged 18, Matthews married the first of her three husbands, the 19-year-old actor Henry Lytton, Jr. at Hammersmith Register Office. He was the son of singer and actress Louie Henri and Sir Henry Lytton, the doyen of the Savoy Theatre. Matthews and Lytton Jr. lived in Warwick Close in Kensington, but the marriage did not last, and they divorced in 1930. Following this, she moved to Adelaide Road in South Hampstead.

Matthews had several romantic relationships conducted in the public eye, often causing controversy in the newspapers. The most notorious was her relationship with the married actor Sonnie Hale. A high-court judge denounced her as an &quot;odious&quot; individual when her love letters to Hale were used as evidence in the case of his divorce from his wife, actress/singer Evelyn &#x27;Boo&#x27; Laye. Hale and Matthews were married on 24 January 1931 at Hampstead Register Office, and they lived in The Old House, a farmhouse in Hampton, Middlesex.

It took some time for Matthews&#x27; popularity to recover from the scandal of her affair with Hale. &quot;If I ceased to be a star&quot;, she wrote in a piece for &quot;Picturegoer&quot; in 1934, &quot;all that interest in my home life would evaporate, I believe. Perhaps it is the price one has to pay for being a star&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Evergreen&quot;, she suffered the first of her nervous breakdowns. On 18 December that year, she prematurely gave birth to a son, John Robert Hale Monro III, who survived for only four hours. She had another serious breakdown in 1936, and was hospitalised in New York during World War II.

In 1944, after thirteen years of marriage, Sonnie Hale and Jessie Matthews were divorced. She subsequently moved to Chelsea. On 9 August 1945, she was married for the third and last time to military officer Lt. Brian Lewis, a man thirteen years her junior. In December that year, she miscarried a child. Matthews and Lewis separated in 1956, and were subsequently divorced. However, because the divorce was in South Africa, it was not recognised in England. Consequently, the decree nisi was not granted until December 1980, over twenty years since they had last seen each other. With Hale she had one adopted daughter, Catherine Hale-Monro, who married Count Donald Grixoni on 15 November 1958; they eventually divorced, but she remained known as Catherine, Countess Grixoni.

Matthews latterly lived in Hatch End, north west London. She died of cancer, aged 74, on 19 August 1981.

==Legacy==
A posthumous documentary on Matthews, &quot;Catch A Fallen Star&quot;, part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;40 Minutes&quot; strand, was broadcast in 1987.

A memorial plaque above the venue for her childhood dance classes, 22 Berwick Street, Soho, was unveiled on 3 May 1995 by Andrew Lloyd Webber and stage actress Ruthie Henshall.

<text>The Rose Ryal is a gold coin of the Kingdom of England issued in the reign of King James I and is now very rare. The coin is really a two-ryal coin worth thirty shillings (i.e. 1½ pounds) and is a development of the earlier fine sovereign of Queen Elizabeth I.

The Rose Ryal, so called because of the rose appearing on the reverse, was introduced during James I&#x27;s second coinage (1604-1619). The design of this first issue shows on the obverse the king enthroned with a portcullis beneath his feet, surrounded by the legend (&quot;James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland King&quot;). The reverse shows the royal arms over a rose surrounded by the legend (&quot;This is the Lord&#x27;s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes&quot;, from Psalm 118).

During James&#x27; third coinage (1619–1625) a new-style rose ryal was issued. On the reverse is the royal shield, with the value &quot;XXX&quot; over the shield and the whole surrounded by roses, lions, and lis, surrounded by the legend , while the obverse shows a redesigned version of the enthroned king with a portcullis beneath, surrounded by the legend .

<text>Abraham Hayward Q.C. (22 November 1801 – 2 February 1884) was an English writer and translator.

==Life==

He was son of Joseph Hayward, and was born in Wilton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire.

After education at Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton, he entered the Inner Temple in 1824, and was called to the bar in June 1832. He took part as a conservative in the discussions of the London Debating Society, where his opponents were J A Roebuck and John Stuart Mill. The editorship of the &quot;Law Magazine&quot;, or, &quot;Quarterly Review of Jurisprudence&quot;, which he held from 1828 to 1844, brought him into connection with John Austin, G Cornewall Lewis, and such foreign jurists as Savigny, whose tractate on contemporary legislation and jurisprudence he rendered into English.

In 1833 he travelled abroad, and on his return began contributing to the &quot;New Monthly&quot;, the &quot;Foreign Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;.

In February 1835 he was elected to the Athenaeum Club under Rule II, and he remained for nearly fifty years one of its most conspicuous and most influential members. He was also a subscriber to the Carlton, but ceased to frequent it when he became a Peelite. At the Temple, Hayward, whose reputation was rapidly growing as a connoisseur not only of a bill of fare but also as company, gave &quot;recherché&quot; dinners, at which ladies of rank and fashion appreciated the wit of Sydney Smith and Theodore Hook, the dignity of Lockhart and Lyndhurst and the oratory of Macaulay. At the Athenaeum and in political society he to some extent succeeded to the position of Croker. He and Macaulay were commonly said to be the two best-read men in town.

Political ladies first, and statesmen afterwards, came to recognise the advantage of obtaining Hayward&#x27;s good opinion. The &quot;old reviewing hand&quot; became an acknowledged link between society, letters and politics. In one notable and lengthy land rights case, &#x27;The Queen v. Ames&#x27;, Hayward acted on behalf of the town of Lyme Regis in securing the permanent right of way for its citizens, across the cliffs to Axminster. There were other successes, but his promotion to be Q.C. in 1845 excited a storm of opposition, and, disgusted at being &#x27;black-balled&#x27; by J. A. Roebuck and therefore not elected a Bencher of his Inn in the usual course, Hayward virtually withdrew from legal practice. His enemies prevented him from enjoying a well-selected quasisinecure, which both Palmerston and Aberdeen admitted to be his due. Samuel Warren attacked him as Venom Tuft in &quot;Ten Thousand a Year&quot;; and Disraeli aimed at him partially in Ste Barbe (in &quot;Endymion&quot;), though the satire here was directed primarily against Thackeray.

As a counsellor of great ladies and of politicians, to whom he held forth with a sense of all-round responsibility surpassing that of a cabinet minister, Hayward retained his influence to the last years of his life. But he had little sympathy with modern ideas. He used to say that he had outlived everyone that he could really look up to. He died, a bachelor, in his rooms at 8 St James&#x27;s Street (a small museum of autograph portraits and reviewing trophies) and was buried in Highgate Cemetery (east side).
==Works==
He printed privately a translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; into English prose (pronounced by Carlyle to be the best version extant in his time). A second and revised edition was published after another visit to Germany in January 1834, in the course of which Hayward met Tieck, Chamisso, De La Motte Fouqué, Varnhagen von Ense and Madame Goethe. In 1878 he contributed the volume on Goethe to Blackwood&#x27;s Foreign Classics for English Readers. The late nineteenth century English author George Gissing who read a lot of German literature in German during his lifetime, thought the volume &#x27;poor stuff&#x27;.

His first successes as reviewer were in 1835–1836 by articles on &quot;Walker&#x27;s Original&quot; and on &quot;Gastronomy.&quot; The essays were reprinted to form &quot;The Art of Dining&quot;, in 1852. Hayward got up every important subject of discussion immediately it came into prominence, and concentrated his information in such a way that he habitually had the last word to say on a topic. When Rogers died, when &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was published, when the &quot;Greville Memoirs&quot; was issued or a revolution occurred on the continent, Hayward, whose memory was as retentive as his power of accumulating documentary evidence was exhaustive, wrote an elaborate essay on the subject for the &quot;Quarterly&quot; or the &quot;Edinburgh&quot;. He followed up his paper by giving his acquaintances no rest until they either assimilated or undertook to combat his views.

In February 1848 he became one of the chief leader-writers for the Peelite organ, the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. The morbid activity of his memory, however, continued to make him many enemies. He alienated Disraeli by tracing a purple patch in his official eulogy of the Duke of Wellington to a newspaper translation from Thiers&#x27;s funeral panegyric on General St Cyr. His sharp tongue had already made him an enemy of Roebuck, and he disgusted the friends of Mill by the stories he raked up for an obituary notice of the great economist (&quot;The Times&quot;, 10 May 1873). He broke with Henry Reeve in 1874 by a venomous review of the &quot;Greville Memoirs&quot;, in which Reeve was compared to the beggarly Scot deputed to let off the blunderbuss which Bolingbroke (Greville) had charged.

After his break with Reeve, Hayward devoted himself more exclusively to the &quot;Quarterly&quot;. His essays on Chesterfield and Selwyn were reprinted in 1854. Collective editions of his articles appeared in volume form in 1858, 1873 and 1874, and &quot;Selected Essays&quot; in two volumes, 1878. In his useful but far from flawless edition of the &quot;Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs (Thrale) Piozzi&quot; (1861), he again appears as a supplementer and continuator of J. W. Croker. His &quot;Eminent Statesmen and Writers&quot; (1880) commemorates to a large extent personal friendships with such men as Dumas, Cavour and Thiers, whom he knew intimately.

Two volumes of Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence&quot; (edited by HE Carlisle) were published in 1886. In &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (27 November 1875) he may be seen as he appeared in later life.

<text>Andrew Wynford Davies (; born 20 September 1936) is a Welsh screenwriter and novelist, best known for his television adaptations of &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot;, &quot;House of Cards&quot;, &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Bleak House&quot;, &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;, and his original serial &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot;. He was made a BAFTA Fellow in 2002.

==Education and early career==

Davies was born in Rhiwbina, Cardiff, Wales. He attended Whitchurch Grammar School in Cardiff and then University College, London, where he received a BA in English in 1957. He took a teaching position at St Clement Danes Grammar School in London, where he was on the teaching staff from 1958 to 1961. He held a similar post at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School in Hackney, London from 1961 to 1963. Following that, he was a lecturer in English at Coventry College of Education (which later merged with the University of Warwick to become the Faculty of Educational Studies and later the Warwick Institute of Education), and then at the University of Warwick.

In 1960, Davies contributed material to the BBC Home Service&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night at Home&quot; strand, alongside Harold Pinter and Ivor Cutler. He wrote his first play for radio in 1964 and many more were to follow. In 1960, he married Diana Huntley; the couple have a son and daughter. He is resident in Kenilworth, Warwickshire.

==Writer==

Davies&#x27; first television play, &quot;Who&#x27;s Going to Take Me On?&quot;, was broadcast in 1967 as part of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; strand. His early plays were written as a sideline to his work in education, many of them appearing in anthology series such as &quot;Thirty Minute Theatre&quot;, &quot;Play for Today&quot; and &quot;Centre Stage&quot;. One of his London stage plays, &quot;Rose&quot;, played on Broadway in 1981, with Glenda Jackson and Jessica Tandy. His first serial adaptation of a work of fiction was &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot; (1980), from the novel by R. F. Delderfield. He wrote &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; (1986–88), a campus based comedy-drama series that drew upon his career in education.

He is now best known for his adaptations of classic works of literature for television including 
the Charles Dickens short story The Signalman (1976), &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1995) starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1998), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (2005) and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (2008). He is the writer of the screenplays for the BBC production &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1994) and a planned film of the same name once announced for 2011 release.

Davies also co-devised with Bernadette Davis the sitcom &quot;Game On&quot; for BBC2 and co-wrote the first two series broadcast in 1995 and 1996. The popularity of his adaptation of Michael Dobbs&#x27;s political thriller &quot;House of Cards&quot; (for which Davies won his first Emmy award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries) was a significant influence in Dobbs&#x27;s decision to write two sequels, which Davies also adapted for television. In film, he has collaborated on the screenplays for the first two &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; films, based on Helen Fielding novels.

He is a prolific writer for children. The first of his novels was &quot;Conrad&#x27;s War&quot;, published by Blackie in 1978. Davies won the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, which is judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers and recognises the best book by an author who has not yet won it. He has written &quot;Alfonso Bonzo&quot; (book and television series) and the adventures of Marmalade Atkins (television series and numerous books). He also wrote the stories &quot;Dark Towers&quot; and &quot;Badger Girl&quot; for BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Look and Read&quot; programmes for schools audiences.

2008 saw the release of his adaptations of the 1999 novel &quot;Affinity&quot; by Sarah Waters, Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (a film), Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (a BBC series). &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; won seven of eleven Emmy nominations and earned Davies his second Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries.

Adaptations of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, one of Dickens&#x27; lesser-read works and Anthony Trollope&#x27;s Palliser novels were scrapped by the BBC in late 2009, following a move away from &quot;bonnet dramas&quot;.

ITV was looking to recreate its period drama success with &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; with a new series &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot;, written by Davies and starring Jeremy Piven. An initial ten-part series first aired on 6 January 2013 and it has run for 4 series by 2016.

Davies&#x27; six-part adaptation of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot; was broadcast on BBC One in January and February 2016. Following its success, the BBC announced in July 2016 that it would be followed up with a six-part adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; to be scripted by Davies. In May 2017, it was announced that BBC would adapt Vikram Seth&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; into an eight-part series to be scripted by Davies.

In May 2018, he announced at the Hay Festival that he is adapting John Updike&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; for television.

<doc id="229157" wikidata="Q6219504" url="?curid=229157" title="John Arthur Roebuck">
<text>John Arthur Roebuck (28 December 1802 – 30 November 1879), British politician, was born at Madras, in India. He was raised in Canada, and moved to England in 1824, and became intimate with the leading radical and utilitarian reformers. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath from 1832 to 1847, and MP for the Sheffield constituency from 1849. He took up a general attitude of hostility to the government of the day, whatever it was, which he retained throughout his life. He twice came to public prominence: in 1838, when, although at the time without a seat in parliament, he appeared at the bar of the Commons to protest, in the name of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, against the suspension of the constitution of Lower Canada; and in 1855, when, having overthrown Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s ministry by carrying a resolution for the appointment of a committee of inquiry into the mismanagement in the Crimean War, he presided over its proceedings.

==Life==
John Arthur Roebuck was born at Madras in 1801, was fifth son of Ebenezer Roebuck, a civil servant in India, and a grandson of the inventor John Roebuck. He was taken to England in 1807 following the death of his father. His mother remarried, to 
John Simpson, and the family emigrated to Lower Canada, where he was educated. His step-father was active in politics, being a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and later of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada.

Roebuck returned to England in 1824, and was entered at the Inner Temple, and called to the bar in 1831. In 1834, he married Henrietta Falconer, a daughter of Thomas Falconer. In 1835 he became the agent in England for the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada during the dispute between the executive government and the Legislative Assembly. In 1838, although at the time without a seat in Parliament, he appeared at the bar of the Commons to protest, in the name of the Lower Canada Assembly, against the suspension of the constitution of Lower Canada. In 1843 he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and was elected a bencher of his inn.

===Political career===

He was elected as a member of Parliament for Bath in 1832, declaring himself &quot;an independent member of that house&quot;. A disciple of Jeremy Bentham and a friend of John Stuart Mill, Roebuck professed advanced political opinions, which he resolved to uphold in the House of Commons. In general, he took up an attitude of hostility to the government of the day, whatever it was, which he retained throughout his life. He attacked everyone who differed from him with such vehemence as to earn the nickname of &quot;Tear &#x27;em.&quot; He was never sympathetic with the Whigs, and never let an opportunity go to exhibit his contempt for them. In 1852, he wrote &quot;The whigs, have ever been an exclusive and aristocratic faction, though at times employing democratic principles and phrases as weapons of offence against their opponents. ... When out of office they are demagogues; in power they become exclusive oligarchs&quot;.

He opposed the use of coercion in Ireland; advocated the abolition of sinecures; and proposed withdrawing the veto from the House of Lords. In 1835 he collected in a volume a series of &quot;Pamphlets for the People&quot; in support of his political views. In one of his pamphlets Roebuck denounced newspapers and everybody connected with them. As a result, John Black, the then editor of &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, challenged him to a duel which was fought on 19 November 1835. Neither party was injured. He failed to be re-elected for Bath in 1837, but he regained the seat in 1841.

In 1843, he proposed a motion in favour of secular education, which was rejected. In the debate on the Irish Colleges Bill, he taunted the Irish supporters of the bill with such bitterness that John Patrick Somers, MP for Sligo, threatened to challenge him to a duel. In April 1844 Roebuck defended the Home Secretary Sir James Graham from various charges, and was denounced by George Smythe, 7th Viscount Strangford, as the &quot;Diogenes of Bath,&quot; whose actions were always contradictory. Roebuck&#x27;s reply to this led to Smythe demanding a duel or a retraction.

Roebuck lost his seat in the general election of 1847. He spent some of his time in writing &quot;A Plan for Governing our English Colonies&quot;, which was published in 1849. He was returned to parliament for the Sheffield constituency in a by-election in 1849.

Roebuck championed a vigorous foreign policy. In 1850 he moved a strongly worded vote of confidence in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s recent foreign policy, following the Don Pacifico affair. In 1854 he defended the Crimean War; but the inefficiency which soon became apparent in carrying it on excited his disgust. In 1855, when, having overthrown Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s ministry by carrying a resolution for the appointment of a committee of inquiry into the mismanagement in the Crimean War, he presided over its proceedings. During the American Civil War he firmly championed the slave-holders of the South, boasting that Lord Palmerston had confessed to him that he was on the same side. In June 1863 Roebuck moved a resolution in the House of Commons calling for the Government to &quot;enter into negotiations with the Great Powers of Europe, for the purpose of obtaining their co-operation in the recognition of the independence of the Confederate States of North America.&quot; During the debate on the motion Roebuck claimed to have recently received an audience with the Emperor of the French who he said had assured him that France stood ready to recognise the Confederacy if the United Kingdom would do likewise. Roebuck later dropped the motion under pressure from the Government. Roebuck also defended Austrian rule in Italy.

In his latter years his political opinions became greatly modified. A speech at Salisbury in 1862, in which he alleged that working men were spendthrifts and wife-beaters, made him unpopular for a time. He strongly denounced the trade unionist Sheffield Outrages of 1867. These uncompromising attitudes led to Roebuck&#x27;s rejection by Sheffield voters at the election of 1868. He regained the seat in 1874. In 1878 he was made a privy councillor by the Tory government. He died at Westminster, in 1879. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

<doc id="229159" wikidata="Q776841" url="?curid=229159" title="Royal Scots Greys">
<text>The Royal Scots Greys was a cavalry regiment of the Army of Scotland that became a regiment of the British Army in 1707 upon the Union of Scotland and England, continuing until 1971 when they amalgamated with the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Dragoon Guards) to form the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.

The regiment&#x27;s history began in 1678, when three independent troops of Scots Dragoons were raised. In 1681, these troops were regimented to form The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons, numbered the 4th Dragoons in 1694. They were already mounted on grey horses by this stage and were already being referred to as the &quot;Grey Dragoons&quot;. 

Following the formation of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, they were renamed The Royal North British Dragoons (&quot;North Britain&quot; then being the envisaged common name for Scotland), but were already being referred to as the &quot;Scots Greys&quot;. In 1713, they were renumbered the 2nd Dragoons as part of a deal between the commands of the English Army and the Scottish Army when the two were in the process of being unified into the British Army. They were also sometimes referred to, during the first Jacobite uprising, as Portmore&#x27;s Dragoons. In 1877, their nickname was finally made official when they became the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys), which was inverted in 1921 to The Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons). They kept this title until 2 July 1971, when they amalgamated with the 3rd Carabiniers, forming the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.

==Origins of the Scots Greys==
The Royal Scots Greys began life as three troops of dragoons; this meant that while mounted as cavalry, their armament was closer to that used by infantry units. Troopers were equipped with matchlock muskets, sergeants and corporals with halberds and pistols; only the officers carried swords, though Lieutenants were armed with a partisan. The original uniform called for the troopers to wear grey coats, but there is no record of any requirement that the horses be a particular colour.

On 21 May 1678, two troops were raised by Captains John Strachan and John Inglis with a third under Captain Viscount Kingstoun added on 23 September. These were the first mounted units raised for the Crown in Scotland and were used by John Graham, Viscount Dundee to uphold the Episcopalian order by suppressing prohibited Presbyterian assemblies or Conventicles in South-West Scotland. Some of the persecuted Presbyterian civilians took up arms to defend their Conventicles from the dragoons&#x27; attacks in June 1679, and this resulted in the Bothwell Bridge.

In 1681, an additional three troops were raised and added to the existing three to create what became the Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons. In this period, regiments were considered the personal property of their colonel and changed names when transferred. At senior levels in particular, ownership and command were separate functions; &#x27;Colonel&#x27; usually indicated ownership, with operational command generally exercised by a lieutenant colonel.

Charles II&#x27;s commander in Scotland, Lieutenant-General Thomas Dalziel, 1599-1685 was appointed Colonel with Charles Murray, Lord Dunmore as Lt-Colonel. Shortly after James II &amp; VII became King in February 1685, a Scottish revolt known as Argyll&#x27;s Rising broke out in June which was easily crushed: the regiment saw action against Argyll&#x27;s army at Stonedyke near Dumbarton. Dunmore became Colonel of the Regiment himself in 1685. The Lt-Colonel at this time was William Livingston, Viscount Kilsyth.

Scotland grew increasingly restive in the period before the November 1688 Glorious Revolution and the regiment was employed in an ultimately vain attempt to stem the tide of rebellion. It arrived in London shortly before William of Orange landed but saw no fighting and in December, Dunmore was replaced as Colonel by Sir Thomas Livingstone, a Scot who had served William for many years and was related to Kilsyth. Now officially known as Livingstone&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons, after loyally serving the Stuarts&#x27; Episcopalian Scottish government they were now part of the force used by Hugh Mackay to support William&#x27;s new Presbyterian Scottish government and oppose erstwhile comrades who remained loyal to the Stuarts and rebelled against William and his government in the first Scottish Jacobite Rising of 1689-1692. As cavalry, their role was to secure the roads between Inverness and Stirling and so were not present at the Jacobite victory of Killiecrankie in July 1689. In 1692, William III confirmed the regiment&#x27;s designation as &#x27;Royal&#x27; and they were ranked as the 4th Dragoons.

==1693–1714: Grey Horses, Red Coats, and War of Spanish Succession==
When inspected by William III in 1693, it was noted the regiment was mounted on grey horses. One suggestion is these were inherited from the Dutch Horse Guards, who had returned to the Netherlands but this has not been confirmed. The original grey coats were replaced with red, or scarlet, coats with blue facings, proclaiming the Scots Greys &quot;Royal&quot; status.

Transferred to the Netherlands in 1694 during the Nine Years&#x27; War, they were used for reconnaissance duties, but did not see any significant actions during their three years on the continent. Following the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, they were based in Scotland; after the War of the Spanish Succession began, they returned to Flanders in 1702 as part of Marlborough&#x27;s army. They played an active role in the campaigns of 1702 and 1703, including the capture of a large shipment of gold in 1703.

During Marlborough&#x27;s march to the Danube in 1704, the Scots Greys served as part of Ross&#x27;s Dragoon Brigade. Used as dismounted infantry, they took part in the Battle of Schellenberg, then the Battle of Blenheim on 2 July 1704; despite being heavily engaged, they did not have a single fatality, though many were wounded. 
At the Battle of Elixheim in 1705, the Scots Greys participated in the massed cavalry charge which broke through the French lines. At Ramillies in May 1706, as part of Lord Hays&#x27; brigade of dragoons, the regiment captured the colours of the elite Régiment du Roi. 

Renamed the Royal North British Dragoons, their next significant action was the Battle of Oudenarde. At the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709, they captured the standard of the French Household Cavalry; This was their last significant action prior to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. 

Following the 1707 Acts of Union, the English and Scottish military establishments were merged, causing debates over regimental precedence; this was connected to the price of commissions, seniority and pay. The Scots Greys were to be designated the first dragoon regiment and the Royal Scots the first regiment of infantry but having both Scots regiments first led to protests. A compromise was reached, whereby the English dragoon regiment was designated as the first, and the Scots Greys became the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons. This was the origin of the motto &quot;Second to None&quot;.

==1715–1741 Home Service and Jacobites==
Once back in Britain, the Scots Greys returned to Scotland where they helped police the countryside. In 1715, the Earl Mar declared for the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, James Stuart, sparking the Jacobite rising. Remaining loyal to the Anglo-German king, the Scots Greys were active in putting down the uprising. This included taking part at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November 1715. There the Scots Greys, under the Duke of Argyll, were stationed on the right of the Government forces. Also known at that time as Portmore&#x27;s Dragoons, the Scots Greys initially attacked the left flank of the Jacobite army. Advancing around a bog, which the highlanders had thought would protect their flank, the Scots Greys surprised the highlanders, making repeated charges into disordered ranks of the Jacobite infantry. The Scots Greys continue to pursue the shattered left wing of the Jacobite force as it fled for nearly two miles until it was blocked by the river Allan. Unable to fall back, disorganised, they were easy targets for the Scots Greys&#x27; dragoons. It is reported that the Duke of Argyll was said to cry out to &quot;Spare the poor blue bonnets!&quot;. However, little quarter was given by Scots Greys to any group trying to rally that day. The rest of the royal forces were not as successful. The Jacobites managed to rout the left wing of the Royal army, the day ending in a tactical standoff.

Although the fighting was indecisive, the battle had halted the Jacobites&#x27; momentum. For the next four years, the Scots Greys continued to suppress Jacobite supporters in Scotland. With the final end of the First Jacobite rising in 1719, the Scots Greys went back to their traditional role: policing Scotland. The next 23 years passed relatively uneventfully for the regiment.

===War of the Austrian Succession===
During the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession, &#x27;British&#x27; forces served on behalf of Hanover until 1744. The Scots Greys transferred to Flanders in 1742 and garrisoned the area around Ghent. The regiment fought at Dettingen in June 1743, now chiefly remembered as the last time a British monarch commanded troops in battle. An attempt by the Allies to relieve Tournai led to the May 1745 Battle of Fontenoy; this featured a series of bloody frontal assaults by the infantry and the cavalry played little part, with the exception of covering the retreat. 

When the 1745 Rising began in July many British units were recalled to Scotland but the regiment remained in Flanders, fighting at the Battle of Rocoux on 11 October 1746, a French tactical victory. After Culloden, Cumberland and other British units returned to the Low Countries, in preparation for the 1747 campaign. 

The French won another tactical victory at Lauffeld on 2 July, where the Scots Greys took part in Ligonier&#x27;s charge, one of the best known cavalry actions in British military history. This enabled the rest of the army to withdraw but Ligonier was taken prisoner and the Scots Greys lost nearly 40% of their strength. By the time it was back to full strength, the 1748 Peace of Aix-la-Chappelle ended the war and the Scots Greys returned to Britain.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===
The Scots Greys passed the seven years between the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War moving from station to station within Great Britain. The years passed relatively uneventfully for the regiment. The major development during this period was the addition of a light company to the Scots Greys in 1755.

However, soon after the light company was raised, with Britain entering into the Seven Years&#x27; War, it was detached from the Scots Greys and combined with the light companies of other cavalry regiments to form a temporary, separate light battalion. This light battalion would be employed raiding the French coast. One of the most notable raids was the attack on St. Malo from the 5 to 7 June 1758. The raid resulted in the destruction of the shipping at St. Malo.

The balance of the regiment was transferred to Germany, where it joined the army commanded by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. Assigned to the cavalry under the command of Lord George Sackville, the Scots Greys arrived in Germany in 1758. The following year, the Scots Greys took part in the Battle of Bergen on 13 April 1759. There, the forces of Britain, Hanover, Brunswick, and Hesse-Kassel were defeated, leaving the cavalry, including the Scots Greys, to cover the retreat. Because of the rear-guard action by the British cavalry, the army was able to survive to fight again later that year near Minden.

Reeling after the defeat at Bergen, the British army and its allies reformed and engaged in a series of manoeuvres with the French armies. Eventually, the two forces collided on 1 August 1759 at the Battle of Minden. The Scots Greys, still part of Sackville&#x27;s command, were held back due to Sackville&#x27;s delay. Eventually, while Sackville consulted with his superiors, his deputy, on his own initiative, finally ordered the Scots Greys and the rest of the cavalry forward. However, when Sackville returned, he countermanded the order and the cavalry held its place. Once the battle appeared won, with the French retreating, the Scots Greys and the rest of the cavalry pressed the pursuit of the retreating French army.

With Sackville sacked as commander of the British cavalry on the continent and court-martialed for his actions at Minden, the Scots Greys and the rest of the British cavalry came under the command of Marquess of Granby. The following year, 1760, saw the British cavalry more aggressively led at the Battle of Warburg. There, on 31 July 1760, the Scots Greys participated in Granby&#x27;s charge, which broke the French left flank and then defeated the counter-charge of the French cavalry. Three weeks later, the Scots Greys, along with the Inniskilling Dragoons, met with the rearguard of the French forces near the town of Zierenberg. There the dragoons, supported by some British grenadiers, encountered a French cavalry force covering the retreat. Two squadrons of the Scots Greys charged four squadrons of French cavalry. The Scots Greys and Inniskillings routed the French, sending them in a disorderly retreat into the town of Zierenberg. Soon after, infantry was brought up to storm the town; the town and the survivors of the Scots Greys&#x27; attack were captured.

The Scots Greys began the following year by conducting patrols and skirmishing with French troops. Eventually, the Scots Greys were with the main army under Brunswick at the Battle of Villinghausen on 15–16 July 1761.

The start of 1762 found the Scots Greys again raiding and clashing with French cavalry along the Hanoverian frontier. With the war approaching the end, the French decided to make one last concerted effort to overrun Hanover. At the same time, Brunswick, still commanding the Anglo-Hanoverian-Brunswick-Hessian forces in western Germany, wanted to take the initiative once the campaign season arrived. The two forces met at the castle of Wilhelmsthal near Calden. Still attached to Granby&#x27;s command, the Scots Greys were present for the Battle of Wilhelmsthal, on 24 July 1762. As the French centre gave way, the Scots Greys were ordered to exploit the victory. The Scots Greys drove the French forces through the village of Wilhelmsthal, capturing many prisoners and part of the baggage train.

The Battle of Wilhemlstahl was to be the Scots Greys&#x27; last major engagement of the war. The following year, the French and British concluded the Treaty of Paris ending the hostilities, for the moment, between the two. With the end of the fighting, the Scots Greys returned home to Great Britain via the low countries.

==1764–1815==

===Home service and changes===
Between 1764 and 1815, the Scots Greys remained on home service. Unlike many of the other regiments of British cavalry, they did not see any combat during the American Revolutionary War. Also, except for the Flanders Campaign of 1793–94, they saw no other active service during the French Revolutionary or Napoleonic Wars until the Waterloo Campaign of 1815. For most of the 20 years following the Seven Years&#x27; War the Scots Greys remained in Scotland and England.

During this time, however, change was happening to the Scots Greys. Through a series of changes in uniform and equipment, the regiment began to be identified more as cavalry, rather than as mounted infantry. Drummers, an instrument of the infantry, were replaced with trumpeters, as was standard for cavalry regiments, in 1766. Two years later, the Scot Greys traded in their mitre-style grenadier cap for the tall bearskin hat that would remain a part of the regiment&#x27;s uniform until its amalgamation in 1971. During this period, the Scots Greys also underwent an organizational change. Although deemed to be a heavy dragoon unit, each troop of the regiment was reorganised to include a detachment of light dragoons. These light dragoons were mounted on lighter, faster horses than the rest of the regiment. However, this increase in strength was soon lost, as the light troops of Scots Greys and other heavy dragoon regiments of the British Army were combined to form a new regiment, the 21st (Douglas&#x27;s) Light Dragoons, in 1779.

===Campaign in the Low Countries===
With the French Revolution in 1789, and the increasing tensions between Great Britain and Revolutionary France, the Scots Greys were brought up to strength and then expanded with four new troops to nine troops of dragoons, each of 54 men, in 1792 in anticipation of hostilities. Four troops of the Scots Greys were alerted for possible foreign deployment in 1792 and were transported to the continent in 1793 to join the Duke of York&#x27;s army operating in the low countries. The Scots Greys arrived in time to participate in the siege of Valenciennes and then the unsuccessful siege of Dunkirk.

Following the failure of the siege, the Scots Greys were employed as part of the screen for the Duke of York&#x27;s army, skirmishing with French forces. The next significant action for the Scots Greys occurred at Willems 10 May 1794 on the heights near Tournai. There the Scots Greys, brigaded with the Bays and the Inniskillings, charged the advancing French infantry. The French infantry, upon seeing the threat of the cavalry formed into squares. The Scots Greys charged directly into the nearest of the squares. The charge broke the formed infantry square, a remarkable feat. The breaking of the first square demoralised the other French infantry, allowing the Bays and the Inniskillings to break those squares as well. In exchange for 20 casualties, the Greys had helped rout three battalions and capture at least 13 artillery pieces. This would be the last time that British cavalry, alone without artillery support, would break an infantry square until the Battle of Garcia Hernandez in 1812.

Despite the victory before Tournai, the Allied Army would be defeated at the Battle of Tourcoing on 18 May 1794. From then on, the British Army would be retreating in the face of the French Army. During the retreat, the Scots Greys were active in covering the British forces retreat through the low countries and into Hanover. By the spring of 1795, the Army reached Bremen, in Hanover, and was embarked on ships to return to England. The four troops of Scots Greys arrived in England in November 1795, allowing the regiment to be reunited. The ninth troop was disbanded when the regiment was reunited.

Despite their exploits in the low countries, and the fact that Britain would be heavily engaged around the globe fighting Revolutionary and, later, Napoleonic France, the Scots Greys would not see action until 1815.

===Waterloo===

This changed when news of Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba reached Britain. The Scots Greys, which had been reduced in size because of the end of the Peninsular War, were expanded. This time, there would be 10 troops of cavalry, a total of 946 officers and men, the largest the regiment had ever been until that time. Six of the ten troops were sent to the continent, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel James Inglis Hamilton, to join the army forming under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The Scots Greys, upon arrival in Ghent, were brigaded under the command of Major-General Ponsonby in the Union Brigade, with Royal Dragoons and the Inniskillings Dragoons.

The Scots Greys, with the rest of the Union Brigade, missed the Battle of Quatre Bras despite a long day of hard riding. As the French fell back, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade arrived at the end of their 50-mile ride.
On the morning of 18 June 1815, the Scots Greys found themselves in the third line of Wellington&#x27;s army, on the left flank. As the fights around La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont developed, Wellington&#x27;s cavalry commander, the Earl of Uxbridge, held the cavalry back. However, with the French infantry advancing and threatening to break the British centre. Uxbridge ordered the Household Brigade and the Union Brigades to attack the French infantry of D&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Corps. The Scots Greys were initially ordered to remain in reserve as the other two brigades attacked.

As the rest of the British heavy cavalry advanced against the French infantry, just after 1:30 pm, Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton witnessed Pack&#x27;s brigade beginning to crumble, and the 92nd Highlanders falling back in disorder. On his initiative, Hamilton ordered his regiment forward at the walk. Because the ground was broken and uneven, thanks to the mud, crops, and the men of the 92nd, the Scots Greys remained at the walk until they had passed through the Gordons. The arrival of the Scots Greys helped to rally the Gordons, who turned to attack the French. Even without attacking at a full gallop, the weight of the Scots Greys charge proved to be irresistible for the French column pressing Pack&#x27;s Brigade. As Captain Duthilt, who was present with de Marcognet&#x27;s 3rd Division, wrote of the Scots Greys charge:

Just as I was pushing one of our men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly – to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into infantry who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so it is true that once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This is what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.

A lieutenant of the 92nd Highlanders who was present would later write, &quot;the Scots Greys actually walked over this column&quot;.


As the Scots Greys waded through the French column, Sergeant Charles Ewart found himself within sight of the eagle of 45e Régiment de Ligne (45th Regiment of the Line). With a chance to capture the eagle, Ewart fought his way towards it, later recounting:
With the eagle captured, Sergeant Ewart was ordered to take the trophy off, denying the French troops a chance to recapture their battle standard. In recognition of his feat, he was promoted from sergeant to ensign.

Having defeated the French column and captured one of its battle standards, the Scots Greys were now disorganised. Neither Ponsonby nor Hamilton were able to effectively bring their troopers back under control. Rather than being able to reorganise, the Scots Greys continued their advance gaining speed, eventually galloping, and now aimed at Durutte&#x27;s division of infantry. Unlike the disordered column that had been engaged in attacking Pack&#x27;s brigade, some of Durutte&#x27;s men had time to form square to receive the cavalry charge. The volley of musket fire scythed through the Scots Greys&#x27; ragged line as they swept over and round the French infantry, unable to break them. Colonel Hamilton was last seen during the charge, leading a party of Scots Greys, towards the French artillery. However, in turning to receive the Scots Greys&#x27; charge, Durutte&#x27;s infantry exposed themselves to the 1st Royal Dragoons. The Royal Dragoons slashed through them, capturing or routing much of the column.

Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery, dispersing or sabring the gunners. Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys and the rest of the British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the counter-charge of Milhaud&#x27;s cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division.

As Ponsonby tried to rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was attacked by Jaquinot&#x27;s lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French soldier who had captured Ponsonby executed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue. By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud&#x27;s and Jaquinot&#x27;s cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The French artillery added to the Scots Greys&#x27; misery.

The remnants of the Scots Greys retreated to the British lines, harried by French cavalry. They eventually reformed on the left, supporting the rest of the line as best they could with carbine fire. In all, the Scots Greys suffered 104 dead and 97 wounded and lost 228 of the 416 horses. When they were finally reformed, the Scots Greys could only field two weakened squadrons, rather than the three complete ones with which they had begun the day.

Following the victory of Waterloo, the Scots Greys pursued the defeated French Army until Napoleon&#x27;s surrender and final abdication. The Scots Greys would remain on the continent until 1816 as part of the army of occupation under the terms of the peace treaty.

==1816–1856: Years of peace and the Crimean War==
Between 1816 and 1854, the Scots Greys remained in the British Isles. As they had done in the interludes between continental wars, they moved from station to station, sometimes being called upon to support local civilian authorities.

The decades of peaceful home service were broken with the outbreak of war with Russia. Trying to prop up the Ottoman Empire, Britain, France, and Sardinia, mobilised forces to fight in the Black Sea. The allied nations agreed that the target of the expedition would be Sevastopol in the Crimea. Assigned to Brigadier-General Sir James Scarlett&#x27;s Heavy Brigade of the Cavalry Division, the Scots Greys, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Griffith arrived in the Crimea in 1854.
On 25 October 1854, the Heavy Brigade was part of a British force supporting the siege operations around Sevastopol. The British on the right flank of the siege lines were over extended, giving the Russian forces under General Pavel Petrovich Liprandi an opportunity to disrupt the British siege works and possible destroy their supply base at Balaclava. With nearly 25,000 men, including 3,000 cavalry troopers formed in 20 squadrons and 78 artillery pieces, General Liprandi attacked the British positions. To defend its supply base and siege lines, the British could counter with approximately 4,500 men and 26 artillery pieces.

As the Russians attacked, the Scots Greys watched as the redoubts protecting the supply lines and Balaclava were overrun by the Russians. They watched as the Russian force charged the 93rd Highlanders, only to be turned back by the &quot;thin red streak tipped with a line of steel&quot;.

Leading men into battle for the first time ever, Scarlett ordered his brigade to form two columns. The left column contained a squadron of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, followed by the two squadrons of the Scots Greys. As they trotted to the assistance of the Campell&#x27;s Highlanders, Scarlett was informed of additional Russian cavalry threatening his flank. Ordering the brigade to wheel about, the Scots Greys ended up in line with the Inniskilling Dragoons in the front row supported by the 5th Dragoon Guards. Even with the Russian cavalry approaching, Scarlett waited patiently for his dragoons to be brought into formation rather than move in a disorganised formation.

The approaching Russian cavalry was on the heights and numbered about 3,000 sabres. The Scots Greys and the rest of the British dragoons were waiting at the base of the heights, and totalled about 800 men. Satisfied that his brigade was ready, Scarlett finally sounded the advance. Although Scarlett had spent precious minutes ordering his line, it soon proved to be unwieldy, especially in the sector occupied by the Scots Greys, who had to pick their way through the abandoned camp of the Light Brigade. The Scots Greys, once clear of the Light Brigade&#x27;s camp, had to speed up to catch Scarlett and his aides, who were more than 50 yards ahead of them. For some reason, the Russian cavalry commander chose to halt up slope of the Heavy Brigade, choosing to receive the charge at a halt.
Scarlett and his command group, two aides and a trumpeter, were the first to reach the Russian cavalry. The rest of the brigade followed closely. As they neared the Russian line, they started to take carbine fire, which killed the Scots Greys&#x27; commander and took the hat off of its executive officer. The Scots Greys finally came abreast of the Inniskillings just short of the Russians and the two regiments finally were able to gallop. As the Inniskillings shouted their battle cry, &quot;Faugh A Ballagh&quot;, observers reported that the Scots Greys made an eerie, growling moan. The Scots Greys charged through the Russian cavalry, along with the Inniskilings, and disappeared into the melee among the mass of Russian cavalry. With both forces disordered by the charge, it became clear to the regimental adjutant of the Scots Greys that, to avoid being overwhelmed by Russian numbers, the Scots Greys had to reform. Pushed back from the centre of the mass, the Scots Greys reformed around the adjutant and drove again into the Russian cavalry. Seeing that the Scots Greys were again cut off, the Royal Dragoons, finally arriving to the fight after disobeying Scarlett&#x27;s order to remain with the Light Brigade, charged to their assistance, helping to push the Russians back. Amid the hacking and slashing of the sabre battle, the Russian cavalry had had enough, and retreated back up the hill, pursued for a short time by the Scots Greys and the rest of the regiments.

The entire encounter lasted approximately 10 minutes, starting at 9:15 and ending by 9:30 am. In that time, in exchange for 78 total casualties, the Heavy Brigade inflicted 270 casualties on the Russian cavalry, including Major-General Khaletski. More importantly, the Scots Greys helped rout a Russian cavalry division, ending the threat to Campbell&#x27;s Highlanders, and with it the threat to the British supply base. With the rest of the Heavy Brigade, the Scots Greys could only look on as Lord Cardigan lead the Light Brigade on their ill-fated charge. As the Scots Greys returned to the British lines, they passed Colonel Campbell and the 93rd Highlanders. Campbell called out to the Scots Greys, &quot;Greys, gallant Greys, I am sixty-one years of age, but were I young again, I should be proud to serve in your ranks.&quot; Not only did Campbell recognise their achievement, so did the Crown. Two members of the Scots Greys, Regimental Sergeant Major John Grieve and Private Henry Ramage, were among the first to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on 25 October. For the rest of the war, the Heavy Cavalry, including the Scots Greys, had little to do.

==1857–1905: Home service, Egypt, and the 2nd Anglo-Boer War==

By 1857, the regiment was back in Britain, returning to its peacetime duties in England, Scotland and Ireland for the next fifty years of service without a shot being heard in anger. After years of being known as the Scots Greys, though official designated as the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons, their nickname was made official. In 1877, the regiment was retitled as 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys).

Although individual members of the regiment on secondment to other units may have seen action, the regiment as a whole did not see active service until the start of the Anglo-Boer War. The largest detachment of the Scots Greys to see action were the two officers and 44 men who were sent to join the Heavy Camel Regiment during the expedition to relieve Gordon at Khartoum. They saw action at the Battle of Abu Klea, where they suffered thirteen killed in action, and another three who died of disease.

In 1899, the regiment&#x27;s years of peace ended with the start of the Second Anglo-Boer War. That year, the Scots Greys, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel W.P. Alexander, were ordered to Cape Town to join the Cavalry Division being formed. In the years since Balaclava, much had changed about warfare. Gone were the red coats and bearskin shakos. The Scots Greys would now fight wearing khaki. In fact, with the popularity of wearing khaki that accompanied the start of the Boer War, the Scots Greys went so far as to dye their grey mounts khaki to help them blend in with the veldt.

The regiment arrived in the Cape Colony in December 1899 and was put to work guarding the British lines of communication between the Orange and Modder rivers. When Lord Roberts was prepared to begin his advance, the Scots Greys were attached to the 1st Cavalry Brigade under Brigadier General Porter. While serving under Porter, the Scots Greys were reinforced by two squadrons of Australian horsemen.

Once Roberts&#x27; offensive began, the Scots Greys took part in the relief of Kimberly. With Kimberly relieved, the Scots Greys were engaged in the fighting during the advance to Bloemfontein and later Pretoria, including the Battle of Diamond Hill.

Following the capture of Pretoria, the Scots Greys were sent to liberate British prisoners. The POW&#x27;s being held at Waterval POW camp, the same one where those captured in the Jameson Raid had been held. As the Scots Greys approached, prisoner lookouts at the camp spotted the dragoons when they moved through Onderstepoort. As word spread through the camp, the British prisoners over-powered the guards, mostly men either too old or too young to be out on commando, pushed their way out of confinement to meet with the Scots Greys. Although the camp guards were easily overcome, and most likely unknown to the British forces and prisoners, Koos de la Rey and his men were positioned to try and prevent the rescue of the British prisoners. De la Rey ordered warning shells fired, trying to keep the prisoners in their prison camp. Faced with the approaching Scots Greys and the prisoners, De la Rey opted to not do more and instead ordered a retreat rather than fight a battle over the prison camp.

The fall of Pretoria was also the end of the second phase of the war. With the end of formal fighting, and the start of third phase of the Boer War, the guerrilla campaign by the Boers, the Scots Greys were on the move constantly.
Among the detachments was a squadron was left at Uitval (also known as Silkaatsnek) under the command of Major H. J. Scobell. There they were eventually joined by five companies from the 2nd battalion, the Lincolnshire Regiment, with a section of guns from O Battery, RHA. While Scobell had kept a strong picket line to watch for Boer commandos, this was changed when he was superseded as the commander of the garrison and the Scots Greys came under the command of an infantry colonel. This decrease in pickets allowed a force of Boer commandos to attack the outpost on 10 July 1900. Most of the squadron was captured during the disaster that ensued. The defeat allowed the Boers to hold Silkaatsnek.

Following the disaster at Silkaatsnek, the Scots Greys were concentrated and returned to operating with the 1st Cavalry Brigade. From February to April 1901, the Scots Greys and 6th Dragoon Guards were sent on a sweep from Pretoria to east of Transvaal. In the process, they captured or destroyed large amounts of Boer war stocks, including nearly all of the remaining artillery. Following that success, the Scots Greys and 6th Dragoon Guards were sent to sweep the guerrillas from the valley of the Vaal and into the Western Transvaal. There, they received word of the defeat of Benson&#x27;s column at Battle of Bakenlaagte on 30 October 1901. Reinforced by the 18th Hussars, 19th Hussars, and a detachment of mounted Australians, the reinforced brigade chased after the Boers, killing a number of those who had participated in the fighting at Bakenlaagte.

The Scots Greys would continue fighting to suppress the guerrilla campaign. The most notable capture made by the regiment was that of Commandant Danie Malan. Eventually, the last of the &quot;bitter enders&quot; in the Boer camp agreed to peace, with the formal end of the conflict happening on 31 May 1902. The Scots Greys remained for three more years, helping to garrison the colony, operating out of Stellenbosch, before returning home to Britain in 1905.

==The Great War==

During the inter-war years, the Scots Greys were re-equipped and reorganised based on the experience of Boer War. Lee–Enfield rifles and new swords were introduced as the British Army debated what the role of cavalry would be in the coming war. In 1914, the Scots Greys were organised as a regiment of three squadrons. Each squadron was made up of four troops with 33 men each. When war did come, in August 1914, the Scots Greys were assigned to the 5th Cavalry Brigade commanded by Brigadier P.W. Chetwode.

Initially, the 5th Cavalry Brigade operated as an independent unit under control of the BEF. However, on 6 September 1914, it was assigned to Brigadier-General Gough&#x27;s command. When Gough&#x27;s independent command was expanded to a division, the formation was redesignated as the 2nd Cavalry Division. The Scots Greys and the other cavalry regiments of the 5th Brigade would remain with the 2nd Cavalry Division for the rest of the war.

===1914: Mons, the Retreat, the Marne, the Aisne===

The regiment landed in France on 17 August 1914. Soon after arriving in France, staff of the BEF issued a directive ordering the Scots Greys to dye their horses. The reason was partly because the grey mounts made conspicuous targets, but was also partly based on the fact that the all grey mounts made the regiment distinctive and therefore easier to identify. For the rest of the war, the grey horses of the regiment would be dyed a dark chestnut.

First contact with the German army came on 22 August 1914 near Mons. The Scots Greys, fighting dismounted, drove off a detachment from the German 13th Division. The German infantry reported that they fell back because they had encountered a brigade. As it became apparent that the B.E.F. could not hold the position against the German onslaught, the Scots Greys became part of the rear guard, protecting the retreating I Corps. In the aftermath of the Battle of Le Cateau, the Scots Greys, with the rest of the 5th Cavalry Brigade, helped to temporarily check the German pursuit at Cerizy, on 28 August 1914.

Once the B.E.F. was able to reorganise and take part in the Battle of the Marne, in September 1914, the Scots Greys shifted from covering the retreat to screening the advance. Eventually, the advance of the B.E.F. halted at the Battle of Aisne, where British and German forces fought to standstill just short of the Chemin des Dames.

===1914: Race to the sea and First Ypres===
After being pulled from the trenches at the Aisne, the Scots Greys were sent north to Belgium as part of the lead elements as the British and Germans raced towards the sea, each trying to outflank the other. With the cavalry reinforced to Corps strength, the Scots Greys and the rest of the 5th Cavalry Brigade were transferred to the newly formed 2nd Cavalry Division.

As the front became more static, and the need for riflemen on the front line more pressing, the Scots Greys found themselves being used almost exclusively as infantry through the Battles of Messines and Ypres. The regiment was almost continuously engaged from the start of the First Battle of Ypres until its end.

===1915–1916: Trench warfare===

The Scots Greys rotated back into the trenches in 1915. Due to the shortage of infantry, the regiment continued to fill the gaps in the line, fighting in a dismounted role. The regiment remained on line for all but seven days of the Second Battle of Ypres. The losses in that battle would force the Scots Greys into reserve for the rest of the year. According to a report in Scottish newspapers of the time it was decided to paint the horses khaki as their grey coats were too visible to German gunners. This gave rise to a comic poem printed at the time, of which this is the first verse:
&lt;poem&gt;
O wae is me my hert is sair, tho but a horse am I.
My Scottish pride is wounded and among the dust maun lie.
I used to be a braw Scots grey but now I&#x27;m khaki clad.
My auld grey coat has disappeared, the thocht o&#x27;t makes me sad.
&lt;/poem&gt;
By January 1916, the Scots Greys were back in action, albeit in a piecemeal fashion. With the Kitchener Armies still not fully ready, men were still needed for the front. Like the other cavalry regiments, the Scots Greys contributed a troop to the front. In two months of action, this line troop was active in raids and countering raids by the German army.

With the arrival of the Kitchener Armies, the Scots Greys were concentrated again in preparation of the forthcoming summer offensive. The 2nd Cavalry Division became the reserve for General Plumer&#x27;s Second Army. Mounted, the Scots Greys were held in readiness to exploit a breakthrough that never came during the Battle of the Somme.

As the war continued, it became apparent that more mobile firepower was needed at all levels of the British Army. Accordingly, the Scots Greys were expanded to include a machine gun squadron.

===1917: Arras and Cambrai===
As the war progressed, British generals still hoped to use the Scots Greys and other cavalry regiments in their traditional roles. The Battle of Arras would demonstrate the futility of that hope.

Beginning in April, the Scots Greys were engaged in action around the town of Wancourt. In three days of fighting, in an action that would become known as the First Battle of the Scarpe, the regiment suffered heavy casualties among its men and horses. After a short period to refit, the Greys drew the assignment of raiding the German positions at Guillermont Farm. The raid succeeded, with the Scots Greys killing 56 and capturing 14 with negligible loss to themselves.

In November 1917, the Scots Greys saw a glimpse of their future when they moved to support the armoured attack at the Battle of Cambrai. Initially intended to be part of the exploitation force, as at the Battle of the Somme, the plan failed to develop the type of break through which could be exploited by the cavalry. As the fighting bogged down, the Scots Greys once again found themselves fighting on foot in an infantry role. Part of the reason that the Scots Greys were unable to advance as cavalry was because the bridge that was crucial to the advance was accidentally destroyed when the tank crossing it proved to be too heavy. Unable to advance mounted, the Scots Greys were committed as infantry to the battle.

===1918: St. Quentin, retreat, 100 Days===

After the winding down of the battles of 1917, the Scots Greys found themselves near the St. Quentin canal. There, they witnessed the German offensive forcing their way across the canal. Although the Scots Greys held their positions, they were soon in danger of being flanked. After almost three years of static warfare, the rapidity of the German advance caught the regiment flat flooted as the German attacks penetrated the Scots Greys position. In the confusion of the retreat, detachments of the Scots Greys became lost and ended up serving with other regiments of the 5th Cavalry Brigade, fighting rearguard actions as the B.E.F. retreated. Once the Michael Offensive began to grind down in April, the Scots Greys, along with the other cavalry regiments, were able to be withdrawn from the line to refit and reorganise.
Between May and June 1918, the Scots Greys were held in reserve. However, in August, the Scots Greys was brought forward for the Battle of Amiens. Still part of the 2nd Cavalry Division, the Scots Greys moved in support of the Canadian Corps&#x27; attack on Roye.

With the victory at Amiens, the B.E.F. began its long-awaited final offensive. During this first month of the offensive, August to September 1918, the Scots Greys rarely operated as a unit. Instead, detachments of the Scots Greys were engaged in a variety of traditional cavalry duties. This included scouting, liaison duties and patrolling. As the B.E.F. approached the Sambre river, the Scots Greys were used to probe the available river crossings. However, just as they did, many dragoons of the Scots Greys began to fall ill from influenza. Within a few days, due almost solely to the influenza outbreak, the regiment could muster only one composite company of men healthy enough to fight.

At the time of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were at Avesnes. To enforce the terms of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were ordered to cross into Germany, arriving there on 1 December 1918. However, although they would be here to police the terms of the armistice until a final treaty could be completed, they were almost immediately dismounted. By the beginning of 1919, the Scots Greys were reduced to 7 officers and 126 other ranks. This was approximately the size of one of its pre-war squadrons. After almost five years of service on the continent, the Scots Greys returned home to Britain on 21 March 1919 via Southampton.

===1919–1939: Inter-war years===
For the next year, the Scots Greys remained in Britain. While there, the regiment was once again renamed. This time they were designated the &quot;Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons)&quot;. Although tanks had been introduced during the First World War, many senior officers believed that the horse still had a place on the battlefield. Consequently, the Scots Greys retained their horses when they were sent on to their first peacetime deployment &quot;East of Suez&quot;. In 1922, the Scots Greys arrived in India, where they would serve for the next six years.

Upon returning to Great Britain, the Scots Greys found themselves subject to the problems that the rest of the British Army were going through in that era. In 1933, the regiment took part in a recruiting drive by conducting a march through Scotland, including a three-day traverse of the Cairngorm Mountains to get better publicity. Although budgets were lean, the Scots Greys, like other British cavalry regiments, were finally re-equipped. Each troop would now contain an automatic weapons section.

Still mounted on horses, the Scots Greys received orders for Palestine in October 1938. There they took part in suppressing the later stages of Arab Revolt. Much of the time, the Scots Greys were engaged in keeping the peace between the Jewish settlers and the Arabs.

==Second World War==

===1939–1941: Palestine and Syria===
Still stationed in Palestine, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel H. N. Todd, the Scots Greys were brought up to war strength following the declaration of war against Germany. Although the German blitzkrieg attacks in Poland, France and the Low Countries demonstrated that the tank was now the dominant weapon, the Scots Greys continued to be equipped with horses.

As the B.E.F. fought in France in 1940, the Scots Greys were retained in the Middle East to police the Mandate. In fact the last mounted cavalry charge on horseback by the Scots Greys occurred in February 1940, when the regiment was called to quell Arab rioters.

At first, the Scots Greys were transformed into a motorised regiment, using wheeled vehicles. Elements of the Scots Greys and Staffordshire Yeomanry formed a composite cavalry regiment assigned to reinforce the divisional cavalry element for Operation Exporter, the invasion of Vichy-held Syria and Lebanon. The remainder of the regiment remained in Palestine, operating in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The composite Grey-Stafford regiment took part in most of the battles of the campaign, including the Battle of Kissoué, where it held off a counter-attack by Vichy French armour.

A final review of the Scots Greys as a cavalry regiment occurred at Nablus in the Palestine mandate once the campaign in Syria and Lebanon was complete. Soon after this final review, the horses were traded in and then they who had spent their lives as dragoons were retrained to act as drivers, loaders, and gunners for tanks. Now designated as an armoured regiment, they received their first tanks in September 1941. Initially, the Scots Greys trained on the Stuart tank.

===1942–1943: Egypt, Libya, Tunisia===
With the conversion to armour complete, the Scots Greys were transferred to the Eighth Army. Once in Egypt, their new Stuart tanks were immediately withdrawn and the regiment spent time near Cairo learning to operate the Grant.

Although combat ready, the Scots Greys did not participate in the fighting around Tobruk in the late spring and summer of 1942. Because so many other armoured units were mauled in the fighting, the Scots Greys had to turn over their tanks to other units. In July 1942, the Scots Greys finally were committed to the fighting, equipped with a mixture of Grant and Stuart tanks. Unlike most tank units in the Eighth Army, which were either predominantly fielding heavy/medium tanks or light tanks, the Scots Greys field 24 Grants and 21 Stuarts. Temporarily attached to the 22nd Armoured Brigade, the Scots Greys were placed with majority of the British heavy armour. Initially held in reserve on Ruweisat Ridge, the Scots Greys conducted a successful counter-attack against the German forces to plug a hole that had been created by the German attack. Attacking as though still a mounted regiment, the Scots Greys fought the Panzer IV&#x27;s of the 21st Panzer Division, eventually driving them back.

A month later, the Scots Greys were in action again at the Second Battle of El Alamein. Now attached to the 22nd Armoured Brigade, part of the 7th Armoured Division. As part of the 4th Armoured Brigade, the Scots Greys took part in the diversionary attack which pinned the 21st Panzer Division and Ariete Division in place while other elements of the Eighth Army executed the main attack to the north. the way through the minefields. Once the break-out began, with Operation Supercharge, the Scots Greys, now back with the 4th Armoured Brigade, which was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division, began attempted break-out. In the course of their advance, the Scots Greys participated in the annihilation of the Ariete Division on 4 November 1942. At Fuka, the Scots Greys found the division&#x27;s artillery. Charging forward as if still mounted on horses, the Scots Greys captured eleven artillery pieces and approximately 300 prisoners in exchange for one Stuart put out of action.

The Scots Greys continued their pursuit of the Panzer Army Africa for the next month and a half. The main problem for the regiment faced as it chased after Rommel&#x27;s retreating army was the condition of its tanks. Some tanks were repairable, others had to be replaced from whatever was available. By the end of the month, the Scots Greys were fielding 6 Grant, 17 Sherman, and 21 Stuart tanks. Beginning in the second week of December, the Eighth Army became engaged in what would develop into the Battle of El Agheila. On 15 December 1942, the Scots Greys became engaged in tank battle with elements of the 15th Panzer Division near the village of Nofilia. Due to breakdowns and losses along the way, the Scots Greys were reduced to 5 Grants and 10 Shermans. Leading the 4th Armour Brigade&#x27;s advance, the Scots Greys entered the village, over-running the infantry defenders, capturing 250 men of the 115 Panzergrenadier Regiment. Just as it was completing the capture of the prisoners, the Scots Greys encountered approximately 30 panzers of the 15th Panzer Division. The tank engagement was inconclusive, with each side losing 4 tanks, although the Scots Greys were able to recover 2 of their damaged tanks. The Germans withdrew as the 2nd New Zealand Division moved to the south, outflanking the 15th Panzer Division.

As the pursuit continued, the Scots Greys saw little in the way of tank versus tank action while Rommel&#x27;s army retreated into Tunisia. By January 1943, the decision was made to withdraw the Scots Greys from the front to refit the regiment.

===1943: Italy===
The Royal Scots Greys were re-equipped as an all-Sherman regiment, with Sherman II tanks. The regiment continued to refit through the short Sicilian campaign, not seeing action until it was part of the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche), part of the Italian Campaign, in September 1943. The regiment was assigned to 23rd Armoured Brigade, alongside 40th and 46th RTR. The 23rd was an independent brigade reporting directly to British X Corps, which was itself under command of the U.S. Fifth Army.

Soon after landing, the Royal Scots Greys were in action against the German forces during the advance to Naples. Although the regiment was part of the 23rd Armoured Brigade, the regiment&#x27;s three squadrons were split up to provide armour support for the three brigades (167th, 169th and 201st Guards) of the 56th (London) Infantry Division, nicknamed &quot;The Black Cats&quot;. Landing with the Black Cats of the 56th Division, the Scots Greys were instrumental in defeating the counter-attacks of Sixteenth Panzer Division. Finally, on 16 September, the Scots Greys were committed to the fight as a regiment, helping to stop, and then drive back, the Twenty-Sixth Panzer Division, allowing X Corps to advance out of the beachhead. The regiment would continue to participate in the Allied drive north, until it was brought to a halt at the Garigliano River. In January 1944, the regiment turned over its tanks to other units needing replacements and was transferred back to England. Just before the regiment sailed, they were transferred back to the 4th Armoured Brigade.

===1944–1945: North-West Europe===
The regiment spent the first half of the year refitting and training in preparation for the invasion of Europe. On 7 June 1944, the first three tanks of the regiment landed on Juno Beach. As part of the Battle of Caen, the Scots Greys took part in the fighting for Hill 112. During the fighting for Hill 112, the Scots Greys came to realise disparity between the Sherman II&#x27;s and the latest German armour, including the new Panthers. In one incident, a 75mm equipped Sherman of the Scots Greys hit a Panther at 800 yards four times. All four rounds impacted harmlessly on the Panther&#x27;s frontal armour.

Once the breakthrough was achieved, the Scots Greys took part in the pursuit of the retreating German forces. The Scots Greys saw action at the Falaise pocket, the crossing of the Seine, and was one of the first regiments to cross the Somme River at the beginning of September 1944. After crossing the Somme, the Scots Greys, along with the rest of the 4th Armoured Brigade, moved north into Belgium, near Oudenarde.

In mid September, the Scots Greys took part in the Operation Market-Garden, in particular the fighting around Eindhoven where the 101st Airborne landed to capture the bridges. The Scots Greys would operate in the Low Countries for the rest of the year. The regiment saw action in operations helping to capture Nijmegen Island, and the area west of the Maas. The regiment also helped to capture the Wilhelmina Canal and clear German resistance along the Lower Rhine to secure the allied flank for the eventual drive into Germany.

After nearly six months of fighting in the low countries, the Scots Greys entered Germany as part of Montgomery&#x27;s Operation Plunder offensive. On 26 February, the Scots Greys crossed into Germany. Little more than a month later, the regiment was involved in the capture of Bremen. On 3 April 1945, the Scots Greys came under the command of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, forming up in Neuenkirchen.  On 5 April, the regiment supported the hard-fought breakout of the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, as they crossed the Dortmund-Ems Canal and went on to capture the district of Drierwalde.  They continued to support the 52nd Division as they made their way across Germany towards Bremen, securing Hopsten, Recke, Voltage, Alfhausen, Bersenbrück, and Holdorf along the way.

With Germany crumbling, Allied commanders began to become concerned with how far the Red Army was advancing into Western and Central Europe. To prevent possible post-war claims over Denmark, the Scots Greys and 6th Airborne Division were tasked with the job of extending eastwards past Lübeck. Despite having been in action for three months, the Scots Greys covered in eight hours to capture the city of Wismar on 1 May 1945. The regiment captured the town just hours before meeting up with the Red Army.

The final surrender by the surviving Nazi officials on 5 May 1945 marked the end of the war for the Scots Greys. With no further fighting in the regiment&#x27;s near future, the Scots Greys immediately began collecting horses to establish a regimental riding school at Wismar.

==1946–1971: Post-War and Amalgamation==
After the final surrender of Japan, the Scots Greys shifted to garrison duty. From 1945 until 1952, the regiment remained in the British sector of Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), garrisoned at Osnabrück as part of 20th Armoured Brigade. In 1952, the regiment deployed to Libya, joining the 25th Armoured Brigade. The regiment returned to home service in 1955, rotating through barracks in Britain and Ireland before returning to Germany 1958 to rejoin the BAOR.

In 1962, the Scots Greys were on the move again, this time deploying to help with the Aden Emergency. The regiment remained in Aden until 1963, helping to guard the border with Yemen. After a year in the Middle East, the Scots Greys returned to Germany, where they would remain until 1969.

In 1969, the Scots Greys returned home to Scotland for the last time as an independent unit. As part of the reductions started by the 1957 Defence White Paper, the Royal Scots Greys were scheduled to be amalgamated with the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Dragoon Guards). The amalgamation took place on 2 July 1971 at Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh. The amalgamated formation was christened The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys).

==Regimental traditions==

===Regimental museum===
The regimental collection is held by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum which is based in Edinburgh Castle.

===Scots Greys band===

Unique among British cavalry regiments was that the Scots Greys fielded bagpipers. These bagpipers were initially formed by and paid for by the regiment because they were not authorised pipers on strength. At various times throughout the history of the regiment, there were pipers in the regiment, but these were unofficial. While stationed in India in the 1920s, the regiment fielded its first mounted pipers. At the end of the Second World War, the British Army was contracting from its wartime strength. Despite the contraction of some Scottish Territorial and Yeomanary units, some of the personnel were retained by the army and sent to various other units. As part of this, the Scots Greys received a small pipe band from one of these demobilised units. King George VI took a particular interest in the Scots Greys&#x27; pipe band. His interest was so great that he took part in the design of the band&#x27;s uniform, awarding them the right to wear the Royal Stuart tartan.

The Scots Greys band over the years has acquired a few of its own traditions, which were specific to the band as opposed to the rest of the regiment. While the full dress of the rest of regiment required the wearing of a black bearskin headdress, the kettle drummers wore white bearskins. The tradition of the white bearskins is believed to have originated in 1887 ahead of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. A common myth is that the adoption of white bearskin caps comes from Tsar Nicolas II, who was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment on his coronation in 1894, however pictures exist of the white bearskin caps being in use prior to this in addition to being disputed by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, who maintain the traditions of their antecedent regiments. A tradition developed within the regiment of the Scots Greys band playing the Russian national anthem in the regiment&#x27;s officers mess, in honour of Tsar Nicholas II.

In addition to distinctive uniforms, the Scots Greys band was also entitled to certain other prerogatives. These included flying the sovereign&#x27;s personal pipe banner, carried by the pipe major when the sovereign was present.

An album called &quot;Last of The Greys&quot; by the Royal Scots Greys regimental band was released in 1972 – from which the track &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; went, astonishingly, to top of the &quot;Top 40&quot; charts on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK, the recording went to number one. The successor formations to the Scots Greys continue to release albums today.

===Nicknames===
Up until at least the Second World War, &quot;The Greys&quot; also had a popular, if somewhat derogatory, nickname of &quot;The Bird Catchers&quot;, derived from their cap badge and the capture of the Eagle at Waterloo. Another nickname of the regiment was the &quot;Bubbly Jocks&quot;, a Scots term meaning &quot;turkey cock&quot;.

===Anniversaries and the loyal toast===
Most regiments of the British Army have regimental anniversaries, usually commemorating a battle which the regiment distinguished itself. In the Scots Greys, the regiment annual commemorated its participation in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.

The Scots Greys, along with certain other regiments of the British Army, handled the loyal toast differently. Since the Glorious Revolution, officers were required to toast the health of the reigning sovereign. Typically, this meant standing and giving a toast to the monarch. The Scots Greys, however, did not stand for the toast. It is said that this tradition of giving the loyal toast while seated started during the reign of George III. During his reign, George III would often dine with the regiment; however, because of his health, he was unable to stand during the toasts. Since he could not, he allowed the officers to remain seated during the loyal toasts.

===Motto===
The Scots Greys had the motto &quot;Second to none&quot;. It referred to their seniority in the British Army and their fighting prowess. Their official motto, however, was that of the Order of the Thistle; &quot;Nemo Me Impune Lacessit&quot; (No one provokes me with impunity).

===Uniform===
Although the same basic uniform was worn by the heavy cavalry of the British Army at any given period, for centuries each regiment had its own distinctions and variations. The Scots Greys were no different. The most noticeable difference in the uniform of the Scots Greys was that the regimental full dress worn as general issue until 1914 included a bearskin cap. They were the only British heavy cavalry regiment to wear this fur headdress. Prior to receiving the bearskin, they were also unique among British cavalry regiments in wearing the mitre cap (sometimes referred to as a grenadier cap) instead of the cocked hat or tricorn worn by the rest of the British cavalry during the eighteenth century. The mitre cap dates back to the reign of Queen Anne, who awarded them this distinction after the Battle of Ramillies in 1706. An early form of the bearskin was adopted in 1768.

Other regimental dress distinctions of the Scots Greys included a black and white zigzag &quot;Vandyk&quot; band on the No. 1 dress peaked caps of the regiment, metal insignia representing the White Horse of Hanover worn at the back of the bearskin, and the silver eagle badge worn to commemorate the capture of the French standard at Waterloo.

<text>In physics and engineering, the quality factor or factor is a dimensionless parameter that describes how underdamped an oscillator or resonator is. It is defined as the ratio of the initial energy stored in the resonator to the energy lost in one radian of the cycle of oscillation. factor is alternatively defined as the ratio of a resonator&#x27;s centre frequency to its bandwidth when subject to an oscillating driving force. These two definitions give numerically similar, but not identical, results. Higher indicates a lower rate of energy loss and the oscillations die out more slowly. A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high , while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low one. Resonators with high quality factors have low damping, so that they ring or vibrate longer.

==Explanation==
The factor is a parameter that describes the resonance behavior of an underdamped harmonic oscillator (resonator). Sinusoidally driven resonators having higher factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around that frequency for which they resonate; the range of frequencies for which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high- tuned circuit in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have more selectivity; it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High- oscillators oscillate with a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable.

The quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system, depending on their construction. Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from slamming shut) have near . Clocks, lasers, and other resonating systems that need either strong resonance or high frequency stability have high quality factors. Tuning forks have quality factors around 1000. The quality factor of atomic clocks, superconducting RF cavities used in accelerators, and some high- lasers can reach as high as 1011 and higher.

There are many alternative quantities used by physicists and engineers to describe how damped an oscillator is. Important examples include: the damping ratio, relative bandwidth, linewidth and bandwidth measured in octaves.

The concept of originated with K. S. Johnson of Western Electric Company&#x27;s Engineering Department while evaluating the quality of coils (inductors). His choice of the symbol was only because, at the time, all other letters of the alphabet were taken. The term was not intended as an abbreviation for &quot;quality&quot; or &quot;quality factor&quot;, although these terms have grown to be associated with it.

== Definition ==

The definition of since its first use in 1914 has been generalized to apply to coils and condensers, resonant circuits, resonant devices, resonant transmission lines, cavity resonators, and has expanded beyond the electronics field to apply to dynamical systems in general: mechanical and acoustic resonators, material and quantum systems such as spectral lines and particle resonances. 

=== Bandwidth definition ===
In the context of resonators, there are two common definitions for , which are not exactly equivalent. They become approximately equivalent as becomes larger, meaning the resonator becomes less damped. One of these definitions is the frequency-to-bandwidth ratio of the resonator:

formula_1

where is the resonant frequency is the resonance width or full width at half maximum (FWHM) i.e. the bandwidth over which the power of vibration is greater than half the power at the resonant frequency, is the angular resonant frequency, and is the angular half-power bandwidth.

Under this definition, is the reciprocal of fractional bandwidth.

=== Stored energy definition ===
The other common nearly equivalent definition for is the ratio of the energy stored in the oscillating resonator to the energy dissipated per cycle by damping processes:

formula_2

The factor makes expressible in simpler terms, involving only the coefficients of the second-order differential equation describing most resonant systems, electrical or mechanical. In electrical systems, the stored energy is the sum of energies stored in lossless inductors and capacitors; the lost energy is the sum of the energies dissipated in resistors per cycle. In mechanical systems, the stored energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies at some point in time; the lost energy is the work done by an external force, per cycle, to maintain amplitude.

More generally and in the context of reactive component specification (especially inductors), the frequency-dependent definition of is used:

formula_3

where is the angular frequency at which the stored energy and power loss are measured. This definition is consistent with its usage in describing circuits with a single reactive element (capacitor or inductor), where it can be shown to be equal to the ratio of reactive power to real power. (&quot;See&quot; Individual reactive components.)

== factor and damping ==
The factor determines the qualitative behavior of simple damped oscillators. (For mathematical details about these systems and their behavior see harmonic oscillator and linear time invariant (LTI) system.)

* A system with low quality factor () is said to be overdamped. Such a system doesn&#x27;t oscillate at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system&#x27;s response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system&#x27;s output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.
* A system with high quality factor () is said to be underdamped. Underdamped systems combine oscillation at a specific frequency with a decay of the amplitude of the signal. Underdamped systems with a low quality factor (a little above ) may oscillate only once or a few times before dying out. As the quality factor increases, the relative amount of damping decreases. A high-quality bell rings with a single pure tone for a very long time after being struck. A purely oscillatory system, such as a bell that rings forever, has an infinite quality factor. More generally, the output of a second-order low-pass filter with a very high quality factor responds to a step input by quickly rising above, oscillating around, and eventually converging to a steady-state value.
* A system with an intermediate quality factor () is said to be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.

In negative feedback systems, the dominant closed-loop response is often well-modeled by a second-order system. The phase margin of the open-loop system sets the quality factor of the closed-loop system; as the phase margin decreases, the approximate second-order closed-loop system is made more oscillatory (i.e., has a higher quality factor).

=== Some examples ===
{\delta} \frac{1 - m^2}{v^2_{m,p}},&lt;/math&gt;
where is the cavity wall radius, is the skin depth of the cavity wall, is the eigenvalue scalar ( is the azimuth index, is the radial index; in this application, skin depth is &lt;/math&gt;)}}
| In medical ultrasonography, a transducer with a high -factor is suitable for doppler ultrasonography because of its long ring-down time, where it can measure the velocities of blood flow. Meanwhile, a transducer with a low -factor has a short ring-down time and is suitable for organ imaging because it can receive a broad range of reflected echoes from bodily organs.

== Physical interpretation ==

Physically speaking, is approximately the ratio of the stored energy to the energy dissipated over one radian of the oscillation; or nearly equivalently, at high enough values, 2 times the ratio of the total energy stored and the energy lost in a single cycle.

It is a dimensionless parameter that compares the exponential time constant for decay of an oscillating physical system&#x27;s amplitude to its oscillation period. Equivalently, it compares the frequency at which a system oscillates to the rate at which it dissipates its energy. More precisely, the frequency and period used should be based on the system&#x27;s natural frequency, which at low values is somewhat higher than the oscillation frequency as measured by zero crossings.

Equivalently (for large values of ), the factor is approximately the number of oscillations required for a freely oscillating system&#x27;s energy to fall off to , or about or 0.2%, of its original energy. This means the amplitude falls off to approximately or 4% of its original amplitude.

The width (bandwidth) of the resonance is given by (approximately):
formula_4
where is the natural frequency, and , the bandwidth, is the width of the range of frequencies for which the energy is at least half its peak value.

The resonant frequency is often expressed in natural units (radians per second), rather than using the in hertz, as
formula_5

The factors , damping ratio , natural frequency , attenuation rate , and exponential time constant are related such that:

formula_6

and the damping ratio can be expressed as:

formula_7

The envelope of oscillation decays proportional to or , where and can be expressed as:

formula_8
and
formula_9

The energy of oscillation, or the power dissipation, decays twice as fast, that is, as the square of the amplitude, as or .

For a two-pole lowpass filter, the transfer function of the filter is

formula_10

For this system, when (i.e., when the system is underdamped), it has two complex conjugate poles that each have a real part of . That is, the attenuation parameter represents the rate of exponential decay of the oscillations (that is, of the output after an impulse) into the system. A higher quality factor implies a lower attenuation rate, and so high- systems oscillate for many cycles. For example, high-quality bells have an approximately pure sinusoidal tone for a long time after being struck by a hammer.

== Electrical systems ==

For an electrically resonant system, the &quot;Q&quot; factor represents the effect of electrical resistance and, for electromechanical resonators such as quartz crystals, mechanical friction.

=== Relationship between and bandwidth ===

The 2-sided bandwidth relative to a resonant frequency of (Hz) is .

For example, an antenna tuned to have a value of 10 and a centre frequency of 100 kHz would have a 3 dB bandwidth of 10 kHz.

In audio, bandwidth is often expressed in terms of octaves. Then the relationship between and bandwidth is

formula_11
where is the bandwidth in octaves.

=== RLC circuits ===

In an ideal series RLC circuit, and in a tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) the factor is:

formula_12

where , , and are the resistance, inductance and capacitance of the tuned circuit, respectively. Larger series resistances correspond to lower circuit values.

For a parallel RLC circuit, the factor is the inverse of the series case:

formula_13

Consider a circuit where , , and are all in parallel. The lower the parallel resistance is, the more effect it will have in damping the circuit and thus result in lower . This is useful in filter design to determine the bandwidth.

In a parallel LC circuit where the main loss is the resistance of the inductor, , in series with the inductance, , is as in the series circuit. This is a common circumstance for resonators, where limiting the resistance of the inductor to improve and narrow the bandwidth is the desired result.

=== Individual reactive components ===

The of an individual reactive component depends on the frequency at which it is evaluated, which is typically the resonant frequency of the circuit that it is used in. The of an inductor with a series loss resistance is the of a resonant circuit using that inductor (including its series loss) and a perfect capacitor.

formula_14

where:
* is the resonance frequency in radians per second;
* is the inductance;
* is the inductive reactance; and
* is the series resistance of the inductor.

The of a capacitor with a series loss resistance is the same as the of a resonant circuit using that capacitor with a perfect inductor:

formula_15

where:
* is the resonance frequency in radians per second;
* is the capacitance;
* is the capacitive reactance; and
* is the series resistance of the capacitor.

In general, the of a resonator involving a series combination of a capacitor and an inductor can be determined from the values of the components, whether their losses come from series resistance or otherwise:

formula_16

== Mechanical systems ==
For a single damped mass-spring system, the factor represents the effect of simplified viscous damping or drag, where the damping force or drag force is proportional to velocity. The formula for the factor is:
formula_17
where is the mass, is the spring constant, and is the damping coefficient, defined by the equation , where is the velocity.

== Acoustical systems ==
The of a musical instrument is critical; an excessively high in a resonator will not evenly amplify the multiple frequencies an instrument produces. For this reason, string instruments often have bodies with complex shapes, so that they produce a wide range of frequencies fairly evenly.

The of a brass instrument or wind instrument needs to be high enough to pick one frequency out of the broader-spectrum buzzing of the lips or reed.
By contrast, a vuvuzela is made of flexible plastic, and therefore has a very low for a brass instrument, giving it a muddy, breathy tone. Instruments made of stiffer plastic, brass, or wood have higher values. An excessively high can make it harder to hit a note. in an instrument may vary across frequencies, but this may not be desirable.

Helmholtz resonators have a very high , as they are designed for picking out a very narrow range of frequencies.

== Optical systems ==
In optics, the factor of a resonant cavity is given by
formula_18
where is the resonant frequency, is the stored energy in the cavity, and is the power dissipated. The optical is equal to the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth of the cavity resonance. The average lifetime of a resonant photon in the cavity is proportional to the cavity&#x27;s . If the factor of a laser&#x27;s cavity is abruptly changed from a low value to a high one, the laser will emit a pulse of light that is much more intense than the laser&#x27;s normal continuous output. This technique is known as -switching. factor is of particular importance in plasmonics, where loss is linked to the damping of the surface plasmon resonance. While loss is normally considered a hindrance in the development of plasmonic devices, it is possible to leverage this property to present new enhanced functionalities.

<doc id="229162" wikidata="Q3532211" url="?curid=229162" title="Charles Greville (diarist)">
<text>Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville (2 April 1794 – 17 January 1865) was an English diarist and an amateur cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1819 to 1827. His father, Charles Greville, was a second cousin of the 1st Earl of Warwick. His mother, Lady Charlotte Bentinck, was a daughter of the 3rd Duke of Portland (former leader of the Whig party and prime minister).

==Early life==
Much of Greville&#x27;s childhood was spent at his maternal grandfather&#x27;s house at Bulstrode. He was one of the Pages of Honour to George III, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford; but he left the university early, having been appointed private secretary to Earl Bathurst before he was twenty. The interest of the Duke of Portland had secured for him the secretaryship of the island of Jamaica, which was a sinecure office, the duties being performed by a deputy, and the reversion of the clerkship of the council. His mother was widely believed to be the mistress of the Duke of Wellington, an affair which caused her family much distress, and may account for Greville&#x27;s frequently hostile attitude to Wellington.

==Cricket career==
Mainly associated with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he made five known appearances in first-class matches. He played for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series. His brother was Algernon Greville.

==Public career==
Greville entered upon the discharge of the duties of a Clerk of the Council in ordinary in 1821, and continued to perform them for nearly forty years, until his retirement in 1859. He, therefore, served under three successive sovereigns (George IV, William IV and Victoria) and, although no political or confidential functions were attached to that office, it was one that brought him into habitual intercourse with the chiefs of all the parties in the state. Well-born, well-bred, handsome, and accomplished, Greville led the easy life of a man of fashion, taking an occasional part in the transactions of his day and much consulted in the affairs of private life.

In 1837, Greville won 9,000 pounds from the first-place finish of his horse Mango in the St Leger Stakes. Until 1855, when he sold his stud, he was an active member of the turf, and he trained successively with Lord George Bentinck and with the Duke of Portland.

Greville died at Mayfair, London, and the celebrity now attached to his name is entirely due to the posthumous publication of a portion of a Journal or Diary that it was his practice to keep during the greater part of his life. These papers were given by him to his friend Henry Reeve a short time before his death, with an injunction that they should be published, as far as was feasible, at not too remote a period after the writer&#x27;s death.

==Diary==
The journals of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, were published in obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold in little more than a year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on the mind of a competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandals. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the &quot;Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland&quot;, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.

The full span of memoirs eventually appeared in three parts—three volumes covering 1817 to 1837, published in 1874, three for the period from 1837 to 1852, published in 1885, and the final two in 1887, covering 1852 to 1860. When the first part appeared in 1874 some passages caused extreme offence. The copies issued were as far as possible recalled and passages suppressed, however, a copy of this original manuscript remained in the Wallace family&#x27;s possession until it was sold and eventually acquired by a bookseller from New York, Gabriel Wells. Wells and the Doubleday publishing house produced &quot;The Greville Diary&quot; in two volumes in 1927; however, these were criticised for poor editing and containing some inaccurate statements.

In 1874, when it became known that Greville&#x27;s diary was going to be printed, the news caused an uproar. Queen Victoria wrote that she was &quot;&quot;horrified&quot; and &quot;indignant&quot; at this dreadful and really scandalous book. Mr Greville&#x27;s indiscretion, indelicacy, ingratitude, betrayal of confidence and shameful disloyalty towards his Sovereign make it &quot;very important&quot; that the book should be severely censored and discredited&quot;. She also said that &quot;The tone in which he speaks of royalty is unlike anything which one sees in history, even of people hundreds of years ago, and is most reprehensible...Of George IV he speaks in such shocking language, language not fit for any gentleman to use&quot;. The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli wrote to Lady Bradford on 26 October 1874:

I have not seen Chas. Greville&#x27;s book, but have read a good deal of it. It is a social outrage. And committed by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don&#x27;t think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don&#x27;t limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don&#x27;t forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made &quot;à propos&quot; of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Gros[veno]r Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.
==His brother&#x27;s diary==

His brother, Henry William Greville (1801–1872), attaché to the British embassy in Paris from 1834 to 1844, also kept a diary, of which part was published by Viscountess Enfield, &quot;Leaves from The Diary of Henry Greville&quot; (London, 1883–1884).

<doc id="229167" wikidata="Q201598" url="?curid=229167" title="Bucephalus">
<text>Bucephalus (; ; – June 326 BC) or Bucephalas, was the horse of Alexander the Great, and one of the most famous horses of classical antiquity. According to the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; (1.15), the name &quot;Bucephalus&quot; literally means &quot;ox-headed&quot; (from and ), and supposedly comes from a brand (or scar) on the thigh of the horse that looked like an ox&#x27;s head. 

Ancient historical accounts state that Bucephalus&#x27;s breed was that of the &quot;best Thessalian strain&quot;, and that he died in what is now Punjab, Pakistan, after the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. Alexander was so grieved at the loss of his horse that he named one of the many cities he founded after him, as Alexandria Bucephalus.

== Taming of Bucephalus ==

A massive creature with a massive head, Bucephalus is described as having a black coat with a large white star on his brow. He is also supposed to have had a &quot;wall eye&quot; (blue eye), and his breeding was that of the &quot;best Thessalian strain&quot;.

Plutarch says that in 344 BC, at twelve or thirteen years of age, Alexander of Macedonia won the horse by making a wager with his father: a horse dealer named Philonicus the Thessalian offered Bucephalus to King Philip II for the remarkably high sum of 13 talents. Because no one could tame the animal, Philip was not interested. However, Alexander was, and he offered to pay himself should he fail.

Alexander was given a chance and surprised all by subduing the horse. He spoke soothingly to the horse and turned its head toward the sun so that it could no longer see its own shadow, which had been the cause of its distress. Dropping his fluttering cloak as well, Alexander successfully tamed the horse. Plutarch says that the incident so impressed Philip that he told the boy, &quot;O my son, look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee.&quot; Philip&#x27;s speech strikes the only false note in the anecdote, according to A. R. Anderson, who noted his words as the embryo of the legend fully developed in the &quot;History of Alexander the Great&quot; I.15, 17.

The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; presents a mythic variant of Bucephalus&#x27;s origin. In this tale, the colt, whose heroic attributes surpassed even those of Pegasus, is bred and presented to Philip on his own estates. The mythic attributes of the animal are further reinforced in the romance by the Delphic Oracle who tells Philip that the destined king of the world will be the one who rides Bucephalus, a horse with the mark of the ox&#x27;s head on his haunch.

== Alexander and Bucephalus ==

As one of his chargers, Bucephalus served Alexander in numerous battles.

The value which Alexander placed on Bucephalus emulated his hero and supposed ancestor Achilles, who claimed that his horses were &quot;known to excel all others—for they are immortal. Poseidon gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to me.&quot;

Arrian states, with Onesicritus as his source, that Bucephalus died at the age of thirty. Other sources, however, give as the cause of death not old age or weariness, but fatal injuries at the Battle of the Hydaspes (June 326 BC), in which Alexander&#x27;s army defeated King Porus. Alexander promptly founded a city, Bucephala, in honour of his horse. It was on the west bank of the Hydaspes river (modern-day Jhelum in Pakistan). The modern-day town of Jalalpur Sharif, outside Jhelum, is said to be where Bucephalus is buried.

The legend of Bucephalus grew in association with that of Alexander, beginning with the fiction that they were born simultaneously: some of the later versions of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; also synchronized the hour of their death. The Bucephalus appears in almost all versions of the &quot;Armenian Alexander Romance&quot;, and visual illustrations in the surviving manuscripts of this text sometimes represent scenes with the Bucephalus.
