<text>The Daily Mirror is a British national daily tabloid newspaper. Founded in 1903, it is part of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), which is owned by parent company Reach plc. From 1985 to 1987, and from 1997 to 2002, the title on its masthead was simply The Mirror. It had an average daily print circulation of 716,923 in December 2016, dropping to 587,803 the following year. Its Sunday sister paper is the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;. Unlike other major British tabloids such as &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the &quot;Mirror&quot; has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, which incorporate certain stories from the &quot;Mirror&quot; that are of Scottish significance.

Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the &quot;Mirror&quot; becoming a part of International Publishing Corporation. During the mid-1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily (non-Sunday) British newspaper since. The &quot;Mirror&quot; was owned by Robert Maxwell between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form Trinity Mirror (now known as Reach plc). In August 2023 Reach launched a US division of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, titled &quot;The Mirror US&quot;.

==History==
===1903–1995===

&quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; was launched on 2 November 1903 by Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) as a newspaper for women, run by women. About the name, he said: &quot;I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides ... to be entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull.&quot; It cost one penny (equivalent to p in ).

It was not an immediate success and in 1904 Harmsworth decided to turn it into a pictorial newspaper with a broader focus. Harmsworth appointed Hamilton Fyfe as editor and all of the paper&#x27;s female journalists were fired. The masthead was changed to &quot;The Daily Illustrated Mirror&quot;, which ran from 26 January to 27 April 1904 (issues 72 to 150), when it reverted to &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. The first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously, but instead news text and engraved pictures (of a traitor and an actress), with the promise of photographs inside. Two days later, the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added: &quot;A paper for men and women&quot;. This combination was more successful: by issue 92, the guaranteed circulation was 120,000 copies and by issue 269, it had grown to 200,000: by then the name had reverted and the front page was mainly photographs. Circulation grew to 466,000 making it the second-largest morning newspaper.

Alfred Harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1917, the price was increased to one penny. Circulation continued to grow: in 1919, some issues sold more than a million copies a day, making it the largest daily picture paper. In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the 1924 Women&#x27;s Olympiad held at Stamford Bridge in London.
Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the &quot;Mirror&quot;″s editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s. On Monday, 22 January 1934 the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran the headline &quot;Give the Blackshirts a helping hand&quot; urging readers to join Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, and giving the address to which to send membership applications. By the mid-1930s, the &quot;Mirror&quot; was struggling – it and the &quot;Mail&quot; were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; establish circulations of more than two million, and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it.

In 1935 Rothermere sold the paper to Harry Guy Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp. With Cecil King (Rothermere&#x27;s nephew) in charge of the paper&#x27;s finances and Guy Bartholomew as editor, during the late 1930s the &quot;Mirror&quot; was transformed from a conservative, middle class newspaper into a left-wing paper for the working class. Partly on the advice of the American advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, the &quot;Mirror&quot; became the first British paper to adopt the appearance of the New York tabloids. The headlines became bigger, the stories shorter and the illustrations more abundant. By 1939, the publication was selling 1.4 million copies a day. In 1937, Hugh McClelland introduced his wild Western comic strip &quot;Beelzebub Jones&quot; in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. After taking over as cartoon chief at the &quot;Mirror&quot; in 1945, he dropped &quot;Beelzebub Jones&quot; and moved on to a variety of new strips.

During the Second World War the &quot;Mirror&quot; positioned itself as the paper of the ordinary soldier and civilian, and was critical of the political leadership and the established parties. At one stage, the paper was threatened with closure following the publication of a Philip Zec cartoon (captioned by William Connor), which was misinterpreted by Winston Churchill and Herbert Morrison. In the 1945 UK general election, the paper strongly supported the Labour Party in its eventual landslide victory. In doing so, the paper supported Herbert Morrison, who co-ordinated Labour&#x27;s campaign, and recruited his former antagonist Philip Zec to reproduce, on the front page, a popular VE Day cartoon on the morning of the election, suggesting that Labour were the only party who could maintain peace in post-war Britain. By the late 1940s, it was selling 4.5 million copies a day, outstripping the &quot;Express&quot;; for some 30 years afterwards, it dominated the British daily newspaper market, selling more than 5 million copies a day at its peak in the mid-1960s.

The &quot;Mirror&quot; was an influential model for German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot;, which was founded in 1952 and became Europe&#x27;s biggest-selling newspaper.

In 1955, the &quot;Mirror&quot; and its stablemate the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; (later to become the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;) began printing a northern edition in Manchester. In 1957 it introduced the Andy Capp cartoon, created by Reg Smythe from Hartlepool, in the northern editions.

The &quot;Mirror&quot; mass working-class readership had made it the United Kingdom&#x27;s best-selling daily tabloid newspaper. In 1960, it acquired the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; (the popular daily of the labour movement) when it bought Odhams, in one of a series of takeovers which created the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). The &quot;Mirror&quot; management did not want the &quot;Herald&quot; competing with the &quot;Mirror&quot; for readers, and in 1964, relaunched it as a mid-market paper, now named &quot;The Sun&quot;. When it failed to win readers, &quot;The Sun&quot; was sold to Rupert Murdoch – who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor to the &quot;Mirror&quot;.
In an attempt to cater to a different kind of reader, the &quot;Mirror&quot; launched the &quot;Mirrorscope&quot; pull-out section on 30 January 1968. The &quot;Press Gazette&quot; commented: &quot;The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; launched its revolutionary four-page supplement &quot;Mirrorscope&quot;. The ambitious brief for the supplement, which ran on Wednesdays and Fridays, was to deal with international affairs, politics, industry, science, the arts and business&quot;. The &quot;British Journalism Review&quot; said in 2002 that &quot;Mirrorscope&quot; was &quot;a game attempt to provide serious analysis in the rough and tumble of the tabloids&quot;. It failed to attract significant numbers of new readers, and the pull-out section was abandoned, its final issue appearing on 27 August 1974.

In 1978, &quot;The Sun&quot; overtook the &quot;Mirror&quot; in circulation, and in 1984 the &quot;Mirror&quot; was sold to Robert Maxwell. The first &quot;Mirror&quot; using colour appeared on the 1st August 1988 edition. Following Maxwell&#x27;s death in 1991, David Montgomery became Mirror Group&#x27;s CEO, and a period of cost-cutting and production changes ensued. The &quot;Mirror&quot; went through a protracted period of crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form Trinity Mirror in 1999. Printing of the &quot;Daily&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; moved to Trinity Mirror&#x27;s facilities in Watford and Oldham.

===1995–2004===

Under the editorship of Piers Morgan (from October 1995 to May 2004) the paper saw a number of controversies. Morgan was widely criticised and forced to apologise for the headline &quot;ACHTUNG! SURRENDER For you Fritz, ze Euro 96 Championship is over&quot; a day before England met Germany in a semi-final of the Euro 96 football championships.

In 2000, Morgan was the subject of an investigation after Suzy Jagger wrote a story in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealing that he had bought £20,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the &quot;Mirror&quot;″s &#x27;City Slickers&#x27; column tipped Viglen as a good buy. Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The &#x27;City Slickers&#x27; columnists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code, and were sacked before the inquiry. In 2004, further enquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry cleared Morgan from any charges. On 7 December 2005 Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought £67,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his wife&#x27;s name too.

In 2002, the &quot;Mirror&quot; attempted to move mid-market, claiming to eschew the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip. The paper changed its masthead logo from red to black (and occasionally blue), in an attempt to dissociate itself from the term &quot;red top&quot;, a term for a sensationalist mass-market tabloid. (On 6 April 2005, the red top came back.) Under then-editor Piers Morgan, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial stance opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and ran many front pages critical of the war. It also gave financial support to the 15 February 2003 anti-war protest, paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards. Morgan re-hired John Pilger, who had been sacked during Robert Maxwell&#x27;s ownership of the Mirror titles. Despite such changes, Morgan was unable to halt the paper&#x27;s decline in circulation, a decline shared by its direct tabloid rivals &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Star&quot;.

Morgan was fired from the &quot;Mirror&quot; on 14 May 2004 after authorising the newspaper&#x27;s publication of photographs allegedly showing Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment. Within days the photographs were shown to be fakes. Under the headline &quot;SORRY.. WE WERE HOAXED&quot;, the &quot;Mirror&quot; responded that it had fallen victim to a &quot;calculated and malicious hoax&quot; and apologised for the publication of the photographs.

===2004–present===
The &quot;Mirror&quot; front page on 4 November 2004, after the re-election of George W. Bush as U.S. president, read &quot;How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?&quot;. It provided a list of states and their alleged average IQ, showing the Bush states all below average intelligence (except for Virginia), and all John Kerry states at or above average intelligence. The source for this table was &quot;The Economist&quot;, although it was a hoax. Richard Wallace became editor in 2004.

On 30 May 2012, Trinity Mirror announced the merger of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; into a single seven-day-a-week title. Richard Wallace and Tina Weaver, the respective editors of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, were simultaneously dismissed and Lloyd Embley, editor of &quot;The People&quot;, appointed as editor of the combined title with immediate effect. In 2018, Reach plc acquired the Northern &amp; Shell titles, including the Daily Express, which led to a number of editor moves across the stable. Lloyd Embley was then promoted to editor-in-chief across the entire group, and Alison Phillips (previously deputy editor-in-chief for the Trinity Mirror titles) was appointed editor of the Daily Mirror.

In August 2023 MGN Ltd and Reach plc launched a division of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for the United States. It consists of a news website, titled &quot;The Mirror&quot; &quot;US&quot;, with offices based in New York City.

==Political allegiance==

The &quot;Mirror&quot; has consistently supported the Labour Party since the 1945 UK general election. On the day of the 1979 UK general election, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; urged its readers to vote for the governing Labour Party led by James Callaghan. As widely predicted by the opinion polls, Labour lost this election and Conservative Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. The &quot;Mirror&quot;″s continued support of the Labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been partly as a result of what was labelled by the Daily Mail the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;, where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes.

By the time of the 1983 UK general election, Labour support was at a postwar low, partly due to the strong challenge by the recently formed SDP–Liberal Alliance. Despite this, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; remained loyal to Labour and urged its readers to vote for the party, then led by Michael Foot, condemning the Thatcher-led Tory government for its &quot;waste of our nation&quot;, as well as the rise in unemployment that Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government had seen in its first term in power largely due to monetarist economic policies to reduce inflation, although the government&#x27;s previously low popularity had dramatically improved since the success of the Falklands conflict a year earlier. However, the Conservatives were re-elected and Labour suffered its worst postwar general election result, only narrowly bettering the SDP–Liberal Alliance in terms of votes whilst winning considerably more seats.

At the 1987 UK general election, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; remained loyal to Labour, led by Neil Kinnock, and urged its readers with the slogan &quot;You know he&#x27;s right, chuck her out.&quot; By this stage, unemployment was falling and inflation had remained low for several years. As a result, the Tories were re-elected for a third successive term, although Labour did cut the Tory majority slightly. For the 1992 UK general election, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; continued to support Labour, still led by Neil Kinnock. By this stage, Thatcher had stepped down and the Tory government was now led by John Major. The election was won by the Conservatives, although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to 21 seats compared to the triple-digit figure of the previous two elections, which led to a difficult term for Major. The outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections, as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead, although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government&#x27;s change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November 1990, in spite of the onset of the early 1990s recession which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline. Labour&#x27;s credibility was helped by plans including extra National Health Service (NHS) funding and moving away from firm commitments on re-nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation, but its decision to be up-front about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win.

By the time of the 1997 UK general election, support for the Labour Party, by then led by Tony Blair, in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the Conservative government led by John Major since late 1992, whose reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of Black Wednesday in September of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. A reinvented New Labour had further improved its credibility under Blair by promising traditional Labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; urged its readers that their country needed Blair, and to vote Labour.

The 1997 election produced a Labour landslide that ended the party&#x27;s 18-year exile from power, followed by two further wins in the 2001 and 2005 UK general elections. On 4 May 2010, the newspaper printed a picture of Conservative leader David Cameron with a giant red cross through his face. The headline read &quot;How to stop him&quot; in reference to the 2010 UK general election two days later, confirming the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s Labour allegiance. The election ended in Britain&#x27;s first hung parliament since 1974 but Cameron still became prime minister within days as the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was the only leading national newspaper to remain loyal to Labour and Gordon Brown at a time when opinion polls showed the party on course for their worst election result since 1983.

The newspaper was critical of the Liberal Democrats for forming the coalition which enabled the Conservatives to form a new government in 2010, and branded leader Nick Clegg as Pinickio (alluding to the lying fictional character Pinocchio) for going back on numerous pre-election pledges. It has frequently referred to the party as the &quot;Fib Dems&quot; or &quot;Lib Dumbs&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Also in 2016, the newspaper asked for Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s resignation &quot;for the good of the party and of the country.&quot; Despite this critical position, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election. For the 2019 UK general election, the newspaper again endorsed Labour &quot;to protect NHS, end poverty and for a kinder Britain.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; threw its support behind the Labour Party for the 2024 UK general election, stating that &quot;a Labour government is more crucial than ever for the new generation.&quot;

==Libel, contempt of court, errors and criticism==

* In the 1959 &quot;Liberace v Daily Mirror&quot; case, Liberace sued the &quot;Mirror&quot; for libel. William Connor had written a pseudonymous column hinting that the American entertainer was a homosexual; at the time, homosexual acts were illegal in Britain. The jury found in Liberace&#x27;s favour and he received £8,000 in damages (estimated at £500,000 in 2009). After Liberace&#x27;s death, the paper editorially asked, &quot;Can we have our money back, please?&quot;
* In 1991, shortly after the death of Queen&#x27;s lead singer Freddie Mercury, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran a column by Joe Haines which contained extensive insults towards Mercury, HIV/AIDS victims, and homosexuals. The article prompted an open letter in condemnation from folk singer Lal Waterson, later recorded as a song by her sister Norma.
* In December 1992, Scottish politician George Galloway won libel damages from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and its Scottish sister the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, who had falsely accused him of making malicious allegations about their foreign editor Nicholas Davies. Galloway had used parliamentary privilege to call for an independent investigation into allegations about Davies made in the book &quot;The Samson Option&quot;.
* In May 2004, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published what it claimed were photos of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at an unspecified location in Iraq. The decision to publish the photos, subsequently shown to be hoaxes, led to Piers Morgan&#x27;s sacking as editor of the paper on 14 May 2004. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; then stated that it was the subject of a &quot;calculated and malicious hoax&quot;. The newspaper issued a statement apologising for the printing of the pictures. The paper&#x27;s deputy editor, Des Kelly, took over as acting editor during the crisis. The tabloid&#x27;s rival, &quot;The Sun&quot;, offered a £50,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of those accused of faking the &quot;Mirror&quot; photographs.
* In June 2004, American model Caprice Bourret won a libel case against the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for an article in April that year which falsely claimed that her acting career had failed.
* In November 2007, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; paid damages to Sir Andrew Green after having likened him and his group MigrationWatch UK to the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party in September of that year. The newspaper admitted that such allegations were &quot;untrue&quot;.
* In February 2008 both the &quot;Daily&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; implied that TV presenter Kate Garraway was having an affair. She sued for libel, receiving an apology and compensation payment in April 2008.
* On 18 September 2008, David Anderson, a British sports journalist writing for the &quot;Mirror&quot;, repeated a claim deriving from vandalism on Wikipedia&#x27;s entry for Cypriot football team AC Omonia, which asserted that their fans were called &quot;The Zany Ones&quot; and liked to wear hats made from discarded shoes. The claim was part of Anderson&#x27;s match preview ahead of AC Omonia&#x27;s game with Manchester City, which appeared in the web and print versions of the &quot;Mirror&quot;, with the nickname also quoted in subsequent editions on 19 September.
* In November 2009, the &quot;Mirror&quot; paid &quot;substantial&quot; damages for libel to Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo after it admitted that a story about him becoming highly intoxicated in a Hollywood nightclub was untrue.
* On 12 May 2011, the High Court of England and Wales granted the Attorney General permission to bring a case for contempt against &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for the way they had reported on the arrest of a person of interest in the Murder of Joanna Yeates. On 29 July, the Court ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court, fining the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; £50,000 and &quot;The Sun&quot; £18,000.
* In October 2013, a defamation case brought by the Irish airline Ryanair against the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was settled out of court. The &quot;Mirror&quot; had repeated allegations about the airline&#x27;s safety from a Channel 4 documentary which were not reflected by its most recent evaluation by the Irish Aviation Authority.
* On 19 July 2011 the &quot;Mirror&quot; published an article labelling comedian Frankie Boyle a racist. He later sued for defamation and libel, winning £54,650 in damages and a further £4,250 for a claim about his departure from &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. The &quot;Mirror&quot; had argued he was &quot;forced to quit&quot; but this was found to be libellous by the court.
* On 20 March 2017 the &quot;Mirror&quot; painted the traditional Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; (&#x27;stenka na stenku&#x27;, Ru) which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly represented by the &quot;Mirror&quot; in the pictures and text, labelled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The &quot;Mirror&quot; article was titled &quot;Russia&#x27;s Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup&quot;, and received negative receptions from Russian media, also being described as fake news. Representatives of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continued to insist that the photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gave no evidence of their participation in the festival.
* In March 2019, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; faced criticism from social media users, as well as from columnist Owen Jones and journalist Mehdi Hasan, for covering the Christchurch mosque shootings with the headline &quot;Angelic boy who grew into an evil far-right mass killer&quot; in reference to perpetrator Brenton Tarrant. Users criticised it for humanising Tarrant while ignoring the victims, and for the perceived double standard of how attacks conducted by Islamists are portrayed more negatively than those by white supremacists. These criticisms typically contrasted the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s coverage of Tarrant with its coverage of Orlando nightclub shooting perpetrator Omar Mateen three years earlier, who was covered with the headline &quot;ISIS Maniac Kills 50 in Gay Nightclub&quot;.

<doc id="235693" wikidata="Q3569926" url="?curid=235693" title="Workers' Dreadnought">
<text>Workers&#x27; Dreadnought was a communist newspaper based in London and led by Sylvia Pankhurst.

The paper was started by Pankhurst at the suggestion of Zelie Emerson, after Pankhurst had been expelled from the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union by her mother and sister. The paper was published on behalf of the newly formed East London Federation of Suffragettes.

Provisionally titled &quot;Workers&#x27; Mate&quot;, the newspaper first appeared on 8 March 1914 (14 March according to another source or 21 March according to yet another), the day of a suffragette rally at which Pankhurst was due to speak, in Trafalgar Square, as The Woman&#x27;s Dreadnought, with a circulation of 30,000, subsequently (at number 10, in May 1914) stated as 20,000.

When the editor was imprisoned, Norah Smyth alternated as acting editor with Jack O&#x27;Sullivan. For many years, Smyth had used her skills as a photographer to provide pictures for the newspaper of East End life, particularly of women and children living in poverty.

In July 1917, the name was changed to &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;, which initially had a circulation of 10,000. Its slogan changed to &quot;Socialism, Internationalism, Votes for All&quot;, and then in July 1918 to &quot;For International Socialism&quot;, reflecting increasing opposition to Parliamentarism in the party.

The paper took a strong stance against the First World War, calling for Britain to begin peace negotiations, and speaking positively of Russia&#x27;s exit from the war. The paper&#x27;s first issue for October 1917 advocated for a peace referendum among the British Army, but before it could enter circulation the Metropolitan Police raided offices of &quot;Workers Dreadnought&quot; and destroyed the copies of the issue.

On 19 June 1920,&quot; Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; was adopted as the official weekly organ of the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International). 

During the Post-war French occupation of the Rhineland, German communists attempted to retake the region. France employed the use of black colonial troops to halt them. Reporting on the events, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; referred to the soldiers using terms such as &quot;Black Scourge in Europe,&quot; and &quot;Black Menace of 40,000 Troops&quot;. Jamaican writer Claude McKay considered the papers&#x27; focus on the Black soldiers to be illogical prejudice, and a distraction from the communists&#x27; efforts against French occupation. McKay wrote a letter adressed to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;&#x27;s editor George Lansbury expressing these concerns. Landsbury refused to print the response, while writing back privately claiming to not be personally prejudice against black people. Instead, he was encouraged by a friend to send it to Sylvia Pankhurst and have it printed in &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;, and did so.

The paper warned of fascism in Italy, condemned the white labourism in South Africa&#x27;s Rand Rebellion,

Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act for publishing articles &quot;calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty&#x27;s forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population&quot;. Claude McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of &quot;The Yellow Peril and the Dockers&quot; attributed to &quot;Leon Lopez&quot;, which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;.

On 14 June 1924, &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; ceased publication.

<doc id="235696" wikidata="Q2629069" url="?curid=235696" title="Softmodem">
<text>A software modem, commonly referred to as a softmodem, is a modem with minimal hardware that uses software running on the host computer, and the computer&#x27;s resources (especially the central processing unit, random access memory, and sometimes audio processing), in place of the hardware in a conventional modem.

Softmodems are also sometimes called winmodems due to limited support for platforms other than Windows. By analogy, a linmodem is a softmodem that can run on Linux.

Softmodems are sometimes used as an example of a hard real-time system. The audio signals to be transmitted must be computed on a tight interval (on the order of every 5 or 10 milliseconds); they cannot be computed in advance, and they cannot be late or the receiving modem will lose synchronization.

== History ==
The first generations of hardware modems (including acoustic couplers) and their protocols used relatively simple modulation techniques such as FSK or ASK at low speeds. Under these conditions, modems could be built with the analog discrete component technology used during the late 70s and early 80s.

As more sophisticated transmission schemes were devised, the circuits grew in complexity substantially. New modulation required mixing analog and digital components, and eventually incorporating multiple integrated circuits (ICs) such as logical gates, PLLs and microcontrollers. Later techniques used in modern V.34, V.90 and V.92 protocols (such as a 1664-point QAM constellation) are so complex that implementing them with discrete components or general purpose ICs became impractical.

Furthermore, improved compression and error correction schemes were introduced in the newest protocols, requiring extra processing power in the modem itself. This made the construction of a mainly analog/discrete component modem impossible. Finally, compatibility with older protocols using completely different modulation schemes would have required a modem made with discrete electronics to contain multiple complete implementations.

Initially the solution was to use LSI ASICs which shrank the various implementations into a small number of components, but since standards continued to change, there was a desire to create modems that could be upgraded.

In 1993, Digicom marketed the &quot;Connection 96 Plus&quot;, a modem based around a DSP which was programmed by an application on startup. Because the program was replaceable, the modem could be upgraded as standards improved. Digicom branded this technology &quot;SoftModem&quot;, perhaps originating the term.

Likewise, the term &quot;Winmodem&quot; originated by Prof. Parvaiz Akhtar in 1996 with hardware being developed by USRobotics&#x27; &quot;Sportster Winmodem&quot;, a similarly upgradable DSP-based design.

In 1996, two types of modem began to reach the market: &quot;host-based&quot; modems, which offloaded some work onto the host CPU, and &quot;software-only&quot; modems which transferred all work onto the host system&#x27;s CPU. In 1997, the AC&#x27;97 standard for computer audio would introduce channels for modem use, making software modem technology common in PCs.

Since then, some softmodems have been created as standalone software projects utilizing standard sound card interfaces, such as an experimental open-source 96 kbit/s leased-line softmodem called AuDSL from 1999, and the Minimodem project which implements several FSK modem standards.

== Types ==
Softmodems can be separated into two classes: &quot;controllerless&quot; modems and &quot;pure software&quot; modems.

Controllerless modems utilize a DSP on the modem itself to perform modulation, demodulation and other tasks. Some, known as &quot;host-based&quot; modems, may still use some amount of the host&#x27;s CPU power for some tasks.

Pure software modems perform all modem tasks on the host PC&#x27;s CPU, while the hardware provides only analog-digital conversion and connection to the telephone network.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The original stated purpose of the DSP-based softmodem was to provide for upgradeability, a concern in an era when modem standards were changing rapidly. Both DSP and pure software modems offer this feature.

Softmodems provide cost and efficiency advantages over traditional hardware modems. Their minimal hardware design reduces manufacturing costs and power consumption.

A downside of either type of softmodem is that drivers must be provided, and the terms &quot;softmodem&quot; and &quot;winmodem&quot; have gained negative connotations, particularly within the open-source community, due to drivers for Linux often being omitted or provided only as unmaintainable binaries.

While DSP-based softmodems usually only require host attention during startup, pure software modems consume some CPU cycles on the host, which can conceivably slow down application software on older computers. This was a major issue in the 1990s, when CPUs were not nearly as powerful as today&#x27;s typical hardware.

== DSL softmodems ==
Although &quot;softmodem&quot; typically applies to PSTN modems, there are some software-based DSL modems or even routers, which work on the same principles but at higher bandwidth and with more complex encoding schemes. One of the first software based DSL modem chipsets was Motorola&#x27;s SoftDSL chipset.

The term WinDSL has been coined to describe this kind of technology. DSL softmodems generally require the same interfaces as PSTN softmodems, such as USB or PCI.

<text>Arthur Furguson (1883–1938) was (or may have been) a Scottish con artist who allegedly became known for &quot;selling&quot; English national monuments and other 
property to visiting American tourists during the 1920s.

It is claimed that in the 1920s, Furguson sold monuments such as Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square (for the sum of £6,000), Big Ben (£1,000 for a down payment), and Buckingham Palace (£2,000 for a down payment) to American tourists. Furguson immigrated to the US in 1925. He sold the White House to a rancher on the installment plan for yearly payments of $100,000, and tried to sell the Statue of Liberty to a visiting Australian, who went to the police. Furguson was imprisoned and was released in 1930. He continued to defraud people in Los Angeles until his death in 1938.

However, according to author Dane Love, who profiled Furguson in his book &quot;The Man Who Sold Nelson&#x27;s Column&quot;, the existence of Furguson himself may be a hoax. Love attempted to trace contemporary records which would confirm the story, but found &quot;[t]here was nothing about his arrest, his trial or his time in jail in New York. There&#x27;s not even any trace of his grave in Los Angeles, where he supposedly died in 1938.&quot;

<text>Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst (5 May 1882 – 27 September 1960) was an English feminist and socialist activist and writer. Following encounters with women-led labour activism in the United States, she worked to organise working-class women in London&#x27;s East End. This, together with her refusal in 1914 to enter into a wartime political truce with the government, caused her to break with the suffragette leadership of her mother and sister, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst. Pankhurst welcomed the Russian Revolution and consulted in Moscow with Lenin. But as an advocate of workers&#x27; control, she rejected the Leninist party line and criticised the Bolshevik regime.

Pankhurst was vocal in her support for Irish independence; for anti-colonial struggle throughout the British Empire; and for anti-fascist solidarity in Europe. Following its invasion by Italy in 1935, she was devoted to the cause of Ethiopia where, after the Second World War, she spent her remaining years as a guest of the restored emperor Haile Selassie. The international circulation of her pan-Africanist weekly &quot;The New Times&quot; and &quot;Ethiopia News&quot; was regarded by British colonial authorities as a factor in the development of African nationalism, and of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica.

==Early life==
Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst (she later dropped her first forename) was born at Drayton Terrace, Old Trafford, Manchester, to Emmeline Pankhurst (née Goulden) and Dr. Richard Pankhurst.

Dr Pankhurst had been a founding member in 1872 of the National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, and played a role in drafting legislation that gave unmarried women householders a vote in local elections, and married women control over their property and earnings. According to his daughter, he was also distinguished by his support for Irish Home Rule, being &quot;the first English Parliamentary candidate to pledge himself to Irish self-government when he stood at a by-election in Manchester in 1883&quot;.

The family home, for a period in Russell Square in London, hosted radical intelligentsia from both Britain and abroad. These included the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, the Communard Louise Michel, and the Fabian Annie Besant.

In 1893, Pankhurst&#x27;s parents joined the Scottish miner Keir Hardie, a family friend, as founding members of the Independent Labour Party (ILP).

Pankhurst and her sisters, Christabel and Adela, attended Manchester High School for Girls. In 1903, Pankhurst went on to train as an artist at the Manchester School of Art. While completing an ILP commission to paint murals in a social hall the party had built in Salford, Pankhurst discovered that the hall, named after her father, would not admit women. It was an episode that helped convince her elder sister, Christabel, of the need for women to organise independently.

In 1904, Pankhurst won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, but she was incensed to learn that of 16 scholarships awarded by the college each year, 13 were reserved for men, and that, in response to a parliamentary question, Keir Hardie should be told that the authorities &quot;did not contemplate any change&quot;.

==Suffragette==

The Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) was founded as an independent women&#x27;s movement on 10 October 1903 in the family&#x27;s Nelson Street home in Manchester. Pankhurst&#x27;s sister Christabel had persuaded a group of ILP women that women had to do the work of emancipation themselves, and that they needed a movement free of party affiliation.

In 1906, Sylvia Pankhurst started to work full-time for WSPU, with Christabel and their mother. She devised the WSPU logo and various leaflets, banners, and posters as well as the decoration of its meeting halls.
In 1907 she toured industrial towns in England and Scotland, painting portraits of working-class women in their working environments. She was later to write that she witnessed &quot;so much distress&quot;, that she felt unable to return to her &quot;beloved profession&quot;. She became a full-time organiser, with Alice Hawkins and Mary Gawthorpe, helping establish the WSPU in Leicester.

Pankhurst contributed articles to the WSPU&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Votes for Women&quot; and, in 1911, she published a propagandist history of the WSPU&#x27;s campaign, &quot;The Suffragette: The History of the Women&#x27;s Militant Suffrage Movement&quot;. It included her witness account of Black Friday 18 November 1910, in which 300 women marched to the Houses of Parliament as part of their campaign to press for voting rights under the Conciliation Bill, and were met with violence, some of it sexual, from the Metropolitan Police and male bystanders.

In 1912, Pankhurst led a march on Mountjoy Prison in Dublin in solidarity with two English WPSU militants who had violently sought to disrupt the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith&#x27;s visit to the Irish capital. They had thrown a hatchet, to which a suffrage message was attached, into the carriage in which he was travelling with John Redmond and had attempted to set fire to the theatre in which the Prime Minister was to speak.

Between February 1913 and August 1914, Sylvia was arrested eight times for protest actions in London. After the passing of the so-called Cat and Mouse Act, she would be released for short periods to recuperate from hunger striking. Supporters would carry her back to her home and offices in Old Ford Street, Bow, where, when the police came to re-arrest her, street battles would ensue.

In June 1914, supporters carried her to the entrance to the Strangers&#x27; Gallery of the House of Commons where she announced that she would continue her hunger strike until Asquith agreed to receive a deputation of East London women. Asquith met the deputation of six working mothers. After listening to them pay tribute to the work Pankhurst had done &quot;in arousing the women of the East End to the importance of the vote in their daily lives&quot;, and describe their hardships, the Prime Minister reiterated the government&#x27;s position: votes for women would have to await a general democratic reform of the franchise. That did not occur until 1918, with votes extended to married, property owning women over thirty. Full voting equality took another ten years.

== Encounters women-led labour activism in the United States ==
Pankhurst undertook two speaking tours in the United States: in the first three months of 1911 and again at the beginning of 1912. Writing letters home, mostly to Keir Hardie, she described herself as having to persuade her largely middle-class hosts that sweated female labour and mother-child poverty were as much a feature of the New World as the Old. She related her experience of going into factories, workshops, workhouses and prisons, of observing the application of Taylorist principles (rendering workers &quot;part of the machinery&quot;), and of witnessing in the South the virtual criminalisation of African Americans.

In January 1911, she was in Chicago. A strike wave, which had begun in 1909 with &quot;the uprising of the 20,000&quot; mostly immigrant, Jewish women workers in the sweatshops of New York, had spread to the city&#x27;s clothing workers. Union pickets had been beaten and arrested. Two had been shot dead. Pankhurst visited strikers in their police cells, and observed that their conditions were as bad anything suffragettes had been subject to in Britain.

That same month, in New York City, she met the pioneer socialist feminist Margaret Sanger, together with a twenty-year-old Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. A year later, Flynn was to be the &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; strategist for the Industrial Workers of the World in the Lawrence textile strike. Back in New York City at the beginning of 1912, Pankhurst observed in laundry workers the same ability to overcome through collective action the racial, ethnic and sexual divisions systematically exploited by employers.

In Chicago, Pankhurst had been in the company of Zelie Passavant Emerson. Emerson had come to the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League from the settlement house movement. Pankhurst had encountered settlement houses in England: as a child she had visited the first of these, Ancoats Brotherhood in Manchester. But in their outreach to women as both domestic and wage workers, in America she saw a potentially potent form of women-led activism. Returning to London with Emerson, it was an example she sought to replicate in London&#x27;s East End.

Before being followed back to England by Emerson, in April 1912 Pankhurst joined the funeral procession in New York City for the 146 garment workers killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Speaking beside labour organiser Rose Schneiderman, she said that their deaths were the result of working-class people being denied the right to represent themselves.

== East London socialist ==
In a first show of independence, and with the support of Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Eveline Haverfield, Nellie Cressall, and George Lansbury, Pankhurst renamed the East London Federation of the WPSU, the East London Federation of Suffragettes. Although it was to remain a women&#x27;s—and women-led—emancipatory movement, it was opened to trade unionists and to men.

Pankhurst noted that &quot;the East End was the greatest homogeneous working-class area accessible to the House of Commons by popular demonstrations&quot; and proposed that the &quot;creation of a woman&#x27;s movement in that great abyss of poverty would be a call and a rallying cry to the rise of similar movements in all parts of the country&quot;. In this spirit, in November 1913, Pankhurst spoke at the Albert Hall, alongside James Connolly, in support of the men and women of the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union locked-out by Dublin employers.

In January 1914, accompanied by Nora Smyth, Pankhurst visited her sister Christabel in Paris, where she was taking refuge from the Cat and Mouse Act, to discuss the future of the ELFS. Christabel was insistent upon an independent, women-only WPSU, and was incredulous at her sister&#x27;s unwillingness to attack socialists unpledged to women&#x27;s suffrage. Pankhurst was equally insistent on supporting popular and labour struggles, and critical of what she considered to the WPSU&#x27;s social elitism. The sisters agreed that they and their organisations should go their separate ways.

From the East London Federation of Suffragettes, in 1914 Pankhurst formed the Workers&#x27; Suffrage Federation. At the suggestion of Emerson, Pankhurst started a WSF paper. Provisionally titled &quot;Workers&#x27; Mate&quot;, the newspaper first appeared as &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Dreadnought.&quot; Nora Smyth (who helped pay the bills) and Mary Phillips were the principal contributors, with Smyth illustrating the paper with her photographs of domestic East End poverty.

In the first edition of the paper (8 March 1914), Pankhurst&#x27;s editorial defended their insistence on building a working-class suffragette campaign:Those Suffragists who say that it is the duty of the richer and more fortunate women to win the Vote, and that their poorer sisters need not feel themselves called upon to aid in the struggle appear, in using such arguments, to forget that it is the Vote for which we are fighting. The essential principle of the vote is that each one of us shall have a share of power to help himself or herself and us all. It is in direct opposition to the idea that some few, who are more favoured, shall help and teach and patronize the others.This &quot;struck a strong chord with many women socialists of an earlier generation who had serious reservations about the WSPU&quot;. Amy Hicks, a veteran of the Social Democratic Federation, supported the ELFS from its start; as did Dora Montefiore who had left the WSPU in 1906, and had also spoken on behalf of the Dublin workers at the Albert Hall. The ELFS supported labour struggles and organised rent strikes.

==War-time organiser and dissident==

The United Kingdom declaration of war upon Germany on 4 August 1914 found Pankhurst in Dublin investigating the Bachelor&#x27;s Walk massacre. After allowing the initial popular enthusiasm for the war to pass, Pankhurst (who on 8 August decried the &quot;heedless&quot; rush to war of &quot;men-made governments&quot;) and the WSF campaigned against conscription and in solidarity with conscientious objectors. These were positions for which she was attacked in the WSPU newspaper, patriotically renamed &quot;Britannia&quot;.

Pankhurst retained the confidence of some WSPU veterans. She was invited by Elizabeth McCracken to Belfast, where Christabel&#x27;s wartime directive had put a halt to a particularly militant campaign, to speak in support of equal pay for women doing war work. It was a demand Pankhurst championed along with universal food rationing, debt relief and improved allowances for soldiers wives. By helping to shift some the costs of the war off the back of women and poor, she believed that these were measures that might hasten its end.

At the same time, in the East End docks community, the ELFS/WSF sought to offer women practical assistance. They organised &quot;cost-price&quot; canteens, employment in a toy-making cooperative (whose product was in high demand in West-End shops), and (in what had been a pub converted from the Gunmakers&#x27; Arms to the Mothers &#x27; Arms) childcare offered on Montessori principles, a home visiting centre, and free medical care and advice. Not wishing to be diverted by actions that might be interpreted as charity (and for which wealthy patrons had to be solicited), Pankhurst had misgivings. She feared that &quot;organised relief, even the kindliest and most understanding, might introduce some savour of patronage or condescension, and mar our affectionate comradeship, in which we were all equals&quot;. Mitigation was sought in a policy of paying women not less than the minimum wage paid to men in the area and by creating the separate League of Rights for Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Wives and Relatives, in which women who wished to challenge government benefit decisions were encouraged to act collectively. Pankhurst later wrote: It was my great joy that we were stimulating working women to speak up for themselves and their sort, and to master, despite their busy lives, the intricacies of Royal warrants and Army regulations, so as to secure the promised allowances, such as they were, for themselves and their neighbours.In 1915, Pankhurst supported the International Women&#x27;s Peace Congress, held at The Hague. Her sister Christabel, meanwhile, seconded British diplomatic efforts, travelling to Russia after the February 1917 Revolution to rally support for the country&#x27;s continued participation in the war.

The 28 July 1917 edition of her paper appeared under a new title &quot;Worker&#x27;s Dreadnought&quot;—WSF members &quot;realised that solidarity between men and women was essential if they were going to win their fight&quot;— and with a new strap-line, &quot;Socialism. Internationalism, Votes for All&quot;. It printed, three days in advance of &quot;The Times&quot;, Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;wilful defiance of military authority&quot;: his statement that having become &quot;a War of aggression and conquest&quot;, the conflict was being &quot;deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it&quot;. It led to a police raid on the paper&#x27;s offices. The issue of 6 October 1917 advocating a peace referendum among the troops, was destroyed and the type broken up.

In May 1918, the WSF, in line with the paper, was renamed the Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation. Reflecting her growing belief, in the wake of the October Revolution in Russia, that only Soviets could form the &quot;guiding and co-ordinating machinery&quot; for a socialist transformation, Pankhurst refused an invitation to stand for the Sheffield Hallam constituency in the December 1918 &quot;Coupon election&quot;. The WSF did go on to support other socialist candidates, but claimed to do so merely to &quot;make propaganda ... for &quot;the Soviet system [in which] those who make the laws are delegates chosen from amongst the workers themselves&quot;.

== Revolutionary ==

=== Left communist ===

By March 1919, Pankhurst was insisting that the choice was clear: socialists had to build &quot;an industrial republic on Soviet lines,&quot; and abandon the Parliamentary system. Lenin, who in his 1920 thesis &quot;Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot; profiled the WSF, advised Pankhurst that, tactically, the blanket rejection of parliamentarianism is a &quot;mistake&quot;.

In June 1920, the WSF co-hosted the inaugural meeting conference of the Communist Party (BSTI). In preparation for the meeting, Pankhurst published a manifesto in the &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought.&quot; Rather than the developing Leninist model of the party-state and centrally planned economy, it embraced ideas closer to the councilism of the Dutch revolutionary Marxist Antonie Pannekoek and to the anarcho-syndicalism of her partner Silvio Corio. Her contribution was to highlight the potential for extending their models of collective decision-making from the workplace into the domestic sphere. What she called Household Soviets would ensure that &quot;mothers and those who are organisers of the family life of the community&quot; are &quot;adequately represented, and may take their due part in the management of society&quot;

In any event, it was the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), formed by the British Socialist Party in August 1920 (with Montefiore on its provisional council), that gained Moscow&#x27;s approval. In July, Pankhurst had smuggled herself into Soviet Russia to attend the Second Congress of the Comintern. There Lenin personally persuaded her that her objections were less important than unity, and that it would be possible for her to maintain a platform within the CPGB.

On her return, Pankhurst was sufficiently enthused to offer a paean to the new Soviet society:From Russia... I brought away with me a prevailing memory of beautiful, well-grown children and healthy people. It appears that a happy contentment and buoyant, confident enthusiasm is radiating from the active makers of the revolution and builders of the proletarian state, to wider and wider sections of people...In September, with Willie Gallacher Pankhurst called a conference, inviting representatives of the Shop Stewards Movement, the CPGB, the Scottish Worker&#x27;s Committee and the Glasgow Communist Group. All the groups at the conference bar Guy Aldred&#x27;s Glasgow Communist Group agreed to merge with the Communist Party of Great Britain in January 1921.

In the interim, in October 1920, she had been arrested in the offices of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and sentenced to six months for calling on dockers not to load arms for shipment to the anti-Bolshevik forces in Russia. Pankhurst said she considered a hunger strike but was afraid the weapon was no longer available as the government had just allowed Terence MacSwiney, Sinn Féin mayor of Cork, to die in Brixton Prison.

While in Holloway, Pankhurst wrote poems published in 1922 as &quot;Writ on Cold Slate&quot;. &quot;Above all&quot; they are the stories of her cellmates – &quot;the young and the old, the homeless and the hungry, mothers, pregnant women and babies born in captivity – &#x27;dregs from the ancient system&#x27;s wheel of waste&#x27;&quot;.

=== Break with Moscow ===
In September 1921, arguing that there had to be &quot;free expression and circulation of opinion within the Party&quot; and &quot;an independent Communist voice, free to express its mind unhampered by Party discipline&quot;, Pankhurst refused to hand over control of the &quot;Workers Dreadnought&quot; to the CPGB, and was expelled.

In an &quot;Open Letter to Lenin&quot; in November, Pankhurst warned that the Bolsheviks had begun to &quot;desert communism&quot; and, by default, were opening Europe to path taken in Italy by the Fascisti. She had serialised Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s 1918 critique of Bolshevik policy, and had herself repeated Luxemburg&#x27;s charge that in sanctioning the division of the land into small peasant holdings, the Bolsheviks had betrayed the revolution. She had also opened the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; to Alexandra Kollontai&#x27;s &quot;The Workers&#x27; Opposition&quot;, a critique of the developing Soviet bureaucracy, and to appeals from anarchists in Bolshevik prisons.

By July 1923, Pankhurst concluded that &quot;the term &#x27;dictatorship of the proletariat&#x27; has been used to justify the dictatorship of a party clique of officials over their own party members and over the people at large&quot;. Socialism, as interpreted by the Bolsheviks, had been stripped of its emancipatory promise. In one of her last contributions to &quot;Dreadnought&quot; on the subject of Soviet regime she wrote:The Bolsheviks pose now as the prophets of centralised efficiency, trustification, State control and the discipline of the proletariat in the name of increased production... Russian workers remain wage slaves, and very poor ones, working, not from free will, but under compulsion of economic need, and kept in their subordinate position by ... State coercion.Stirred by the example in Germany of the General Workers&#x27; Union (AAUD), and on the principle, advanced by Antonie Pannekoek, that Communism can be achieved only by workers &quot;acting where they stand in the process of production&quot;, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; group called for an &quot;All-Workers Revolutionary Union&quot; (AWRU). This was to organise on industrial unionist lines, with recallable delegates elected, in rising succession, from workshops, factories, districts, and regions to national councils. With this One Big Union programme, in February 1922 they formed themselves as the Communist Workers&#x27; Party (CWP).

When in July 1923 the CWP announced its campaign to build the AWRU, it was with the admission that they had no funds and very few people. It had managed to established just three branches outside London, in Sheffield, Plymouth and Portsmouth. Despite optimism concerning a rise in revolutionary sentiment, by the end of 1923 the CWP had dissolved.

On 14 June 1924, &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; itself ceased publication. This was not before raising the alarm at the triumph fascism in Italy, condemning the then-Communist condoned white labourism in South Africa&#x27;s Rand Rebellion, and employing its first black correspondent, the Jamaican writer Claude McKay. With McKay, Pankhurst shared outrage at the &quot;Daily Herald&#x27;s&quot; campaign against the French employment of black colonial troops in Germany.

== Writer ==
With her partner, the Italian libertarian socialist Silvio Erasmus Corio, Pankhurst retired to a cottage in then rural Woodford Green, Essex (now in the London Borough of Redbridge)&quot;.&quot;

While Corio ran a tearoom, Pankhurst researched and wrote an eclectic series of books: an anti-colonial historical-cultural treatise. &quot;India and the Earthly Paradise&quot; (1926); a promotion of the international auxiliary language Latino sine flexione, &quot;Delphos, or the future of International Language&quot; (1928); &quot;Save the Mothers: A plea for measures to prevent the annual loss of about 3000 child-bearing mothers and 20,000 infant lives in England and Wales and a similar grievous wastage in other countries&quot; (1930); her largely autobiographical accounts,&quot;The Suffragette Movement&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Home Front&quot; (1932); and a biography of her mother, &quot;The Life of Emmeline Pankhurst&quot; (1935), who, since the birth of Pankhurst&#x27;s son Richard in 1927, had broken off all contact.

==Anti-imperialism and anti-fascism==
While the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; did not take a consistent line on the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, an editorial written by Pankhurst on the event stated in part that: &quot;Justice can make but one reply to the Irish rebellion and that is the demand that Ireland should be allowed to govern itself&quot;. She placed the rising in the context of the limitations of the Irish Home Rule movement, and argued that &quot;[everybody] knows it was the Carsonites who first armed&quot;. She claimed that the rebels were animated by &quot;high ideals&quot;, and stated that the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; &quot;[understands] why rebellion breaks out in Ireland and we share the sorrow of those who are weeping today for the rebels whom the government has shot.&quot;

In commentary on the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; suggested that &quot;with their industries being destroyed by English capitalists, and with their lives always in danger from the military . . . Irish men and women are compelled to become Communists in word and deed&quot;. The paper was open to assertions of James Connolly&#x27;s daughter Nora that with &quot;the awakening of a revolutionary spirit (caused by the insurrection of 1916) has come an intensive growth of revolutionary thought&quot;. In the event, Pankhurst was disappointed by the outcome: the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 described in the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; as &quot;a sad, humiliating compromise of the stand for a completely independent Irish Republic&quot;.

In &quot;India and the Earthly Paradise&quot;, published in Bombay in 1926, Pankhurst claimed that the social and family structures in ancient India resembled the essential features of communism: equality, fraternity and mutuality. She further argued in the work that these structures were corrupted and destroyed by priests, monarchies and successive wave of foreign invaders, citing the caste system in India to support her arguments. The work has been described as a &quot;&#x27;romantic Communist&#x27; contribution to Indian nationalism&quot; which may have been the &quot;result of [Pankhurst&#x27;s] contacts with fringe elements of that movement&quot;. Though she was unable to find a publisher for the work in Britain, Pankhurst continued to involve herself on Indian affairs. She participated in protests against the slow progress of the Indian Home Rule movement and criticised the Royal Air Force&#x27;s use of aerial bombing during the Saya San Rebellion in Burma and Pink&#x27;s War in the North-West Frontier. In 1935, Pankhurst commissioned the Anti–Air War Memorial in Woodford Green, London as &quot;a protest against war in the air&quot;.

In 1934, the French feminist Gabrielle Duchêne organized the World Assembly of Women, and chaired its World Committee of Women against War and Fascism (CMF: &quot;Comité mondial des femmes contre la guerre et le fascisme&quot;).
Pankhurst was among the non-Communist British sponsors of the Committee along with Charlotte Despard, Ellen Wilkinson, Vera Brittain and Storm Jameson, the Six Point Group and the National Union of Women Teachers. In 1935 the Committee pooled resources with the League against Imperialism and the West-African &quot;Union des Travailleurs Nègres&quot; to promote freedom of speech and to protest repression throughout the European colonial empires. The Women&#x27;s World Committee was active in support of the International Committee for the Defence of the Ethiopian People, which held its first meeting on 2 September 1935 before the Italian invasion of Ethiopia was launched in October 1935.

Having already in her Open Letter to Lenin (1922) identified Fascism as a gathering threat in Europe, Pankhurst acted in support of Italian exiles (her partner Silvio Corio among them). She was a founding member of the anti-fascist Friends of Italian Freedom, the Italian Information Bureau and the Women&#x27;s International Matteotti Committee. Later, in the 1930s, she became a vice-president of the League for the Boycott of Aggressor Nations and the Anti-Nazi Council which sought trade embargoes against Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and Hitler&#x27;s Germany. To George Bernard Shaw (who professed to be &quot;unmoved&quot; by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti) she wrote (9 July 1935):You have said that &quot;liberty, as understood by the upholders of capitalism, is a putrefying corpse&quot;. To a large extent you are right, for if people are slaves of economic stress, as so many are everywhere today, they often find themselves unable to exercise the liberty of standing up for their convictions as they would desire, but at least in the non-Fascist countries, most of us are able to do propaganda for our convictions, as you and I do.Pankhurst wrote to Winston Churchill, her constituency MP, concurring with him on the need for a more resolute foreign policy, but was unable to persuade him of the need for immediate action against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.

In 2004, the release of previously classified government files revealed that throughout the 1930s and 1940s MI5 had monitored Ms Pankhurst&#x27;s movements and intercepted her letters and telephone calls.

== Involvement in Ethiopia ==

From 1936, MI5 monitored Pankhurst&#x27;s correspondence. In 1940 she wrote to Viscount Swinton, then chairing a committee investigating Fifth Columnists, and enclosed lists of active Fascists still at large and of anti-Fascists who had been interned. A copy of this letter on MI5&#x27;s file carries a note in Swinton&#x27;s hand reading: &quot;I should think a most doubtful source of information.&quot; Meanwhile, the authorities took an increasingly grim view of her anti-colonial agitation, heightened from 1935 as she became &quot;the main protagonist of the &#x27;print activism&#x27;&quot; in the cause of Ethiopia.

In July 1935, representing the Women&#x27;s Committee against War and Fascism, Pankhurst together with George Brown (League of Coloured Peoples), Reginald Reynolds (No More War movement) and Reginald Bridgeman (League against Imperialism) organised a public protest in support of Ethiopia at Essex Hall in London. After the Italian invasion commenced in October, she began publication of &quot;The New Times and Ethiopia News&quot;. As well as reporting Italian atrocities in Ethiopia (and from July 1936, Francoist atrocities in Spain), it provided an outlet for anti-colonialist writers elsewhere in Africa. Nancy Cunard, for whom it was no accident that the Spanish fascist rebellion first broke out in an African colony (Spanish Morocco), also wrote for the paper, as did Jawaharlal Nehru.

Pankhurst visited Ethiopia in 1944 after it had been liberated by Allied forces from Italian occupation, and criticised what she perceived as British ambitions to take over the region. In another visit which lasted from 1950 to 1951, she visited Eritrea, which was then under a British military administration. Pankhurst observed the administration&#x27;s dismantlement of Italian-built port installations in Eritrea, which were sent to India and Kenya as war reparations, criticising the policy in a pamphlet titled &quot;Why are we destroying the Eritrean ports?&quot; In opposition to the British authorities, she supported Eritrea, Djibouti and Somaliland becoming part of Ethiopia. In 1947, a Foreign Office official commented that &quot;we agree with you... that this horrible old harridan should be choked to death with her own pamphlets&quot;.

&quot;The New Times and Ethiopia News&quot; remained in circulation for 20 years and at its height sold 40,000 copies weekly. This included an extensive circulation throughout West Africa and the West Indies. In 1956, the Governor of Jamaica, Sir Hugh Foot, was informed that Pankhurst&#x27;s paper was radicalising a &quot;sect&quot; who called themselves the &quot;Rastafari&quot;. At the same time, he was cautioned that she could be relied upon to &quot;react violently to any suggestion that her paper should not be made available to all and sundry&quot;. In some Crown colonies, such as Sierra Leone from where the nationalist I. T. A. Wallace Johnson contributed pieces, the paper had, indeed, been banned.

=== Friendship with Haile Selassie ===
Pankhurst did have political contact with T. Ras Makonnen, the West Indian pan-Africanist (a Guyanese of Ethiopian descent), but there is no indication that she was engaged with the new spiritual movement in Jamaica. Such, nonetheless, was her seeming hagiography of Haile Selassie that she has since been proposed as the &quot;first white Rastafarian&quot;.

Her biographer Patricia Romero suggests that Pankhurst was overwhelmed by Haile Selassie so that &quot;her republicanism departed from Waterloo station in June 1936, when the emperor&#x27;s train rolled in&quot; and she encountered him for the first time. Others explain the devotional relationship, at least in part, by reference to her strong anti-imperialist, anti-fascist and anti-racist sympathies: &quot;Pankhurst loved to defend the underdog and she saw in Selassie much more a defeated victim of fascism than a reactionary monarch&quot;. According to her son, Richard, her mother did not hesitate to tell Haile Selassie that, as a life-long republican, she supported him only because of the cause he represented, and that while she was cautious about involving herself in Ethiopia&#x27;s domestic politics, she did voice support for trade unions and for universal suffrage.

In 1956, encouraged by Haile Selassie to aid with women&#x27;s development, Pankhurst and her son Richard moved into an imperial guest house in the Ethiopian capital to Addis Ababa (Corio had died in 1954). She raised funds for Ethiopia&#x27;s first teaching hospital, and wrote extensively on Ethiopian art and culture. She dedicated &quot;Ethiopia: A Cultural History&quot; (1955) to Haile Selassie: &quot;Guardian of Education, Pioneer of Progress, Leader and Defender of his People in Peace and War&quot;.

==Death and commemoration==

Pankhurst died in Addis Ababa in 1960, aged 78, and received a full state funeral at which Haile Selassie named her &quot;an honorary Ethiopian&quot;. She is the only foreigner buried in front of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, in a section reserved for patriots of the Italian war.

Pankhurst&#x27;s name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, Westminster, London. There is a two-dimensional silhouette constructed of Corten steel representing Pankhurst as a campaigning suffragette in Mile End Park, Bethnal Green, London. She is also the subject of a mural, completed 2018 by Jerome Davenport, on the gable-end of the Lord Morpeth pub on Old Ford Road in Bow, London. It is next door to the house in which she lived between 1914 and 1924 while working with the ELFS and WSF.

In October 2022, London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre announced for 25 January 2023 the world premiere of &quot;Sylvia&quot;, a hip hop musical about Pankhurst. Directed and choreographed by Kate Prince, it seek to tell her story to &quot;younger and more diverse audiences&quot;.

==Family==
Pankhurst objected in principle to entering into a marriage and to taking a husband&#x27;s name. Near the end of the First World War, she began living with Italian anarchist Silvio Corio and moved to Woodford Green, where she lived for over 30 years — a blue plaque and Pankhurst Green opposite London Underground&#x27;s Woodford tube station commemorate her ties to the area. At Woodford Green in 1927, at the age of 45, she gave birth to a son, Richard. As she refused to marry the child&#x27;s father, her mother broke ties with her and did not speak to her again. Richard became a leading student of Ethiopian history and the first director of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at Addis Ababa University. His son, Pankhurst&#x27;s grandson, Alula Pankhurst is an Ethiopian scholar and social development consultant in Addis Ababa, and has been a contributor to the &quot;Ethiopia Observer&quot; which continues to publish.

== Art ==
From an early age Pankhurst had an ambition to become a &quot;painter and draughtsman in the service of the great movements for social betterment&quot;. She trained at Manchester School of Art (1900–02) and then the Royal College of Art in London (1904–06). As part of her work campaigning for the WSPU, for which she created designs for a range of banners, jewellery and graphic logos. Her motif of the &#x27;angel of freedom&#x27;, a trumpeting emblem had wider appeal across the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, appearing on banners, political pamphlets, cups and saucers.

An exhibition of her artistic works took place at Tate Britain in 2013–14. Information about the exhibition, together with photographs of the artwork itself, is part of the Sheffield Hallam University Research Archive.

Pankhurst found it difficult to reconcile her artistic vocation with her political activities, eventually deciding that they were incompatible. She said: &quot;Mothers came to me with their wasted little ones. I saw starvation look at me from patient eyes. I knew that I should never return to my art&quot;. By 1912, she had all but abandoned her artistic career in order to concentrate on her political activism.

<text>Elegance is beauty that shows unusual effectiveness and simplicity.

Elegance is frequently used as a standard of tastefulness, particularly in visual design, decorative arts, literature, science, and the aesthetics of mathematics.

Elegant things often exhibit refined and suggest maturity, and in the case of mathematics, a deep mastery of the subject matter.

==General concept==
Essential components of the concept include simplicity and consistency of design, focusing on the essential features of an object. In art of any kind one might also require dignified grace, or restrained beauty of style.

Visual stimuli are frequently considered elegant, if a small number of colors and stimuli are used, emphasizing the remainder.

==In philosophy of science==
In the philosophy of science, there are two concepts referring to two aspects of simplicity: elegance (syntactic simplicity), which means the number and complexity of hypotheses, and parsimony (ontological simplicity), which is the number and complexity of things postulated.

==In mathematics==

In mathematical problem solving, the solution to a problem (such as a proof of a mathematical theorem) exhibits mathematical elegance if it is surprisingly simple and insightful yet effective and constructive. Such solutions might involve a minimal amount of assumptions and computations, while outlining an approach that is highly generalizable. Similarly, a computer program or algorithm is elegant if it uses a small amount of code to great effect.

==In engineering==

In engineering, a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems that are not thought to be inter-related.
Elegance can arguably be measured for engineering problems as the ratio of problem complexity to that of solution complexity. Thus a simple (low complexity) solution to a problem of high complexity is seen as elegant. This measure does not advise of process to produce elegant solutions, and is merely a way of comparing between multiple solutions for elegance assessment.

==In chemistry==

In chemistry, chemists might look for &quot;elegance&quot; in theory, method, technique and procedure. For example, elegance might comprise creative parsimony and versatility in the utilization of resources, in the manipulation of materials, and in the effectiveness in syntheses and analysis.

==In pharmacy==

In pharmacy, elegance in formulation is important for quality as well as for effectiveness in dosage form design, a major component of pharmaceuticals.

==In fashion==

The concept of elegance in fashion is often associated with the modern taste for subtraction and understatement that capitalistic societies have developed to convey a sense of status. Unlike similar concepts such as glamour, elegance is a unisex practice, and it was initially developed amongst the male ruling classes after the French Revolution. Elegance was later adopted by ladieswear, from the 20th century onwards. This approach to clothes based on subtraction and understatement is pursued by the upper classes to avoid vulgarity, hence belonging to a lower social status. Several elements that determine the adoption of elegance and its rule have been recognized: a key role is played by class, gender, morality and taste.

<text>A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department stores. The term &quot;mall&quot; originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it, but in the late 1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping centers that were becoming increasingly commonplace. In the United Kingdom and other countries, shopping malls may be called &quot;shopping centres&quot;.

In recent decades, malls have declined considerably in North America, particularly in subprime locations, and some have closed and become so-called &quot;dead malls&quot;. Successful exceptions have added entertainment and experiential features, added big-box stores as anchors, or converted to other specialized shopping center formats such as power centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, and festival marketplaces. In Canada, shopping centres have frequently been replaced with mixed-use high-rise communities. In many European countries and Asian countries, shopping malls continue to grow and thrive.
== Terminology ==

In the United States, Persian Gulf countries, and India, the term &quot;shopping mall&quot; is usually applied to enclosed retail structures (and is generally abbreviated to simply &quot;mall&quot;), while &quot;shopping center&quot; usually refers to open-air retail complexes; both types of facilities usually have large parking lots, face major traffic arterials, and have few pedestrian connections to surrounding neighborhoods. Outside of North America, the terms &quot;shopping precinct&quot; and &quot;shopping arcade&quot; are also used.

In the UK, such complexes are considered &quot;shopping centres&quot;; however, &quot;shopping centre&quot; covers many more sizes and types of centers than the North American &quot;mall&quot;. Other countries follow UK usage. In Canadian English, and often in Australia and New Zealand, the term &quot;mall&quot; may be used informally but &quot;shopping centre&quot; or merely &quot;centre&quot; will feature in the name of the complex (such as Toronto Eaton Centre). The term &quot;mall&quot; is less-commonly a part of the name of the complex.
==Types==

The International Council of Shopping Centers, based in New York City, classifies two types of shopping centers as malls: regional malls and super regional malls. A regional mall, per the International Council of Shopping Centers, is a shopping mall with to gross leasable area with at least two anchor stores. A super-regional mall, per the International Council of Shopping Centers, is a shopping mall with over of gross leasable area, three or more anchors, mass merchant, more variety, fashion apparel, and serves as the dominant shopping venue for the region () in which it is located. Not classified as malls are smaller formats such as strip malls and neighborhood shopping centers, and specialized formats such as power centers, festival marketplaces, and outlet centers.

==History==
===Forerunners to the shopping mall===
Shopping centers in general may have their origins in public markets and, in the Middle East, covered bazaars.

In 1798, the first covered shopping passage was built in Paris, the Passage du Caire. The Royal Opera arcade in London opened in 1816, and the more famous Burlington Arcade in 1819. The Arcade in Providence, Rhode Island, built in 1828, claims to be the first shopping arcade in the United States. Western European cities in particular built many arcade-style shopping centers. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, which opened in 1877, was larger than its predecessors, and inspired the use of the term &quot;galleria&quot; for many other shopping arcades and malls.

In the mid-20th century, with the rise of the suburb and automobile culture in the United States, a new style of shopping center was created away from downtowns. Early shopping centers designed for the automobile include Market Square, Lake Forest, Illinois (1916), and Country Club Plaza, Kansas City, Missouri (1924).

The suburban shopping center concept evolved further in the United States after World War II, with larger open-air shopping centers anchored by major department stores, such as the Broadway-Crenshaw Center in Los Angeles, built in 1947 and anchored by a five-story Broadway and a May Company California.

===Downtown pedestrian malls and use of term &quot;mall&quot;===
In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the term &quot;shopping mall&quot; was first used, but in the original sense of the word &quot;mall&quot;, meaning a pedestrian promenade in the U.S., or in U.K. usage, a &quot;shopping precinct&quot;. Early downtown pedestrianized malls included the Kalamazoo Mall (the first, in 1959), &quot;Shoppers&#x27; See-Way&quot; in Toledo, Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach, Santa Monica Mall (1965).

Although Bergen Mall opened in 1957 using the name &quot;mall&quot; and inspired other suburban shopping centers to rebrand themselves as malls, these types of properties were still referred to as &quot;shopping centers&quot; until the late 1960s.

===Enclosed malls===

The enclosed shopping center, which would eventually be known as the shopping mall, did not appear in mainstream until the mid-1950s. One of the earliest examples was the Valley Fair Shopping Center in Appleton, Wisconsin, which opened on March 10, 1955. Valley Fair featured a number of modern features including central heating and cooling, a large outdoor parking area, semi-detached anchor stores, and restaurants. Later that year the world&#x27;s first fully enclosed shopping mall was opened in Luleå, in northern Sweden (architect: Ralph Erskine) and was named &quot;Shopping&quot;; the region now claims the highest shopping center density in Europe.

The idea of a regionally-sized, fully enclosed shopping complex was pioneered in 1956 by the Austrian-born architect and American immigrant Victor Gruen. This new generation of regional-size shopping centers began with the Gruen-designed Southdale Center, which opened in the Twin Cities suburb of Edina, Minnesota, United States in October 1956. For pioneering the soon-to-be enormously popular mall concept in this form, Gruen has been called the &quot;most influential architect of the twentieth century&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell.

The first retail complex to be promoted as a &quot;mall&quot; was Paramus, New Jersey&#x27;s Bergen Mall, which opened with an open-air format on November 14, 1957, and was later enclosed in 1973. Aside from Southdale Center, significant early enclosed shopping malls were Harundale Mall (1958) in Glen Burnie, Maryland, Big Town Mall (1959) in Mesquite, Texas, Chris-Town Mall (1961) in Phoenix, Arizona, and Randhurst Center (1962) in Mount Prospect, Illinois.

Other early malls moved retailing away from the dense, commercial downtowns into the largely residential suburbs. This formula (enclosed space with stores attached, away from downtown, and accessible only by automobile) became a popular way to build retail across the world. Gruen himself came to abhor this effect of his new design; he decried the creation of enormous &quot;land wasting seas of parking&quot; and the spread of suburban sprawl.

Even though malls mostly appeared in suburban areas in the U.S., some U.S. cities facilitated the construction of enclosed malls downtown as an effort to revive city centers and allow them to compete effectively with suburban malls. Examples included Main Place Mall in Buffalo (1969) and The Gallery (1977, now Fashion District Philadelphia) in Philadelphia. Other cities created open-air pedestrian malls.

In the United States, developers such as A. Alfred Taubman of Taubman Centers extended the concept further in 1980, with terrazzo tiles at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, indoor fountains, and two levels allowing a shopper to make a circuit of all the stores. Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed. Fading daylight through glass panels was supplemented by gradually increased electric lighting, making it seem like the afternoon was lasting longer, which encouraged shoppers to linger.

===Decline of shopping malls in the United States===

In the United States, in the mid-1990s, malls were still being constructed at a rate of 140 a year. But in 2001, a PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that underperforming and vacant malls, known as &quot;greyfield&quot; and &quot;dead mall&quot; estates, were an emerging problem. In 2007, a year before the Great Recession, no new malls were built in America, for the first time in 50 years. City Creek Center Mall in Salt Lake City, which opened in March 2012, was the first to be built since the recession.

Malls began to lose consumers to open-air power centers and lifestyle centers during the 1990s, as consumers preferred to park right in front of and walk directly into big-box stores with lower prices and without the overhead of traditional malls (i.e., long enclosed corridors).

Another issue was that the growth-crazed American commercial real estate industry had simply built too many nice places to shop—far more than could be reasonably justified by the actual growth of the American population, retail sales, or any other economic indicator. The number of American shopping centers exploded from 4,500 in 1960 to 70,000 by 1986 to just under 108,000 by 2010.

Thus, the number of dead malls increased significantly in the early 21st century. The economic health of malls across the United States has been in decline, as revealed by high vacancy rates. From 2006 to 2010, the percentage of malls that are considered to be &quot;dying&quot; by real estate experts (have a vacancy rate of at least 40%), unhealthy (20–40%), or in trouble (10–20%) all increased greatly, and these high vacancy rates only partially decreased from 2010 to 2014. In 2014, nearly 3% of all malls in the United States were considered to be &quot;dying&quot; (40% or higher vacancy rates) and nearly one-fifth of all malls had vacancy rates considered &quot;troubling&quot; (10% or higher). Some real estate experts say the &quot;fundamental problem&quot; is a glut of malls in many parts of the country creating a market that is &quot;extremely over-retailed&quot;. By the time shopping mall operator Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield decided to exit the American market in 2022, the United States had an average of 24.5 square feet of retail space per capita (in contrast to 4.5 square feet per capita in Europe).

In 2019, The Shops &amp; Restaurants at Hudson Yards opened as an upscale mall in New York City with &quot;a &#x27;Fifth Avenue&#x27; mix of shops&quot;, such as H&amp;M, Zara, and Sephora below them. This is one of the first two malls built recently, along with American Dream in which both opened in 2019 since City Creek Center.

Online shopping has also emerged as a major competitor to shopping malls. In the United States, online shopping has accounted for an increasing share of total retail sales. In 2013, roughly 200 out of 1,300 malls across the United States were going out of business. To combat this trend, developers have converted malls into other uses including attractions such as parks, movie theaters, gyms, and even fishing lakes. In the United States, the 600,000 square foot Highland Mall will be a campus for Austin Community College. In France, the So Ouest mall outside of Paris was designed to resemble elegant, Louis XV-style apartments and includes of green space. The Australian mall company Westfield launched an online mall (and later a mobile app) with 150 stores, 3,000 brands and over 1 million products.

The COVID-19 pandemic also significantly impacted the retail industry. Government regulations temporarily closed malls, increased entrance controls, and imposed strict public sanitation requirements.

==Design==

===Vertical malls===
High land prices in populous cities have led to the concept of the &quot;vertical mall&quot;, in which space allocated to retail is configured over a number of stories accessible by elevators and/or escalators (usually both) linking the different levels of the mall. The challenge of this type of mall is to overcome the natural tendency of shoppers to move horizontally and encourage shoppers to move upwards and downwards. The concept of a vertical mall was originally conceived in the late 1960s by the Mafco Company, former shopping center development division of Marshall Field &amp; Co. The Water Tower Place skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois was built in 1975 by Urban Retail Properties. It contains a hotel, luxury condominiums, and office space and sits atop a block-long base containing an eight-level atrium-style retail mall that fronts on the Magnificent Mile.

Vertical malls are common in densely populated conurbations in East and Southeast Asia. Hong Kong in particular has numerous examples such as Times Square, Dragon Centre, Apm, Langham Place, ISQUARE, Hysan Place and The One.

A vertical mall may also be built where the geography prevents building outward or there are other restrictions on construction, such as historic buildings or significant archeology. The Darwin Shopping Centre and associated malls in Shrewsbury, UK, are built on the side of a steep hill, around the former town walls; consequently the shopping center is split over seven floors vertically – two locations horizontally – connected by elevators, escalators and bridge walkways. Some establishments incorporate such designs into their layout, such as Shrewsbury&#x27;s former McDonald&#x27;s, split into four stories with multiple mezzanines which featured medieval castle vaults – complete with arrowslits – in the basement dining rooms.

==Components==
===Food court===

A common feature of shopping malls is a food court: this typically consists of a number of fast food vendors of various types, surrounding a shared seating area.

===Department stores===

When the shopping mall format was developed by Victor Gruen in the mid-1950s, signing larger department stores was necessary for the financial stability of the projects, and to draw retail traffic that would result in visits to the smaller stores in the mall as well. These larger stores are termed anchor stores or draw tenants. In physical configuration, anchor stores are normally located as far from each other as possible to maximize the amount of traffic from one anchor to another.

==Regional differences==

===Europe===
There are a reported 222 malls in Europe. In 2014, these malls had combined sales of US$12.47 billion. This represented a 10% bump in revenues from the prior year.

====U.K. and Ireland====
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, both open-air and enclosed centers are commonly referred to as &quot;shopping centres&quot;. &quot;Mall&quot; primarily refers to either a shopping mall – a place where a collection of shops all adjoin a pedestrian area – or an exclusively pedestrianized street that allows shoppers to walk without interference from vehicle traffic.

The majority of British enclosed shopping centres, the equivalent of a U.S. mall, are located in city centres, usually found in old and historic shopping districts and surrounded by subsidiary open air shopping streets. Large examples include Westquay in Southampton; Manchester Arndale; Bullring Birmingham; Liverpool One; Trinity Leeds; Buchanan Galleries in Glasgow; St James Quarter in Edinburgh; and Eldon Square in Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to the inner city shopping centres, large UK conurbations will also have large out-of-town &quot;regional malls&quot; such as the Metrocentre in Gateshead; Meadowhall Centre, Sheffield serving South Yorkshire; the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester; White Rose Centre in Leeds; the Merry Hill Centre near Dudley; and Bluewater in Kent. These centres were built in the 1980s and 1990s, but planning regulations prohibit the construction of any more. Out-of-town shopping developments in the UK are now focused on retail parks, which consist of groups of warehouse style shops with individual entrances from outdoors. Planning policy prioritizes the development of existing town centres, although with patchy success. Westfield London (White City) is the largest shopping centre in Europe.

====Russia====
In Russia, on the other hand, a large number of new malls had been built near major cities, notably the MEGA malls such as Mega Belaya Dacha mall near Moscow. In large part they were financed by international investors and were popular with shoppers from the emerging middle class.

==Management and legal issues==
===Shopping property management firms===

A shopping property management firm is a company that specializes in owning and managing shopping malls. Most shopping property management firms own at least 20 malls. Some firms use a similar naming scheme for most of their malls; for example, Mills Corporation puts &quot;Mills&quot; in most of its mall names and SM Prime Holdings of the Philippines puts &quot;SM&quot; in all of its malls, as well as anchor stores such as The SM Store, SM Appliance Center, SM Hypermarket, SM Cinema, and SM Supermarket. In the UK, The Mall Fund changes the name of any center it buys to &quot;The Mall (location)&quot;, using its pink-M logo; when it sells a mall the center reverts to its own name and branding, such as the Ashley Centre in Epsom. Similarly, following its rebranding from Capital Shopping Centres, intu Properties renamed many of its centres to &quot;intu (name/location)&quot; (such as intu Lakeside); again, malls removed from the network revert to their own brand (see for instance The Glades in Bromley).

===Legal issues===
One controversial aspect of malls has been their effective displacement of traditional main streets or high streets. Some consumers prefer malls, with their parking garages, controlled environments, and private security guards, over central business districts (CBD) or downtowns, which frequently have limited parking, poor maintenance, outdoor weather, and limited police coverage.

In response, a few jurisdictions, notably California, have expanded the right of freedom of speech to ensure that speakers will be able to reach consumers who prefer to shop, eat, and socialize within the boundaries of privately owned malls. The Supreme Court decision &quot;Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins&quot; was issued on 9 June 1980 which affirmed the decision of the California Supreme Court in a case that arose out of a free speech dispute between the Pruneyard Shopping Center in Campbell, California, and several local high school students.

==World&#x27;s largest malls==
This is a list of the world&#x27;s largest shopping malls based on their gross leasable area (GLA), with a GLA of at least .


===Combination retail and wholesale shopping malls===
Some wholesale market complexes also function as shopping malls in that they contain retail space which operate as stores in normal malls do but also act as producer vendor outlets that can take large orders for export.

<text>A sensor is often defined as a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. The stimulus is the quantity, property, or condition that is sensed and converted into electrical signal.

In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. 

Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors.

Analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. Their applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. There is a wide range of other sensors that measure chemical and physical properties of materials, including optical sensors for refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement, and electro-chemical sensors for monitoring pH of fluids.

A sensor&#x27;s sensitivity indicates how much its output changes when the input quantity it measures changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, its sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.

Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today&#x27;s world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance. Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.

==Classification of measurement errors==
A good sensor obeys the following rules:

* it is sensitive to the measured property
* it is insensitive to any other property likely to be encountered in its application, and
* it does not influence the measured property.

Most sensors have a linear transfer function. The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio between the output signal and measured property. For example, if a sensor measures temperature and has a voltage output, the sensitivity is constant with the units [V/K]. The sensitivity is the slope of the transfer function. Converting the sensor&#x27;s electrical output (for example V) to the measured units (for example K) requires dividing the electrical output by the slope (or multiplying by its reciprocal). In addition, an offset is frequently added or subtracted. For example, −40 must be added to the output if 0 V output corresponds to −40 C input.

For an analog sensor signal to be processed or used in digital equipment, it needs to be converted to a digital signal, using an analog-to-digital converter.

===Sensor deviations===
Since sensors cannot replicate an ideal transfer function, several types of deviations can occur which limit sensor accuracy:
* Since the range of the output signal is always limited, the output signal will eventually reach a minimum or maximum when the measured property exceeds the limits. The full scale range defines the maximum and minimum values of the measured property. 
* The sensitivity may in practice differ from the value specified. This is called a sensitivity error. This is an error in the slope of a linear transfer function.
* If the output signal differs from the correct value by a constant, the sensor has an offset error or bias. This is an error in the y-intercept of a linear transfer function.
* Nonlinearity is deviation of a sensor&#x27;s transfer function from a straight line transfer function. Usually, this is defined by the amount the output differs from ideal behavior over the full range of the sensor, often noted as a percentage of the full range.
* Deviation caused by rapid changes of the measured property over time is a dynamic error. Often, this behavior is described with a bode plot showing sensitivity error and phase shift as a function of the frequency of a periodic input signal.
* If the output signal slowly changes independent of the measured property, this is defined as drift. Long term drift over months or years is caused by physical changes in the sensor.
* Noise is a random deviation of the signal that varies in time.
* A hysteresis error causes the output value to vary depending on the previous input values. If a sensor&#x27;s output is different depending on whether a specific input value was reached by increasing vs. decreasing the input, then the sensor has a hysteresis error.
* If the sensor has a digital output, the output is essentially an approximation of the measured property. This error is also called quantization error.
* If the signal is monitored digitally, the sampling frequency can cause a dynamic error, or if the input variable or added noise changes periodically at a frequency near a multiple of the sampling rate, aliasing errors may occur.
* The sensor may to some extent be sensitive to properties other than the property being measured. For example, most sensors are influenced by the temperature of their environment.

All these deviations can be classified as systematic errors or random errors. Systematic errors can sometimes be compensated for by means of some kind of calibration strategy. Noise is a random error that can be reduced by signal processing, such as filtering, usually at the expense of the dynamic behavior of the sensor.

===Resolution===
The &quot;sensor resolution&quot; or &quot;measurement resolution&quot; is the smallest change that can be detected in the quantity that is being measured. The resolution of a sensor with a digital output is usually the numerical resolution of the digital output. The resolution is related to the precision with which the measurement is made, but they are not the same thing. A sensor&#x27;s accuracy may be considerably worse than its resolution.

* For example, the distance resolution is the minimum distance that can be accurately measured by any distance-measuring devices. In a time-of-flight camera, the distance resolution is usually equal to the standard deviation (total noise) of the signal expressed in unit of length.
* The sensor may to some extent be sensitive to properties other than the property being measured. For example, most sensors are influenced by the temperature of their environment.

==Chemical sensor==
A chemical sensor is a self-contained analytical device that can provide information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a liquid or a gas phase. The information is provided in the form of a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the concentration of a certain chemical species (termed as analyte). Two main steps are involved in the functioning of a chemical sensor, namely, recognition and transduction. In the recognition step, analyte molecules interact selectively with receptor molecules or sites included in the structure of the recognition element of the sensor. Consequently, a characteristic physical parameter varies and this variation is reported by means of an integrated transducer that generates the output signal.
A chemical sensor based on recognition material of biological nature is a biosensor. However, as synthetic biomimetic materials are going to substitute to some extent recognition biomaterials, a sharp distinction between a biosensor and a standard chemical sensor is superfluous. Typical biomimetic materials used in sensor development are molecularly imprinted polymers and aptamers.

==Biosensor==

In biomedicine and biotechnology, sensors which detect analytes thanks to a biological component, such as cells, protein, nucleic acid or biomimetic polymers, are called biosensors.
Whereas a non-biological sensor, even organic (carbon chemistry), for biological analytes is referred to as sensor or nanosensor. This terminology applies for both in-vitro and in vivo applications.
The encapsulation of the biological component in biosensors, presents a slightly different problem that ordinary sensors; this can either be done by means of a semipermeable barrier, such as a dialysis membrane or a hydrogel, or a 3D polymer matrix, which either physically constrains the sensing macromolecule or chemically constrains the macromolecule by bounding it to the scaffold.

==Neuromorphic sensors==
Neuromorphic sensors are sensors that physically mimic structures and functions of biological neural entities. One example of this is the event camera.

==MOS sensors==
The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, MOSFET sensors (MOS sensors) were later developed, and they have since been widely used to measure physical, chemical, biological and environmental parameters.

===Biochemical sensors===
A number of MOSFET sensors have been developed, for measuring physical, chemical, biological, and environmental parameters. The earliest MOSFET sensors include the open-gate field-effect transistor (OGFET) introduced by Johannessen in 1970, the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) invented by Piet Bergveld in 1970, the adsorption FET (ADFET) patented by P.F. Cox in 1974, and a hydrogen-sensitive MOSFET demonstrated by I. Lundstrom, M.S. Shivaraman, C.S. Svenson and L. Lundkvist in 1975. The ISFET is a special type of MOSFET with a gate at a certain distance, and where the metal gate is replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. The ISFET is widely used in biomedical applications, such as the detection of DNA hybridization, biomarker detection from blood, antibody detection, glucose measurement, pH sensing, and genetic technology.

By the mid-1980s, numerous other MOSFET sensors had been developed, including the gas sensor FET (GASFET), surface accessible FET (SAFET), charge flow transistor (CFT), pressure sensor FET (PRESSFET), chemical field-effect transistor (ChemFET), reference ISFET (REFET), biosensor FET (BioFET), enzyme-modified FET (ENFET) and immunologically modified FET (IMFET). By the early 2000s, BioFET types such as the DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET), gene-modified FET (GenFET) and cell-potential BioFET (CPFET) had been developed.

===Image sensors===
MOS technology is the basis for modern image sensors, including the charge-coupled device (CCD) and the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), used in digital imaging and digital cameras. Willard Boyle and George E. Smith developed the CCD in 1969. While researching the MOS process, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting.

The MOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was developed by Tsutomu Nakamura at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor was later developed by Eric Fossum and his team in the early 1990s.

MOS image sensors are widely used in optical mouse technology. The first optical mouse, invented by Richard F. Lyon at Xerox in 1980, used a 5μm NMOS sensor chip. Since the first commercial optical mouse, the IntelliMouse introduced in 1999, most optical mouse devices use CMOS sensors.

===Monitoring sensors===
MOS monitoring sensors are used for house monitoring, office and agriculture monitoring, traffic monitoring (including car speed, traffic jams, and traffic accidents), weather monitoring (such as for rain, wind, lightning and storms), defense monitoring, and monitoring temperature, humidity, air pollution, fire, health, security and lighting. MOS gas detector sensors are used to detect carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and other gas substances. Other MOS sensors include intelligent sensors and wireless sensor network (WSN) technology.

===Electronics sensors===
The typical modern CPUs, GPUs and SoCs are usually integrated electrics sensors to detect chip temperatures, voltages and powers.

<text>John Morton Downey (November 14, 1901 – October 25, 1985), also known as Morton Downey, was an American singer and entertainer popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, enjoying his greatest success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Downey was nicknamed &quot;The Irish Nightingale&quot;.

==Early years==
John Morton Downey was born in Wallingford, Connecticut, the fourth of six children of James A. and Bessie (Cox) Downey, a well-known family in both Wallingford and Waterbury, Connecticut. The grandson of Irish immigrants, he was known by his middle name because so many of his near relatives were named John. His father was the chief of the Wallingford Fire Department until a near fatal automobile accident necessitated his retirement. Downey began his singing career as a member of the choir of Most Holy Trinity Church in Wallingford.

==Music==
Downey&#x27;s signature sound was a very creamy and very high-timbred Irish tenor, which an uninformed listener can easily mistake for a female voice. The popularity of such highly artificial and &quot;heady&quot; male pop vocals peaked in the late 1920s and early 1930s. By the mid-1930s, the style was out of fashion, and Downey reduced some of his broader mannerisms and made a transition to a somewhat more &quot;chesty&quot; vocal timbre.

For a time in the 1920s, Downey sang with Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra. He first recorded in 1923 for Edison Records under the pseudonym Morton James; the following year he recorded for Victor with the S.S. Leviathan Orchestra. In 1925, he began four years of recording for Brunswick Records. In 1926, he had a hit in the show &quot;Palm Beach Nights&quot;.

Downey toured London, Paris, Berlin, New York City and Hollywood. He also began appearing in movies, including &quot;Syncopation&quot; (1929), the first film released by RKO Radio Pictures.

Downey was also a songwriter whose most successful numbers include &quot;All I Need Is Someone Like You&quot;, &quot;California Skies&quot;, &quot;In the Valley of the Roses&quot;, &quot;Now You&#x27;re in My Arms&quot;, &quot;Sweeten Up Your Smile&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s How I Spell Ireland&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing New&quot;, and &quot;Wabash Moon&quot;. He joined ASCAP in 1949.

The famous tenor vocalist Bill Kenny idolized Downey, and it is believed that he was Kenny&#x27;s biggest influence. The similarities in style can be heard in Kenny&#x27;s earliest recordings with The Ink Spots.

===Radio===
In 1930, Downey began making national radio broadcasts after opening his own nightclub (The Delmonico) in New York. He was voted America&#x27;s &quot;Radio Singer of the Year&quot; in 1932. At the time, Downey was featured nightly on the &quot;Camel Quarter Hour&quot; radio broadcast. On February 5, 1945, his transcribed program &quot;Songs by Morton Downey&quot; moved from the NBC Blue Network to the Mutual Broadcasting System. The move came after Blue Network officials adopted a policy &quot;against the use of transcriptions for network originated programs, except where technical difficulties void live broadcasts.&quot; As a result of the shift, the number of stations carrying the program more than doubled.

===Recordings===
In the 1930s, he recorded for ARC, Hit of the Week, and Decca Records, and in the 1940s, he made records for Columbia Records.

===Television===
In 1949, Downey began appearing on television. He was host of the &quot;Mohawk Showroom&quot; on NBC three nights a week. It was also known as &quot;The Morton Downey Show&quot; on the nights he was host. From 1950 to 1951, he co-hosted &quot;Star of the Family&quot;.

Morton Downey was the father of television personality Morton Downey Jr. by his first wife, actress Barbara Bennett (1906–1958), the sister of actresses Constance and Joan Bennett, and with whom he ultimately had five children, four sons, and a daughter: Michael, &quot;Sean&quot; (John Morton Downey Jr.), Lorelle, Anthony, and Kevin. Her early promise as a dancer and actress gave way to her turbulent marriage with Downey. The couple married in 1929 and divorced in 1941. She married actor Addison Randall shortly afterward.

Downey&#x27;s second wife was Peggy Boyce Schulze (1922–1964), the former wife of Prince Alexander zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst and the granddaughter of Colorado mining industrialist William Boyce Thompson. Downey owned a house at Squaw Island, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, next to Joseph P. Kennedy&#x27;s house. John and Jacqueline Kennedy rented Downey&#x27;s house in the summer of 1963.

Downey&#x27;s third wife was Ann Trainer, the widow of Howell Van Gerbig and the former wife of John Kevin Barry; they married in 1970.

Downey died following a stroke in 1985 in Palm Beach, Florida, aged 83, and was buried in the local Catholic cemetery in his hometown of Wallingford, Connecticut.

<text>Arsène Jules Étienne Juvenal Dupuit (18 May 1804 – 5 September 1866) was a French civil engineer and economist.

He was born in Fossano, Cisalpine Republic then under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte. At the age of ten he went to Versailles with his family where he studied — winning a Physics prize at graduation. He then studied in the École Polytechnique as a civil engineer. He gradually took on more responsibility in various regional posts. He received a Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1843 for his work on the French road system, and shortly after moved to Paris. He also studied flood management in 1848 and supervised the construction of the Paris sewer system. He died in Paris.

Engineering questions led to his interest in economics, a subject in which he was self-taught. His 1844 article was concerned with deciding the optimum toll for a bridge. It was here that he introduced his curve of diminishing marginal utility. As the quantity of a good consumed rises, the marginal utility of the good declines for the user. So the lower the toll (lower marginal utility), the more people who would use the bridge (higher consumption). Conversely as the quantity rises (people allowed on the bridge), the willingness of a person to pay for that good (the price) declines.

Thus, the concept of diminishing marginal utility should translate itself into a downward-sloping demand function. In this way he identified the demand curve as the marginal utility curve. This was the first time an economist had put forward a theory of demand derived from marginal utility. Although not the first time that the demand curve had been drawn, it was the first time that it had been proved rather than asserted. Dupuit, however, did not include a supply curve in his theory.

Dupuit went on to define &quot;relative utility&quot; as the area under the demand/marginal utility curve above the price and used it as a measure of the welfare effects of different prices – concluding that public welfare is maximized when the price (or bridge toll) is zero. This was later known as Marshall&#x27;s &quot;consumer surplus&quot;.

Dupuit&#x27;s reputation as an economist does not rest on his advocacy of laissez-faire economics (he wrote &quot;Commercial Freedom&quot; in 1861) but on frequent contributions to periodicals. Wanting to evaluate the net economic benefit of public services, Dupuit analysed capacities for economic development, and attempted to construct a framework for utility theory and measuring the prosperity derived with public works. He also wrote on monopoly and price discrimination.

Dupuit also considered the groundwater flow equation, which governs the flow of groundwater. He assumed that the equation could be simplified for analytical solutions by assuming that groundwater is hydrostatic and flows horizontally. This assumption is regularly used today, and is known by hydrogeologists as the Dupuit assumption.

<text>The Long-term Ecological Observatory (LEO) is a project off the coast of New Jersey, United States, which monitors the processes in the ocean with online IT systems, spearheaded by the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. Already installed are sensors for temperature, salinity, transmission, light, light attenuation, fluorescence, pressure and velocity.

With improvements in Internet infrastructure it will be possible to observe and evaluate plankton (like copepods) or juvenile fish (like Atlantic herring) online with a quantitative &quot;in situ&quot; microscope, known as the ecoSCOPE, in order to get more insight into some of the enigmatic life histories of ocean organisms, like predator–prey interaction between herring and copepods, the Eel story, or oxygen depletion.

<text>CSS &quot;Texas&quot; was the third and last (or according to some sources) casemate ironclad built for the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. Not begun until 1864 and intended to become part of the James River Squadron, she saw no action before being captured by Union forces while still fitting out. CSS &quot;Texas&quot; was reputed to have been one of the very best-constructed Confederate ironclads, second only to .

==History==
Designed by John L. Porter, the Confederacy&#x27;s chief naval designer, CSS &quot;Texas&quot; belonged to an 1863/64 class of three ironclads, with (also referred to as the CSS &quot;Tennessee II&quot;) and , all three slated to be sister ships. Of the three, only &quot;Tennessee&quot; was completed and commissioned, proving her mettle in the Battle of Mobile Bay. &quot;Columbia&quot; was launched but incapacitated while being completed, never seeing operational duty in the Civil War, despite later being captured, repaired, and appraised by the Union Navy.

The keel for CSS &quot;Texas&quot; was laid down at Rocketts Naval Yard, just outside Richmond, Virginia. She was launched in mid-January 1865, almost at exactly the same time as her unfinished sister ironclad &quot;Columbia&quot; was crippled beyond salvation. At the time of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s evacuation of Richmond on 3 April 1865, she was left unfinished but still intact at the Richmond Navy Yard. She was one of only two vessels (the other being the small iron-hulled gunboat ) which escaped destruction by retreating Confederate forces, because attempts to set her ablaze proved unsuccessful. Captured when Richmond fell the following day, both ironclad and gunboat were appropriated &quot;for use in the Navy&quot;, as per Union Admiral David D. Porter (not related to the &quot;Texas&quot; designer). In his official report of April 12, 1865, Porter mentioned that he was informed that the engines and parts of her armor were not yet installed, residing undamaged but completed in the warehouses of the Richmond naval yard. He subsequently ordered all of it transported to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, along with the ironclad. This task was begun on 3 May 1865 and completed the following day. &quot;Texas&quot; was towed downstream by three tugboats, accompanied by Union monitor , commanded by Lieutenant Commander R. Chandler, who was in charge of the overall operation.

As the war was winding down, and unlike her captured sister ship &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot; was not commissioned into the Union Navy. She saw no active service, except for a trial run on 22 June 1865 with her engines apparently installed, the one and only time &quot;Texas&quot; was known to have sailed under her own power. She was eventually laid up at the Norfolk yard until 15 October 1867, when she was sold at auction for scrapping to J. N. Leonard &amp; Co. of New Haven, Connecticut, having originally cost $218,068 to construct.

==Design==
The casemate of &quot;Texas&quot; was roughly octagonal, rather than being a sloped, rectangular, armored box, as on earlier Confederate ironclads and including her class sisters; during construction, it was shortened and reshaped due to critical war materials shortages, accounting for the substantially reduced number of crew needed, when compared to her class sister CSS &quot;Tennessee II&quot;. The casemate fitted snugly around her eight gun ports, six of which were to be used with two pivot cannons, each one firing from three forward and three aft gun port positions.

Details of her armament are sketchy, but her sister &quot;Tennessee II&quot;, carried four Brooke rifles, two Brooke rifles, and a bolted-on spar torpedo fitted to her bow. &quot;Tennessee II&quot;″s armor was three layers of iron plate, and instead of being bolted to her deck, the pilot house formed a seamless extension of her sloped side-armor. &quot;Tennessee II&quot;″s top speed was about , according to some sources, and her crew numbered about 133 sailors. However, it is unclear how closely &quot;Texas&quot; would have resembled her sister had she been completed, if at all, considering the shortages &quot;Texas&quot; had to contend with during construction.

Other sources gave &quot;Texas&quot; a (projected) top speed of about . These note that both &quot;Tennessee II&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; differed from each other in their final details due to a lack of available materials, notably the iron plate for her armor; her cannons and engines were also different. During construction, design improvements were also incorporated into &quot;Texas&quot; from lessons learned in combat with the Union Navy.

Particulars on her dimensions and propulsion, recorded by her Union captors, were later included as a statistical summary in the &quot;Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion&quot;. It was stated that she measured 217 feet in length, 48.6 feet abeam, and was designed to draw 13 feet of water and 13.6 feet when fully loaded. She was a twin-engined vessel, each driving a separate propeller, powered by two 22&#x27;(L)×8.4&#x27;(W)×9.1&#x27;(H) boilers, heated by a 7&#x27;(L)×3.6&#x27;(W) furnace, with a grate surface area of 96.8 sq. ft. Recorded is also an appraisal of an inspecting Union officer, who deemed &quot;Texas&quot; as &quot;(...) one of the best and most valuable hulls built by the Rebels&quot;. It was only in this summary that the June 22 trial run was mentioned.

==Popular culture==
CSS &quot;Texas&quot; is featured prominently in the feature film &quot;Sahara&quot; (2005), based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Clive Cussler. In both, a team of treasure hunters search for what was considered by the late 20th century a mythical Civil War-era Confederate ironclad transporting an equally mythical cargo of gold bullion (one more take on the myth of lost &quot;Confederate gold&quot;). In the film&#x27;s fictionalized version of historical events (and unlike its historical counterpart), CSS &quot;Texas&quot;, close to completion and under the command of Captain Mason Tombs, made it out of Richmond just before the fall of the city. The ironclad battles through the Union blockade of the James River before disappearing into history. It is carrying what remains of the Confederate treasury&#x27;s gold bullion, the riches the salvagers are pursuing. The ironclad and its contents (including the mortal remains of its crew that later succumbed to a tropical disease) are discovered a century later. Everything is buried in an old, forgotten, dried up tributary of the Niger River, deep in western Africa (on the highly implausible assumption that an early river ironclad, without masts and long-range sails, could somehow traverse the often violent Atlantic all the way to Africa without a renewable fuel source for its hungry steam boilers and engines). The adventurers manage to reactivate the ironclad&#x27;s heavy ordinance to fight-off an African warlord and his troops. They succeed in killing him, even though the ironclad&#x27;s iron plating is heavily bullet-riddled and no match for modern armor-piercing ordnance. &quot;Texas&quot; and its historic contents are remanded into the custody of the Smithsonian Institution, but not before the adventurers have successfully removed the Confederate bullion to another African location, under the watchful, guarding eyes of others...

In Cussler&#x27;s novel, CSS &quot;Texas&quot; is powered by riverboat steam engines that enable her to make a highly unlikely 14 knots. She is armed with four heavy cannon, two Blakely 100-pounders and two 9-inch 68-pounders, which to a certain extent corresponds with what little is known of the historical ship in her final configuration. The film features the ship with more than four guns.

Two recreations of &quot;Texas&quot; were constructed for the film: a scale shooting model and full-sized exterior and interior sets. Their outer appearances did not correspond with what is known about the historical ironclad; instead, &quot;Texas&quot; is represented on screen as an amalgam of the original (of the Battle of Hampton Roads fame) and Porter&#x27;s original casemate ironclad (co-)design, which he based on his two 150 ft. and 180 ft. standard designs. The &quot;Columbia&quot;-class was a variant of the latter and both CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot; and CSS &quot;Columbia&quot; were built with larger and differently-shaped casemates.

<doc id="235812" wikidata="Q2117622" url="?curid=235812" title="Rogowski coil">
<text>A Rogowski coil, named after Walter Rogowski, is an electrical device for measuring alternating current (AC) or high-speed current pulses. It sometimes consists of a helical coil of wire with the lead from one end returning through the centre of the coil to the other end so that both terminals are at the same end of the coil. This approach is sometimes referred to as a &quot;counter-wound&quot; Rogowski. 

Other approaches use a full toroid geometry that has the advantage of a central excitation not exciting standing waves in the coil. The whole assembly is then wrapped around the straight conductor whose current is to be measured. There is no metal (iron) core. The winding density, the diameter of the coil and the rigidity of the winding are critical for preserving immunity to external fields and low sensitivity to the positioning of the measured conductor.

Since the voltage that is induced in the coil is proportional to the rate of change (derivative) of current in the straight conductor, the output of the Rogowski coil is usually connected to an electrical (or electronic) integrator circuit to provide an output signal that is proportional to the current. Single-chip signal processors with built-in analog to digital converters are often used for this purpose. It can also be made &quot;self integrating&quot; (e.g., no external circuit) by placing a low inductance resistor in parallel with the output. This approach also makes the sensing circuit more noise immune.

==Advantages==
This type of coil has advantages over other types of current transformers.
* It is not a closed loop, because the second terminal is passed back through the center of the toroid core (commonly a plastic or rubber tube) and connected along the first terminal. This allows the coil to be open-ended and flexible, allowing it to be wrapped around a live conductor without disturbing it. However, positioning of the measured conductor is important in that case: It has been shown that, with flexible sensors, the effect of the position on the accuracy ranges from 1 to 3%. Another technique uses two rigid winding halves with a precise locking mechanism.
* Due to its low inductance, it can respond to fast-changing currents, down to several nanoseconds.
* Because it has no iron core to saturate, it is highly linear even when subjected to large currents, such as those used in electric power transmission, welding, or pulsed power applications. This linearity also enables a high-current Rogowski coil to be calibrated using much smaller reference currents. 
* No danger of opening the secondary winding. 
* Lower construction costs. 
* Temperature compensation is simple. 
* For larger currents conventional current transformers require an increase of the number of secondary turns, in order to keep the output current constant. Therefore, a Rogowski coil for large current is smaller than an equivalent rating current transformer.

==Disadvantages==
This type of coil also has some disadvantages over other types of current transformers.
* The output of the coil must be passed through an integrator circuit to obtain the current waveform. The integrator circuit requires power, typically 3 to 24Vdc, and many commercial sensors obtain this from batteries.
* Traditional split-core current transformers do not require integrator circuits. The integrator is lossy, so the Rogowski coil does not have a response down to DC; neither does a conventional current transformer (see Néel effect coils for DC). However, they can measure very slow changing currents with frequency components down to 1 Hz and less.
* Constant DC current cannot be measured. The Rogowski coil samples the field, generating a voltage as the field changes.

== Applications ==
Rogowski coils are used for current monitoring in precision welding systems, arc melting furnaces, or electromagnetic launchers. They are also used in short-circuit testing of electric generators and as sensors in protection systems of electrical plants. Another field of usage is the measurement of harmonic current content, due to their high linearity. Also for lightning research.

==Formulae==
The voltage produced by a Rogowski coil is
:formula_1

where 
*formula_2 is the area of one of the small loops, 
*formula_3 is the number of turns, 
*formula_4 is the length of the winding (the circumference of the ring),
*formula_5 is the rate of change of the current threading the loop, 
*formula_6 V·s/(A·m) is the magnetic constant,
*formula_7 is the major radius of the toroid,
*formula_8 is its minor radius.

This formula assumes the turns are evenly spaced and that these turns are small relative to the radius of the coil itself.

The output of the Rogowski coil is proportional to the derivative of the wire current. The output is often integrated so the output is proportional to the wire&#x27;s current:
:formula_9
In practice, an instrument will use a lossy integrator with a time constant much less than the lowest frequency of interest. The lossy integrator will reduce the effects of offset voltages and set the constant of integration to zero.

At high frequencies, the Rogowski coil&#x27;s inductance will decrease its output.

The inductance of a toroid is

:formula_10

==Similar devices==
A device similar to the Rogowski coil was described by Arthur Prince Chattock of Bristol University in 1887. Chattock used it to measure magnetic fields rather than currents. The definitive description was given by Walter Rogowski and W. Steinhaus in 1912.

More recently, low-cost current sensors based on the principle of a Rogowski coil have been developed. These sensors share the principles of a Rogowski coil, measuring the rate of change of current using a transformer with no magnetic core. The difference from the traditional Rogowski coil is that the sensor can be manufactured using a planar coil rather than a toroidal coil. In order to reject the influence of conductors outside the sensor&#x27;s measurement region, these planar Rogowski current sensors use a concentric coil geometry instead of a toroidal geometry to limit the response to external fields. The main advantage of the planar Rogowski current sensor is that the coil winding precision that is a requirement for accuracy can be achieved using low-cost printed circuit board manufacturing.

<text>Nivea B. Hamilton (born March 24, 1982), known mononymously as Nivea, is an American R&amp;B singer. She has released three studio albums: her self-titled debut (2001), followed up by &quot;Complicated&quot; (2005), &quot;Animalistic&quot; (2006), and an independently released extended play, &quot;Nivea: Undercover&quot; (2011). In 2019, she released her album &quot;Mirrors&quot;.

Her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Man&quot; was nominated for a Best R&amp;B Performance Grammy in 2003.

==Early life==
Nivea Hamilton was born in Atlanta, Georgia on March 24, 1982. She is the youngest of three sisters. She sang in a church choir and from there, admired Mariah Carey. She admitted to being shy in a 2019 interview with BET, saying &quot;I never wanted anyone to hear me sing... my parents would turn down the radio [and I would automatically stop].&quot;

==Career==
===2000–2003: &quot;Nivea&quot;===

In 2000, Nivea appeared on Jive Records labelmate, rapper Mystikal&#x27;s hit single &quot;Danger (Been So Long)&quot; which garnered her some buzz. Following its success, she had signed with Jive and released her debut solo single &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with the Radio&quot; in 2001. It garnered moderate success, peaking at number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 85 on the Hot R&amp;B Songs chart. Her label then decided to release her self-titled debut album internationally, due to high demand in the domestic area. Released firstly in Australia on September 25, 2001, the album would later be released in the United States on December 10, 2002, peaking at number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and thirty-five on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while topping the Heatseekers album chart. &quot;Run Away (I Wanna Be with You)&quot; (featuring Pusha T) was released as the album&#x27;s next single in Japan on December 10, 2001.

On June 3, 2002, she released her second U.S. single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Man&quot; featuring brothers Brian and Brandon Casey (of R&amp;B group Jagged Edge). The single was a big hit, peaking at number eight on the Hot 100 at number twenty-five on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, respectively. The single&#x27;s performance fueled album sales of her debut. The following year, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Man&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

The album&#x27;s third U.S. single &quot;Laundromat&quot; (released in April 2003) featured singer, songwriter and producer R. Kelly. Due to Kelly&#x27;s legal issues within that period (see R. Kelly child sexual abuse material case), he was unable to appear in the song&#x27;s video, which instead starred comedian Nick Cannon, playing her love interest in the music video. The single became a minor hit for the singer, peaking at number twenty on the Hot R&amp;B Songs chart and number 58 on the Hot 100.

===2004–2008: &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Animalistic&quot;===

Following the success of her first album, she began work on her second studio album, releasing a buzz single, &quot;You Wanna Touch Me&quot; featuring rapper and &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot; reality star Rasheeda and singer Akon. It only charted at number 86 on the Hot R&amp;B Songs chart. After meeting her future husband, Terius &quot;The-Dream&quot; Nash, they began dating and he soon handled the primary production on her forthcoming album.

In late 2004, she released the project&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Okay&quot;, which featured YoungbloodZ and its producer, Lil&#x27; Jon. The single became a hit, peaking at number fourteen on the Hot R&amp;B Songs chart and number forty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On May 3, 2005, she released her second album &quot;Complicated&quot;, a week before she gave birth to her daughter. The album peaked at number nine on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop album chart and underperformed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number thirty-seven, selling 27,000 copies in its first week. A second single, &quot;Parking Lot&quot; was released, shortly before she got pregnant. Jive Records subsequently dropped promotion for the project, although she appeared on &quot;Soul Train&quot; the following year and performed &quot;Complicated&quot;, which was originally planned as the album&#x27;s third single. Before it could materialize, Jive went into a new direction with its artist roster. In March 2006, Nivea parted ways with the label.

After her departure from Jive, she gave birth to her twins in April, a month after her severity from the imprint. That same year, she began work on her next studio album and signed a new contract with Formula Records. Primarily produced by her then-husband, The-Dream, her third album, &quot;Animalistic&quot;, was released on November 15, 2006, exclusively in Japan, led by the single, &quot;Watch It&quot;, which garnered some airplay. However, she premiered new material on her MySpace profile such as &quot;I Might&quot;, &quot;Look Back&quot; and &quot;Zodiac&quot;, although they were never released officially. She later took a hiatus from the music industry to focus on raising her children following her divorce from The-Dream.

===2009–2014: &quot;Undercover&quot; and &quot;Loud Blunt&quot;===
In 2010, she released a buzz single titled &quot;Love Hurts&quot; which featured her then-boyfriend, rapper Lil&#x27; Wayne as her love interest in the music video. Also that year, she appeared on a few mixtapes including Sir Will (&quot;It Only Hurts Forever&quot;) and Rasheeda (&quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Say Something Remix&quot;).

She later announced that she would release an acoustic EP titled &quot;Nivea: Undercover&quot; and premiered the set&#x27;s first single, a cover of the Sade song &quot;Love Is Stronger Than Pride&quot; in early 2011. In September 2011, the EP was released independently. She also collaborated with George Reefah on the single &quot;Bump&quot;, which received a music video.

In 2012, she announced work on her fourth studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Purple Heart&quot;, which was set for a May release. The following year, she renamed the album to &quot;Nivea Revealed&quot; and announced a new single &quot;Loud Blunt&quot;, which was released in November 2013 on digital services.

===2015–2022: &quot;Mirrors&quot;, &quot;The Randy Watson Collection,&quot; collaborations and &quot;Virginia&quot;===
In October 2015, Nivea revealed that she would be releasing two albums simultaneously through her own record label. One of the projects was originally titled &quot;The Randy Watson Collection&quot;, which would be an acoustic LP, with her father behind the production. According to the singer, Randy Watson will explore a love story between herself and two men, and is influenced by neo soul and pop. The second project will be titled &quot;Mirrors&quot; and will be an R&amp;B album with urban undertones.

In early 2018, she announced she was working with Wash House Entertainment. She collaborated with Snypa on the song, &quot;This Way&quot;, which was released in January. In April, she announced and premiered her new single &quot;Circles&quot; in Atlanta. In September, she was featured on the song &quot;Dope New Gospel&quot; on ex-boyfriend Lil Wayne&#x27;s album &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;, which was released on September 28, 2018. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The following day, she released the single, &quot;Circles&quot;.

On September 16, 2019, she was featured on the song, &quot;Oh Oh&quot;, by rapper SugaCane. On September 26, 2019, she released her album, &quot;Mirrors&quot;, including the single, &quot;Circles&quot;.

In 2021, Nivea appeared on the reality show &quot;BET Presents: The Encore&quot; alongside former girl group members Shamari Devoe (of Blaque), 702 sisters Irish &amp; LeMisha Grinstead, Cherish twins Fallon &amp; Felisha King, Pamela Long (of Total), Aubrey O&#x27;Day (of Danity Kane), and Kiely Williams (of 3LW &amp; The Cheetah Girls).

On January 7, 2022, Nivea released a new single, &quot;Virginia&quot;, her first new release in 2 years. Ken Hamm of Soulbounce.com reviewed &quot;Virginia&quot; stating, &quot;Nivea’s plight shows us that maybe love just isn’t enough. Over sultry keys and guitar licks, Nivea sings about a man who makes her feel warm when the world feels so cold. However, this love thang is a situation ship, not a relationship; she’s wifey, but not the wife&quot; while Amethyst Music News Magazine wrote &quot;R&amp;B veteran/singer/songwriter Nivea is back with a new single entitled, &#x27;Virginia.&#x27; On the track, the singer displays the beautiful vocals that she’s known for singing.&quot;

=== 2022–present: Upcoming collaboration album and &quot;Queens Court&quot; ===
In mid-October 2022, she confirmed that she and singer Paula DeAnda are recording a collaborative album together; both singers have confirmed this on separate interviews in 2020. They claimed to have stayed in contact and planned to have a single set for a 2022 release.

In 2023, she appeared on the first season of the Peacock dating reality series, &quot;Queens Court&quot;, alongside Evelyn Lozada and Tamar Braxton.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
In February 2002, Nivea started dating rapper Lil Wayne. On December 11, 2002, they became engaged. In her July 2003 interview with &quot;Sister to Sister&quot; magazine, Nivea spoke about her engagement and how Wayne proposed. &quot;Wayne said, &#x27;I got your Christmas present with me and you&#x27;re gonna love it. It&#x27;s gonna make you smile. He got down on his knee and he was like, &#x27;I know I&#x27;m young, but I&#x27;ve been through enough relationships to know and understand the meaning of what love is.&#x27; He was just perfect. He told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and he loved me. It was snot and tears at the same time.&quot; She also spoke on her wishes to have a son with the rapper. &quot;I want a little boy very much right now. Wayne&#x27;s daughter is just wonderful. She&#x27;s a beautiful little girl.&quot; In a 2021 interview with Kandi Burruss, Nivea revealed having suffered a miscarriage. Nivea credited Wayne as being her first love. She said that if they did not get married, that she would die a single woman. In August 2003, Lil Wayne called off their engagement. His song, &quot;Something You Forgot&quot;, was about his relationship with Nivea.

Nivea married R&amp;B singer, songwriter and producer Terius &quot;The-Dream&quot; Nash in December 2004. Their daughter was born on May 10, 2005, and their twin sons in April 2006. The-Dream filed for legal separation on December 10, 2007. On June 15, 2008, their divorce was finalized. Nash stated in an interview, &quot;I decided to end it because I didn&#x27;t want to take this person [Nivea] and treat them a certain way based on what I was changing into, based on being bitter.&quot; However, Nivea says The-Dream wanted the divorce, not she. &quot;I&#x27;m lying, it&#x27;s not. We&#x27;re supposed to say that, but it&#x27;s not true. It wasn&#x27;t no mutual agreement, he wanted to do it, I didn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m dealing with it.&quot; The-Dream wrote much of his album, &quot;Love/Hate&quot; (2007), based on his relationship with Nivea. He credited her with inspiring more sincerity in his songwriting, &quot;to open up that other side of it that connects with the everyday woman&quot;, as he told SOHH. &quot;She has helped me a lot with that area.&quot; Dream&#x27;s single, &quot;I Love Your Girl&quot; (2007), explained his relationship with Nivea and the love triangle between the duo and Lil Wayne.

After her divorce from The-Dream in 2007, Nivea reconciled with Wayne in early 2008. On June 9, 2009, it was rumored that Nivea and Lil Wayne were engaged and expecting a child together. On October 14, 2009, Lil Wayne confirmed that he and Nivea were expecting a son. Nivea gave birth to their son on November 30, 2009. In June 2010, with Lil Wayne incarcerated on a weapons charge, the pair broke off their engagement for the second time. They would later reunite in 2018 to record &quot;Dope New Gospel&quot; for Wayne&#x27;s long-awaited album, &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;, and had since remained on good terms. Their son currently performs music under the alias, Lil Novi.

<text>Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven (22 December 1807 – 21 October 1873) was a Norwegian writer, poet, critic, and art theorist. He has been considered &quot;one of the greatest figures in Norwegian literature.&quot;

==Background==
Johan Welhaven was born in Bergen, Norway in 1807. His grandfather, Johan Andrew Welhaven (1748–1811) was a teacher and later assistant to the pastor at St Mary&#x27;s Church (&quot;Mariakirken&quot;), which served the city&#x27;s German community. The author&#x27;s father, Johan Ernst Welhaven (1775–1828), was a pastor at St. George&#x27;s Hospital, (&quot;St. Jørgens spedalskehospital&quot;), while his mother, Else Margaret Cammermeyer, was the daughter of Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer, resident chaplain of Holy Cross Church (&quot;Korskirken&quot;).

Johan Welhaven was the member of an accomplished family which included his sister socialite Maren Sars, the wife of theologian and biologist Michael Sars (1805–1869), and mother of historian, Ernst Sars (1835–1917), marine biologist Georg Ossian Sars (1837–1927) and mezzo-soprano singer Eva Nansen (1858–1907). Johan Welhaven was himself the father of Norwegian architect Hjalmar Welhaven.

Welhaven attended Bergen Cathedral School from 1817 to 1825. In 1828 he began to study theology under the supervision of his father, but that same year his father died, and thus, Welhaven continued his studies at the university in the capital, where he came to live the rest of his life. After his final exams at the University of Christiania in 1827, he devoted himself to literature.

In 1836 he had visited France and Germany; and in 1858 he went to Italy to study archaeology. In 1840, he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at the Royal Frederik&#x27;s University in Christiania and delivered a series of lectures on literary subjects.

When in 1843 he obtained an academic job, controversy aroused because he had not even completed his theological degree, and had not published any work of philosophical nature. Wergeland also searched for the position and completed a theological degree and used the illustrations of &quot;Creation, Man and the Messiah&quot; to show his deep historical and philosophical knowledge. He became professor in 1846.

Afterwards, he spent 26 years lecturing in philosophy at the university from 1840 to 1866. His influence was extended by his appointment as director of the Society of Arts.

He died in Christiania in 1873.

==Career==
Welhaven made his name as a representative of conservatism in Norwegian literature in the 19th century. As shown by an attack on Henrik Wergeland&#x27;s poetry, he opposed the theories of the extreme nationalists. He desired to see Norwegian culture brought into line with that of other European countries, and he himself followed the romantic tradition, being influenced by J.L. Heiberg.

He is known for his feud with Henrik Wergeland and for the poem &quot;Republikanerne&quot; (&quot;The Republicans&quot;). Welhaven was also romantically involved with Wergeland&#x27;s younger sister Camilla Collett.

He gave an exposition of his aesthetic creed in the 1834 sonnet cycle &quot;Norges Dæmring&quot; (&quot;The Dawn of Norway&quot;). He published a volume of &quot;Digte&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;) in 1839; and in 1845 &quot;Nyere Digte&quot; (&quot;Newer Poems&quot;). Other poems followed in 1847 &quot;Den Salige&quot; (The Blessed One), 1848, 1851 and 1859. He was well known for dealing with nature and folklore, such as in «Asgaardsreien» from &quot;Nyere Digte&quot;, the basis for Peter Nicolai Arbo&#x27;s painting &quot;The Wild Hunt of Odin&quot;. He later also became known for poems about religion, like «En Sangers Bøn» (The Prayer of a Singer). In it, he showed his spiritual side, expressing empathy for his fellows human being and pious Christian hope with biblical allusions.

In the 1840s, Welhaven was a figure of the Norwegian national romanticism movement. Welhaven helped in beginning the career of Hans Gude—a romanticist painter—as it was Welhaven who first recommended that Gude should attend the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf.

<text>Norteños (, ; &quot;Norteñas&quot; for females) are the various affiliated gangs that pay tribute to Nuestra Familia while in California state and federal correctional facilities. Norteños may refer to Northern California as &quot;&quot;. Their biggest rivals are the Sureños from Southern California. As of 2008, the statewide north–south dividing line between Norteños and Sureños was regarded as running through the southern end of the Central Valley. The gang&#x27;s membership consists primarily of Mexican Americans.

==History==
In 1968, Mexican American inmates of the California state prison system separated into two rival groups, &quot;Norteños&quot; (northerners) and &quot;Sureños&quot; (southerners), according to the locations of their hometowns. Norteños, affiliated with Nuestra Familia, were prison enemies of the Southern Latinos, who are composed of members and affiliates of &quot;La eMè&quot;, better known as the Mexican Mafia. While &quot;La eMè&quot; had initially been created to protect Mexicans in prison, there was a perceived level of abuse by members of &quot;La eMe&quot; towards the imprisoned Latinos from rural farming areas of Northern California. The spark that led to the ongoing war between Norteños and members of the Mexican Mafia involved a situation in which a &quot;La eMe&quot; member allegedly stole a pair of shoes from a Northerner. This event put into motion the longest-running gang war in the state of California and the founding of Nuestra Familia.

==Culture==
Norteños use the number 14, which represents the fourteenth letter of the English alphabet, the letter N, in order to pay allegiance to Nuestra Familia. It is sometimes written in Roman numerals as &quot;XIV&quot;, or a hybrid of Roman and Arabic numerals, &quot;X4&quot;. Norteños use the color red to signify affiliation. Some Norteños will tattoo themselves with four dots. The Norteños commonly use a whistle chirp, which is derived from Mexican rancho calls. These are also used by other gangs such as Surenos, Crips, and other groups in intercity areas. They are most often used to warn others about police activity in the area, but for the Norteños, they are mostly used to show affiliation. A Norteño could shout &quot;shaooo,&quot; which is a common way to show affiliation for Norteños. A Norteño derogatorily refers to a Sureño as a &quot;scrap&quot; (Hispanicized &quot;scrapa&quot;) or &quot;Sur rat&quot; (south rat). Norteños also use images of the Mexican American labor movement, such as the sombrero, machete, and the logo of the United Farm Workers, which is a stylized black Aztec eagle (&quot;Huelga bird&quot;).

==Criminal activity==
On January 9, 2005, in Ceres, California, in Stanislaus County, Officer Sam Ryno was the first to respond to a call about a man with a gun in front of George&#x27;s Liquors. Andres Raya, a U.S. Marine on leave after serving in Iraq, was armed with an SKS rifle and opened fire on officers, hitting Officer Ryno and killing Sergeant Stevenson. Raya was shot dead some time later after he opened fire on SWAT team members.

Law enforcement officials claimed Raya had been involved in gangs for years prior to his signing up for military service. Modesto authorities discovered information during the investigation into the shooting that shows Raya was a Norteño gang member who was not involved in combat during his tour of duty in Iraq. A cooperative effort between local law enforcement, federal, and military agencies revealed a large amount of information about Raya in a short amount of time.

In August 2013, a shooting done by a documented Norteño killed three people and wounded four others at Taco Choice, a Mexican restaurant and bar in Salinas, California. The gunman, 21-year-old Giovanni Pacheco, was sentenced to life without parole.

===Operation Black Widow===
Federal law enforcement agencies, long unable to infiltrate the group, began to step up their investigations in the late 1990s. In 2000 and 2001, 22 members were indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges, including several who were allegedly serving as high-ranking gang leaders while confined in Pelican Bay State Prison in northern California. Thirteen of the defendants pleaded guilty; the other cases are still ongoing. Two of the defendants face the death penalty for ordering murders related to the drug trafficking. The largest of the federal investigations was Operation Black Widow. In the aftermath of Operation Black Widow, the five highest-ranking leaders of the Norteños were transferred to a federal supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.

=== Goshen murders===
On February 3, 2023, two alleged Norteño gang members, Noah David Beard and Angel &quot;Nanu&quot; Uriarte, were arrested for the January 16, 2023, murders of six people in Goshen, California. Among the six victims were a 16-year-old mother, Alissa Parraz, and her 10-month-old baby, Nycholas Parraz, both reportedly shot in the head. Surveillance video released by authorities showed the teenage mother running outside, placing the infant on the other side of a fence, then jumping over it herself. Authorities alleged that it was Beard who killed them. Both mother and son were found dead in the street, shot in the back of the head.

<text>Dunderberg, which is a Swedish word meaning &quot;thunder(ing) mountain&quot;, was an ocean-going casemate ironclad of 14 guns built for the Union Navy. She resembled an enlarged, two-masted version of the Confederate casemate ironclad . She was originally designed to have both gun turrets and a casemate but the turrets were deleted while the ship was still being built. Construction began in 1862, but progress was slow and she was not launched until after the end of the American Civil War in 1865.

The ship was not accepted by the Union Navy so her builder began seeking buyers elsewhere; Otto von Bismarck expressed some interest, and the thought of Prussia armed with such a vessel prompted France to purchase her and commission her in 1867 with the name Rochambeau. She was initially placed in reserve, but was mobilized in 1870 to participate in the Franco-Prussian War. The ship saw no action and was decommissioned after the end of the war. &quot;Rochambeau&quot; was stricken from the Navy Directory in 1872 and scrapped in 1874.

==Design, description and construction==
On 11 April 1862, William H. Webb, arguably the premier wooden shipbuilder in the country, sent a model of a large wooden-hulled, casemate ironclad with a displacement of about to the US Navy Department. Webb signed a contract on 3 July with the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Yards and Docks for a ship that had an overall length of , a beam of at least and a draft of no more than . His ship was required to make in still water and she was to be armed with four Dahlgren guns in two gun turrets, each protected by of armor, and eight 11-inch Dahlgren guns in a casemate. The ship was to be completed in 15 months at a cost of $1,250,000.

Now named &quot;Dunderberg&quot; by Webb, the contract was amended on 27 August to specify her armor scheme. Above the main deck, her armor was to be thick. From the main deck to a depth of below the waterline, the armor was to be thick, tapering to at its lower edge. The ship&#x27;s main and casemate deck armor was thick except at the rear of the ship. The main deck, from the rear of the casemate to the stern, was to consist of 4.5-inch armor plates that tapered to 2.5 inches in thickness. &quot;Dunderberg&quot; was to be given a complete double bottom and her engine and boiler rooms were to be completely enclosed by watertight bulkheads. She was also to be provided with two masts and the appropriate rigging.

The ship was powered by two back-acting steam engines driving one four-bladed propeller feet in diameter, using steam generated by six tubular boilers at a working pressure of . The engines, designed to produce , and boilers were both subcontracted by Webb to the Etna Iron Works of New York City. The engines were originally intended to have a bore of and a stroke of , but Webb increased the bore to to insure that &quot;Dunderberg&quot; reached her contract speed. During the ship&#x27;s first sea trial on 22 February 1867, she reached a speed of about ; during a demonstration for her French buyers on 12 June, &quot;Dunderberg&quot; reached . She had two auxiliary boilers to provide steam for the steam engines that powered her pumps, ventilation fans and rotated the gun turrets. These engines, with their bore and stroke of , were larger than the main engines of the s. All of the boilers exhausted through a retractable funnel. The ship normally carried of coal, but could hold a maximum of . She had a light brigantine rig that had a sail area of .

Her keel was laid down before 3 October 1862 at Webb&#x27;s shipyard in New York City, even though Webb was forced to use unseasoned oak for &quot;Dunderberg&quot; because the supply of seasoned timber had been exhausted earlier in the war. Unseasoned wood was far more prone to rot and significantly shortened the ship&#x27;s life. Her hull was very strongly built with the space between her frames filled with timber and diagonal iron straps tied her frames together. The sides of the casemate at the level of the main deck were approximately thick. Before beginning construction, Webb redesigned the hull, increasing its length to between perpendiculars and its overall length to . Her beam decreased from to and she displaced, at her nominal draft of forward and aft, . These changes made her the longest wooden ship ever built. &quot;Dunderberg&quot;″s hull was protected from biofouling by two external layers of zinc and copper. The ship was fitted with two rudders, the primary one in the usual location aft of the propeller, but she also had an auxiliary rudder placed in the deadwood above and ahead of the propeller.

Many other changes were made to &quot;Dunderberg&quot; while she was under construction and significantly contributed to her delays in completion. The most important of these was the eventual elimination of her turrets which began in October 1863 when Webb wrote to Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, saying that he concurred with the General Superintendent of Ironclads, Rear Admiral Francis Gregory&#x27;s suggestion that the &quot;turrets be dispensed with and the casemate lengthened to accommodate an additional number of guns&quot; Welles did not approve the change until September 1864 when he authorized an armament of four 15-inch and twelve 11-inch guns in the casemate. This was extended by to an approximate overall length of so that it now covered the aft magazine and shell room. It was provided with a total of 22 gun ports, six on each broadside, two on each corner and one each facing the bow and stern. The design of the gun ports was another issue that took years to resolve. They were originally sized for the 11-inch Dahlgren gun with a height of , but this was inadequate to allow the guns to fully elevate as experience with proved. The mounting of the much larger 15-inch Dahlgren gun in the casemate further complicated the design of the gun ports, especially since the design for their carriages was not even finished until May 1866. The design of the gunport itself was revised in the second half of 1865 to reduce the chance of projectiles entering them; the new design was roughly hourglass shaped and narrower in the middle of the casemate than on either the inside or the outside of the gun port. All of these changes to the gun ports delayed the completion of the casemate&#x27;s woodwork as well as the cutting and installation of the casemate armor. The angle of the casemate was also changed from the original very shallow 35° from the horizontal to an angle of 60° after Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, noted that it would be very difficult to work the guns at such an angle. The deletion of the turrets also required a redesign of the conning tower as Webb had intended to mount it on top of the fore turret. A copy of that used by the monitors was installed between the funnel and the foremast during August 1866.
&quot;Dunderberg&quot; was built with a plough-shaped , ram bow of which the forward were sheathed in cast iron. Her full armament was not installed before she was sold, but gunnery trials were conducted in February 1867 with two 15-inch and four 11-inch guns. With a gun port height of , the 15-inch guns could elevate +8.5° and depress to −5°; equivalent figures for the 11-inch guns were +5° and −7°. The 15-inch guns could traverse 30° forward of the beam and 28° aft and the 11-inch Dahlgrens could bear 28° to both sides. The only significant problem encountered during the trials was that the gun deck was made of soft pine and did not withstand the force of recoil well.

Other problems that delayed the ship&#x27;s completion were shortages of material, labor and money. Prices for pig iron and bar iron nearly tripled while boiler plate and copper roughly doubled. Wages of even inexperienced workers increased between 50 and 100 percent. The New York City draft riots in July 1863 and several machinist&#x27;s strikes further slowed progress on &quot;Dunderberg&quot;. Webb failed to account for these problems when negotiating the ship&#x27;s contract and he repeatedly tried to charge the Navy for alterations as well as use cheaper materials to reduce his costs. He also attempted to have his contract amended by act of Congress, but he was unsuccessful. The Navy agreed to pay for some of the changes made and it also reduced the reserve amount held back in case the
ship did not meet her specifications in 1865.

By about 1864, both sides regarded the ship as a white elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the &quot;Dunderberg&quot; as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, in the hope of getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The &quot;New York Times&quot; estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.

==French service==

After Prussia expressed an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. &quot;Dunderberg&quot; arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.

The ship was commissioned and renamed &quot;Rochambeau&quot;, in honor of the Comte de Rochambeau, a general during the American Revolution, on 7 August. After briefly running machinery trials two days later, Rochambeau began an in the naval dockyard at Cherbourg to fix problems that had become apparent during her delivery voyage and to modify her in accordance with French practices. These changes included the addition of a pilothouse on top of the conning tower, the replacement of the main rudder and the length of her stern was reduced somewhat. Her armament was removed and replaced by four Canon de 270 Modèle 1864/66 and 10 Canon de 24 C modèle 1864 (9.4 in) guns, both of which were breech-loading. The 15-caliber guns fired a shell while the 17-caliber guns fired one that weighed . The 270 mm guns were mounted in the corners of the casemate and could pivot between a broadside gun port and one on the corner. Eight of the 240 mm guns were mounted on the broadside and the remaining two were positioned in the bow and stern gun ports. The remaining four gunports, those on the corners closest to the broadside, were plated over.

The French carefully measured the ship during her 1868 overhaul. At the waterline &quot;Rochambeau&quot; was long and had a beam of . She had a mean draft of , a depth of hold of , and displaced . They rated her engines at only , but they produced a maximum of and gave a speed just over 15 knots during her machinery trials in June 1868 after the completion of her overhaul. At normal load she carried of coal and at deep load. In service the ship proved to burn a lot of coal, full bunkers and stored on deck provided her a range of only at a speed of . They reduced her sail area to .

They measured the ship&#x27;s armor thickness throughout. The casemate was completely protected by plates. The hull armor extended to a depth of below the waterline and its upper strake was thick while the lower was thick. Her decks were covered by plates and the sides of the conning tower were thick. In service, &quot;Rochambeau&quot; proved to be very wet and threw up a lot of spray in a head sea. She had a very quick roll which caused problems when trying to work the guns in heavy weather as even moderate seas could prevent their use altogether since the gun ports were only about above the waterline. Under sail alone in a good breeze, the ship could not maintain her course, could not be steered and would turn until wind and wave were on her beam.
&quot;Rochambeau&quot; completed her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly under the command of Captain (&quot;Capitaine de vaisseau&quot;) Jules-François-Émile Krantz (a future Minister of Marine) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve. She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a one-piece cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, &quot;Rochambeau&quot; was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak.

The ship was recommissioned with a crew of 600 men in mid-July 1870, just before the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War. She departed Cherbourg on 25 August to join the fleet in Danish waters and reached Copenhagen on 31 August. The fleet fruitlessly cruised the Baltic Sea for several weeks before they were ordered home on 16 September. &quot;Rochambeau&quot;″s shallow draft meant that she and the armored corvette were ordered to search the mouth of the Jade Estuary on 26 September for Prussian ships, but they found nothing.

Upon her return, &quot;Rochambeau&quot; was decommissioned again and her crew was ordered to help defend Paris. The ship was stricken from the Navy List (Liste de la Flotte) on 15 April 1872 and was scrapped sometime in 1874.

<text>Elgin Baylor Lumpkin (born October 15, 1970), better known by his stage name Ginuwine ( ), is an American R&amp;B singer. He began his career as a member of the musical collective Swing Mob in the early 1990s. As a solo act, he signed with Epic Records to release his 1996 debut single, &quot;Pony&quot;. The song peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and preceded the release of his debut studio album, &quot;Ginuwine...The Bachelor&quot; (1996), which received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His second and third albums, &quot;100% Ginuwine&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Life&quot; (2001), both peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the latter spawned the single &quot;Differences&quot;, which peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song.

His fourth album, &quot;The Senior&quot; (2003), spawned the top ten single &quot;In Those Jeans&quot;, as well as the top 40 singles &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; (featuring Birdman) and &quot;Stingy&quot;. His fifth, &quot;Back II da Basics&quot; (2005) peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and served as his final release with Epic; he signed with Warner Records to release his sixth album &quot;A Man&#x27;s Thoughts&quot; (2009), which performed similarly despite mixed critical reception. Serving as his final release on a major label, his albums &quot;Elgin&quot; (2011) and &quot;A Ginuwine Christmas&quot; (2011) followed thereafter.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2013, Ginuwine has sold an estimated 6.98 million albums in the US. Aside from his solo career, he formed the R&amp;B trio TGT alongside contemporaries Tyrese Gibson and Tank in 2007, with whom he has released one studio album.

== Early life ==
Elgin Baylor Lumpkin was born on October 15, 1970, in Washington, D.C. He is named after NBA legend Elgin Baylor, a fellow D.C. native. In 1988, he graduated from Forestville High School (later known as Forestville Military Academy) in Forestville, Maryland, and later graduated from Prince George&#x27;s Community College in Largo, Maryland, with a paralegal associate&#x27;s degree.

== Career ==

=== Music ===

Lumpkin began his career as a member of Swing Mob, a Rochester, New York-based record label and music compound founded by Donald &quot;DeVante Swing&quot; DeGrate, Jodeci, Chad Elliott, and Darryl Pearson. There, he met rapper Melissa &quot;Missy&quot; Elliott, rapper Melvin &quot;Magoo&quot; Barcliff, producer Steven&quot;Stevie J&quot; Jordan, singer-songwriter and rapper Stephen &quot;Static Major&quot; Garrett, Benjamin Digital Black Bush, producer-singer Jawaan Smoke E. Digglera Peacock , singers Leshawn Shellman, Radiah Scott, Chonita Coleman, Rolita White, Susan Weems, Charlene &quot;Tweet&quot; Keys, heavy metal artist Baazar Boogieman Royale, and producer Timothy &quot;Timbaland&quot; Mosley, who became his main collaborators through the 1990s. After Swing Mob folded, they continued working together on different projects, one of which was Ginuwine&#x27;s 1996 debut album, titled &quot;Ginuwine...the Bachelor&quot;. The first single, &quot;Pony&quot; peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

His second album, &quot;100% Ginuwine&quot;, was released in 1999 and featured the hit single &quot;So Anxious&quot;. After &quot;100% Ginuwine&quot;, Ginuwine and Timbaland grew apart. Producers such as R. Kelly and Troy Oliver have crafted hits for him since then. In 2001, Ginuwine had a number-four hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the single &quot;Differences&quot;, which also peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Within a year, Ginuwine lost both of his parents. He later wrote and recorded a song that is featured on his third album &quot;The Life&quot; entitled &quot;Two Reasons I Cry&quot;. In 2002, he was a featured artist on P. Diddy&#x27;s number-one hit &quot;I Need a Girl (Part II)&quot;. Later that year, Ginuwine started his own label, Bag Entertainment. Ginuwine&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Senior&quot; was released in 2003. It featured the hit singles &quot;Stingy&quot;, &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; and &quot;In Those Jeans&quot;.

Ginuwine&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Back II Da Basics&quot;, was released on November 15, 2005. The album debuted at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling close to 100,000 copies. Ginuwine stated on BET&#x27;s Top 100 countdown that the album went Gold with sales of 500,000 copies.

In May 2007, an album entitled &quot;I Apologize&quot; was released in stores. Although attributed to Ginuwine, the release was an unauthorized album and included only three Ginuwine songs – apparently from stolen masters – and ten songs by other artists. Ginuwine spoke against the unofficial release on both his MySpace page and through YouTube. In 2007, Ginuwine collaborated with Canadian hip-hop artist Belly in the latter&#x27;s debut solo song &quot;Pressure&quot;, which was featured in Belly&#x27;s debut album the &quot;Revolution&quot;, released in June 2007.

Ginuwine&#x27;s sixth album entitled &quot;A Man&#x27;s Thoughts&quot;, was released on June 23, 2009. The album was produced by The Underdogs, B Cox, Timbaland, The Runners, Johnta Austin, Oak and Polow Da Don. The album includes guests appearances from Brandy, Missy Elliott, Bun B and Timbaland. Ginuwine formed a group with Tank and Tyrese named TGT. Their first single was a remix of Tank&#x27;s &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. They were supposed to tour but plans fell apart due to conflicting schedules.

Ginuwine announced on his Myspace Blog on August 21, 2008, that due to label and legal issues, they will not be able to release an official TGT album. Ginuwine is the founder and CEO of LoveSong Incorporated, after completing his contract with 550 Music/Epic. Ginuwine announced on his Myspace blog on August 21, 2008, that he signed a major label deal with Notifi Records/Warner Brothers.

Ginuwine introduced producer MELROG and rapper Young Knight a.k.a. Knightron on the &quot;Back 2 Da Basics&quot; album. Currently Knightron is working on his own album under Ginuwine&#x27;s label BAG ENT. Ginuwine&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Elgin&quot;, was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2011.

In 2014 Ginuwine was working on a studio album called &quot;Same Ol&#x27; G...the Bachelor&quot; and confirmed that Timbaland and Missy Elliott were executive producing the project. The album was never released.

In the 2023 memoir, &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, Britney Spears stated that Justin Timberlake had acted inappropriately and put on a blaccent when meeting Ginuwine. However, in December 2023, Ginuwine stated: &quot;I can tell you I don&#x27;t remember that happening. I truly don&#x27;t remember that happening [...] If Justin would&#x27;ve did something like that, I probably would&#x27;ve looked at him like, &#x27;Why are you acting like that?&#x27; If he did that, that would be something that I would remember. That would&#x27;ve definitely stuck out.&quot;

<doc id="235843" wikidata="Q3338539" url="?curid=235843" title="Netrunner">
<text>Netrunner is an out-of-print collectible card game (CCG) designed by Richard Garfield, the creator of &quot;&quot;. It was published by Wizards of the Coast and introduced in April 1996. It was produced until 1999. The game took place in the setting for the &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; role-playing game (RPG), but it also drew from the broader cyberpunk genre.

In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released &quot;&quot;, a new card game based on &quot;Netrunner&quot;, under license from Wizards of the Coast. The new game uses Fantasy Flight Games&#x27; Living Card Game release format (as used in their &quot;&quot;, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; games), and shares the cyberpunk setting of their &quot;Android&quot; board game. Since 2019, the game has been run by the nonprofit games publisher Null Signal Games.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Netrunner&quot; depicts cyberspace combat between a global mega-corporation (the Corp) and a hacker (the Runner). The Corp aims to complete its secret agendas before the Runner can hack in and steal data. It isn&#x27;t easy, though, as the Corp has strong defensive &quot;data forts&quot; protected by malevolent computer programs known as &quot;ICE&quot; (short for Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). Runners must use special programs of their own, called &quot;icebreakers&quot;, to break through and steal the hidden plans. All this is paid for in the game by &quot;bits&quot; (representing currency), which are earned and spent during the course of play.

An interesting feature of &quot;Netrunner&quot; is its asymmetry: each side has different abilities and uses completely different cards distinguished by alternate card backs. This contrasts with most other CCGs, which usually depict a &quot;battle between peers&quot; where each opponent draws upon the same card pool. While a player does not have to play both sides except in tournament play, many players believe that a firm understanding of both leads to better overall player ability.

The &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; supplement &quot;Rache Bartmoss&#x27; Brainware Blowout&quot; featured rules on using &quot;Netrunner&quot; cards instead of the RPG&#x27;s existing system to simulate netrunning during game sessions. It also gave conversions to the RPG of some of the cards in the base set (the rest having been mentioned in one book or another).

==Expansion sets==
* &quot;Netrunner&quot; base set (aka Limited, v1.0) - 374 cards - Release Date: April 26, 1996. The set was sold in 60-card starter decks and 15-card booster packs.
* &quot;Proteus&quot; (v2.1) - 154 cards - Release Date: September 1996 The set was sold in 15-card booster packs, and included game mechanics considered too advanced for the base set.
* &quot;Silent Impact&quot; - Never released, development halted by WotC. However, a series of six cards labelled &#x27;v2.0&#x27; were issued as promotional cards for a planned, but never released, Netrunner 2.0 core set. Even though originally appearing in Netrunner 1.0, these six cards have been revised for 2.0 and feature new artwork as well as revised game text. The six cards in question are Forged Activation Orders, misc.for-sale, The Shell Traders, Pacifica Regional AI, Bizarre Encryption Scheme, and New Galveston City Grid. These cards are extremely rare.
* &quot;Classic&quot; (v2.2) - 52 cards from the Silent Impact set. Release Date: November 1999

Several fan-made expansions have been created for &quot;Netrunner&quot; and released online. Many of them have been sanctioned for tournament play.

==Webrunner==
&quot;Netrunner&quot; launched with a proto-alternate reality game called &quot;Webrunner: The Hidden Agenda&quot;, which cast players as hackers against the evil Futukora corporation. Players broke through seven puzzle-themed &quot;gates&quot; to get the secret data (&quot;agenda&quot;). The popular game was the first online game tied into a product release, making the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; technology section.

A sequel, &quot;Webrunner II: The Forbidden Code&quot;, followed on release of the &quot;Proteus&quot; expansion. In this, players were cast as security chiefs beset by hackers.

==Online gameplay==
&quot;Netrunner&quot; was playable online through CCG Workshop in the past, but it was shut down by Wizards of the Coast. It is now possible to play &quot;Netrunner&quot; online using Magic Workstation on Runners&#x27; Net, a site which also holds IRC chats and forums to discuss the game. Players may also use other CCG engines such as LackeyCCG or Gccg, which allows players to build and share plugins for different card games and play the games online. This game can now be played on the OCTGN online game system.

==Product ownership==
Zvi Mowshowitz, a well-known &quot;&quot; Pro Tour player, attempted to purchase the license for &quot;Netrunner&quot; from Wizards of the Coast after the company stopped producing the game. Negotiations, however, fell apart without any revival of the game or transfer of ownership.

In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games announced that they were releasing a modified version of &quot;Netrunner&quot;, under license from Wizards of the Coast, called &quot;&quot;.

In 2018, Fantasy Flight Games announced that their partnership with Wizards of the Coast to license development of the game was concluding. Starting October 22, 2018, Fantasy Flight no longer sells &quot;Netrunner&quot; products.

Since 2019, Null Signal Games has continued to release new expansion sets for &quot;Netrunner&quot;, compatible with previous &quot;Android: Netrunner&quot; products, and run in-person and online organised tournaments.

In August and September 2021, Wizards of the Coast renewed trademarks for both physical and digital &quot;Netrunner&quot; goods and content. However, as of February 23, 2022, Wizards of the Coast filed a Notice of Abandonment for the trademark application.

==Reception==
Andy Butcher reviewed &quot;Netrunner&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine in 1996, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that &quot;&quot;Netrunner&quot; is almost without fault. It&#x27;s certainly the best new card game in the last year, and arguably the best since &quot;Magic&quot; started it all. Richard Garfield has done it again.&quot;

&quot;Netrunner&quot; was lauded by critics, such as &quot;InQuest&quot; magazine, for its balanced gameplay and impressive artwork. In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Netrunner&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. According to editor Scott Haring, &quot;among the connoisseurs of the card game design art, &quot;Netrunner&quot; is considered to be one of the best-designed games ever.&quot;

<doc id="235844" wikidata="Q999210" url="?curid=235844" title="Siilinjärvi">
<text>Siilinjärvi () is a municipality of Finland. It is located in Northern Savonia, north of the city of Kuopio, which largely surrounds Siilinjärvi. Another neighbour municipality with Kuopio is Lapinlahti. The name, in Finnish, apparently translates literally as &quot;Hedgehog&#x27;s Lake&quot;, although its etymology actually stems from a Sámi word meaning &quot;winter dwelling&quot;. Lakes are essential part of the geography of Siilinjärvi. There are 123 lakes, and the biggest of them are Kallavesi and Juurusvesi–Akonvesi. Water area is 106.85 km2, which is 21% of the whole area of Siilinjärvi.

The median age is relatively low; 23% of the population are under 15 years old. Siilinjärvi has eleven elementary schools and two secondary schools (one is located in Suininlahti and one downtown).

The Kuopio Airport is located in the village of Rissala in Siilinjärvi along the Highway 9. The airport is also the home of the Karelian Air Command and the 31st Squadron of the Finnish Air Force.

Siilinjärvi is the birthplace of politician and former prime minister of Finland and European Commissioner Jyrki Katainen.

==Economy==

The main sources of income are services and industry. One of the most important employers in Siilinjärvi is Siilinjärvi apatite mine owned by Yara International. The other largest companies in Siilinjärvi are Yara International&#x27;s factory and apatite mine, Lujabetoni Oy, Hydroline Oy, Recreational Pool Fontanella and Spa Hotel Kunnonpaikka. 5% of jobs are in primary production, 29% in industry and construction and 66% in services. Unemployment figures are the lowest in North Savonia, averaging 9,4% in 2016, while at the same time the average unemployment rate in North Savonia was 13,4% and in the whole country 13,2%.

Siilinjärvi&#x27;s income tax rate in 2017 was 21,25.

==Services==
===Energy production and water supply===
The use of district heating has increased in recent years. Most of the district heat is produced from the Yara plant&#x27;s process waste heat and from Savon Voima&#x27;s Tiprusniemi bioheat plant. At the Tiprusniemi bioheat center, heat is produced with domestic wood fuel. In addition, Sulkavantie has a LPG back-up and peak heating center.

In Siilinjärvi, groundwater is used as raw water, which is obtained from three groundwater intakes, two of which are located in the church village and one in the Toivala-Vuorela area. In addition to the municipal water supply plant, there are 15 water cooperatives in the municipality&#x27;s sparsely populated areas.

===Fire and rescue services===
There are two fire stations in the Siilinjärvi municipality, the North Savonia Rescue Department station and the Yara TPK station. Siilinjärvi&#x27;s main fire station is located in Simonsalo at Sulkavantie 6, a few minutes&#x27; drive from the center of Siilinjärvi. The station has a 24-hour on-call service. Station 15 houses an inspection car PS 020, a fire truck PS 151, a fire truck PS 1512, a tank truck PS 153, a crew transport, an off-road and boat tractor PS 157, and a snowmobile and boat. Yara TPK has a fire truck PS 191 and a boat. In addition, it has been proposed to build a third fire station in Siilinjärvi near the Vuorela residential area.

==Culture==
A local newspaper called &quot;Uutis-Jousi&quot; is published in Siilinjärvi. Siilinjärvi also has its own library.

===Food===
In the 1980s, each of Savonia&#x27;s then municipalities voted for its own title dishes. The traditional food of Siilinjärvi was a cockscomb, a potato gruel and a red berry kissel with whipped cream.

<text>Rita Maria de Azevedo Mafra Guerra, commonly known as Rita Guerra (born 22 October 1967) is a Portuguese singer-songwriter. She represented Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 where she sang &quot;Deixa-me sonhar&quot; and finished 22nd. In 2020, she won the Portuguese version of &quot;Masked Singer&quot; as the crow.

==Biography==
Guerra was born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal. She has long competed in the Portuguese national pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. She first participated in 1992, making it to the national finals with the song &quot;Meu amor inventado em mim,&quot; reaching second place. She sang in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, in Riga, Latvia, where she finished 22nd with 13 points. Guerra&#x27;s brother died of cancer the day previous to the contest, which she found out immediately after her performance. Guerra married the lyricist and composer of the song, Paulo Martins. He was also responsible for the production of her latest album called Rita, released on 20 June 2005.

Since 1989, Guerro is a regular feature on the shows of Casino do Estoril. She was on the casino&#x27;s stage for the first time with Adamo, a well known Belgian singer. &quot;Pormenores sem a mínima importância&quot; was her debut album, featuring Rui Veloso, a famous rock singer and composer, and the group Taxi. &quot;Independence Day&quot; was her second album, a CD released in 1995 sang only in English. Approaching ethnic music in the album &quot;Da Gama&quot;, Rita Guerra got the help of maestro Pedro Osório and Paulo de Carvalho, Portuguese representative at ESC 1974. In 2000, Rita and Beto, one of the backing singers in Riga, released an album called &quot;Desencontros&quot;.

Rita has also regularly worked in the Portuguese soundtrack of animated films such as &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;&quot;Prince of Egypt&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and others.

On 24 February 2020, she won the first ever &quot;A Máscara&quot;&quot;, the Portuguese version of Masked Singer, as the crow.

<doc id="235857" wikidata="Q378789" url="?curid=235857" title="Mycetozoa">
<text>Mycetozoa is a polyphyletic grouping of slime molds. It was originally thought to be a monophyletic clade, but recently it was discovered that protostelia are a polyphyletic group within Conosa.

==Classification==
It can be divided into dictyostelid, myxogastrid, and protostelid groups.

The mycetozoan groups all fit into the unikont supergroup Amoebozoa, whereas most other slime molds fit into various bikont groups (fonticulids are opisthokonts).

==Utility in research==
The dictyostelids are used as examples of cell communication and differentiation, and may provide insights into how multicellular organisms develop.

&quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; are useful for studying cytoplasmic streaming. They have also been used to study the biochemical events that surround mitosis, since all of the nuclei in a medium-sized plasmodium divide in synchrony. It has been observed that they can find their way through mazes by spreading out and choosing the shortest path, an interesting example of information processing without a nervous system. Myxomycete plasmodia have also been used to study the genetics of asexual cell fusion. The giant size of the plasmodial cells allows for easy evaluation of complete or partial cell fusion.

In 2006, researchers at the University of Southampton and the University of Kobe reported that they had built a six-legged robot whose movement was remotely controlled by a &quot;Physarum&quot; slime mold. The mold directed the robot into a dark corner most similar to its natural habitat.

Slime molds are sometimes studied in advanced mathematics courses. Slime mold aggregation is a natural process that can be approximated with partial differential equations.

==Meiosis==

Members of the Mycetozoa group are able to undergo sexual reproduction either by heterothallic or homothallic mating. An analysis of meiosis-related genes in the &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; genome revealed that 36 of the 44 genes tested were present in the genome. One gene, &quot;Spo11&quot;, was absent in the Mycetozoa, raising questions about the assumed universal role of &quot;Spo11&quot; as an initiator of meiosis.

<text>The Daily Show is an American late-night talk and satirical news television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central in the United States, with extended episodes released shortly after on Paramount+. &quot;The Daily Show&quot; draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, and media organizations. It often uses self-referential humor. The show also airs on Slice in Canada. 

The half-hour-long show premiered on July 22, 1996, and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on political satire and news satire, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn&#x27;s tenure. Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure began on September 28, 2015, and ended in December 2022. Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn from 1996 to 1998, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah from 2015 to 2022. &quot;The Daily Show&quot; is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 26 Primetime Emmy Awards.

The program has been popular among young audiences. The Pew Research Center suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4%, who said the same of CNN. In 2015, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;&#x27;s median age of viewership was 36 years old. Between 2014 and 2023, the show&#x27;s ratings declined by 75%, and its average viewer age increased to 63. In 2023, the viewership for age range of 25–54 year olds was 158,000 and the age range for 18–34 year olds was 30,000.

Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other &quot;Daily Show&quot; writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians, their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart&#x27;s appearance on the CNN show &quot;Crossfire&quot; picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.

As a new permanent host had not been chosen after Noah&#x27;s tenure ended in 2022, the show featured a rotating cast of guest hosts, with Jon Stewart returning to host Monday night shows starting February 12, 2024, and through the fall elections, with the correspondents rotating hosting duties for other shows. Stewart later extended his contract into 2025. 

== Format ==
=== Opening segment ===
During Trevor Noah&#x27;s tenure as host, each episode began with announcer Drew Birns announcing the date and the introduction, &quot;From Comedy Central&#x27;s World News Headquarters in New York, this is &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot;. Previously, the introduction was &quot;This is &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, the most important television program, ever.&quot; The host then opens the show with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. Previously, the show had divided its news commentary into sections known as &quot;Headlines&quot;, &quot;Other News&quot;, and &quot;This Just In&quot;; these titles were dropped from regular use on October 28, 2002, and were last used on March 6, 2003. Some episodes will begin with a 1–3 minute intro on a small story (or small set of stories) before fully transitioning into the main story of the night. Currently, the segment is simply called &quot;Headlines.&quot;

=== Correspondent segments ===
The monologue segment is often followed by a segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent, either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location in front of a greenscreen showing stock footage. They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host&#x27;s straight man. Some correspondent segments involve the show&#x27;s members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue.

Correspondents are typically introduced as the show&#x27;s &quot;senior&quot; specialist in the story&#x27;s subject, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as &quot;Senior Latino Correspondent&quot;, &quot;Senior Youth Correspondent&quot; or &quot;Senior Black Correspondent&quot;.

While correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a greenscreen background, on rare occasions, cast members have recorded pieces on location. For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called &quot;Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq&quot; in which correspondent Rob Riggle reported from Iraq. In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled &quot;Rob Riggle: Chasing the Dragon&quot;, which focused on the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

Jason Jones traveled to Iran in early June 2009 to report on the Iranian elections, and John Oliver traveled to South Africa for the series of segments &quot;Into Africa&quot; to report on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, Oliver traveled to Gabon, on the west African coast, to report on the Gabonese government&#x27;s decision to donate $2 million to UNESCO after the United States cut its funding for UNESCO earlier that year. On July 19, 2016, Roy Wood Jr. reported live from the Republican National Convention and talked about Donald Trump&#x27;s African-American support.

Topics have varied widely; during the early years of the show, they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. However, as the show began to gain popularity — particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections — most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.

=== Recurring segments ===

Some segments have recurred periodically throughout different tenures, such as &quot;Back in Black&quot; (segments hosted by comedian Lewis Black) &amp; &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot;. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a common segment of the show has been dubbed &quot;Mess O&#x27; Potamia&quot;, focusing on the United States&#x27; policies in the Middle East, especially Iraq. Elections in the United States were a prominent focus in the show&#x27;s &quot;Indecision&quot; coverage throughout Stewart &amp; Noah&#x27;s time as host (the title &quot;InDecision&quot; is a parody of NBC News&#x27; &quot;Decision&quot; segment). Since 2000, under Stewart&#x27;s tenure, the show went on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the Democratic and Republican National Convention. For the 2006 U.S. midterm elections, a week of episodes was recorded in the contested state of Ohio. The &quot;Indecision&quot; &amp; &quot;Democalypse&quot; coverage of the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 elections all culminated in live Election Night specials.

With Noah as host, one new recurring segment has been &quot;What the Actual Fact&quot;, with correspondent Desi Lydic examining statements made by political figures during speeches or events. Under Noah, the continuation of &quot;Democalypse&quot; and &quot;Indecision&quot; also took place with live shows after the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention. For the first time, under Noah, the show also went live after all three U.S. presidential debates in 2016.

=== Interviews ===
In the show&#x27;s third act, the host conducts an interview with a celebrity guest. Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures. During Stewart&#x27;s tenure, the show&#x27;s guests tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials. In the show&#x27;s earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians. (In 1999, for an &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; segment, Steve Carell struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate John McCain&#x27;s press overflow bus and onto the Straight Talk Express).
However its rise in popularity, particularly following the show&#x27;s coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections, made Stewart according to a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (2006) article, &quot;the hot destination for anyone who wants to sell books or seem hip, from presidential candidates to military dictators&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; labeled it &quot;the coolest pit stop on television&quot;.

Prominent political guests have included U.S. President Joe Biden, former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former Bolivian President Evo Morales, Jordanian King Abdullah II, former Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Mexican President Vicente Fox. 

The show has played host to former and current members of the administration and Cabinet as well as members of Congress. Numerous presidential candidates have appeared on the show during their campaigns, including John McCain, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

=== Closing segment ===
In a closing segment, there is a brief segue to the closing credits in the form of the host introducing &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot;, a humorous piece of video footage without commentary that has been part of the show&#x27;s wrap-up since the series began in 1996. The segment often relates to a story covered earlier in the episode, but occasionally is merely a humorous or ridiculous clip. Occasionally, the segment is used as a tribute to someone who has died.

Sometimes, before the &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot;, this segment is used for quick promotions. The host might promote the show that follows right after their broadcast, such as promoting the show &quot;@midnight&quot;. This time has also been used to promote films, books or stand-up specials that are affiliated with the host.

In October 2005, following &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; premiere, a new feature (sometimes referred to as the toss) was added to the closing segment in which Stewart would have a short exchange with &quot;our good friend, Stephen Colbert at &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;&quot;, which aired immediately after. The two would have a scripted comedic exchange via split-screen from their respective sets. In 2007, the &quot;toss&quot; was cut back to twice per week, and by 2009 was once a week before gradually being phased out. It was used on the 2014 mid-term election night and again just before the final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on December 18, 2014, and returned upon the premiere of &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;. Stewart then regularly tossed to Wilmore at the end of his Monday night episodes. Under Noah, the &quot;toss&quot; has been used for &quot;The Opposition with Jordan Klepper&quot; and &quot;Lights Out with David Spade&quot;.

== Studio ==

The host sits at his desk on the elevated island stage in the style of a traditional news show. The show initially used New York PBS station WNET&#x27;s facilities until late 1998, when it moved a few blocks to NEP Studio 54. &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; would claim NEP Studio 54 in 2005. On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.
The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests&#x27; couch, which had been a part of the set since the show&#x27;s premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a &quot;Bring Back the Couch&quot; campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by &quot;Daily Show&quot; contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.
On April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.

On September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of Trevor Noah&#x27;s tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart&#x27;s set. A second on-stage &#x27;jumbo-tron&#x27; was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped. On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote &quot;The Daily Show&quot;&#x27;s RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions&#x27; respective cities). The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show that Washington is &quot;a little broke&quot; and needs &quot;repair&quot;. Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.

After a stretch of episodes filmed from Trevor Noah&#x27;s apartment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show returned to a smaller studio at One Astor Plaza, the corporate headquarters of ViacomCBS in Times Square. The new studio had no audience, and a smaller, more intimate atmosphere with muted colors. In April 2022, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; returned to NEP Studio 52 with a revamped set, combining elements of the Times Square studio with a revamped version of its previous layout.

== Production ==
The show&#x27;s writers begin each day with a morning meeting where they review material that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah — who describes his role as that of the captain of a team — has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal. An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; typically tapes four new episodes a week, Monday through Thursday, forty-two weeks a year. The show is broadcast at 11 PM Eastern/10 PM Central, a time when local television stations show their news reports and about half an hour before most other late-night comedy programs begin to go on the air. The program used to be rerun several times the next day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central prime time broadcast.

From 2007 to 2024, full archive clips from the show under Jon Stewart&#x27;s tenure were available on the Comedy Central website. In June 2024, the Comedy Central website was shut down in favor of the Paramount+ streaming service, where full episodes going back to December 2023 are available. Clips dating from the beginning of Trevor Noah&#x27;s tenure to the present are available on the show&#x27;s YouTube channel.

== History ==
=== Craig Kilborn&#x27;s tenure (1996–1998) ===
&quot;The Daily Show&quot; was created by Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg and premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been marketed as a replacement for &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to ABC earlier that year). Madeleine Smithberg was co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as well as the former executive producer. A graduate of Binghamton University, she was an executive producer of &quot;Steve Harvey&#x27;s Big Time&quot; and a talent coordinator for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

Aiming to parody conventional newscasts, it featured a comedic monologue of the day&#x27;s headlines from anchor Craig Kilborn (a well-known co-anchor of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;), as well as mockumentary style on-location reports, in-studio segments and debates from regular correspondents Winstead, Brian Unger, Beth Littleford, and A. Whitney Brown.

==== Common segments ====
Common segments included &quot;This Day in Hasselhoff History&quot; and &quot;Last Weekend&#x27;s Top-Grossing Films, Converted into Lira&quot;, in parody of entertainment news shows and their tendency to lead out to commercials with trivia such as celebrity birthdays. Another commercial lead-out featured Winstead&#x27;s parents, on her answering machine, reading that day&#x27;s &quot;Final Jeopardy!&quot; question and answer. In each show, Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called &quot;Five Questions&quot; in which the guest was made to answer a series of questions that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion. These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled &quot;The Daily Show: Five Questions&quot;, which contains transcripts of Kilborn&#x27;s best interviews. Each episode concluded with a segment called &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot; that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to the alligators. Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the laughter of its own off-camera staff members. A studio audience was incorporated into the show for its second season, and has remained since.

==== Differences between Kilborn&#x27;s version and Stewart&#x27;s version ====
The show was much less politically focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show&#x27;s focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for &quot;a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics&quot;. The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged by some of the show&#x27;s cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, &quot;You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces.&quot; One reviewer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as &quot;bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty.&quot;

==== Craig Kilborn&#x27;s departure ====
There were reports of backstage friction between Kilborn and head writer Lizz Winstead. Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what direction the show should take. &quot;I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven&quot;, she said. In a 1997 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine interview, Kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about Winstead. Comedy Central responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.

In 1998, Kilborn left &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to replace Tom Snyder on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. He claimed the &quot;Five Questions&quot; interview segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future &quot;Daily Show&quot; hosts from using it in their interviews. Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him, but the majority of the show&#x27;s crew and writing staff stayed on. Kilborn&#x27;s last show as host aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386-episode tenure. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart&#x27;s debut four weeks later. Kilborn made a short appearance on Jon Stewart&#x27;s final edition of the &quot;Daily Show&quot; saying &quot;I knew you were going to run this thing into the ground.&quot;

=== Jon Stewart&#x27;s tenure (1999–2015) ===
==== Shift in content ====

Comedian Jon Stewart took over as host of the show, which was retitled &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, on January 11, 1999. Stewart had previously hosted &quot;Short Attention Span Theater&quot; on Comedy Central, two shows on MTV (&quot;You Wrote It, You Watch It&quot; and &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;), as well as a syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television. In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart initially retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like &quot;God Stuff&quot;, with John Bloom presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and &quot;Backfire&quot;, an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of &quot;This Week in God&quot; and Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell&#x27;s &quot;Even Stevphen&quot;. After the change, a number of new features were developed. The ending segment &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot;, previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show. The show&#x27;s theme music, &quot;Dog on Fire&quot; by Bob Mould, was re-recorded by They Might Be Giants shortly after Stewart joined the show.

Stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of the series. He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show&#x27;s voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of &quot;The Onion&quot; Ben Karlin who, along with fellow &quot;Onion&quot; contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things &quot;[started] to take shape&quot;. Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, &quot;The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don&#x27;t believe.&quot;

Under Stewart and Karlin &quot;The Daily Show&quot; developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Then-correspondent Stephen Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy. Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on &quot;human interest-y&quot; pieces, with Stewart as host the show&#x27;s content became more &quot;issues and news driven&quot;, particularly after the beginning of the 2000 election campaign with which the show dealt in its &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; coverage. Stewart himself describes the show&#x27;s coverage of the 2000 election recount as the point at which the show found its editorial voice. &quot;That&#x27;s when I think we tapped into the emotional angle of the news for us and found our editorial footing,&quot; he says. Following the September 11th attacks, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; went off the air for nine days. Upon its return, Stewart opened the show with a somber monologue, that, according to Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya, addressed both the absurdity and importance of his role as a comedian. Commented Stewart:

Gillick and Gorilovskaya point to the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the point at which Jon Stewart emerged as a trusted national figure. Robert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, recalled of this period, &quot;When all the news guys were walking on eggshells, Jon was hammering those questions about WMDs.&quot;

==== Broadening the role of the correspondent ====
During Stewart&#x27;s tenure, the role of the correspondent broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved &quot;character driven [field] pieces—like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot.&quot; However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen. Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.

==== Popularity and critical respect ====
The show&#x27;s 2000 and 2004 election coverage, combined with a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to new levels of popularity and critical respect. Since Stewart became host, the show has won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards, and its ratings steadily increased. In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since the show&#x27;s inception as Comedy Central became available in more households. By September 2008, the show averaged nearly two million viewers per night. Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s interview on October 29, 2008, pulled in 3.6 million viewers.

==== In the political spectrum ====
The move towards greater involvement in political issues and the increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where the views of the show fit in the political spectrum. Adam Clymer, among many others, argued in 2004 that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was more critical of Republicans than Democrats under Stewart. Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show had a more liberal point of view, but that it was not &quot;a liberal organization&quot; with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost was to be funny. He acknowledged that the show is not necessarily an &quot;equal opportunity offender&quot;, explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because &quot;I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not.&quot; In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: &quot;We are liberal, but Jon&#x27;s very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power it would be easier to attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it&#x27;s just not worth it.&quot;

Stewart was critical of Democratic politicians for being weak, timid, or ineffective. He said in an interview with Larry King, prior to the 2006 elections, &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t feel that [the Democrats] make an impact. They have forty-nine percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go, &#x27;Guys, pick up your game.&#x27;&quot; He has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, describing them as &quot;incompetent&quot; and &quot;unable... to locate their asses, even when presented with two hands and a special ass map.&quot;

Karlin, then the show&#x27;s executive producer, said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among the staff which, &quot;when filtered through Jon and the correspondents, feels uniform,&quot; the principal goal of the show is comedy. &quot;If you have a legitimately funny joke in support of the notion that gay people are an affront to God, we&#x27;ll put that motherfucker on!&quot;

On September 15, 2003, Senator John Edwards became the first candidate to announce that they were running for president on the show, causing Jon Stewart to jokingly inform him that their show was &quot;fake&quot; and he might have to re-announce elsewhere. On November 17, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden appeared on the show, making him the first sitting vice president to do so. On October 27, 2010, President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to be interviewed on the show, wherein Obama commented he &quot;loved&quot; the show. Obama took issue with Stewart&#x27;s suggestion that his health care program was &quot;timid.&quot;

After the United States Senate failed to pass and the media failed to cover the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide health monitoring and financial aid to sick first responders of the September 11 attacks, Stewart dedicated the entire December 16, 2010, broadcast to the issue. During the next week, a revived version of the bill gained new life, with the potential of being passed before the winter recess. Stewart was praised by both politicians and affected first responders for the bill&#x27;s passage. According to Syracuse University professor of television, radio and film Robert J. Thompson, &quot;Without him, it&#x27;s unlikely it would&#x27;ve passed. I don&#x27;t think Brian Williams, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer would&#x27;ve been allowed to do this.&quot;

==== Writers&#x27; strike ====
Due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, the show went on on November 5, 2007. Although the strike continued until February 2008, the show returned to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of writers. In solidarity with the writers, the show was referred to as A Daily Show with Jon Stewart rather than &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,&quot; until the end of the strike. As a member of the Writers Guild of America, Stewart was barred from writing any material for the show himself which he or his writers would ordinarily write. As a result, Stewart and the correspondents largely ad-libbed the show around planned topics. 

In an effort to fill time while keeping to the strike-related restrictions, the show aired or re-aired some previously recorded segments, and Stewart engaged in a briefly recurring mock feud with fellow late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Conan O&#x27;Brien. The strike officially ended on February 12, 2008, with the show&#x27;s writers returning to work the following day, at which point the title of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was restored.

==== Stewart&#x27;s absence in 2013 ====
Starting in June 2013, Jon Stewart took a twelve-week break to direct &quot;Rosewater&quot;, a drama about a journalist jailed by Iran for four months. Correspondent John Oliver replaced Stewart at the anchor desk for two months, to be followed by one month of reruns. Oliver received positive reviews for his hosting, leading to his departure from the show in December 2013 for his own show &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;, which debuted April 27, 2014, on HBO.

==== Jon Stewart&#x27;s departure ====

On February 10, 2015, Stewart announced that he would be leaving the show later in the year. Comedy Central indicated in a statement that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would continue without Stewart, saying it would &quot;endure for years to come&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s final episode aired on August 6 as an hour-long special in three segments. The first featured a reunion of a majority of the correspondents and contributors from throughout the show&#x27;s history as well as a pre-recorded &quot;anti-tribute&quot; (mocking Stewart) from various frequent guests and &quot;friends&quot; of the show. This included Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, John Kerry, and Chuck Schumer. The second segment featured a pre-recorded tour of the Daily Show production facility and studio introducing all of the show&#x27;s staff and crew. The final segment featured a short farewell speech from Stewart followed by the final &quot;Moment of Zen&quot; (being &#x27;his own&#x27; moment of zen): a performance of &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot; by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.

=== Trevor Noah&#x27;s tenure (2015–2022) ===
On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Trevor Noah would replace Stewart as host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Shortly after his announcement, it was revealed that Amy Schumer, Louis C.K., Amy Poehler, and Chris Rock were all considered for the job. His first show was on September 28, 2015, with comedian Kevin Hart as his first guest. Noah&#x27;s premiere episode was simulcast by Viacom on Comedy Central, the Nick at Nite block on Nickelodeon, Spike, MTV, MTV2, mtvU, VH1, VH1 Classic, BET, Centric, CMT, TV Land, Logo TV, and the NickMom block on the Nick Jr. Channel.

On September 14, 2017, it was announced that Comedy Central had extended Trevor Noah&#x27;s contract as host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for five years, through 2022.

Ratings declined by about 37 percent at the start of Noah&#x27;s tenure. They gradually increased from there, only to fall to the lowest ratings in 15 years in 2020, partially due to him not being funny. Some of the musicians that have been on the shows as guests performed their music as well. Beginning in 2020 until the end of Noah&#x27;s tenure, the show expanded to a 45-minute time slot.

On September 29, 2022, during a taping of the show, Noah announced that he would step down as the host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; so he could focus on his standup career and touring. On October 2, 2022, it was confirmed that the show would continue on Comedy Central following Noah&#x27;s departure. On October 12, 2022, it was announced that Noah&#x27;s final episode would air on December 8. On October 18, 2022, it was announced that Comedy Central may replace Noah with more than one comedian.

==== Differences between Stewart&#x27;s version and Noah&#x27;s version ====
In addition to changes in the tone of the show, Noah also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while standing in front of a screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Noah also increased the usage of more millennial-based references, impersonations and characterizations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.

The debut of &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot; brought along three new correspondents: Roy Wood Jr., Desi Lydic and Ronny Chieng.

Additional correspondents were added in 2017. Michael Kosta became the Senior Constitutional Correspondent and Senior American Correspondent on July 11, 2017. Dulcé Sloan became the Senior Fashion Correspondent on September 7, 2017.

In January 2016, &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot; started to use a modified version of the show&#x27;s previous theme, remixed by Timbaland and King Logan.

Noah also avoided talking enough about Fox News, as Stewart was previously known for. &quot;&quot;The Daily Show&quot; was based on an emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the Gawkers, the BuzzFeeds. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge is going to be an exciting one I&#x27;m sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source—which was historically Fox News,&quot; Noah said at a press conference before the show&#x27;s debut.

==== Stewart visits &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot;; Jordan Klepper guest hosts ====
On December 8, 2015, former host Jon Stewart returned to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for the first time in an extended-length show to return attention to extending the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, otherwise referred to as 9/11 First Responders Bill, which Stewart explained had been blocked by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell for political reasons. On October 20, 2016, Noah was unable to host a scheduled taping of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; due to illness, so correspondent Jordan Klepper guest hosted.

On November 16, 2017, Stewart once again returned to &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, in part as a parody of the robocalls of fake &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter &quot;Bernie Bernstein&quot; and to promote &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot; on HBO.

==== &quot;The Daily Social Distancing Show&quot;, expansion, move to Times Square ====
In March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show suspended production. On March 18, 2020, Comedy Central began to release webisodes of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; produced remotely from Noah&#x27;s home, entitled &quot;The Daily Social Distancing Show&quot;. This format moved to television beginning March 23. Following the cancellation of &quot;Lights Out with David Spade, The Daily Show&quot; expanded into a 45-minute format beginning April 27, 2020. In July 2020, Comedy Central head Chris McCarthy told &quot;Vulture&quot; that there were plans to possibly extend the show to an hour-long format by the end of the year.

In May 2020, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; won the 2020 Webby Award for Humor in the category Social.
The at-home format continued until June 2021, when the show went on an extended hiatus for the summer. &quot;The Daily Show&quot; returned on September 13, 2021, with the show re-located to studios at ViacomCBS&#x27;s headquarters at One Astor Plaza in Times Square (its existing studio was being occupied by fellow Comedy Central program &quot;Tha God&#x27;s Honest Truth&quot;). Comedy Central stated that the show planned to preserve the &quot;intimacy and creative elements&quot; of the home-based episodes. The program continued to be filmed with no studio audience; while there were plans to reinstate an audience, this was delayed due to concerns regarding Omicron variant. 

In March 2022, it was announced that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would go on a hiatus from March 18 to accommodate Noah&#x27;s hosting of the Grammy Awards on April 3. On April 11, the show returned to Studio 52 with an audience and a redesigned studio.

=== Weekly guest hosts (2023) ===
On December 6, 2022, Comedy Central announced that until the next iteration of the show, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would feature weekly celebrity guest hosts including Al Franken, Wanda Sykes, Leslie Jones, Hasan Minhaj, Sarah Silverman, Chelsea Handler, John Leguizamo, Marlon Wayans, Kal Penn, and D.L. Hughley, as well as both current and former correspondents. The show returned from hiatus on January 17 with Leslie Jones guest hosting through January 19. Jones was followed by Sykes, Hughley, Handler, and Silverman, each hosting a week through February 16. Correspondent Dulcé Sloan had her first and last guest hosting gig of this era on May 1, 2023, when it was cut short by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, bumping originally announced guest hosts Michael Kosta, Charlamagne tha God, Michelle Wolf, Ronny Chieng, Lewis Black, and Desus Nice.

On August 1, 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Minhaj was the primary possibility of a permanent replacement host. A day later, &quot;The Wrap&quot; reported that Penn was also a top candidate.

On September 27, 2023, following the 148-day strike, Comedy Central announced the show would return on October 16 with guest hosts and would not name a permanent host until 2024. The extension of the search for a permanent host has been attributed to the &quot;New Yorker&quot; article alleging factual inaccuracies in Minhaj&#x27;s comedy routines.

=== Jon Stewart returns and correspondents (2024) ===
On January 24, 2024, it was announced that Jon Stewart would return as host for Monday night shows, while the remainder of the week would be hosted by the correspondents, beginning on February 12. Stewart accepted the single day a week contract deal as his initial run left him feeling exhausted. The producers of the show hope that Stewart will serve to cultivate and attract new talent to fill a full host role. In May 2024, it was announced that Stewart would additionally begin hosting &quot;The Weekly Show&quot;, an original podcast from Comedy Central. Dulcé Sloan was a senior correspondent but only hosted one week and no longer lived in New York.

On July 14, 2024, in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Comedy Central announced that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would not air live from Milwaukee, the host city for the 2024 Republican National Convention, and would preempt the Monday evening broadcast for July 15. The show returned to air on July 16, 2024, from its New York studio. In late October, it was announced that Stewart has extended his contract to host until 2025.

== Correspondents, contributors and staff ==

The show&#x27;s correspondents have two principal roles: experts with satirical senior titles that the main host interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of hosting correspondents collectively known as &quot;The Best News Team&quot; (formerly known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Fakest News Team&quot; and previously spelled &quot;The Best News Team Ever&quot;) Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Jordan Klepper, and Desi Lydic. Troy Iwata, Josh Johnson, and Grace Kuhlenschmidt are non-hosting correspondents. Contributors appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or topic. Current contributors include Lewis Black and Charlamagne tha God. Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.

The show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these. In 2006, &quot;The Onion&quot; editor-in-chief Scott Dikkers described it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that &quot;I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better show you could put on your resume right now.&quot; Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in &quot;The Office&quot;, credits Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with his success. In 2005, the show&#x27;s longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, earning critical and popular acclaim. Colbert would host the program until he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show&quot; in 2015. Ed Helms, a former correspondent from 2002 to 2006, also starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot; and was a main character in the 2009 hit &quot;The Hangover&quot;. 

After filling in as host during Stewart&#x27;s two-month absence in the summer of 2013, John Oliver went on to host his own show on HBO, &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;. In 2016, former correspondent Samantha Bee launched her own late-night talk show &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;. Bee&#x27;s husband Jason Jones, also a former correspondent, serves as executive producer for the show. Hasan Minhaj, the last correspondent hired during Stewart&#x27;s tenure as host, left the show in 2018 to host &quot;Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj&quot; on Netflix.

In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout period on the show as a correspondent. Her credentials were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, who suggested that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon&#x27;s column was denounced by Munn and the &quot;Daily Show&quot; female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal on the show&#x27;s website in which they asserted that the description of the &quot;Daily Show&quot; office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent in 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.

Wyatt Cenac had a tumultuous tenure on the show, revealing in a July 2015 interview on &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, that his departure stemmed in part from a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart&#x27;s final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation.

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===

Television ratings from 2008 show that the program generally drew 1.45 to 1.6 million viewers nightly, a high figure for cable television. By the end of 2013 The Daily Show&#x27;s ratings hit 2.5 million viewers nightly. In demographic terms, the viewership is skewed to a relatively young and well-educated audience compared to traditional news shows. A 2004 Nielsen Media Research study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35. During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, the show received more male viewers in the 18- to 34-year-old age demographic than &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; and all of the evening news broadcasts. 

For this reason, commentators such as Howard Dean and Ted Koppel posited that Stewart served as a real source of news for young people, regardless of his intentions. In 2016, a &quot;New York Times&quot; study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was &quot;most popular in cities and other more liberal-leaning areas along the coasts. Peak popularity is in San Francisco; it&#x27;s least popular in Alabama&quot;.

From January 2014 to January 2023, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; lost 75% of its audience, averaging 570,000 nightly viewers, down from 2.2 million. During the same period, the average age of its viewership increased from 48.2 to 63.3, with only 30,000 viewers in the coveted 18–34 demographic per broadcast.

=== As a news source ===
The show&#x27;s writers reject the idea that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; has become a source of news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an &quot;age of information osmosis&quot; in which it is close to impossible to gain one&#x27;s news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. &quot;Our show would not be valuable to people who didn&#x27;t understand the news because it wouldn&#x27;t make sense,&quot; he argues. &quot;We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening.&#x27;&quot;

A 2006 study published by Indiana University tried to compare the substantive amount of information of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; against prime time network news broadcasts, and concluded that when it comes to substance, there is little difference between &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and other news outlets. The study contended that, since both programs are more focused on the nature of &quot;infotainment&quot; and ratings than on the dissemination of information, both are broadly equal in terms of the amount of substantial news coverage they offer.

As the lines between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under pressure in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and &quot;Daily Show&quot; co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, &quot;When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, if you give them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary.&quot; She has argued that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.

During Stewart&#x27;s appearance on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, Stewart criticized that show and said that it was &quot;hurting America&quot; by sensationalizing debates and enabling political spin. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a &quot;fake news&quot; comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. &quot;You&#x27;re on CNN!&quot; Stewart said, &quot;The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls! What is wrong with you?&quot; Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because &quot;you can&#x27;t interview Bill Clinton, Richard Clarke, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Bob Dole, etc., etc., and still say you&#x27;re just a comedian.&quot;

A 2004 study into the effect of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on viewers&#x27; attitudes found that participants had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state that it is not clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show&#x27;s viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.

Rachel Larris, who has also conducted an academic study of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, and that it would be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart&#x27;s comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.

Stewart himself says that he does not perceive his show as cynical. &quot;It&#x27;s so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical,&quot; he says. &quot;What&#x27;s more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it &#x27;fair and balanced&#x27;? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism.&quot; Stewart has said that he does not take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. &quot;We&#x27;re not the guys at the craps table betting against the line,&quot; he said on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. &quot;If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense.&quot;

In July 2009, &quot;Time&quot; magazine held an online poll entitled &quot;Now that Walter Cronkite has passed on, who is America&#x27;s most trusted newscaster?&quot; Jon Stewart won with 44% of the vote, 15 points ahead of Brian Williams in second place with 29%. Stewart downplayed the results on the show stating &quot;It was an Internet poll and I was the &#x27;None of the above&#x27; option&quot;.

In June 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; #17 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

In December 2013, TV Guide ranked it #53 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.

=== Effectiveness ===
In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a study of American television viewers and found that fans of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign survey conducted by the Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates&#x27; backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.

In a survey released by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch &quot;The Daily Show&quot; tend to be more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer&#x27;s program at 53% and Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; comes close to providing the complete daily news.

== Episodes ==
== Awards and nominations ==

Under host Jon Stewart, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; rose to critical acclaim. It has received two Peabody Awards for its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Between 2001 and 2024, it has been awarded 26 Primetime Emmy Awards in the categories of Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Series (winner for 10 consecutive years from 2003 to 2012) and Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program, and a further seven nominations. The show has also been honored by GLAAD, the Television Critics Association, and the Satellite Awards. &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot;, the 2004 bestseller written by Stewart and the writing staff of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, was recognized by Publishers Weekly as its &quot;Book of the Year&quot;, and its abridged audiobook edition received the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. 

In September 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine selected the series as one of &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME&quot;. In 2015, the show received its third Peabody Award for the show&#x27;s &quot;lasting impact on political satire, television comedy and even politics itself.&quot;

== Global editions ==

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; airs on various networks worldwide; in addition, an edited version of the show called &quot;The Daily Show: Global Edition&quot; was produced each week specifically for overseas audiences until mid-2020. It used to air outside of the U.S. on CNN International and other overseas networks beginning in September 2002. This edition ran for a half-hour and contained a selection of segments, including one guest interview from the preceding week&#x27;s shows, usually from the Monday or Tuesday episode. Stewart provided an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week&#x27;s prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present. When aired on CNN International, the broadcast was prefaced by a written disclaimer: &quot;The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through.&quot;
Since February 27, 2017, &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot; has been regularly simulcast on Black Entertainment Television.

Between 2001 and 2006, Westwood One broadcast small, ninety-second portions of the show to various radio stations across America.

In Canada, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was aired on CTV Comedy Channel in simulcast with the Comedy Central airing. However, it was dropped in 2023, leaving the program without a Canadian television home, and exclusive to Paramount+. In August 2024, Corus Entertainment acquired the linear television rights to &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, with the program scheduled to move to Slice beginning on September 9, 2024.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the digital television channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; Tuesday through Friday evenings with the &quot;Global Edition&quot;, which is uncensored, airing on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 was the first international broadcaster to syndicate entire &quot;Daily Show&quot; episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the &#x27;toss&#x27; to &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; was usually included even though it was aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.
In July 2012 Comedy Central announced that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would be shown on Comedy Central Extra in the same format as previously on More4, with episodes shown 24 hours after airing in the U.S. The show aired on the channel from July 2012 to April 2015.

The Global Edition of the week of July 20, 2011, was not aired in the UK as it included a segment mocking Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s appearance before the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in relation to the News International phone hacking scandal. Parliamentary rules ban parliamentary proceedings from being broadcast in a satirical context. Stewart dedicated a segment of the show on August 2, 2011, to lampooning the censorship of the episode in Britain. In May that year, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; mocked the ban on using footage of the Royal Wedding in a satirical context with an animated video that showed Paddington Bear, Gollum and Adolf Hitler as guests at the wedding, and depicted its attendants engaging in various forms of violent and sexual behavior. Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; used to be aired in India on Comedy Central India.

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; aired on Australian Pay TV channel, The Comedy Channel, weeknights at 6:30pm. Free-to-air digital channel ABC2 began broadcasting the show without commercial breaks in March 2010, but discontinued in January 2011 when The Comedy Channel obtained exclusive rights; episodes were also available on the network&#x27;s online service ABC iView shortly after airing. The Comedy Channel (as well as ABC2 during 2010) used to air the show together with &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and both air the &quot;Global Edition&quot; on Mondays and the regular edition Tuesday through Friday. The &quot;Global Edition&quot; was previously shown weekend late nights on SBS before moving to Network TEN. The show now airs on 10 Shake (owned by Comedy Central parent ViacomCBS).

In North Africa and the Middle East, the Daily Show was broadcast on Showtime Arabia starting in 2008 and ending in 2015. When the show transitioned under Noah, OSN decided to wait a bit before airing the new show. Now, the Global Edition of Noah&#x27;s show is broadcast on OSN&#x27;s Comedy Central HD channel. Episodes are often edited if they contain topics deemed inappropriate for the region.

Episodes of the American version are also available online the next day at Comedy Central&#x27;s official &quot;Daily Show&quot; website, although this service is not available in all countries. However, clips for UK and Ireland viewers became available on the UK Comedy Central website in December 2011.

=== &quot;The Daily Show: Nederlandse Editie&quot; ===
An official Dutch version of the show called &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Daily Show: Dutch Edition&quot;) premiered on the Dutch Comedy Central on January 31, 2011. The program is similar to the original, except with Dutch news and a Dutch view on international news. The show is hosted by comedian Jan-Jaap van der Wal, who was a team captain on &quot;Dit was het nieuws&quot;, the Dutch edition of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;. The first episode featured a guest appearance by Jon Stewart (recorded at the New York studio), who gave his official blessing for the show. This is also the first and still only franchise of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. The &#x27;Dutch Edition&#x27; didn&#x27;t make it past the test run of 12 episodes due to lack of viewers.

== Spin-offs ==
=== &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; ===

A spin-off, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, was announced in early May 2005. The show starred former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and served as Comedy Central&#x27;s answer to the programs of media pundits such as Bill O&#x27;Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed the idea for the show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier &quot;Daily Show&quot; segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot. &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; premiered on October 17, 2005, and aired following &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for nine years. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year. &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; was produced by Jon Stewart&#x27;s production company, Busboy Productions.

In 2014, it was announced that Colbert would leave Comedy Central to host &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; on CBS in 2015, following the retirement of David Letterman. The final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; aired on December 18, 2014.

=== &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot; ===

On May 9, 2014, it was announced that Larry Wilmore had been selected to host a show on Comedy Central to serve as a replacement for &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. On January 19, 2015, Wilmore began hosting &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;, a late-night panel talk show. It was produced by Busboy Productions. On August 15, 2016, Comedy Central announced that Wilmore&#x27;s show had been cancelled. The show ended on August 18, 2016, with a total of 259 episodes.

=== &quot;The Opposition with Jordan Klepper&quot; ===

On April 4, 2017, Comedy Central announced a brand-new spinoff to occupy the 11:30 p.m. time slot which had not had an original show since the canceling of &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;. &quot;The Daily Show&quot;&#x27;s senior correspondent Jordan Klepper was enlisted as host, with Klepper, Stuart Miller, and Trevor Noah serving as executive producers. The show intends to &quot;satirize the hyperbolic, conspiracy-laden noise machine that is the alternative-media landscape on both the right and left.&quot;

The show aired from September 25, 2017, to June 28, 2018. Comedy Central announced that Klepper would be hosting a new primetime weekly talk show, &quot;Klepper&quot;, which debuted in 2019.

=== &quot;The Daily Show: Ears Edition&quot; ===
In February 2018, &quot;The Daily Show: Ears Edition&quot; podcast was launched as companion piece to the main program, often featuring extended information and additional interviews. In December 19, Comedy Central launched a 5 episode mini series podcast called &quot;The Daily Show Podcast Universe&quot;.

<text>The Swedish Vallhund, also known as the &quot;Västgötaspets&quot; and Swedish cow dog, is a breed of dog native to Sweden. The breed&#x27;s name, &quot;Vallhund&quot;, when translated into English, means herding dog, as the Swedish Vallhund was originally bred as a drover and herder of cows over 1,000 years ago. In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Björn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end. In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as &quot;the Västgötaspets&quot; for Västergötland, the province in which their revival took place. Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity. 


==Physical features==
The average height of the Swedish Vallhund, measured at the withers, is approximately 33 cm (12.9 in) for males and 31 cm (12.2 in) for females. They are strong, with a long body. The ratio of height to body length is about 2:3. The head of the Vallhund is wedge-shaped, with dark brown oval eyes and pricked ears. They are born with every variance of tail length, from no tail at all to full length, therefore they are often mistaken for having been docked. (Tail docking is illegal in Sweden.)

==Colour and coat==
The coat is short and harsh, with a tight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat. The hair on the foreparts of the legs is slightly longer than that of the neck, chest and back parts of the hind legs. Fur color varies from grey, greyish brown and greyish yellow to reddish brown, with darker hair on the back, neck, and sides of the body. Lighter hair in the same shade of color as mentioned above can be seen on the muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks. They have lighter markings on their shoulders, also known as harness markings. Some dogs have white patches which appear, to a small extent, as a narrow blaze, neckstop or slight necklace, as well as having white markings on their fore and hindlegs and on the chest. The maximum is 30% white.

==Health and lifespan==
The Swedish Vallhund is generally a healthy dog. Its small stature contributes to its longevity, with an average lifespan of 15 years. Its pointy ears mean that—unlike dog breeds with long, hanging ears—ear problems are rare. This breed does well in hot climates because of its double layer coat, as long as the dog is provided cool shade and water. The breed does not do well in very deep snow because of its short legs. The Vallhund has an inherited type of progressive retinal atrophy disease in 34.9% of the population, which appears as mild to moderate night-blindness around the age of ten.

==Activities==
The Vallhund can compete in a variety of sports including dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, hiking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Vallhunds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

==History==
The Swedish Vallhund is an ancient, national dog breed of Sweden and may date back to the 8th or 9th century. Swedish Vallhunds originated in the province of Västergötland, which lies just south of lake Vänern. Here the small dog proved to be excellent for watching, guarding and herding. The breed dates to the Viking settlement of England and is thought to have played a part in the development of the modern Welsh Corgi and the Lancashire Heeler. According to the American Kennel Club, another theory of the breed&#x27;s origin is that during the eighth or ninth century &quot;either the Swedish Vallhund was brought to Wales or the Corgi was taken to Sweden, hence the similarities between the two breeds&quot;.

The Swedish Vallhund is related to larger spitz dogs and moose hunting dogs of Scandinavia. Large dogs of this spitz-type have been found buried with their masters in Stone-Age settlements in Scandinavia.

<doc id="235875" wikidata="Q1550565" url="?curid=235875" title="Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals">
<text>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785; ; also known as the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals, and the Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals) is the first of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s mature works on moral philosophy and the first of his trilogy of major works on ethics alongside the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; and &quot;The Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. It remains one of the most influential in the field. Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics—one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory, and showing that they are normative for rational agents.

Kant proposes to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us. Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;, which states that one must act only according to maxims which one could will to become a universal law. Kant argues that the rightness of an action is determined by the principle that a person chooses to act upon. This stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time of Kant&#x27;s career.

The &quot;Groundwork&quot; is broken into a preface, followed by three sections. Kant begins from common-sense moral reason and shows by analysis the supreme moral law that must be its principle. He then argues that the supreme moral law in fact obligates us. The book is famously difficult, and it is partly because of this that Kant later, in 1788, decided to publish the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;.

== Preface ==

In the preface to the &quot;Groundwork&quot;, motivating the need for pure moral philosophy, Kant makes some preliminary remarks to situate his project and explain his method of investigation.

Kant opens the preface with an affirmation of the Ancient Greek idea of a threefold division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics.

Logic is purely formal—it deals only with the form of thought itself, not with any particular objects. Physics and ethics, on the other hand, deal with particular objects: physics is concerned with the laws of nature, ethics with the laws of freedom. Additionally, logic is an &quot;a priori&quot; discipline, i.e., logical truths do not depend on any particular experience for their justification. By contrast, physics and ethics are mixed disciplines, containing empirical and non-empirical parts. The empirical part of physics deals with contingently true phenomena, like what kind of physical entities there are and the relations in which they stand; the non-empirical part deals with fundamental concepts like space, time, and matter. Similarly, ethics contains an empirical part, which deals with the question of what—given the contingencies of human nature—tends to promote human welfare, and a non-empirical part, which is concerned with an &quot;a priori&quot; investigation into the nature and substance of morality.

Because it is &quot;a priori&quot;, Kant calls this latter, non-empirical part of ethics &quot;metaphysics of morals&quot;. It corresponds to the non-empirical part of physics, which Kant calls &quot;metaphysics of nature&quot;.

=== Metaphysics of morals ===
Kant proceeds to motivate the need for the special sort of inquiry he calls a &quot;metaphysics of morals&quot;: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.”

The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other words, do not vary according to the particularities of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through &quot;a priori&quot; rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant believes that, until we have completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the &quot;Groundwork&quot;.

=== Pure ethics ===
In essence, Kant&#x27;s remarks in the preface prepare the reader for the thrust of the ideas he goes on to develop in the &quot;Groundwork. &quot;The purpose of the &quot;Groundwork&quot; is to prepare a foundation for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact that is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from &quot;a priori &quot;reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the &quot;Groundwork&quot; attempts to establish a pure (&quot;a priori&quot;) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the &quot;supreme principle of morality&quot;. The aim of the following sections of the &quot;Groundwork&quot; is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.

== Section One ==
In section one, Kant argues from common-sense morality to the supreme principle of morality, which he calls the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common-sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality (i.e., the categorical imperative). Kant&#x27;s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts:

# the good will;
# the teleological argument;
# the three propositions regarding duty; and
# the categorical imperative.

=== The Good Will ===
Kant thinks that, with the exception of the good will, all goods are qualified. By &quot;qualified&quot;, Kant means that those goods are good insofar as they presuppose or derive their goodness from something else. For example, wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, but we certainly would not take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. The &quot;good will&quot;, by contrast, is good in itself. Kant writes, “A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes, because of its fitness to attain some proposed end, but only because of its volition, that is, it is good in itself.” The precise nature of the good will is subject to scholarly debate.

=== The Teleological Argument ===
Kant believes that a teleological argument may be given to demonstrate that the “true vocation of reason must be to produce a will that is good.” As with other teleological arguments, such as the case with that for the existence of God, Kant&#x27;s teleological argument is motivated by an appeal to a belief or sense that the whole universe, or parts of it, serve some greater &quot;telos&quot;, or end/purpose. If nature&#x27;s creatures are so purposed, Kant thinks their capacity to reason would certainly not serve a purpose of self-preservation or achievement of happiness, which are better served by their natural inclinations. What guides the will in those matters is inclination.

By the method of elimination, Kant argues that the capacity to reason must serve another purpose, namely, &quot;to&quot; &quot;produce good will&quot;, or, in Kant&#x27;s own words, to “produce a will that is...good in itself.” Kant&#x27;s argument from teleology is widely taken to be problematic: it is based on the assumption that our faculties have distinct natural purposes for which they are most suitable, and it is questionable whether Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy could be consistent with this sort of argument.

=== The Three Propositions Regarding Duty ===
The teleological argument, if flawed, still offers that critical distinction between a will guided by inclination and a will guided by reason. That will which is guided by reason, Kant will argue, is the will that acts from duty. Kant&#x27;s argument proceeds by way of three propositions, the last of which is derived from the first two.

==== First proposition ====
Although Kant never explicitly states what the first proposition is, it is clear that its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among:

Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer. The shopkeeper treats his customer fairly, but because it is in his prudent self-interest to do so, in order to preserve his reputation, we cannot assume that he is motivated by duty, and thus the shopkeeper&#x27;s action cannot be said to have moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief”, and having entirely lost his will to live, yet obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant also notes that many individuals possess an inclination to do good; but however commendable such actions may be, they do not have moral worth when they are done out of pleasure. If, however, a philanthropist had lost all capacity to feel pleasure in good works but still did pursue them out of duty, only then would we say they were morally worthy.

Scholars disagree about the precise formulation of the first proposition. One interpretation asserts that the missing proposition is that an act has moral worth only when its agent is motivated by respect for the law, as in the case of the man who preserves his life only from duty. Another interpretation asserts that the proposition is that an act has moral worth only if the principle acted upon generates moral action non-contingently. If the shopkeeper in the above example had made his choice contingent upon what would serve the interests of his business, then his act has no moral worth.

Kant states that this is how we should understand the Scriptural command to love even one&#x27;s enemy: love as inclination or sentiment cannot be commanded, only rational love as duty can be.

==== Second proposition ====
Kant&#x27;s second proposition states:[A]n action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire.” A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. By this, Kant means that the moral worth of an act depends not on its consequences, intended or real, but on the principle acted upon.

==== Third proposition ====
Kant combines these two propositions into a third proposition, a complete statement of our common sense notions of duty. This proposition is that ‘duty is necessity of action from respect for law.’ This final proposition serves as the basis of Kant&#x27;s argument for the supreme principle of morality, the categorical imperative.

=== Categorical Imperative: Universality ===

Kant believes that all of our actions, whether motivated by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances.

At this point, Kant asks, &quot;what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?&quot; He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of &quot;universality&quot;. Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following:I ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.

Later, at the beginning of Section Two, Kant admits that it is in fact impossible to give a single example of an action that could be certainly said to have been done from duty alone, or ever to know one&#x27;s own mind well enough to be sure of one&#x27;s own motives. The important thing, then, is not whether such pure virtue ever actually exists in the world; the important thing is that that reason dictates duty and that we recognize it as such.

== Section Two ==
In Section II, Kant starts from scratch and attempts to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the &quot;Groundwork&quot; by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves when it comes to evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.

Kant begins his new argument in Section II with some observations about rational willing. All things in nature must act according to laws, but only rational beings act in accordance with the representation of a law. In other words, only rational beings have the capacity to recognize and consult laws and principles in order to guide their actions. Thus, only rational creatures have practical reason. The laws and principles that rational agents consult yield imperatives, or rules that necessitate the will. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will recognize and consult the rules that tell him how to achieve this goal. These rules will provide him with imperatives that he must follow as long as he wants to qualify for nationals.

=== Imperatives ===
Imperatives are either hypothetical or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when he or she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I should go to the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. However, notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me.

Kant posits that there are two types of hypothetical imperative—&quot;rules of skill&quot; and &quot;counsels of prudence&quot;. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know exactly what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. We can only know through experience what certain things will please us and even then, that could change over time. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.

=== Categorical Imperative: Laws of nature ===

Recall that the moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on hypothetical imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law.

What would the categorical imperative look like? We know that it could never be based on the particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant believes that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or &quot;commands&quot;), by definition, apply universally. From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only in a way that the principle of their will could become a universal law. The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. The categorical imperative is Kant&#x27;s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.

=== The Formula of the Universal Law of Nature ===
The first formulation states that an action is only morally permissible if every agent could adopt the same principle of action without generating one of two kinds of contradiction. This is called the Formula for the Universal Law of Nature, which states that one should, “act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature.” A proposed maxim can fail to meet such requirement in one of two ways.

==== Contradiction in conception ====
First, one might encounter a scenario in which one&#x27;s proposed maxim would become impossible in a world in which it is universalized. For example, suppose a person in need of money makes it his or her maxim to attain a loan by making a false promise to pay it back. If everyone followed this principle, nobody would trust another person when he or she made a promise, and the institution of promise-making would be destroyed. However, the maxim of making a false promise in order to attain a loan relies on the very institution of promise-making that universalizing this maxim destroys. Kant calls this a &quot;contradiction in conception&quot; because it is impossible to conceive of the maxim being universalized.

==== Contradiction in willing ====
Second, a maxim might fail by generating what Kant calls a &quot;contradiction in willing.&quot; This sort of contradiction comes about when the universalized maxim contradicts something that rational agents necessarily will. For example, a person might have a maxim never to help others when they are in need. However, Kant thinks that all agents necessarily wish for the help of others from time to time. Therefore, it is impossible for the agent to will that his or her maxim be universally adopted. If an attempt to universalize a maxim results in a contradiction in conception, it violates what Kant calls a perfect duty. If it results in a contradiction in willing, it violates what Kant calls an imperfect duty. Perfect duties are negative duties, that is duties not to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example theft). Imperfect duties are positive duties, duties to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example, giving to charity).

In the &quot;Groundwork&quot;, Kant says that perfect duties never admit of exception for the sake of inclination, which is sometimes taken to imply that imperfect duties &quot;do&quot; admit of exception for the sake of inclination. However, in a later work (&quot;The Metaphysics of Morals)&quot;, Kant suggests that imperfect duties only allow for flexibility in how one chooses to fulfill them. Kant believes that we have perfect and imperfect duties both to ourselves and to others.

=== The Formula of Humanity ===
The second formulation of the categorical imperative is the Formula of Humanity, which Kant arrives at by considering the motivating ground of the categorical imperative. Because the moral law is necessary and universal, its motivating ground must have absolute worth. Were we to find something with such absolute worth, an end in itself, that would be the only possible ground of a categorical imperative. Kant asserts that, “a human being and generally every rational being exists as an end in itself.” The corresponding imperative, the Formula of Humanity, commands that “you use humanity, whether in your own persona or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.” When we treat others merely as means to our discretionary ends, we violate a perfect duty. However, Kant thinks that we also have an imperfect duty to advance the end of humanity. For example, making a false promise to another person in order to achieve the end of getting some money treats their rational nature as a mere means to one&#x27;s selfish end. This is, therefore, a violation of a perfect duty. By contrast, it is possible to fail to donate to charity without treating some other person as a mere means to an end, but in doing so we fail to advance the end of humanity, thereby violating an imperfect duty.

=== The Formula of Autonomy and the Kingdom of Ends ===
The Formula of Autonomy takes something important from both the Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves thinking about your maxim as if it were an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with how you are treating the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what he or she would accept as a universal law. To do this, he or she would test his or her maxims against the moral law that he or she has legislated. The Principle of Autonomy is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.”

==== Kingdom of ends ====
Kant believes that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the &quot;kingdom of ends&quot;. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one&#x27;s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.

== Section Three ==
In section three, Kant argues that we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant establishes two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves; we can view ourselves:

# as members of the world of appearances, which operates according to the laws of nature; or
# as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act.

These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, despite the fact that the world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world—in which morality is grounded—is something that we cannot make positive claims about.

=== Freedom and Willing ===
Kant opens section III by defining the will as the cause of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom—it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces.

However, Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law—it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions in a way that is distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing.

Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant&#x27;s notion of &quot;autonomy&quot;. Thus, Kant&#x27;s notion of &quot;freedom of the will&quot; requires that we are morally self-legislating; that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same.” This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis, which states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa. Kant then asks why we have to follow the principle of morality. Although we all may feel the force of our consciences, Kant, examining phenomena with a philosophical eye, is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so.” He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws,” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under.

==== Gods-eye and human perspective ====
According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god&#x27;s-eye perspective. From this perspective, the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us from our point of view the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god&#x27;s-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding.”

It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.

=== Occupying Two Worlds ===
On Kant&#x27;s view, the categorical imperative is possible because, although we as rational agents can be thought of as members of both the intelligible and the phenomenal world (understanding and appearance), it is the intelligible world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [appearance] and so too of its laws.” In this sense, the world of understanding is more fundamental than, or ‘grounds’, the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, because the world of understanding has priority. As a result, and because the world of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. The categorical imperative, and therefore the moral law, binds us in the intelligible world and in the phenomenal world of appearances.

Kant argues that autonomous rational agents, like ourselves, think of themselves as having free will. This permits such beings to make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant claims, in both this work and in the first Critique, that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our phenomenal experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn&#x27;t come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and there is no room for a free will to influence events.

So, Kant argues, we are committed to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we are committed to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.

The way Kant suggests that we should deal with this dialectic is through an appeal to the two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.

Kant cautions that we cannot feel or intuit this world of the understanding. He also stresses that we are unable to make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could have anything to say about practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.

== Critical reaction ==
In his book &quot;On the Basis of Morality&quot; (1840), Arthur Schopenhauer presents a careful analysis of the &quot;Groundwork&quot;. His criticism is an attempt to prove, among other things, that actions are not moral when they are performed solely from duty. Schopenhauer called Kant&#x27;s ethical philosophy the weakest point in Kant&#x27;s philosophical system and specifically targeted the Categorical Imperative, labeling it cold and egoistic. While he publicly called himself a Kantian, and made clear and bold criticisms of Hegelian philosophy, he was quick and unrelenting in his analysis of the inconsistencies throughout Kant&#x27;s long body of work. Schopenhauer&#x27;s early admirer, Friedrich Nietzsche, also criticized the Categorical Imperative as &quot;dangerous to life&quot;, in that, among other things: A nation goes to pieces when it confounds its duty with the general concept of duty. Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every &quot;impersonal&quot; duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction. He takes it to be a peculiar expression of &quot;slavish&quot; egalitarianism, &quot;de facto&quot; always already prioritizing the sick, the weakly over the healthy and strong – those capable of valid self-legislation to begin with –, thereby undermining the very possibility of human greatness at its root. But others have stressed many deeper similarities that adherents to a framework of unqualified liberalism, prone to condemning Nietzsche from the canon, have overlooked.

In the 20th century, Lewis White Beck observed that in the course of evaluating Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy, some modern scholars have neglected his &quot;second critique&quot; (&quot;The Critique of Practical Reason&quot;) in the course of placing their primary emphasis on the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.&quot; In his &quot;A Commentary on Kant&#x27;s Critique of Practical Reason&quot; Beck argues that a more comprehensive understanding of Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy emerges in the &quot;second critique&quot; as a result of the analysis which Kant puts forth in reference to the concept of &quot;freedom&quot;, the postulates of &quot;pure practical reason&quot; and the notion of &quot;practical reason&quot;. Beck concludes that in the &quot;second critique&quot; Kant weaves these diverse strands into single unified theory of practical moral authority more successfully than in the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.&quot;

<text>The ouroboros or uroboros (; ) is an ancient symbol depicting a snake or dragon eating its own tail. The ouroboros entered Western tradition via ancient Egyptian iconography and the Greek magical tradition. It was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism and most notably in alchemy. Some snakes, such as rat snakes, have been known to consume themselves.

== Name and interpretation ==
The term derives , from &quot;oura&quot; &#x27;tail&#x27; plus &quot;-boros&quot; &#x27;-eating&#x27;.

The &quot;ouroboros&quot; is often interpreted as a symbol for eternal cyclic renewal or a cycle of life, death and rebirth; the snake&#x27;s skin-sloughing symbolises the transmigration of souls. The snake biting its own tail is a fertility symbol in some religions: the tail is a phallic symbol and the mouth is a yonic or womb-like symbol.

== Historical representations ==
=== Ancient Egypt ===
One of the earliest known ouroboros motifs is found in the &quot;Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld&quot;, an ancient Egyptian funerary text in KV62, the tomb of Tutankhamun, in the 14th century BCE. The text concerns the actions of Ra and his union with Osiris in the underworld. The ouroboros is depicted twice on the figure: holding their tails in their mouths, one encircling the head and upper chest, the other surrounding the feet of a large figure, which may represent the unified Ra-Osiris (Osiris born again as Ra). Both serpents are manifestations of the deity Mehen, who in other funerary texts protects Ra in his underworld journey. The whole divine figure represents the beginning and the end of time.

The ouroboros appears elsewhere in Egyptian sources, where, like many Egyptian serpent deities, it represents the formless disorder that surrounds the orderly world and is involved in that world&#x27;s periodic renewal. The symbol persisted from Egyptian into Roman times, when it frequently appeared on magical talismans, sometimes in combination with other magical emblems. The 4th-century CE Latin commentator Servius was aware of the Egyptian use of the symbol, noting that the image of a snake biting its tail represents the cyclical nature of the year.

=== Gnosticism and alchemy ===

In Gnosticism, a serpent biting its tail symbolised eternity and the soul of the world. The Gnostic &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; (c. 400 CE) describes the ouroboros as a twelve-part dragon surrounding the world with its tail in its mouth.

The famous ouroboros drawing from the early alchemical text, &quot;The Chrysopoeia of Cleopatra&quot; (), probably originally dating to the 3rd century Alexandria, but first known in a 10th-century copy, encloses the words &quot;hen to pan&quot; (), &quot;the all is one&quot;. Its black and white halves may perhaps represent a Gnostic duality of existence, analogous to the Taoist yin and yang symbol. The chrysopoeia ouroboros of Cleopatra the Alchemist is one of the oldest images of the ouroboros to be linked with the legendary &quot;opus&quot; of the alchemists, the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

A 15th-century alchemical manuscript, &quot;The Aurora Consurgens&quot;, features the ouroboros, where it is used among symbols of the sun, moon, and mercury.

=== World serpent in mythology ===
In Norse mythology, the ouroboros appears as the serpent Jörmungandr, one of the three children of Loki and Angrboda, which grew so large that it could encircle the world and grasp its tail in its teeth. In the legends of Ragnar Lodbrok, such as &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;, the Geatish king Herraud gives a small lindworm as a gift to his daughter Þóra Town-Hart after which it grows into a large serpent which encircles the girl&#x27;s bower and bites itself in the tail. The serpent is slain by Ragnar Lodbrok who marries Þóra. Ragnar later has a son with another woman named Kráka and this son is born with the image of a white snake in one eye. This snake encircled the iris and bit itself in the tail, and the son was named Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye.

It is a common belief among indigenous people of the tropical lowlands of South America that waters at the edge of the world-disc are encircled by a snake, often an anaconda, biting its own tail.

The ouroboros has certain features in common with the Biblical Leviathan. According to the Zohar, the Leviathan is a singular creature with no mate, &quot;its tail is placed in its mouth&quot;, while Rashi on Baba Batra 74b describes it as &quot;twisting around and encompassing the entire world&quot;. The identification appears to go back as far as the poems of Kalir in the 6th–7th centuries.

=== Connection to Indian thought ===
In the &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot;, a Vedic text of the early 1st millennium BCE, the nature of the Vedic rituals is compared to &quot;a snake biting its own tail.&quot;

Ouroboros symbolism has been used to describe the Kundalini. According to the medieval &quot;Yoga-kundalini Upanishad&quot;: &quot;The divine power, Kundalini, shines like the stem of a young lotus; like a snake, coiled round upon herself she holds her tail in her mouth and lies resting half asleep as the base of the body&quot; (1.82).

Storl (2004) also refers to the ouroboros image in reference to the &quot;cycle of samsara&quot;.

== Modern references ==

=== Jungian psychology ===
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung saw the ouroboros as an archetype and the basic mandala of alchemy. Jung also defined the relationship of the ouroboros to alchemy: Carl Jung, &quot;Collected Works&quot;, Vol. 14 para. 513.

The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann writes of it as a representation of the pre-ego &quot;dawn state&quot;, depicting the undifferentiated infancy experience of both mankind and the individual child.

=== Kekulé&#x27;s dream ===

The German organic chemist August Kekulé described the eureka moment when he realised the structure of benzene, after he saw a vision of Ouroboros:

I was sitting, writing at my text-book; but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed. Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformation: long rows, sometimes more closely fitted together; all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis.

=== Cosmos ===
Martin Rees used the ouroboros to illustrate the various scales of the universe, ranging from 10−20 cm (subatomic) at the tail, up to 1025 cm (supragalactic) at the head. Rees stressed &quot;the intimate links between the microworld and the cosmos, symbolised by the &quot;ouraborus&quot;&quot;, as tail and head meet to complete the circle.

=== Cybernetics ===
W. Ross Ashby applied ideas from biology to his own work as a psychiatrist in &quot;Design for a Brain&quot; (1952): that living things maintain essential variables of the body within critical limits with the brain as a regulator of the necessary feedback loops. Parmar contextualises his practices as an artist in applying the cybernetic Ouroboros principle to musical improvisation.

Hence the snake eating its tail is an accepted image or metaphor in the autopoietic calculus for self-reference, or self-indication, the logical processual notation for analysing and explaining self-producing autonomous systems and &quot;the riddle of the living&quot;, developed by Francisco Varela. Reichel describes this as:

The calculus derives from the confluence of the cybernetic logic of feedback, the sub-disciplines of autopoiesis developed by Varela and Humberto Maturana, and calculus of indications of George Spencer Brown. In another related biological application:

Second-order cybernetics, or the cybernetics of cybernetics, applies the principle of self-referentiality, or the participation of the observer in the observed, to explore observer involvement. including D. J. Stewart&#x27;s domain of &quot;observer valued imparities&quot;.

=== Armadillo girdled lizard ===
The genus of the armadillo girdled lizard, &quot;Ouroborus cataphractus&quot;, takes its name from the animal&#x27;s defensive posture: curling into a ball and holding its own tail in its mouth.
=== In Iberian culture ===
A medium-sized European hake, known in Spanish as and in Portuguese as , is often presented with its mouth biting its tail. In Spanish it receives the name of (&quot;torus hake&quot;). Both expressions &quot;tail-in mouth little hake&quot; and , &quot;the hake that bites its tail&quot;, are proverbial Portuguese and Spanish expressions for circular reasoning and vicious circles.

=== Dragon Gate Pro-Wrestling ===
The Kobe, Japan-based Dragon Gate Pro-Wrestling promotion used a stylised ouroboros as their logo for the first 20 years of the company&#x27;s existence. The logo is a silhouetted dragon twisted into the shape of an infinity symbol, devouring its own tail. In 2019, the promotion dropped the infinity dragon logo in favour of a shield logo.

=== In fiction ===
==== Literature ====

A variation of the Ouroboros motif is an important symbol in the fantasy novel &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; by Michael Ende: featuring two snakes, one black and one white, biting the other&#x27;s tail, this symbol represents the powerful AURYN and the infinite nature of the story. The symbol is also featured prominently on the cover of both the fictional book and the novel.

&quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; is a high-fantasy novel written by E. R. Eddison. Much like the cyclical symbol of the ouroboros eating its own tail, the novel ends as it begins. The main villain has a ring in the form of Ouroboros.

In &quot;Mexican Gothic&quot; the symbol is used throughout the story, portraying the immortality of the home and the family, as well as the persistence of outdated ideologies. 

In &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; and its 2021 television adaption, the Aes Sedai wear a &quot;Great Serpent&quot; ring, described as a snake consuming its own tail. 

In the science fiction short story &quot;All You Zombies&quot; (1958) by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, the character Jane wears an Ouroboros ring, &quot;the worm Ouroboros, the world snake&quot;. The short story later inspired the movie &quot;Predestination&quot; (2014).

In the SCP Foundation universe, the proposal tale &quot;The Ouroboros Cycle&quot; spans the story of the SCP Foundation from its creation to its ending.

In the &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot; novels and television adaptation, the crest of the de Clermont family is an ouroboros. The symbol plays a significant role in the alchemical plot of the story.

In &quot;The Witcher&quot;, the Ouroboros and the &quot;snake biting its own tail&quot; is a recurring theme.

==== Film and television ====
The Ouroboros is the adopted symbol of the End Times-obsessed Millennium Group in the TV series &quot;Millennium&quot;. It also briefly appears when Dana Scully gets a tattoo of it in &quot;The X-Files&quot; Season 4 episode &quot;Never Again&quot; (1997).

&quot;Ouroboros&quot; is an episode of the British science-fiction sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, in which Dave Lister learns that he is his own father through time travel. 

In Season 1 (2012) of &quot;Ninjago&quot; titled &quot;&quot;, the Lost City of Ouroboros (also referred to as the Ancient City of Ouroboros) serves as a pivotal location in the Serpentine&#x27;s plan for vengeance against Ninjago. Once a massive Serpentine city, Ouroboros was buried beneath the Sea of Sand after the Serpentine War. The city was key to Pythor and the Serpentine&#x27;s efforts to awaken the Great Devourer, which had been imprisoned beneath the city. After retrieving the four Fangblades, Pythor returned to Ouroboros and successfully released the Great Devourer, causing significant damage to the city. Despite the destruction, the Serpentine continued to use the city as a temporary base before abandoning it to journey to the tomb of the Stone Army.

In Hemlock Grove (2013-2015), the ouroboros plays an important part throughout the series.

In Season 3 (2014), , during the Nindroid crisis, Pythor once again used Ouroboros as a base of operations. Here, he led an army of Nindroids and launched a giant rocket into space in search of the comet that held the remnants of the Golden Weapons.

In Season 1 (2018) of the cyberpunk Netflix series &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, the protagonist Takeshi Kovacs gets an ouroboros tattoo in shape of an infinity symbol, and it features in the show’s title sequence, tying in to the themes of rebirth and the twisting of the natural cycle of life and death. 

In the season 2 premiere of the television series &quot;Loki&quot;, a character named Ouroboros (played by Ke Huy Quan) is introduced. He is an employee of the Time Variance Authority. In the fourth episode, he also references a snake biting its own tail.

In the anime &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot;, members of the homunculi race are identified by having the symbol carved/tattooed/branded/marked on them.

The Abiranariba in &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot; is based on the ouroboros.

==== Gaming ====
&quot;Splatoon 3&quot; has a serpent-like Salmonid creature named after it, the Horrorboros.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails features the enigmatic Society of Ouroboros, whose members serve as recurring antagonists in the series.

In &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 3&quot;, the player&#x27;s party wields a power named after Ouroboros, which is subversively used to &quot;oppose&quot; the world&#x27;s cycle of death and rebirth, rather than representing it.

In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, an ouroboros spins on loading screens as an indiciation for the game loading.

A three-headed ouroboros is the logo of Elder Scrolls Online, with a lion, a dragon, and an eagle that represent the three main factions of the game.

<text>Comedy Central is an American cable channel owned by Paramount Global through its network division&#x27;s MTV Entertainment Group unit, based in Manhattan. The channel carries comedy programming in the form of both original, licensed, and syndicated television series, stand-up comedy specials, and feature films. 

, Comedy Central is available to approximately 68,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households.

== History ==
=== 1989–1991: The Comedy Channel and Ha! ===
On November 15, 1989, Time-Life, the owners of HBO, launched The Comedy Channel as the first cable channel devoted exclusively to comedy-based programming. On April 1, 1990, Viacom (who owned MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon) launched a rival channel called Ha! that featured reruns of situation comedies and some original sketch comedy.

The Comedy Channel&#x27;s programs were broadcast from the HBO Downtown Studios at 120 East 23rd Street in Manhattan. The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such as &quot;Onion World&quot; with Rich Hall and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, including &quot;The Sweet Life&quot; with Rachel Sweet, &quot;Night After Night with Allan Havey&quot;, &quot;Sports Monster&quot;, and &quot;The Higgins Boys and Gruber&quot;, the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series like &quot;Supercar&quot;, &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;, and &quot;Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp&quot;.

The standard format for The Comedy Channel&#x27;s shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without &quot;host segments&quot; were dubbed &quot;Short Attention Span Theater&quot;. In 1990, hosts under this title, Jon Stewart and Patty Rosborough, were introduced. Comedian Marc Maron also hosted the series.

While The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming, Ha!&#x27;s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister network Nick at Nite) as well as complete 90-minute reruns of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from the sixth through 16th seasons.

After two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching on April 1, 1991, as CTV: The Comedy Network. On June 1, 1991, the network changed its name to Comedy Central to prevent issues with the Canadian broadcast television network CTV, which would eventually be its Canadian content partner through The Comedy Network when that channel started operations six years later.

Around this time, the network introduced their now-iconic logo, which is a globe showing the Americas with tall buildings on the North American part and a black marquee ring (see below).

Comedy Partners was originally a partnership of Home Box Office, Inc., the subsidiary of Time Warner that owned The Comedy Channel and HBO&#x27;s half and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha! LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom&#x27;s half of the network during its first years on air. Viacom bought out AOL Time Warner&#x27;s half in April 2003 for $1.23 billion. Despite HBO&#x27;s exit from the venture, the Viacom Media Networks division in charge of Comedy Central is still called Comedy Partners, currently being a partnership of Paramount Global Content Distribution, the operating subsidiary of Paramount of which Paramount Media Networks is a division and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha! LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom&#x27;s original half of the network.

=== 1991–2000 ===

From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, much of the programming on Comedy Central and its predecessors consisted of comedy films, sitcom reruns, half-hour specials, and clip shows featuring comedians. Except for the cult favorite &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success was &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher, which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up by ABC. Additionally, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; had got its start with original host Craig Kilborn, although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction of Jon Stewart in 1999 (who was former co-host of &quot;Short Attention Span Theater&quot; from 1991).

&quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot; was also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game show &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy group &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; and British shows such as the UK edition of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; (the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. Some later seasons of &quot;AbFab&quot;, as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle&#x27;s &quot;Almost Live!&quot; between 1992 and 1993.

The channel made a breakthrough when &quot;South Park&quot; premiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry the TV-MA rating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network; For example, Fox (known for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time. As word of mouth spread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central should be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998.

=== 2000–2010 ===
On October 30, 2000, Comedy Central introduced a modernized version of its globe logo, by straightening and modernizing the buildings as well as removing the transmitter and marquee. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1991 logo was said to &quot;communicate the 1950s broadcast era&quot;. In 2002, Comedy Central Records was formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.

By 2003, Viacom gained full ownership of Comedy Central, and since 2003, Comedy Central has created a tradition of roasting comedians in the style of the New York Friars&#x27; Club roasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have included Denis Leary, Jeff Foxworthy, Pamela Anderson, William Shatner, Flavor Flav, Bob Saget, Larry the Cable Guy, Joan Rivers, Rob Reiner, David Hasselhoff, Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, Roseanne Barr, James Franco, Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Bruce Willis, and Alec Baldwin.

The success of &quot;South Park&quot;, despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every late Friday (early Saturday morning) and Saturday night (early Sunday morning) at 1 a.m. ET/PT, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called the &quot;Secret Stash&quot;. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut of &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such as &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, and rear nudity.

In late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;Reno 911!&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Dave Chappelle backed out of the much-anticipated third season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; continued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract for &quot;South Park&quot; and the launch of &quot;Daily Show&quot; spin-off &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, it was reported that &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; were the two highest-rated shows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog was reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons of &quot;South Park&quot; forever, and that &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; fulfilled a long-held plan to extend the &quot;Daily Show&quot; brand.

On April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled &quot;Cartoon Wars Part I&quot; and &quot;Cartoon Wars Part II&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot; touched the issue of the recent protest over the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoon &quot;Family Guy&quot;. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show&#x27;s creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads, &quot;In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.&quot; An anonymous source close to the show indicated that &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowed &quot;South Park&quot; to portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, &quot;Super Best Friends&quot;. Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the &quot;Cartoon Wars&quot; episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to &quot;Super Best Friends&quot;).

On January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe. The channel airs 33 shows either dubbed in German or subtitled while also airing locally produced shows. On April 30, Dutch channel The Box was relaunched as the Dutch version of Comedy Central during the primetime and overnight hours timesharing with Nickelodeon. On May 1, 2007, Comedy Central expanded to Italy, replacing Paramount Comedy.

On June 27, 2007, CTVglobemedia-owned networks CTV and The Comedy Network obtained the exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and current programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement with Viacom, expanding on past programming agreements between the two channels. Canadian users attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to The Comedy Network&#x27;s website. The Canadian channel retains its brand name, but the agreement is otherwise very similar to the earlier CTV–Viacom deal for MTV in Canada. As of 2011, this geocaching no longer applies and both the Comedy Central and The Comedy Network websites can be accessed worldwide, except for videos which remain only accessible within each respective country.

In December 2007, Comedy Central picked up a show hosted by Lewis Black called &quot;Lewis Black&#x27;s Root of All Evil&quot;, which debuted in March 2008. On January 9, 2008, it was announced the Comedy Central and MTV would allow the streaming its programs online for free starting in February that year. On January 24, Scott Landsman became the Vice President of Original Programming and Development at the network.

On March 27, 2008, the Swedish Radio and TV Authority approved an application from Comedy Central regarding being allowed to air television programs in Sweden. The grant allowed Comedy Central to broadcast on the terrestrial television network between January 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, after which a new request had to be submitted to continue broadcasting. Comedy Central&#x27;s U.S. flagship network picked up a remake of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; hosted by Dave Attell, star of his former self-titled Comedy Central series &quot;Insomniac&quot;, which debuted in July 2008. Another new show called &quot;Reality Bites Back&quot; premiered after &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot;.

In June 2008, Comedy Central picked up the sketch comedy show &quot;Important Things with Demetri Martin&quot;, which began airing in February 2009. On April 1, 2009, Comedy Central began airing in New Zealand as channel 010 on SKY Digital. On April 6, Paramount Comedy in the UK and Ireland rebranded as Comedy Central. On April 7, 2009, it was announced Comedy Central would air new stand-up comedy specials starring Christopher Titus, Gabriel Iglesias, Pablo Francisco, Jim Breuer, Mitch Fatel and Pete Correale, and ventriloquist Jeff Dunham. An animated show entitled &quot;Ugly Americans&quot; was also picked up by the network. In 2009, &quot;The Goode Family&quot; premiered. Also in 2009, Thomas Lennon announced via Twitter that &quot;Reno 911!&quot; had been canceled after six seasons, much to fan disapproval. The network also played a role in the revival of the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;, which Fox had canceled in 2003. New episodes began airing on Comedy Central in 2010. But in May 2013, Comedy Central released a statement saying that the contract between &quot;Futurama&quot; and Comedy Central would not be renewed and that the summer of 2013 would be &quot;Futurama&quot;″s final season on the air. However, episodes continue to run weekly on Comedy Central.

In 2009, Comedy Central launched a 1080i high definition simulcast feed, which was available on all major cable and satellite providers. The standard definition Comedy Central downscales the HD feed and broadcasts in 16:9 letterboxed to fit the 4:3 ratio. The network also introduced the Internet viral video reaction show &quot;Tosh.0&quot;, hosted by comedian Daniel Tosh. During its second year in the summer of 2010, it became the most viewed show; overtaking &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; for male audiences aged 18–49. Segments from &quot;Tosh.0&quot;″s past seasons have received more views on Comedy Central&#x27;s YouTube channel than any other show. 

&quot;South Park&quot; episodes &quot;200&quot; and &quot;201&quot; aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figure Muhammad&#x27;s perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends returned, but Muhammad was entirely covered by a black bar reading &quot;CENSORED&quot; through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation but did not use Muhammad&#x27;s name. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the &quot;bleeps&quot; were added weeks after the show was finished and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version of South Park, in addition to retroactively removing the original &quot;Super Best Friends&quot; episode. Trey Parker threatened to quit the show after this incident.

=== 2011–2018 ===

On December 9, 2010, Comedy Central introduced a new logo for the network that launched on January 1, 2011, which left behind the previous theme of a world-sized &quot;tower&quot; broadcasting the network/skyscrapers, in favor of an image of two &quot;C&quot;&#x27;s, with one of them and the word &quot;Central&quot; turned upside-down within the new logomark. The new logo was designed to represent the network&#x27;s unique brand of comedy (with some drawing comparisons to the copyright symbol as inspiration for its design and use), and to provide the network with a logo that could be easily used across different platforms, such as social media. However, the &quot;bars&quot; version of the logo used from 2000 to 2011 was intended to be Comedy Central&#x27;s new logo as part of a planned rebranding in 2010, and the network used it short-lived until the network started a logo nicknamed the &quot;Comedymark&quot;. The logo&#x27;s resemblance to the one used by the Federal Communications Commission was also pointed out. It went on to win several industry awards.

The Polish version of the channel was the first international Comedy Central channel to switch to the new logo on February 20, 2011; followed by the Hungarian version on April 1, 2011. Versions of the channel in Germany and the Netherlands soon followed on October 1, 2011. Comedy Central New Zealand rebranded in April 2012. Viacom 18 launched the channel in India on January 23, 2012. StarHub launched Comedy Central Asia in Singapore on November 1, 2012; the channel was added to its Basic Entertainment Upsize group.

In 2012, Atom.com (formerly AtomFilms) was absorbed into Comedy Central.

On April 1, 2012, Comedy Central launched a Russian-language version of Comedy Central branded as Paramount Comedy in Russia. On March 1, 2023, «Paramount Comedy» was renamed to «Comedy Central» and broadcasts in CIS countries (except Russia and Belarus).

On October 21, 2013, the network premiered a nightly comedy-game show series &quot;@midnight&quot; hosted by Chris Hardwick. &quot;@midnight&quot; served as an expansion to the network&#x27;s nightly late-night programming. Due to low ratings, it was canceled on August 4, 2017, with the show airing its 600th and final episode as an hour-long special.

On May 14, 2014, Comedy Central expanded to Spain, replacing Paramount Comedy.

In 2014, it was announced that Stephen Colbert would leave Comedy Central to host &quot;The Late Show&quot; on CBS, following the retirement of David Letterman, the first host of &quot;Late Show&quot;. The final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; aired on Comedy Central on December 18, 2014, after nine years and a total of 1,447 episodes. The final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; was watched by 2.481 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode ever in the show&#x27;s history. The finale was the most-watched cable program of the night in its time slot, beating &quot;The Daily Show&quot; which was seen by 2.032 million viewers. &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; was replaced on Comedy Central by Larry Wilmore from &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, who began hosting his series &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot; on January 19, 2015. The show aired until August 18, 2016, when it was canceled due to low ratings. On February 10, 2015, Jon Stewart also announced his retirement and that he would also leave the network and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; after 16 years. Stewart&#x27;s final episode aired on August 6, 2015, and Trevor Noah succeeded Stewart as new host on September 28, 2015.

On January 5, 2017, the Finnish Government granted television programming licenses in the UHF band. The grant applied by Nickelodeon International Ltd allows Comedy Central to broadcast from May 17, 2017, to January 10, 2027.

On November 16, 2017, Comedy Central launched a Ukrainian-language version of Comedy Central branded as Paramount Comedy in Ukraine. Ukrainian-language version of the channel is operated under the license purchased.

=== 2018–present ===
In July 2018, Comedy Central refreshed its branding, maintaining the existing double-C logomark, but introducing a new in-house typeface, and changing the network&#x27;s corporate color to amber (while also using other colors to denote flagship programs).

On February 11, 2019, Jimmy Kimmel announced on his talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that former show &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; will be revived on Comedy Central for a fifth 20-episode season. The new season will include pranks on social media and other platforms. Kimmel&#x27;s brother Jonathan Kimmel will serve as showrunner and executive producer.

On May 1, 2019, the Viacom-owned Pluto TV launched two Comedy Central networks titled &quot;Comedy Central Pluto&quot; and &quot;Comedy Central Stand Up&quot;. The former airs classic Comedy Central original series such as &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; and more, while the latter airs the network&#x27;s stand-up specials. Later on December 15, 2020, the &quot;Comedy Central Stand Up&quot; channel was removed, and a new &quot;Comedy Central Animation&quot; channel was added.

On December 4, 2019, Viacom re-merged with CBS Corporation to form ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

In 2020, Comedy Central began shifting its programming towards adult animation, with series pickups of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, a reboot of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, and &quot;Daria&quot; spin-off &quot;Jodie&quot; (later changed to a television movie); the first of these titles initially premiered on Paramount+. The network also launched a new weekday animation block initially branded as &quot;Animation Contamination,&quot; featuring reruns of &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;. 

In turn, Comedy Central has decreased its live-action slate; with the cancellations of &quot;Drunk History&quot; and &quot;Tosh.0&quot;. &quot;South Side&quot; and &quot;The Other Two&quot; would move to the Warner-owned HBO Max, while a second season of &quot;Alternatino with Arturo Castro&quot; was slated to premiere on Quibi, but has since failed to materialize after the platform folded.

== Programming == 

Current original programming seen on Comedy Central includes its two longest-running series, &quot;The Daily Show &quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;; &quot;Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens&quot;; adult animated comedies such as &quot;Digman!&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; (which originally premiered on MTV and later Paramount+); and acquired programming such as &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Comedy Central has been a target of criticism from some advocacy groups, including the Parents Television and Media Council (PTMC). The PTMC criticizes their programming not merely for mature content, but also for what they perceive as bigotry and blasphemy. The PTMC has used their criticisms against Comedy Central for their support of the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which would require American cable television companies to allow their subscribers to choose which channels they subscribe to and impose the same content prohibitions that are already in place on broadcast television. The PTMC has also persuaded some advertisers to lower their interest for the channel. PTMC founder and former president L. Brent Bozell III said the channel has managed &quot;to reach the top of its field in spite of – or, better put, because of – the network&#x27;s sheer lack of comedic talent&quot; by its &quot;extensive reliance on shocking or disgusting humor.&quot;

On November 5, 2007, an open letter was written by VideoSift to protest the blocking of Comedy Central&#x27;s embedded video content for non-American viewers.

On April 21, 2010, Comedy Central censored the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;201&quot; in response to a death threat issued by users of a radical Muslim website over the episode&#x27;s planned depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which led several newspaper columnists to condemn the network&#x27;s actions as tantamount to abetting terrorism. As a rare result in the series&#x27; history, &quot;201&quot; and the episode that preceded it were heavily edited and are never aired as reruns.

== International channels ==
Since the early 2000s, Comedy Central has expanded globally with localized channels in Europe (including the United Kingdom), India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, Middle East, Africa Spain and in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The international channels are overseen by Paramount International Networks.

=== Comedy Central Extra ===

Comedy Central Extra is a British and Irish comedy-based television channel, and the sibling channel of Comedy Central in the UK and Ireland. It was originally launched in 2003 as Paramount Comedy 2, before adopting its current name in 2009.

In 2011, Extra was launched in the Netherlands. The channel ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2022; with its programming moved to the Netherlands version of Comedy Central.

The Polish version of Comedy Central Extra is owned by Paramount Networks EMEAA and Polsat. It first launched in 2010 as a programing block on VH1 Poland; it become a full TV channel on 12 June 2012.

<doc id="235883" wikidata="Q7868350" url="?curid=235883" title="USS Choctaw (1856)">
<text>USS &quot;Choctaw&quot; was a large (1,004-ton) steamer built for the merchant service, but acquired by the Union Navy during the second year of the American Civil War.

&quot;Choctaw&quot;, with her crew of 106, was outfitted by the Navy as a ram with heavy rifled guns and was used both as a gunboat and as a ram on the rivers of the Confederate States of America.

== Service history ==

&quot;Choctaw&quot;, a sidewheel steamer, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Choctaw Indian tribe, formerly of Alabama and Mississippi, now resident in Oklahoma. She was built for the merchant service; her keel was laid down at New Albany, Indiana, in 1853. She was launched in 1856. She was purchased by the United States Army on 27 September 1862 and converted into an ironclad ram by Edward Hartt, then transferred to commissioned into the United States Navy at St. Louis, Missouri on 23 March 1863 with Lieutenant Commander Francis M. Ramsay in command.

From 23 April 1863, until the end of the war, &quot; Choctaw &quot; operated in the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Between 29 April and 1 May 1863, she stood up the Yazoo River for a feigned attack on Haynes&#x27; Bluff, Mississippi, designed to prevent the Confederates from reinforcing Grand Gulf. During this action, she was struck 53 times. Remaining in the Yazoo, she took part in attacks with the Union Army which led to the destruction of Confederate works at Haynes&#x27; Bluff and the burning of the navy yard and ships lying there, at Yazoo City, between 18 and 23 May.

On 6 and 7 June, she helped to repel a Confederate attack at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, Louisiana, after which she rescued a large number of Confederates from the river and sent them in as prisoners. Between 7 March and 15 May 1864, she took part in the operations leading to the capture of Fort DeRussy. &quot;Choctaw &quot; arrived at Algiers, Louisiana, on 20 July 1865, and was decommissioned on 22 July 1865. She was sold at New Orleans, Louisiana on 28 March 1866.

<doc id="235886" wikidata="Q975221" url="?curid=235886" title="Second Balkenende cabinet">
<text>The second Balkenende cabinet was the executive branch of the Government of the Netherlands from 27 May 2003 until 7 July 2006. The cabinet was formed by the Christian-democratic Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the conservative-liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and the social-liberal Democrats 66 (D66) after the election of 2003. The cabinet was a centre-right coalition and had a slim majority in the House of Representatives with Christian Democratic Leader Jan Peter Balkenende serving as Prime Minister. Liberal Leader Gerrit Zalm, a former Minister of Finance, served as Deputy Prime Minister and returned as Minister of Finance, while former Progressive-Liberal Leader Thom de Graaf served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio for the Interior.

The cabinet served during the unstable 2000s. Domestically, immigration was a major point of attention and it had to deal with the murder of controversial filmmaker and critic Theo van Gogh, while internationally, it dealt with the war on terror and the government support for the Iraq War. The cabinet suffered several major internal and external conflicts including multiple cabinet resignations, such as that of Deputy Prime Minister De Graaf following the failed introducing of a new referendum system. The cabinet fell prematurely on 30 June 2006 after the Democrats 66 supported a motion of no confidence against Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk and withdraw its support with the Democrats 66 cabinet members resigning on 3 July 2006 and the cabinet continuing in a demissionary capacity until it was replaced by the caretaker third Balkenende cabinet on 7 July 2006.

==Formation==

On 24 January 2003 Queen Beatrix asked Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner (CDA) to lead the coalition negotiations. The negotiations for the coalition were lengthy. Initially the CDA preferred to continue its Centre-right coalition with the VVD, but they did not have sufficient seats in the House of Representatives to continue in government without the support of a third party. Another coalition with Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) would be likely to be unpopular with voters after the events of the First Balkenende cabinet, and the D66 was unwilling to join such a coalition. A government supported by the Christian right-wing Reformed Political Party (SGP) and the social conservative Christian Union (CU) was opposed by the VVD.

A long negotiation between CDA and the Labour Party (PvdA) followed. The CDA and PvdA had come out of the elections as equal partners. The negotiations were troubled by the invasion of Iraq, the bad economic forecasts and personal animosity between incumbent Prime Minister and Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal Jan Peter Balkenende and Wouter Bos the Leader of the Labour Party. After a couple of months talks were called off by Balkenende. At this point, D66 decided to join the coalition after all. The cabinet was based on a very slim majority in the House of Representatives of 78 seats out of 150. When VVD Member of the House of Representatives Geert Wilders left his party on 2 September 2004 (continuing as an Independent), the narrow majority of the cabinet slimmed down even further to 77 seats in the Member of the House of Representatives.

==Term==
===Policy===
The cabinet program is based around the slogan: &quot;Mee doen, Meer Werk, Minder Regels&quot; (Participation, More Jobs, and Fewer Rules).
The cabinet seeks to address the problems of integration of ethnic minorities (participation), the economic recession (more employment) and the lack of trust in government (Fewer Regulations).

===Migration and Integration policy===
The most controversial issue the cabinet addressed is the perceived lack of integration of ethnic minorities, especially immigrants from Morocco and Turkey. To solve this problem this cabinet has tried to reduce the influx of migrants, and to force migrants to take an integration course. The cabinet appointed Rita Verdonk (VVD) as a Minister without Portfolio within the Ministry of Justice with the responsibilities for Integration, Immigration and Asylum Affairs.

The number of immigrants allowed into the Netherlands was reduced by enforcing the asylum-seekers law of 2000 rigidly. This law was created under the Second Kok cabinet by the then Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen. Controversially, 26,000 asylum-seekers who had lived in the Netherlands for over five years but who had not been granted asylum were deported. Furthermore, partners of Dutch citizens are only allowed to immigrate into the Netherlands if the Dutch partner earns more than 120 percent of the minimum income. This income requirement has been decreased back to 100% of the minimum wage in 2010 as a result of the judgement of the EU Court in the Chakroun case.

Since 2006, family migrants from &#x27;non-Western&#x27; countries who want to immigrate into the Netherlands must pass an integration test. It tests the applicant&#x27;s knowledge of the Dutch language, political system and social conventions. The test must be taken before entering the Netherlands, in a Dutch Embassy or Consulates in the country of origin.
Once in the Netherlands, migrants were obliged to pass a second test before receiving a permanent residence permit or being allowed to naturalise. &#x27;Oudkomers&#x27;, i.e. foreigners who have lived in the Netherlands for a long time, were obliged by the Dutch government to take the exam as well.

===Economic Reform===
The cabinet took power at a time when the Netherlands&#x27; economy was in poor shape, with increasing unemployment and slight economic contraction. To jump start economic growth, the cabinet has proposed tax cuts and reform of the system of social welfare.

The cabinet has implemented a new law for disability pensions. Most people enjoyed disability pensions under the old disability law received pensions even if they were only partially disabled and could still work. The pensions of these people have been cut, and so they are forced to return to the workforce. Furthermore, the cabinet has limited the possibility of early retirement. Without exception all Dutch employees will be forced to work until they have become 65, possibly longer.

The cabinet also has cut government spending by 5700 million euro, making a total of 11 billion euro, when combined with the cuts announced by the previous cabinet. Among other measures, free dental care, physiotherapy and anti-conception medication were cut, 12000 positions were to be eliminated in the armed forces and some of their bases closed, the link between benefit payment rates and salaries was to be broken, and the rental housing subsidy was reduced. At the same time, 4 billion euro in extra spending was made available, mainly in education and justice.

===Government Reform===
Another controversial issue is the reform of the Dutch political system. This was proposed to overcome the &#x27;gap between politics and citizens&#x27;, which became clear in the 2002 elections, which were dominated by the populist Pim Fortuyn who was later Assassinated during the election campaign. The cabinet appointed Thom de Graaf (D66) as Deputy Prime Minister and as a Minister without Portfolio within the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations with the responsibilities for Government Reform. Thom de Graaf (D66). De Graaf, who proposed an ambitious reform proposal, was met with much resistance. Two of the most important proposals were the directly elected mayor and the election system.

The Netherlands is one of the last countries in Europe not to have an elected mayor, instead he is appointed by the Crown. To change this the constitution has to be amended. A proposal to do this by former Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Klaas de Vries (PvdA) in 2001, under the second Kok cabinet, was rejected in second reading by the Senate. This was because it would allow the controversial plans of De Graaf to be implemented. This would involve a mayor, directly elected by the city&#x27;s population, who would have considerable power to take care of security and public order. The proposed election system would have preserved proportional representation but have done so with supplemental regional candidates.

On 23 March 2005, the Senate voted against a proposal to introduce a constitutional amendment that would allow the directly elected mayor. As a result, Thom de Graaf (D66) resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Government Reform. The coalition parties then renegotiate a new coalition agreement. In the Easter weekend reached an agreement, the so-called Easter Accord. On 31 March 2005 Alexander Pechtold (D66) the Mayor of Wageningen and Chairman of the Democrats 66 was appointed as the new Minister for Government Reform. The position of Deputy Prime Minister was taken over by Minister of Economic Affairs Laurens Jan Brinkhorst (D66).

===Opposition to policy===
The cabinet was facing a lot of opposition, from the official opposition in the House of Representatives, from an extra-parliamentary movement, from international circles and from within. The left-wing parties in the House of Representatives where critical of the government. They perceived the policy on migration and integration as too hard and causing polarization between Dutch people and immigrants, and the economic reforms and budget cuts as untimely, because of the recession.

The extra-parliamentary movement &quot;Keer het Tij&quot; (Turn the Tide) has organized mass demonstrations against the government. Important partners within Keer het Tij where the three main left-wing opposition political parties the Labour Party (PvdA), Socialist Party and GreenLeft (GL), the largest trade union, the FNV, environmental organisations like Greenpeace and Milieu Defensie, and organisations of migrants. In 2004 they organized a political demonstration in the Hague. At the time the negotiations between the cabinet, the employers and the unions on early retirement had broken off, with the union leaders promising a &quot;hot autumn&quot;.

Most international criticism comes from Belgium. Two ministers, the liberal minister of Foreign Affairs De Gucht and the Socialist vice-prime minister Van den Bossche of the purple Cabinet Verhofstadt II, have criticized the style of the Dutch cabinet, calling the prime minister Balkenende &quot;Petty Bourgeois&quot;.

Criticism also rose out of the ranks of the largest government partner, the CDA. The former Christian-Democratic Prime Minister Dries van Agt and former leader of the parliamentary party, De Vries, criticized the cabinet for its anti-social policy. Minister Pechtold has opposed cabinet policy on terrorism and drug law in the media, breaking the unity of cabinet.

===Resignations===
In December 2003, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, was appointed Secretary-General of the NATO. He was succeeded by former diplomat Ben Bot.

In June 2004 a personal conflict between State Secretary for Higher Education Nijs and Minister of Education Van der Hoeven caused the departure of Nijs. This in turn caused a reshuffle: State Secretary for Social Affairs Rutte became State Secretary for Higher Education and Henk van Hoof (a state secretary in previous cabinets) became State Secretary for Social Affairs.

State Secretary for Higher Education Mark Rutte left the cabinet to become parliamentary leader of the VVD on 28 June 2006. He was supposed to be succeeded by former alderman of The Hague Bruno Bruins, but the cabinet fell just a day before he was installed.

==2006 cabinet crisis==
On 29 June 2006, a cabinet crisis erupted after cabinet member Rita Verdonk lost the support of the coalition party D66 over the Ayaan Hirsi Ali identity fraud controversy.

Hirsi Ali, VVD member and Member of parliament at the time, had signed a statement in which she expressed regret that she had misinformed Minister Verdonk regarding her name. On 28 June, Hirsi Ali made it known that her statement was coerced. In a parliamentary debate on 28 June extending into the next day, Verdonk and the Prime Minister maintained that the purpose of this statement was a legal one: Hirsi Ali was required to declare her intention to keep the name Hirsi Ali in order to retain her passport. However, in a crucial moment during the debate, member of parliament Van Beek asked the Prime Minister about the purpose of the apology. The Prime Minister answered that &quot;it was a statement that the Minister for Integration and Immigration had to be able to live with&quot;. This was interpreted widely as a political deal-making by Verdonk at the expense of Hirsi Ali and not just a legality.

As a result, a motion of no confidence was initiated by opposition party GroenLinks against Minister Verdonk. Coalition party D66 supported this motion with strong words, stating that either the minister had to go, or D66 would leave the cabinet. However, the motion did not get a majority vote. On 29 June, the Prime Minister issued a statement declaring that the ministers unanimously declared that the rejected motion did have no consequences for the cabinet (as it was not supported, the minister was not forced to go). The chairman of the parliamentary D66 group, Lousewies van der Laan then declared in a new parliamentary session that D66 could no longer support the entire cabinet.

The apparent dissent between the D66 cabinet ministers opinion (that Verdonk did not have to go) and the D66 parliamentary group opinion (that Verdonk had to go) resulted in some tense hours where it appeared that the two D66 cabinet ministers Laurens Jan Brinkhorst and Alexander Pechtold had broken away from their party, supporting the cabinet but not their party member Lousewies van der Laan. However, in a reconvened parliamentary session later that evening, Brinkhorst announced that he and Pechtold had resigned and supported their parliamentary group in this issue. The apparent difference was merely based on legality: Since the CDA and VVD ministers did not want to dismiss Verdonk, the D66 ministers could do nothing but state the obvious legal fact that an unsupported motion has no legal consequence. The political decision to leave the coalition was subsequently made by the parliamentary group.

Shortly after, Prime Minister Balkenende announced that all remaining members of the cabinet would offer their resignations (portfolios) to Queen Beatrix. At the end of that day, it was expected that new elections would be called for October 2006 at the earliest.

In the meantime, VVD and CDA blamed D66 for the cabinet&#x27;s demise: they argued that Verdonk did in fact respect the wishes of parliament when she ordered the re-examination of Hirsi Ali&#x27;s passport position. On his first day as parliamentary leader of the VVD, Mark Rutte was furious with D66, labeling their actions as scandalous. Lousewies van der Laan countered that she wanted only Verdonk and not the entire cabinet to resign, and that it was about the coerced statement, which she interpreted as abuse of power by the minister. She blamed VVD and CDA for keeping Verdonk as minister.

The newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad (FD) on 30 June commented that it was highly unusual for a cabinet to resign after surviving 29 June motion of no confidence. According to the FD, Balkenende made an &quot;expensive miscalculation&quot; and the coalition was not able to cope with &quot;accumulation of governmental screw ups, ego maniacal told-you-so attitude and political profiteering&quot;. As Prime Minister, Balkenende should have steered his cabinet around the pitfalls. On the same day, the Volkskrant commented that D66 never was a strong supporter of this center-right cabinet and least of all a supporter of Verdonk. The newspaper described Balkenende as a poor leader with his ministers failing to acknowledge him. In short, the cabinet &quot;slipped over a banana skin&quot; according to this paper. NRC Handelsblad&#x27;s main editorial praised D66 and put the blame on Balkenende for not being able to limit the damage to a single minister. The paper questioned whether the CDA should maintain him as their political leader.

The timing of the cabinet collapse was poorly chosen for the two remaining coalition parties: the economy was improving after 3 years of harsh reforms and little growth; finally, more people were working and unemployment rates showed a decline. The reforms initiated three years ago (one of them a 20 billion euro spending cut) were starting to deliver results. It was felt that CDA and VVD had not been able to benefit from it to its full potential. The polls had already showed improved voter support for VVD and CDA compared to the record-low results the year before. The 29 June Nova poll allotted 38 seats to the CDA, 31 seats to the VVD, and 3 seats to D66; a majority requires 76 seats.

With the collapse of the cabinet some of its initiatives became jeopardized: economic liberalization for gas utility companies, new rules for competition regulators, and liberalizations in the subsidized housing market. A demissionary cabinet would not have been able to tackle these issues but a minority government still could.

On 30 June 2006, the Prime Minister met with Queen Beatrix offering the resignation of the two D66 ministers and offering their portfolios to the other ministers. He expressed his preference for a minority government, a so-called &quot;rompkabinet&quot;. Maxime Verhagen of the CDA and Mark Rutte (VVD) also gave their support for this solution when they were invited for consultation with Beatrix. Two important considerations were imminent for them: the Dutch military NATO mission to Uruzgan, Afghanistan, and the decision on the 2007 budget to be made in September 2006. The main opposition leaders were in favor of a demissionary cabinet (without authority for new policies), and elections as soon as possible.

In an interview with NRC Handelsblad on 1 July, Alexander Pechtold raised his suspicion that VVD and CDA had already for a long time been prepared to drop D66 from the coalition in favor of the support by Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). According to Pechtold this explained the reluctance of VVD and CDA ministers to offer constructive solutions at the height of the crisis. The LPF expressed their support for a minority cabinet on numerous occasions, adding the irony that after the first Balkende cabinet failed in 2003 because of the destructive attitude of LPF, the same LPF was ready to replace D66.

===2006 Information round===
Also on 1 July, Queen Beatrix appointed Minister of State and former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers as so-called &quot;informateur&quot; to see if a so-called rump cabinet could be formed. This would be a cabinet of CDA and VVD with a minority of seats in parliament, which would have to seek support from one or more opposition parties for every decision. At this stage, general elections were planned to take place in November 2006. According to Lubbers the prospective third Balkenende cabinet should be based on the coalition agreement of 2003 and the more recent Easter Accord.

Lubbers&#x27; information task was expected to take until 7 July with elections set at 22 November 2006. However, Lubbers was able to present his final conclusions to the Queen already on 5 July. Balkenende was then appointed as the so-called &quot;formateur&quot; with the actual task of forming a new cabinet. He appointed new ministers and presented a formal cabinet statement to parliament on 7 July 2006.

<text>Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius, usually referred to as Macrobius (fl. AD 400), was a Roman provincial who lived during the early fifth century, during late antiquity, the period of time corresponding to the Later Roman Empire, and when Latin was as widespread as Greek among the elite. He is primarily known for his writings, which include the widely copied and read &quot;Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Dream of Scipio&quot;) about &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot;, which was one of the most important sources for Neoplatonism in the Latin West during the Middle Ages; the &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, a compendium of ancient Roman religious and antiquarian lore; and &quot;De differentiis et societatibus graeci latinique verbi&quot; (&quot;On the Differences and Similarities of the Greek and Latin Verb&quot;), which is now lost. He is the basis for the protagonist Manlius in Iain Pears&#x27; book &quot;The Dream of Scipio&quot;.

==Name==
Macrobius&#x27;s given name () is unrecorded as is his family name (). His recorded name is a series of three surnames (), properly ordered Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius. This is what appears in the earliest surviving manuscripts of the and how he is addressed in the excerpts from his lost . He is called &quot;Macrobius Theodosius&quot; in both Cassiodorus and Boethius and was apparently known during his lifetime as &quot;Theodosius&quot;: The dedication of is &quot;Theodosius to his Symmachus&quot; () and he addressed as &quot;the very greatest Theodosius&quot; () in a dedicatory epistle to Avianus&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;. This was mistakenly reversed in later manuscripts to &quot;Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius&quot;, which James Willis then used in his edition of the &quot;Commentary&quot;.

==Life==
Little is known for certain about Macrobius, but there are many theories and speculations about him. He states at the beginning of his &quot;Saturnalia&quot; that he was &quot;born under a foreign sky&quot; (&quot;sub alio ortus caelo&quot;), and both of his major works are dedicated to his son, Eustachius. Alan Cameron notes that several of the earliest manuscripts of his works spell his son&#x27;s name &quot;Eustathius&quot;, then after pointing out that a certain Plotinus Eustathius was Urban prefect in 462 observes &quot;Plotinus would be a peculiarly appropriate name for a neoplatonist philosopher and keen admirer of the great Lycopolitan (cf. &quot;Comm&quot;. I, 8, 5) to have given his son.&quot; There is also a Macrobius Plotinus Eudoxius who collaborated with Memmius Symmachus over an edition of Macrobius&#x27; &quot;Commentary&quot;. His major works have led experts to assume that he was a pagan.

Which &quot;foreign sky&quot; Macrobius was born under has been the subject of much speculation. Terrot Glover considers Macrobius either an ethnic Greek, or born in one of the Greek-speaking parts of the Roman Empire, such as Egypt, due to his intimate knowledge of Greek literature. J. E. Sandys went further and argued that Macrobius was born in one of the Greek provinces. However other experts, beginning with Ludwig van Jan, point out that despite his familiarity with Greek literature Macrobius was far more familiar with Latin than Greek—as evidenced by his enthusiasm for Vergil and Cicero—and favor North Africa, which was part of the Latin-speaking portion of the Roman Empire.

Scholars have attempted to identify him with a Macrobius who is mentioned in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; as a praetorian prefect of Spain (399–400), and a proconsul of Africa (410). The &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; also records a &quot;praepositus&quot; (or lord chamberlain) named Macrobius in 422. A number of older authorities go so far as to identify Macrobius the author with the first, and date his &quot;floruit&quot; to 399–410. There are objections to either identification: as Alan Cameron notes, the complete name of the first candidate is attested in an inscription to be &quot;Flavius Macrobius Maximianus&quot;, while the second is excluded because &quot;A &quot;praepositus&quot; must at this period have been a eunuch.&quot;

However, since Macrobius is frequently referred to as &quot;vir clarissimus et inlustris&quot;, a title which was achieved by holding public office, we can reasonably expect his name to appear in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;. Further, Cameron points out that during his lifetime Macrobius was referred to as &quot;Theodosius&quot;, and looking for that name Cameron found a Theodosius who was praetorian prefect of Italy in 430. &quot;It is significant that the only surviving law addressed to this Theodosius sanctions a privilege for Africa Proconsularis on the basis of information received concerning Byzacena,&quot; Cameron notes.

==Works==
===&quot;Commentary on the &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;&quot;===

Macrobius&#x27;s most influential book and one of the most widely cited books of the Middle Ages was a commentary on the book &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot; narrated by Cicero at the end of his &quot;Republic&quot;. The nature of the dream, in which the elder Scipio appears to his (adopted) grandson and describes the life of the good after death and the constitution of the universe from a Stoic and Neo-Platonic point of view, gave occasion for Macrobius to discourse upon the nature of the cosmos, transmitting much classical philosophy to the later Middle Ages. In astronomy, this work is noted for giving the diameter of the Sun as twice the diameter of the Earth. Of a third work &quot;On the Differences and Similarities of the Greek and Latin Verb&quot;, we possess only an abstract by a certain Johannes, doubtfully identified with Johannes Scotus Eriugena (9th century).

See editions by Ludwig von Jan (1848–1852, with a bibliography of previous editions, and commentary), Franz Eyssenhardt (1893, Teubner text), James Willis (1994, new Teubner), and R. A. Kaster (OCT and Loeb, 2011); on the sources of the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; see H. Linke (1880) and Georg Wissowa (1880). The grammatical treatise will be found in Jan&#x27;s edition and Heinrich Keil&#x27;s &quot;Grammatici latini&quot;; see also Georg Friedrich Schömann, &quot;Commentatio macrobiana&quot; (1871).

===&quot;Saturnalia&quot;===

Macrobius&#x27;s &quot;Saturnalia&quot; (, &quot;Seven Books of the Saturnalia&quot;) consists of an account of the discussions held at the house of Vettius Agorius Praetextatus during the holiday of the Saturnalia. It contains a great variety of curious historical, mythological, critical, antiquarian and grammatical discussions. &quot;The work takes the form of a series of dialogues among learned men at a fictional banquet.&quot;

Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot; described the Earth as a globe of insignificant size in comparison to the remainder of the cosmos. Many early medieval manuscripts of Macrobius include maps of the Earth, including the antipodes, zonal maps showing the Ptolemaic climates derived from the concept of a spherical Earth and a diagram showing the Earth (labeled as &quot;globus terrae&quot;, the sphere of the Earth) at the center of the hierarchically ordered planetary spheres.

<doc id="235888" wikidata="Q211987" url="?curid=235888" title="Jon Stewart">
<text>Jon Stewart (born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz; November 28, 1962) is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, political commentator, actor, and television host. The long-running host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on Comedy Central from 1999 to 2015, Stewart returned to the satirical news program in 2024. He hosted &quot;The Problem with Jon Stewart&quot; on Apple TV+ from 2021 to 2023. Stewart has received numerous accolades, including 23 Primetime Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and five Peabody Awards. He was honored with the Bronze Medallion in 2019, and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2022.

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian but branched into television as host of &quot;Short Attention Span Theater&quot; for Comedy Central. He went on to host &quot;You Wrote It, You Watch It&quot; (1992–1993) and then &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; (1993–1995), both on MTV, until &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; was retooled, dropped by the network and moved to syndication. He has also appeared in several films, including &quot;Big Daddy&quot; (1999) and &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; (2002). Stewart became host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in 1999, where he also was a writer and co-executive producer. After he joined, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, and during his tenure won numerous Emmy Awards and was nominated for news and journalism awards.

Stewart hosted the 78th and 80th Academy Awards. He is the co-author of the best-selling satirical books &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Earth (The Book): A Visitor&#x27;s Guide to the Human Race&quot; in 2010. He executive produced &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; (2005–2014), &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot; (2015–2016), and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; (2015–present). In February 2024, he returned to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for Monday episodes, as well as in the role of an executive producer.

After leaving &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart maintained a low profile in entertainment industry circles, but used his celebrity and voice in a sustained advocacy for 9/11 first responders and war veterans&#x27; health benefits. In 2019, he received the New York City Bronze Medallion for his &quot;tireless advocacy, inspiration, and leadership (helping to) pass the permanent authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act&quot;. He continued using his platform as an advocate for veterans by being instrumental in helping pass the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, which expands healthcare access and funding to veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service including burn pits.

==Early life and education==
Stewart was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz at Doctors Hospital in the Upper East Side of New York City. His father, Donald Leibowitz (1931–2013), was an energy coordinator for the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, and his mother, Marian Leibowitz (née Laskin), was a teacher and later an educational consultant. Stewart&#x27;s family is Ashkenazi Jewish (Polish-Jewish, Ukrainian-Jewish, Belarusian-Jewish, and possibly Lithuanian-Jewish); his parents had immigrated to the United States from Europe. One of his grandfathers was born in Manzhouli, present-day China. He is the second of four sons, with older brother Lawrence and younger brothers Dan and Matthew.

Stewart&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eleven years old, and he became largely estranged from his father. Due to their strained relationship, Stewart dropped his surname and began using his middle name alone, stating: &quot;There was a thought of using my mother&#x27;s maiden name, but I thought that would be just too big [of] a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; to my dad... Did I have some problems with my father? Yes. Yet people always view [changing my surname] through the prism of ethnic identity.&quot; He had his surname legally changed to &quot;Stewart&quot; in 2001. In 2015, he described his relationship with his father as &quot;still complicated&quot; after his father&#x27;s death two years earlier. Stewart and his older brother, Lawrence, who was previously the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext (the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange), grew up in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Stewart has stated that he experienced much antisemitism as a child, having been bullied frequently due to his Jewish identity. He describes himself in high school as &quot;very into Eugene Debs and a bit of a leftist.&quot; Stewart grew up in the era of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, which inspired in him &quot;a healthy skepticism towards official reports.&quot; His first job was working with his brother at a Woolworth&#x27;s store, and he has jokingly said that being fired by Lawrence himself was one of the &quot;scarring events&quot; of his youth. He has also credited renowned television producer Norman Lear as someone who &quot;raised me.&quot;

After graduating from Lawrence High School in 1980, Stewart attended the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he initially majored in chemistry before switching to psychology. While at William &amp; Mary, Stewart became a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, but eventually began disassociating himself from other members, leaving the fraternity altogether after six months. &quot;My college career was waking up late, memorizing someone else&#x27;s notes, doing bong hits, and going to soccer practice&quot;, he later said. He was a three-year starter in 1981, 1982 and 1983 with the Tribe men&#x27;s soccer team. He had 10 goals and 12 assists on a squad that went 40–15–9 (.695) in his three seasons with the program. He is listed as Jon Leibowitz in official William &amp; Mary Athletics records. The former head coach of the Tribe men&#x27;s soccer team from 1971 to 2003, Al Albert, describes Jon as &quot;athletic and feisty and quick&quot; and added that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t the most technical or clinical player, but he could make things happen.&quot; He graduated from William &amp; Mary in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts. Twenty years later, the college awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree.

After college, Stewart held numerous jobs: contingency planner for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, contract administrator for the City University of New York, puppeteer for children with disabilities, soccer coach at Gloucester High School in Virginia, caterer, busboy, shelf stocker at Woolworth&#x27;s, bartender at the Franklin Corner Tavern (a blue-collar bar in Lawrence), and bartender at the City Gardens nightclub in Trenton, New Jersey. He has said that working at City Gardens was a pivotal moment for him: &quot;Finding this place City Gardens was like, &#x27;Oh, maybe I&#x27;m not a giant weirdo. Maybe there are other people who have a similar sense of yearning for something other than what they have now.&#x27; I think it inspired a lot of people, man. It was a very creative environment. It was a place of great possibility.&quot;

==Career==
=== 1986–1992: Standup and early career ===
With a reputation for being a funny man in school, Stewart returned to New York City in 1986 to try his hand at the comedy club circuit, but could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year. He made his stand-up debut at The Bitter End, where one of his comedic idols, Woody Allen, also began. He began using the stage name Jon Stewart by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name, Stuart, to Stewart. He often jokes that it was because people had trouble pronouncing Leibowitz, or it &quot;sounded too Hollywood&quot; (a reference to Lenny Bruce&#x27;s joke on the same theme). He has implied that the name change was due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer had any contact.

Stewart became a regular at the Comedy Cellar, where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he performed at 2 a.m. while developing his comedy style. In 1989, he landed his first television job as a writer for &quot;Caroline&#x27;s Comedy Hour&quot;. In 1990, he began co-hosting Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Short Attention Span Theater&quot; with Patty Rosborough. In 1992, he hosted the short-lived &quot;You Wrote It, You Watch It&quot; on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by the comedy troupe, The State.

Stewart said that his career did not take off until his March 6, 1992, appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He was considered to take over the show when Letterman left it, but it was given to relatively unknown Conan O&#x27;Brien. He co-hosted &quot;MTV Spring Break &#x27;93 Blind Date&quot; from Daytona Beach with Melissa Rivers.

===1993–1995: &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;===
Later in 1993, Stewart developed &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, a talk show on MTV, which was later dropped by the network and was syndicated for its last two years. &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; was the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show, behind &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. In 1994, Paramount canceled &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parent Viacom&#x27;s acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-long syndicated late-night version of &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;. Many local affiliates had moved Hall&#x27;s show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart&#x27;s show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.

Among the fans of the show was David Letterman, who was the final guest of &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company, Worldwide Pants. Stewart then became a frequent guest host for Tom Snyder on &quot;The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder&quot;, which was produced by Letterman and aired after the &quot;Late Show&quot; on CBS. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently, but instead, Stewart was offered the time slot after Snyder&#x27;s, which he turned down.

=== 1994–1997: Film and other TV work ===
Stewart&#x27;s first film role was a bit part in the box-office bomb, &quot;Mixed Nuts.&quot; He landed a minor part in &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, but his scene was deleted. In 1995, Stewart signed a three-year deal with Miramax. Stewart played romantic leads in the films, &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; and &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;. He had a supporting role in the romantic comedy, &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; and in the horror film, &quot;The Faculty&quot;. Other films were planned for Stewart to write and star in, but they never were produced. Stewart maintained a relationship with Miramax founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein and appeared in films they produced including, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, &quot;Doogal&quot;, and the documentary, &quot;Wordplay&quot;.

In 1996, Stewart hosted a short-lived talk show entitled, &quot;Where&#x27;s Elvis This Week?&quot;, which was a half-hour, weekly comedy television program. It aired on Sunday nights in the United Kingdom on BBC Two. It was filmed at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and featured a set of panelists, two from the UK and two from the United States, who discussed news items and cultural issues. The show premiered in the UK on October 6, 1996; five episodes aired in total. Notable panelists included Dave Chappelle, Eddie Izzard, Phill Jupitus, Nora Ephron, Craig Kilborn, Christopher Hitchens, Armando Iannucci, Norm Macdonald, and Helen Gurley Brown. In 1997, Stewart was chosen as the host and interviewer for George Carlin&#x27;s tenth HBO special, &quot;George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy&quot;. Stewart had a recurring role in &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, playing himself as an occasional substitute and possible successor to late-night talk show host Larry Sanders (played by Garry Shandling). Stewart also headlined the 1997 White House Correspondents&#x27; dinner.

===1998–2015: &quot;The Daily Show&quot; ===
In 1998, Stewart hosted the television special, &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, celebrating 30 years of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He has guest-starred on other sitcoms including &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, and &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. The same year Stewart released his first book, &quot;Naked Pictures of Famous People&quot; (1998), a collection of humorous short stories and essays. The book reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List. In the mid-1990s, Stewart launched his own production company, Busboy Productions, naming the company in reference to his previous job as a busboy. Stewart signed a deal with Miramax to develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas have been produced. After Stewart&#x27;s success as host and producer of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, he revived Busboy Productions with &quot;Daily Show&quot; producers Ben Karlin and Rich Korson. In 2002, Busboy planned to produce a sitcom for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.

Later that year, when Craig Kilborn left the show to replace Tom Snyder on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Stewart began hosting &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on Comedy Central. &quot;The Daily Show&quot; blends humor with the day&#x27;s top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians, newsmakers, and the news media. In an interview on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was &quot;schnicks and giggles&quot; and that &quot;[t]he same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show&quot;, meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh. In his first Daily Show on-air appearance on January 11, 1999, Stewart told his guest that evening, Michael J. Fox, that he felt as if &quot;this is my bar mitzvah&quot;. His style was described by one critic as, &quot;Stewart does not offer us cynicism for its own sake, but as a playful way to offer the kinds of insights that are not permitted in more serious news formats that slavishly cling to official account of events.&quot;

He appeared in &quot;Half Baked&quot; as an &quot;enhancement smoker&quot; and in &quot;Big Daddy&quot; as Adam Sandler&#x27;s roommate; he has joked on the &quot;Daily Show&quot; and in the documentary &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; that to get the role, he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile flop, &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;, in which he played a treacherous television executive; and the animated film &quot;Doogal&quot;, where he voiced the villain Zeebad. In 2007, Stewart made a cameo appearance as himself in &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;, which starred former &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent Steve Carell. In the movie, Stewart was seen on a television screen in a fictional &quot;Daily Show&quot; episode poking fun at Carell&#x27;s character for building an ark.

Until Trevor Noah permanently took over the show in 2015, Stewart hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such as Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry, Jason Jones, and Steve Carell subbed for him, and during John Oliver&#x27;s stint as host during the summer of 2013. Stewart won twenty Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as either a writer or producer, and two for producing &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; (2013–14), earning a total of twenty-two Primetime Emmy Awards, the most wins for a male individual. In 2005, Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; received the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the audiobook edition of &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot;. In 2000 and 2004, the show won two Peabody Awards for its coverage of the US presidential elections in those years, called &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; and &quot;Indecision 2004&quot;, respectively.
The show of September 20, 2001, the first show after the attacks of September 11, 2001, began with no introduction. Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in toward the World Trade Center and New York City. The first nine minutes of the show included a tearful Stewart discussing his personal view on the event. His remarks ended as follows:

In mid-2002, amid rumors that David Letterman was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman&#x27;s replacement on CBS. Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS.

In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air right after &quot;Nightline&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s contract with &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was near expiring, and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another Comedy Central figure, Jimmy Kimmel, the post-&quot;Nightline&quot; slot. In 2004, Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; writing staff released, &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot;, a mock high-school history textbook offering insights into the unique American system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and satirizing such popular American political precepts as &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, &quot;government by the people&quot;, and &quot;every vote counts&quot;. The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top-fifteen best seller. He also delivered the commencement address for the class of 2004 at his alma mater, the College of William &amp; Mary. In 2005, Stewart provided the voice of President James A. Garfield for the audiobook version of Sarah Vowell&#x27;s &quot;Assassination Vacation&quot;.

In 2005, Comedy Central reached an agreement with Busboy in which Comedy Central would provide financial backing for the production company. Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks. The deal spawned the &quot;Daily Show&quot; spin-off &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and its replacement, &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;. Other projects include the sitcom pilot &quot;Three Strikes&quot;, the documentary &quot;Sportsfan&quot;, the series &quot;Important Things with Demetri Martin&quot;, and the film &quot;The Donor&quot;. In 2007, Stewart voiced Mort Sinclaire, former TV comedy writer and communist, on Stephen Colbert&#x27;s audiobook version of &quot;I Am America (And So Can You!)&quot;.

On April 4, 2006, Stewart confronted US Senator John McCain (R-AZ) on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; about his decision to appear at Liberty University, an institution founded by Jerry Falwell whom McCain previously had denounced as one of the &quot;agents of intolerance&quot;. In the interchange, Stewart asked McCain, &quot;You&#x27;re not freaking out on us? Are you freaking out on us, because if you&#x27;re freaking out ... and you&#x27;re going into the crazy base world—are you going into crazy base world?&quot; McCain replied, &quot;Just– just– just a little&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m afraid so.&quot; The clip was played on CNN, was noted and discussed in more detail in the blogosphere and was followed up on in the mainstream media.

In 2007, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was involved in former correspondent Stephen Colbert&#x27;s announcement that he would run for president in 2008. In 2008, Stewart appeared on the news program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;. A 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; story questioned whether he was, in a phrase originally used to describe longtime network news anchor Walter Cronkite, &quot;the most trusted man in America&quot;.

On April 28, 2009, during a discussion on torture with Clifford May, Stewart stated that former President Harry S. Truman was a war criminal for his use of the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II. He defended his view moments later: &quot;Here&#x27;s what I think of the atom bombs. I think if you dropped an atom bomb fifteen miles offshore and you said, &#x27;The next one&#x27;s coming and hitting you&#x27;, then I would think it&#x27;s okay. To drop it on a city, and kill a hundred thousand people? Yeah. I think that&#x27;s criminal.&quot; On April 30, Stewart apologized on his program, and stated he did not believe Truman was a war criminal: &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have said that, and I did. So I say right now, no, I don&#x27;t believe that to be the case. The atomic bomb, a very complicated decision in the context of a horrific war, and I walk that back because it was in my estimation a stupid thing to say.&quot;
On September 16, 2010, Stewart and Stephen Colbert announced a rally for October 30, known as the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. It took place on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and attracted an estimated 215,000 participants. In December 2010, Stewart was credited by the White House, other media, and political news outlets for bringing awareness of the Republican filibuster on the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to the public, leading to the ultimate passing of the bill that provides health benefits to first responders whose health has been adversely affected by their work at Ground Zero.

In March 2010, Stewart announced that he had optioned rights to the story of journalist Maziar Bahari, who was imprisoned in Iran for 118 days. On June 6, 2011, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart again hosted Bahari, and in March 2013, he announced that he was leaving the show for 12 weeks to direct the film version of Bahari&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;Then They Came For Me&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s screenplay adaptation is entitled, &quot;Rosewater&quot;. It premiered at the September 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, receiving &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, and was released to general audiences on November 14, 2014.

 In 2010, Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; writing staff released a sequel to their first book entitled, &quot;Earth (The Book): A Visitor&#x27;s Guide to the Human Race&quot;. The book is meant to serve as a Baedeker travel guide for an alien civilization that discovers Earth after humanity has died out, most likely by its own hands. In April 2010, Comedy Central renewed Stewart&#x27;s contract to host &quot;The Daily Show&quot; into 2013. According to a &quot;Forbes&quot; list of celebrities in 2008, he was earning $14 million a year. &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that Stewart is &quot;the modern-day equivalent of Edward R. Murrow&quot; and the UK national newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; called him the &quot;satirist-in-chief&quot;. In an interview, Senator John McCain described Stewart as &quot;a modern-day Will Rogers and Mark Twain&quot;.

On the show of January 10, 2011, Stewart began with a monologue about the shootings in Tucson, Arizona. He said he wished the &quot;ramblings of crazy people didn&#x27;t in any way resemble how we actually talk to each other on television&quot;. Before a commercial break, Stewart told viewers that the show would continue as usual the next night. After the commercial break, the show featured a rerun of a field piece done by Jason Jones two years earlier.

In March 2012, Stewart interviewed Bruce Springsteen for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Writer Wyatt Cenac said that Stewart cursed him out after Cenac acknowledged he was uncomfortable about a June 2011 &quot;Daily Show&quot; bit about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain (reported in July 2015).

In March 2013, it was announced that Stewart would be taking a 12-week hiatus from &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to direct the film &quot;Rosewater&quot;, which is based on the book &quot;Then They Came for Me&quot; by Maziar Bahari. Beginning June 10, 2013, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; correspondent John Oliver assumed primary hosting duties during Stewart&#x27;s break. The &quot;TV Guide&quot; annual survey for 2013 star salaries showed that Stewart was the highest-paid late night host, making an estimated $25–30 million per year. On July 14, 2014, Stewart interviewed Hillary Clinton about the Middle East. Clinton&#x27;s condemnations of Hamas led Stewart to ask her: &quot;But don&#x27;t you think they would look at that though as, they&#x27;ve given a lot of different things a chance and these are the only guys to them that are giving any resistance to what their condition is?&quot; For Gazans living in that situation, he said Hamas could be viewed as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.

====&quot;The Daily Show&quot; departure ====
During a taping of the show on February 10, 2015, Stewart announced he was leaving &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless confirmed Stewart&#x27;s retirement with a statement. Later, it was announced that South African comedian Trevor Noah would succeed Stewart as the host of the show. On April 20, 2015, Stewart indicated that his final show would be on August 6, 2015.
On July 28, 2015, Darren Samuelsohn of &quot;Politico&quot; reported that twice, Stewart had been at the White House for previously unreported meetings with President Obama: once in October 2011 and once in February 2014. Michael D. Shear of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also picked up on the story. Stewart responded on his show by pointing out that the meetings were listed in the president&#x27;s publicly available visitor log and that he has been asked to meet privately by many prominent individuals, including Roger Ailes of Fox News. He said Obama encouraged him not to make young Americans cynical about their government and Stewart said that his reply was that he was &quot;skeptically idealistic&quot;.

On June 19, 2015, in the wake of the Charleston Church Shooting, Stewart decided not to write jokes for the opening monologue. Elaborating on his decision, Stewart stated, &quot;I honestly have nothing other than just sadness&quot;. Stewart spoke about the racial disparity and injustices in America, saying &quot;The Confederate flag flies over South Carolina ... and the roads are named for Confederate generals&quot; describing it as &quot;racial wallpaper&quot;. Instead he designated a large portion of the show to his guest that night Malala Yousafzai, calling her &quot;an incredible inspiration,&quot; and that &quot;to be quite honest with you, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anyone else in the world I would rather talk to tonight than Malala: So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do. And sorry about no jokes.&quot;

On August 5, 2015, Stewart&#x27;s friend of 30 years, comedian Louis C.K., was selected to be the last guest before the final &quot;Daily Show&quot; episode with Stewart helming the show. C.K. joked that he was there &quot;representing comedy to say good job&quot;.

The hour-long-plus final &quot;Daily Show&quot; on August 6 featured reunions with former correspondents Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Hasan Minhaj, Ed Helms, Kristen Schaal, Larry Wilmore, Jessica Williams, Aasif Mandvi, Lewis Black, John Hodgman, Rob Corddry, Olivia Munn, Josh Gad, Michael Che, and Mo Rocca and cameo video clips from people Stewart had targeted over the years, including Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, John Kerry, Chuck Schumer, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Wolf Blitzer, Joe Scarborough, and Mika Brzezinski. During the final episode, there was a pre-taped behind-the-scenes look at the show spoofing the long-take Copacabana scene from &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, featuring a brief appearance by Martin Scorsese. It concluded with a performance by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.

=== 2015–2023: Standup and Apple TV+ series ===
He also guest starred in the animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as well as the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Between the Lions&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Jack&#x27;s Big Music Show&quot;, and &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;. After Stewart&#x27;s departure from &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, he was listed as an executive producer on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. In addition, Stewart has presented occasional comedic monologues filled with political and media commentary.

In November 2015, it was announced that Stewart signed a four-year deal with HBO that would include exclusive digital content for HBO NOW, HBO Go, and other platforms. HBO programming president Casey Bloys has said that &quot;the idea is it will be an animated parody of a cable news network with an &quot;Onion&quot;-like portal.&quot; The team began working with the cloud graphics company, OTOY, to build a system for creating content. Working on the project were Mike Brown, Steve Waltien, Chelsea Devantez, Lucy Steiner, Kate James, and Robby Slowik. The team tested material in Red Bank, New Jersey, at The Count Basie Theatre Performing Arts Academy. The show&#x27;s premiere was moved several times, from fall 2016, to the first quarter of 2017, and then cancelled on May 23, 2017. The cancelation statement read: &quot;HBO and Jon Stewart have decided not to proceed with a short-form digital animated project... We all thought the project had great potential but there were technical issues in terms of production and distribution that proved too difficult given the quick turnaround and topical nature of the material. We&#x27;re excited to report that we have some future projects together which you will be hearing about in the near future&quot;.
In July 2017, HBO announced Stewart would produce a stand-up comedy special for the network, his first stand-up special since 1996. Ultimately, no special aired. In 2018, Stewart and Dave Chappelle joined forces for a duo comedy tour in the United States, and across the United Kingdom. Stewart performed standup in the 13th Annual &quot;Standup for Heroes&quot; event alongside John Oliver and Hasan Minhaj.

On directing, Stewart noted on &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; influenced his directing process more than his acting gigs did. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s about the collaboration. It&#x27;s about understanding. Doing a show taught me this process of clarity of vision, but the flexibility of process. So know your intention, know where you&#x27;re wanting to go with the scene with the way that you want it to go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where you want it to be.&quot; He also expressed interest in directing more films. Stewart directed the political satire &quot;Irresistible&quot;, released in June 2020, which follows a demoralized Democratic strategist (played by &quot;Daily Show&quot; alumnus Steve Carell), who helps a retired veteran (Chris Cooper) run for mayor in a small, blue collar town in Wisconsin.

After his contract with HBO ended, Stewart signed a multi-year show deal with Apple. On September 30, 2021, Stewart&#x27;s new series, &quot;The Problem with Jon Stewart&quot;, premiered on Apple TV+. The series featured hour-long, single-subject episodes. In addition to hosting the show, Stewart served as executive producer through his company, Busboy Productions. The show was canceled after two seasons, allegedly due to Apple executives disagreeing with coverage of China and artificial intelligence. Apple&#x27;s cancelation attracted criticism from the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.

In July 2022, a &quot;Politico&quot; writer named Juleanna Glover wrote an op-ed titled &quot;If Tucker Runs in 2024, Here&#x27;s Who the Democrats Need.&quot; In the op-ed, Glover called for Stewart to run for president in 2024. Stewart promptly responded to the viral article with a Tweet, stating &quot;ummm... no thank you.&quot; In 2023 Stewart performed at the comedy festival, &quot;Netflix is a Joke&quot; in Los Angeles.

=== Since 2024: Return to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; ===
In January 2024, it was confirmed that Stewart would return to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as the weekly Monday guest host starting February 12, 2024. It was also confirmed that Stewart and his manager James Dixon would serve as executive producers for all &quot;Daily Show&quot; episodes through 2025. In May 2024, it was announced that Stewart would additionally begin hosting &quot;The Weekly Show&quot;, an original podcast from Comedy Central. Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; team won the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Talk Series, his 23rd Emmy. In late October, Stewart extended his contract by one year to remain host until the end of 2025.

== Hosting and public speaking ==

Stewart has hosted the Grammy Awards twice, in 2001 and in 2002, and the 78th Academy Awards, which were held March 5, 2006, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. Critical response to Stewart&#x27;s performance was mixed. Roger Ebert compared him favorably to legendary Oscar host Johnny Carson. Other reviewers were less positive; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that Stewart hosted with &quot;smug humorlessness&quot;. James Poniewozik of &quot;TIME&quot; said that Stewart was a bad host, but a great &quot;anti-host&quot; in that he poked fun at parts of the broadcast that deserved it, which lent him a degree of authenticity with the non-Hollywood audience. Stewart and correspondent John Oliver later poked fun at his lackluster reception on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; coverage of the 79th Academy Awards by saying that the &quot;demon of last year&#x27;s Oscars had finally been exorcised&quot;.

Stewart returned to host the 80th Academy Awards on February 24, 2008. The reception to his performance was better this time. Matthew Gilbert of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; felt the ceremony was average, but praised Stewart, writing that, &quot;It was good to see Jon Stewart being Jon Stewart. He is shaping up to be a dependable Oscar host for the post-Billy Crystal years. He&#x27;s not musical, but he&#x27;s versatile enough to swing smoothly between jokes about politics, Hollywood, new media, and, most importantly, hair.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; columnist Brian Lowry lauded Stewart&#x27;s performance noting that he &quot;earned his keep by maintaining a playful, irreverent tone throughout the night, whether it was jesting about Cate Blanchett&#x27;s versatility or watching &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; on an iPhone screen.

In December 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts honoring Bruce Springsteen, one of that year&#x27;s Kennedy Center Honors recipients, and of whom Stewart is a fan. Stewart gave another speech paying tribute to Springsteen in February 2013 as part of the singer&#x27;s MusiCares Person of the Year award ceremony.

Stewart began a comedic feud with WWE wrestler Seth Rollins in March 2015, and appeared on &quot;WWE Raw&quot; during a &quot;Daily Show&quot;-styled segment hosted by Rollins. On August 23, 2015, Stewart returned to host the WWE&#x27;s SummerSlam at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Later, he got involved in the main event between Rollins and John Cena, helping Rollins retain his WWE World Heavyweight Championship, as well as winning Cena&#x27;s United States Championship when he interfered and hit Cena with a steel chair. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he explained his actions, saying he did it for Ric Flair (who was also present), which was to retain his world championship record. Cena then gave Stewart his finishing move, the Attitude Adjustment, to end the segment. Stewart returned at SummerSlam on August 21, 2016, as a special guest.

In 2016, Stewart joined President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Jill Biden, and David Letterman in honoring military families on May 5 at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. The special celebration which marked both the USO&#x27;s 75th anniversary and the fifth anniversary of Joining Forces.

Stewart got into a Twitter argument with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in multiple tweets stated that Stewart changing his name indicated that he was a fraud. Stewart and some analysts considered this to be anti-Semitic. Trump then tweeted that Stewart should be &quot;proud of his heritage&quot;, and Stewart tweeted back, facetiously, that Trump&#x27;s real name was &quot;Fuckface Von Clownstick&quot; and that Trump should be proud of the &quot;Clownstick heritage&quot;.

In June 2017, Stewart spoke at the funeral service for Ray Pfeifer, an FDNY firefighter from Hicksville, New York, who died after an eight-year battle with cancer as a result of service as a first responder at the September 11 attacks.

==Influences==
Stewart has said his influences include George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, David Letterman, Steve Martin, and Richard Pryor.

Among comedians who say they were influenced by Stewart are Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Hasan Minhaj, Samantha Bee, Larry Wilmore, Bassem Youssef, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah, Desi Lydic, and Jordan Klepper.

== Politics and activism ==
=== Views ===
In 2000, when he was labeled a Democrat, Stewart generally agreed, but described his political affiliation as &quot;more socialist or independent&quot; than Democratic. Stewart has also voted for Republicans, the last time being in the 1988 presidential election when he voted for George H. W. Bush over Michael Dukakis. He described Bush as having &quot;an integrity about him that I respected greatly.&quot; Stewart has said that during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was not a supporter of nominee Joe Biden, describing himself as more of a, &quot;Sanders, Warren guy.&quot; He reluctantly supported his candidacy in 2020, but has criticized him since then over his age, and his handling of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. He has been a vocal proponent of the United States implementing a single-payer healthcare system.

=== Criticism of television journalists ===
Stewart is known as an outspoken, humorous critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular, those of the US media broadcast networks such as CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his &quot;news satire&quot; desk; Stewart asserts that neither his show nor Comedy Central purport to be anything other than satire and comedy.

==== &quot;Crossfire&quot; appearance ====

In a televised exchange with then-CNN correspondent Tucker Carlson on &quot;Crossfire&quot; on October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show&#x27;s hosts to &quot;stop hurting America&quot;, and he referred to both Carlson and co-host Paul Begala as &quot;partisan hacks&quot;. When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.

Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting that &quot;Crossfire&quot; had failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts&#x27; assertion that &quot;Crossfire&quot; is a debate show is like &quot;saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition&quot;. Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewed John Kerry, Stewart asked a series of &quot;softball&quot; questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election). Stewart responded that he didn&#x27;t realize &quot;the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity&quot;. When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, &quot;You&#x27;re on CNN! The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls! What is wrong with you?&quot; In response to prods from Carlson, &quot;Come on. Be funny.&quot; Stewart said, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going to be your monkey.&quot; Later in the show when Carlson jibed, &quot;I do think you&#x27;re more fun on your show&quot;, Stewart retorted, &quot;You&#x27;re as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.&quot; In response to Stewart&#x27;s criticisms, Carlson said, &quot;You need to get a job at a journalism school&quot;, to which Stewart responded, &quot;You need to go to one!&quot;

Stewart discussed the incident on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; the following Monday:

In January 2005, CNN announced that it was canceling &quot;Crossfire&quot;. When asked about the cancellation, CNN&#x27;s incoming president, Jonathan Klein, referred to Stewart&#x27;s appearance on the show: &quot;I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day.&quot;

On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; criticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least &quot;an hour&quot; and &quot;continued to lecture our staff&quot;, something Carlson described as, &quot;one of the weirdest things I have ever seen&quot;.

==== Criticism of CNBC ====

Stewart again became a viral internet phenomenon following a March 4, 2009, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; sequence. CNBC canceled Rick Santelli&#x27;s scheduled appearance on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; that day, so the show ran a short segment showing CNBC giving poor investment advice.

Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between Stewart and Jim Cramer, who had been featured heavily in the original segment, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day, the show&#x27;s website saw its highest day of traffic in 2009. Although Cramer acknowledged on the show that some of Stewart&#x27;s criticisms of CNBC were valid and that the network could &quot;do better&quot;, he later said on &quot;The Today Show&quot; that Stewart&#x27;s criticism of the media was &quot;naïve and misleading&quot;.

==== Criticism of Fox News ====
Throughout his tenure on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart frequently accused Fox News of distorting the news to fit a conservative agenda, at one point ridiculing the network as &quot;the meanest sorority in the world&quot;. In November 2009, Stewart &quot;called out&quot; Fox News for using some footage from a previous Tea Party rally during a report on a more recent rally, making the latter event appear more highly attended than it was. The show&#x27;s anchor, Sean Hannity, apologized for the footage use the following night. A month later, Stewart criticized &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; cohost Gretchen Carlson – a former Miss America and a Stanford graduate – for claiming that she googled words such as &quot;ignoramus&quot; and &quot;czar&quot;. Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for &quot;an audience who sees intellect as an elitist flaw&quot;.

Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; within five months, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; had 24 segments criticizing the Fox News coverage. Bill O&#x27;Reilly, host of the talk show &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; on Fox News, countered that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was a &quot;key component of left-wing television&quot; and that Stewart loved Fox News because the network was &quot;not boring&quot;.

During an interview with Chris Wallace on June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace &quot;insane&quot; for saying that Stewart&#x27;s earlier comparison of the marketing techniques of a Sarah Palin campaign video and an anti-herpes medicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also said Fox viewers are the &quot;most consistently misinformed&quot; viewers of political media. This comment was ranked by the fact-checking site, PolitiFact, as false, with conditions. Stewart later accepted his error.

In 2014, Stewart engaged in an extended &quot;call-out&quot; of Fox News, based on their coverage of food stamps and US government assistance, opining that said coverage was biased. This culminated in segments across multiple episodes, specifically singling out Sean Hannity and his show&#x27;s coverage of the Bundy standoff. Hannity would &quot;return fire&quot; by calling out Stewart for associating himself with Cat Stevens during his Rally in 2010. Stewart responded to this by criticizing Hannity for frequently calling Ted Nugent a &quot;friend and frequent guest&quot; on his program and supporting Nugent&#x27;s violent rhetoric toward Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2007. In late August 2014, Stewart criticized the manner in which Fox News portrayed the events surrounding the shooting of teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests from citizens.

=== 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike ===

Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the Comedy Central writers. &quot;The Daily Show&quot; writers were the first of Comedy Central&#x27;s writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.

Stewart supported the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. On &quot;The Daily Show&quot; episode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how Comedy Central had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, &quot;go support our advertisers&quot;. The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late-night talk shows. Upon Stewart&#x27;s return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, stating that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as &quot;A Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; until the strike ended on February 13, 2008.

Stewart&#x27;s choice to return to the air did bring criticism that he was undermining the writers of his show. Seth MacFarlane wrote an inside joke into an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; about this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the &quot;moral arbiter&quot; of Hollywood. Former &quot;Daily Show&quot; writer David Feldman also accused Stewart of being anti-union at the time and of punishing his writers for their decision to unionize by not using their material.

The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–2008 also was responsible for a notable mock feud between Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Conan O&#x27;Brien in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a crossover/rivalry to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert claimed that because of &quot;the Colbert bump&quot;, he was responsible for Mike Huckabee&#x27;s success in the 2008 presidential race. O&#x27;Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee&#x27;s success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for Chuck Norris&#x27;s success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O&#x27;Brien since Stewart had featured him on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, and in turn, the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle among the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other&#x27;s shows. The feud ended on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; with a mock brawl involving the three hosts.

=== 9/11 First Responders Bill ===

Over the years, Stewart sometimes used &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to argue for causes such as the treatment of veterans and 9/11 first responders. He is credited with breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill to provide health care and benefits for 9/11 emergency workers; the bill passed three days after he featured a group of 9/11 responders on the show. In March 2009, he criticized a White House proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration rolls if they had private health insurance; the White House dropped the plan the next day. In 2010, Stewart held an interview with a panel of four of the 9/11 first responders—Kenny Specht with the FDNY, Chris Bowman NYPD, Ken George DOT, and Kevin Devlin, Operating Engineer of Heavy Equipment—who discussed their health problems with Stewart. In 2015, four months after leaving &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, he returned to reunite the four with Specht as the only panelist healthy enough to attend. Devlin had died and the two other panelists, Bowman and George, were too ill to make it to the show.
In February and June 2019, Stewart again went to Congress to oppose the $7.375 billion limit in pay-outs to 9/11 first responders through December 2020 and to lobby for permanent funding for the Victims Compensation Fund past December 2020, delivering a tearful testimony.
Stewart continued to be a vocal advocate, appearing on late night shows such as &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot;, and news programs such as &quot;Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace&quot;, and &quot;The Fox Report with Shepherd Smith&quot;. On July 12, 2019, the House approved the bill overwhelmingly 402–12. The bill came to the Senate floor where it passed the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund through 2092, virtually funding health care for 9/11 victims and first responders for life. The vote was 97–2 with Republican senators Rand Paul (KY) and Mike Lee (UT) opposing. When hearing that the bill had been passed, Stewart responded by saying, &quot;It has been the honor of my life working with the 9/11 first responders...these families deserve better...and I will follow you wherever your next adventure shall be.&quot;

=== Honoring our PACT Act ===
On September 30, 2021, Stewart debuted his Apple TV+ show, &quot;The Problem with Jon Stewart&quot; by discussing the effects burn pits have had on veterans. Earlier in 2021, the bill Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021 (PACT Act) was introduced. The House of Representatives passed the bill by 256–174 on March 3, 2022, and passed the Senate by 84–14 on June 16, 2022. The bill was reintroduced to the Senate for minor changes which Republican senators including Pat Toomey, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley voted against, putting the bill in jeopardy. Their opposition was the unfounded claim that the bill could be used as a slush fund.

Stewart became a prominent advocate for the bill in person, on Twitter and on various cable news shows including Fox News&#x27; &quot;America&#x27;s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer, CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot;, MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe, and Newsmax. On July 28, 2022, Stewart held a press conference on Capitol Hill where he stated: 

On August 2, 2022, the PACT Act passed in bipartisan measure, 84 to 11. Stewart was praised for lending his voice and celebrity to the issue and is credited as being an essential actor in getting the bill passed. Stewart stated after the bill&#x27;s passing, that while it &quot;feels good&quot;, it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have been this hard&quot;. On August 10, the act was signed by President Joe Biden at a ceremony in the White House, where he praised Stewart for his commitment on this issue saying in part, &quot;What you&#x27;ve done Jon, matters...It really, really matters. To refuse to let anybody forget, refuse to let them forget. And we owe you big, man. We owe you big.&quot;

=== 2023–present Israel–Hamas war ===
Stewart has criticized Israel for its military and political conduct in the Palestinian territories. In 2023, Stewart, alongside other media figures, signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter urging American president Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire in the ongoing Israel–Hamas war.

=== Apple and free speech ===
In April 2024, Stewart claimed that Apple restricted him from interviewing Lina Khan, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), on his podcast. This incident follows the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Apple for alleged anti-competitive practices in the smartphone market. The lawsuit highlights potential harm to free speech due to Apple&#x27;s dominance. Stewart&#x27;s comments raise concerns about Apple&#x27;s influence over content creation beyond its control of the mobile device market.

==Accolades and achievements ==
Stewart and other members of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; have received three Peabody Awards for &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; and &quot;Indecision 2004&quot;, covering the 2000 presidential election and the 2004 presidential election, respectively. He received his third Peabody in 2016 for his tenure at &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015 and Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Series for 10 consecutive years from 2003 to 2012. In 2013, the award for both categories instead went to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; spin-off &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. In 2015, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; resurfaced, winning both categories for one last time for Stewart&#x27;s swan song as host. Stewart won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album in 2005 for his recording, &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot;.

In the December 2003 New Year&#x27;s edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Stewart was named the &quot;Who&#x27;s Next?&quot; person for 2004, with the magazine predicting that he would emerge as an absolute sensation in that year. (The magazine said they had been correct at the end of that year.) Stewart was named among the &quot;2005 Time 100&quot;, an annual list of 100 of the most influential people of the year by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 2004, Stewart spoke at the commencement ceremonies at his alma mater, William &amp; Mary, and received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree. Stewart was the Class Day keynote speaker at Princeton University in 2004, and the 2008 Sacerdote Great Names speaker at Hamilton College. Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; received the 2005 National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language. Stewart was presented an Honorary All-America Award by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) in 2006. On April 21, 2009, President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made Stewart a chief. On October 26, 2010, Stewart was named the Most Influential Man of 2010 by AskMen.

For his advocacy on behalf of 9/11 victims and families, Stewart was one of eighteen individuals and organizations awarded the Bronze Medallion on December 16, 2019. The Bronze Medallion is the highest award conferred upon civilians by New York City. On April 24, 2022, Stewart was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., for his lifelong contribution to the world of comedy.

==Personal life==
Stewart is irreligious, but of Jewish heritage.

=== Marriage and family ===
A production assistant on &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot; arranged a 1995 blind date between Stewart and Tracey Lynn McShane. Stewart proposed to her through a personalized crossword puzzle created with the help of Will Shortz, crossword editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Married in 2000, the two filed a joint name change application legally changing their surnames to &quot;Stewart&quot; on June 19, 2001. With the help of in vitro fertilization, the couple has two children. In 2015, he adopted a vegetarian diet for ethical reasons; his wife is a long-time vegan. Later, he became vegan as well.

=== Animal sanctuary ===
In 2013, Stewart and his wife bought a farm in Middletown, New Jersey, called &quot;Bufflehead Farm&quot;. The Stewarts operate it as a sanctuary for abused animals. Four years later, they received approval to open a 45-acre (18 ha) animal sanctuary in Colts Neck, New Jersey, a home to animals saved from slaughterhouses and live markets.

=== Interests ===
After leaving &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart took up playing the drums, saying it was partly to give his life the structure he no longer had without a daily late-night show to work on. He has been taking drum lessons from New Jersey–based drum teacher Andy Bova, a former member of the indie-rock band No Wine For Kittens.

Stewart is a lifelong fan of the New York Mets and was in attendance when Johan Santana threw the first no-hitter in franchise history on June 1, 2012. Shortly before he left the &quot;Daily Show&quot; in 2015, a compilation played of Stewart&#x27;s jokes about the team during his time on the show. He is also a fan of the New York Knicks, New York Giants, and New York Rangers.

<text>Georg Friedrich Schömann (28 June 1793 – 25 March 1879), was a German classical scholar of Swedish heritage.

== Background ==
He was born at Stralsund in Pomerania. He studied at the Universities of Greifswald and Jena, earning his PhD at Greifswald in 1815. In 1820 he obtained his habilitation with the thesis &quot;&quot;De sortitione iudicum apud Athenienses&quot;. In 1827 he was appointed professor of ancient literature and rhetoric at the University of Greifswald, where in 1844, he was named first librarian. He died in Greifswald on 25 March 1879.

== Classical studies ==
Schömann&#x27;s main interest was in the constitutional and religious antiquities of Greece. His first works on the subject were &quot;De comitiis Atheniensium&quot; (1819), the first independent account of the forms of Athenian political life, and a treatise &quot;De sortitione judicum apud Athenienses&quot; (1820). In conjunction with M. H. E. Meier, Schömann wrote &quot;Der attische Process&quot; (1824). Among his other works are:
*editions of Isaeus (1831) and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Agis and Cleomenes&quot; (1839, important for the Attic law of inheritance and the history of the Spartan constitution).
*&quot;Antiquitates juris publici Graecorum&quot; (1838).
*a critical examination of Grote&#x27;s account of the Athenian constitution (1854, Eng. trans. by Bernard Bosanquet, 1878) from a conservative point of view.
*&quot;Griechische Alterthümer&quot; (2 volumes, 1855, 1859, 2nd edition 1861, 3rd edition 1871-73), treating of the general historical development of the Greek states, followed by a detailed account of the constitutions of Sparta, Crete and Athens, the cults and international relations of the Greek tribes.

The question of the religious institutions of the Greeks, which Schömann considered an essential part of their public life, soon attracted his attention, and he took the view that everything really religious was akin to Christianity, and that the greatest intellects of Greece produced intuitively Christian, dogmatic ideas. From this point of view he edited the &quot;Theogony&quot; of Hesiod (1868), with a commentary, chiefly mythological, and Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De natura deorum&quot; (1850, 4th ed. 1876); translated with introduction and notes Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, and wrote a &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1844), in which Prometheus is brought to see the greatness of his offense and is pardoned by Zeus. Of his contributions on grammatical subjects special mention may be made of &quot;Die Lehre von den Redetheilen nach den Alten dargestellt und beurtheilt&quot; (1862), an introduction to the elements of the science of grammar. His many-sidedness is shown in his &quot;Opuscula academica&quot; (4 volumes, 1856-1871).

In Samuel Butler’s &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; (1903), the protagonist, Earnest Pontifex, is given a copy of &quot;De Comitiis Atheniensibus&quot; by his headmaster, Dr. Skinner.

<text>Outsourcing is a business practice in which companies use external providers to carry out business processes, that would otherwise be handled internally. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another.

The term &quot;outsourcing&quot;, which came from the phrase &quot;outside resourcing&quot;, originated no later than 1981 at a time when industrial jobs in the United States were being moved overseas, contributing to the economic and cultural collapse of small, industrial towns. In some contexts, the term smartsourcing is also used.

The concept, which &quot;The Economist&quot; says has &quot;made its presence felt since the time of the Second World War&quot;, often involves the contracting out of a business process (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, facility management, call center/call center support.

The practice of handing over control of public services to private enterprises (privatization), even if conducted on a limited, short-term basis, may also be described as outsourcing.

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and therefore should not be confused with offshoring which is relocating a business process to another country but does not imply or preclude another company. In practice, the concepts can be intertwined, i.e. &quot;offshore outsourcing&quot;, and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, as described by terms such as &quot;reshoring&quot;, &quot;inshoring&quot;, and &quot;insourcing&quot;.

==Motivation==
Global labor arbitrage can provide major financial savings from lower international labor rates, which could be a major motivation for offshoring. Cost savings from economies of scale and specialization can also motivate outsourcing, even if not offshoring. Since about 2015 indirect revenue benefits have increasingly become additional motivators.

Another motivation is speed to market. To make this work, a new process was developed: &quot;outsource the outsourcing process&quot;. Details of managing DuPont&#x27;s chief information officer Cinda Hallman&#x27;s $4 billion 10-year outsourcing contract with Computer Sciences Corporation and Accenture were outsourced, thus avoiding &quot;inventing a process if we&#x27;d done it in-house&quot;. A term subsequently developed to describe this is &quot;&quot;.

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control by allowing organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It is often perceived to reduce hiring and training specialized staff, to make available specialized expertise, and to decrease capital, operating expenses, and risk.

&quot;Do what you do best and outsource the rest&quot; has become an internationally recognized business tagline first &quot;coined and developed&quot; in the 1990s by management consultant Peter Drucker. The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of &quot;outsourcing&quot; as early as 1989 in his &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article entitled &quot;Sell the Mailroom&quot;.

From Drucker&#x27;s perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability. The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider&#x27;s knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.

In 2009, by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.

The biggest difference between outsourcing and in-house provision is with regards to the difference in ownership: outsourcing usually presupposes the integration of business processes under a different ownership, over which the client business has minimal or no control. This requires the use of outsourcing relationship management.

Sometimes the effect of what looks like outsourcing from one side and insourcing from the other side can be unexpected; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2001 that &quot;6.4 million Americans .. worked for foreign companies as of 2001, [but] more jobs are being outsourced than&quot; [the reverse].

===Reasons for outsourcing===

While U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce high top level executive or managerial costs, they primarily outsource to reduce peripheral and &quot;non-core&quot; business expenses. Further reasons are higher taxes, high energy costs, and excessive government regulation or mandates.

Mandated benefits like social security, Medicare, and safety protection (e.g. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations) are also motivators. By contrast, executive pay in the U.S. in 2007, which could exceed 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965, is not a factor.

Other reasons include reducing and controlling operating costs, improving company focus, gaining access to world-class capabilities, tax credits, freeing internal resources for other purposes, streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions, and maximizing use of external resources. For small businesses, contracting/subcontracting/&quot;outsourcing&quot; might be done to improve work-life balance.

==History==
===20th century===
Following the adding of management layers in the 1950s and 1960s to support expansion for the sake of economy of scale, corporations found that agility and added profits could be obtained by focusing on core strengths; the 1970s and 1980s were the beginnings of what later was named outsourcing. Kodak&#x27;s 1989 &quot;outsourcing most of its information technology systems&quot; was followed by others during the 1990s.

In 2013, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals gave recognition to Electronic Data Systems Corporation&#x27;s Morton H. Meyerson who, in 1967, proposed the business model that eventually became known as outsourcing.

====IT-enabled services offshore outsourcing====
The growth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, although not universally accepted, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s. Services making use of low-cost countries included:

* back-office and administrative functions, such as finance and accounting, HR, and legal
* call centers and other customer-facing departments, such as marketing and sales services
* IT infrastructure and application development
* knowledge services, including engineering support, product design, research and development, and analytics

===Early 21st century===
In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or offshore outsourcing. Other options subsequently emerged including: nearshoring, crowdsourcing, multisourcing, strategic alliances/strategic partnerships, strategic outsourcing.

&quot;Forbes&quot; considered the 2016 U.S. presidential election &quot;the most disruptive change agent for the outsourcing industry&quot;, especially the renewed &quot;invest in America&quot; goal highlighted in campaigning, but the magazine tepidly reversed direction in 2019 as to the outcome for employment. In the case of armament acquisition, section 323 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2014 requires military personnel &quot;to solicit information from all U.S.-owned arsenals regarding the capability of that arsenal to fulfill the manufacturing requirement&quot; when undertaking a make-or-buy analysis.

Furthermore, there are growing legal requirements for data protection, where obligations and implementation details must be understood by both sides. This includes dealing with customer rights.

UK government policy notes that certain services must remain in-house, citing the development of policy, stewardship of tax spend and retention of certain critical knowledge as examples. Guidance states that specific criteria must govern the identification of such services, and that &quot;everything else&quot; could potentially be outsourced.

====Limitations due to growth====
Inflation, high domestic interest rates, and economic growth pushed India&#x27;s IT salaries 10–15%, making some jobs relatively &quot;too&quot; expensive, compared to other offshoring destinations. Areas for advancing within the value chain included research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, and medical transcription.

===Growth of white-collar outsourcing===
Although offshoring initially focused on manufacturing, white-collar offshoring/outsourcing has grown rapidly since the early 21st century. The digital workforce of countries like India and China are only paid a fraction of what would be minimum wage in the United States. On average, software engineers are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the U.S. and Canada. Closer to the U.S., Costa Rica has become a major source for the advantages of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, and similar time zones as the U.S. It takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and U.S. Companies such as Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.

Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar workers have flextime and can choose their working hours, and for which companies to work. Clients benefit from remote work, reduced office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are independent contractors.

Ending a government outsourcing arrangement poses difficulties.

==Variations==
There are many outsourcing models, with variations by country, year and industry. Japanese companies often outsource to China, particularly to formerly Japanese-occupied cities. German companies have outsourced to Eastern European countries with German-language affiliation, such as Poland and Romania. French companies outsource to North Africa for similar reasons. For Australian IT companies, Indonesia is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.

Another approach is to differentiate between tactical and strategic outsourcing models. Tactical models include:

* Staff augmentation
* Project-based
* To gain expertise not available in-house

Strategic consultancy includes for business process improvement.

===Innovation outsourcing===
When offshore outsourcing knowledge work, firms heavily rely on the availability of technical personnel at offshore locations. One of the challenges in offshoring engineering innovation is a reduction in quality.

===Co-sourcing===
Co-sourcing is a hybrid of internal staff supplemented by an external service provider. Co-sourcing can minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control than fully outsourced.

Co-sourcing services can supplement internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information risk management or integrity services, or help during peak periods, or similarly for other areas such as software development or human resources.

====Identity management co-sourcing====
Identity management co-sourcing is when on-site hardware interacts with outside identity services.

This contrasts with an &quot;all in-the-cloud&quot; service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, cloud computing infrastructure.

====Offshore software R&amp;D co-sourcing====
Offshore software R&amp;D is the provision of software development services by a supplier (whether external or internal) located in a different country from the one where the software will be used. The global software R&amp;D services market, as contrasted to information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business process outsourcing (BPO), is rather young and currently is at a relatively early stage of development.

=====Countries involved in outsourced software R&amp;D=====
Canada, India, Ireland, and Israel were the four leading countries as of 2003. Although many countries have participated in the offshore outsourcing of software development, their involvement in co-sourced and outsourced Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) was somewhat limited. Canada, the second largest by 2009, had 21%.

As of 2018, the top three were deemed by one &quot;research-based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists&quot; as China, India and Israel.&quot;

Gartner Group adds in Russia, but does not make clear whether this is pure R&amp;D or run-of-the-mill IT outsourcing.

== Implications ==

=== Performance measurement ===

Focusing on software quality metrics is a good way to maintain track of how well a project is performing.

=== Management processes ===

Globalization and complex supply chains, along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as voice over IP, instant messaging, and issue tracking systems, new time management methods such as time tracking software, and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as cost estimation software.

The term &quot;transition methodology&quot; describes the process of migrating knowledge, systems, and operating capabilities between the two sides.

==== Communications and customer service ====

In the area of call-center outsourcing, especially when combined with offshoring, agents may speak with different linguistic features such as accents, word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. 

==== Governance ====

In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver E. Williamson wrote that the governance structure is the &quot;framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided&quot;, and that &quot;because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction&quot;. University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.

==== Security ====

Reduced security, sometimes related to lower loyalty may occur, even when &#x27;outsourced&#x27; staff change their legal status but not their desk. While security and compliance issues are supposed to be addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers, fraud cases have been reported.

In April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four Citibank customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.

==== Information technology ====
Richard Baldwin&#x27;s 2006 &quot;The Great Unbundling&quot; work was followed in 2012 by &quot;Globalization&#x27;s Second Acceleration (the Second Unbundling)&quot; and in 2016 by &quot;The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalization&quot;. It is here, rather than in manufacturing, that the bits economy can advance in ways that the economy of atoms and things cannot: an early 1990s &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran a half page cartoon showing someone who had just ordered a pizza online, and was seeking help to download it.

==== Step-in rights ====
Step-in rights allow the client or a nominated third party the right to step-in and intervene, in particular to directly operate the outsourced services or to appoint a new operator. Circumstances where step-in rights may be contractually invoked may include supplier insolvency, a &quot;force majeure&quot; event which prevents or impedes the outsourced service provision, where the client believes that there is a substantial risk to the provision of the services, or where performance fails to meet a defined critical level of service. Suitable clauses in a contract may provide for the outsourced service provider to pay any additional costs which are faced by the client and specify that the provider&#x27;s obligation to provide the services is annulled or suspended.

If a contract has a clause granting step-in rights, then there is a right, though not an obligation, to take over a task that is not going well, or even the entire project. &quot;When&quot; and &quot;How&quot; are important: &quot;What is the process for stepping-in&quot; must be clearly defined in the &quot;collateral warranty&quot;.

An example of when there is sometimes hesitancy about exercising this right was reported by the BBC in 2018, when Wealden District Council in East Sussex was &quot;considering exercising &#x27;step in rights&#x27; on its waste collection contract with Kier&quot; due to issues of poor service. After some discussion in this case, a &quot;recovery plan&quot; was agreed with the contractor so that the step in rights were not actually exercised.

Stabler notes that in the event that step-in rights are taken up, it is important to establish which elements of a process are business-critical and ensure these are made top priority when implementing the step-in.

== Issues ==
A number of outsourcings and offshorings that were deemed failures led to reversals signaled by use of terms such as insourcing and reshoring. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2017 that IBM &quot;plans to hire 25,000 more workers in the United States over the next four years,&quot; overlapping India-based Infosys&#x27;s &quot;10,000 workers in the United States over the next two years.&quot; A clue to a tipping point having been reached was a short essay titled &quot;Maybe You Shouldn&#x27;t Outsource Everything After All&quot; and the longer &quot;That Job Sent to India May Now Go to Indiana.&quot;
Among problems encountered were supply-and-demand induced raises in salaries and lost benefits of similar-time-zone. Other issues were differences in language and culture. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.

According to a 2005 Deloitte Consulting survey, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy.

These reversals, however, did not undo the damage. New factories often:

* were in different locations
* needed different skill sets
* used more automation

Public opinion in the U.S. and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2000 to 2010, the U.S. experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 U.S. presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.

A counterswing depicted by a 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource. Deloitte&#x27;s survey identified three trends:
* Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
* Organizations are &quot;redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks&quot;.
* Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to &quot;maximize the value of those relationships&quot;.

===Insourcing===
Insourcing is the process of reversing an outsourcing, possibly using help from those not currently part of the in-house staff. Some authors call this backsourcing, reserving the term &quot;insourcing&quot; to refer simply to conducting certain activities in-house.

Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions, and some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed. Often the reason is to maintain control of critical production or competencies, and insourcing is used to reduce costs of taxes, labor and transportation. Sometimes there are problems with the outsourcing agreements, because of the pressure to bring jobs back to their home country, or simply because it has stopped being efficient to outsource particular tasks.

Studies conducted at companies confirm the positive impact of using insourcing on financial performance.

&quot;Regional insourcing&quot;, a related term, is when a company assigns work to a subsidiary that is within the same country. This differs from &quot;onshoring&quot; and &quot;reshoring&quot;, which may be either inside or outside the company.

====Regional insourcing====
Regional insourcing is a process in which a company establishes satellite locations for specific entities of their business, making use of advantages one state may have over another This concept focuses on the delegating or reassigning of procedures, functions, or jobs from production within a business in one location to another internal entity that specializes in that operation. This allows companies to streamline production, boost competency, and increase their bottom line.

This competitive strategy applies the classical argument of Adam Smith, which posits that two nations would benefit more from one another by trading the goods that they are more proficient at manufacturing.

====Net effect on jobs====
To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the U.S., the UK, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. &quot;The New York Times&quot; disagreed, and wrote that free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.

The impact of offshore outsourcing, according to two estimates published by &quot;The Economist&quot;, showed unequal effect during the period studied 2004 to 2015, ranging from 150,000 to as high as 300,000 jobs lost per year.

In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country. Their data indicated that
140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. Eleven years later in 2014, the U.S. recovered 10,000 of those offshored positions; this marked the highest net gain in 20 years. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies &quot;offshored&quot; and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return.

====Insourcing crossbreeds====
The fluctuation of prefixes and names give rise to many more &quot;cross-breeds&quot; of insourcing. For example, &quot;offshore insourcing&quot; is &quot;when companies set up their own &quot;&quot; process centers overseas, sometimes called a &quot;Captive Service&quot;, taking advantage of their cheaper surroundings while maintaining control of their back-office work and business processes.&quot; &quot;&quot; refers to hiring developers to work in-house from virtual (remote) facilities.

====In the U.S.====
A 2012 series of articles in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the U.S.&#x27;s manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the U.S., increasing U.S. labor productivity, and union flexibility. Hiring at GE&#x27;s giant Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, increased 90% during 2012.

=====100% U.S. Based=====
More than one company uses a &quot;100% U. Based&quot; phrase, whether within or outside their envelopes. &quot;100% US-based customer service available 24/7&quot; is how, in 2024, Business Insider described the expectations of some customers.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of globalization and economic polarization.
* &quot;Low-skilled work&quot;: Low-skill work outsourced to contractors who tend to employ migrant labor is causing a revival of radical trade union activity. In the UK, major hospitals, universities, ministries and corporations are being pressured.

* &quot;In-housing&quot;: In January 2020, Tim Orchard, the CEO of Imperial College Healthcare Trust, stated that the in-housing of over 1,000 Sodexo cleaners, caterers and porters across five NHS hospitals in London &quot;will create additional cost pressures next year but we are confident that there are also benefits to unlock, arising from better team working, more co-ordinated planning and improved quality.&quot;

* &quot;U.S. base&quot;: On June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the U.S. to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the Acquired Rights Directive attempts to address the issue. The directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the U.S., the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Government response====
In response to the recession, U.S. president Barack Obama launched the SelectUSA program in 2011. In January 2012, Obama issued a Call to Action to Invest in America at the White House &quot;Insourcing American Jobs&quot; Forum. Obama met with representatives of Otis Elevator, Apple, DuPont, Master Lock, and others which had recently brought jobs back or made significant investments in the U.S.

====Legislative authorisation====
Governments may legislate to authorise the outsourcing of specific functions or the work of specific government agencies, for example in the United Kingdom, the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (as amended) authorises the contracting-out of work-focussed interviews and documentary work, and the Contracting Out of Functions (Tribunal Staff) Order 2009 authorises the contracting-out of tribunals&#x27; administrative work.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates, including its defense/military ramifications, regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

In particular, distinction is needed between
* &quot;cyclical unemployment&quot; – for which &quot;pump it up&quot; solutions have worked in the past, and
* &quot;structural unemployment&quot; – when &quot;businesses and industries that employed them no longer exist, and their skills no longer have the value they once did.&quot;

=====Competitiveness=====
A governance that attempts adapting to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.

Automation increases output and allows for reduced cost per item. When these changes are not well synchronized, unemployment or underemployment is a likely result. When transportation costs remain unchanged, the negative effect may be permanent; jobs in protected sectors may no longer exist.

Studies suggest that the effect of U.S. outsourcing on Mexico is that for every 10% increase in U.S. wages, north Mexico cities along the border experienced wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.

By contrast, higher rates of saving and investment in Asian countries, along with rising levels of education, studies suggest, fueled the &#x27;Asian miracle&#x27; rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. There was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures.

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.

The tradeoffs are not always balanced, and a 2004 viewer of the situation said &quot;the total number of jobs realized in the United States from insourcing is far less than those lost through outsourcing.&quot;

=====Environmental policy=====
Import competition has caused a &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;race-to-the-bottom&#x27; where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries.

As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, heavy industries have increasingly moved to the U.S., which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s.

Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.

===Success stories===
Companies such as ET Water Systems (now a Jain Irrigation Systems company), GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America. Advances in technology and automation such as 3D printing technologies have made bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., both cost effective and possible. Adidas, for example, plans to produce highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.

===Globalization and socio-economic implications===
====Industrialization====
Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.

Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S. The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. Just as the U.S. has a Made in USA program, other countries support products being made domestically. Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster.

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.

====Growth and income====
It has been suggested that &quot;workers require more education and different skills, working with software rather than drill presses&quot; rather than rely on limited growth labor requirements for non-tradable services.

=== Usability issues in offshore development ===

The main driver for offshoring development work has been the greater availability of developers at a lower cost than in the home country. However, the rise in offshore development has taken place in parallel with an increased awareness of the importance of usability, and the user experience, in software. Outsourced development poses special problems for development, i.e. the more formal, contractual relationship between the supplier and client, and geographical separation place greater distance between the developers and users, which makes it harder to reflect the users&#x27; needs in the final product. This problem is exacerbated if the development is offshore. Further complications arise from cultural differences, which apply even if the development is carried out by an in-house offshore team.

Historically offshore development concentrated on back office functions but, as offshoring has grown, a wider range of applications have been developed. Offshore suppliers have had to respond to the commercial pressures arising from usability issues by building up their usability expertise. Indeed, this problem has presented an attractive opportunity to some suppliers to move up market and offer higher value services.

====Legal issues====

Offshore Software R&amp;D means that company A turns over responsibility, in whole or in part, of an in-house software development to company B whose location is outside of company A&#x27;s national jurisdiction. Maximizing the economic value of an offshore software development asset critically depends on understanding how best to use the available forms of legal regulations to protect intellectual rights. If the vendor cannot be trusted to protect trade secrets, then the risks of an offshoring software development may outweigh its potential benefits. Hence, it is critical to review the intellectual property policy of the potential offshoring supplier. The intellectual property protection policy of an offshore software development company must be reflected in these crucial documents: General Agreement, Non-Disclosure Agreement, and Employee Confidentiality Contract.

====2000-2012 R&amp;D====
As forecast in 2003, R&amp;D is outsourced. Ownership of intellectual property by the outsourcing company, despite outside development, was the goal. To defend against tax-motivated cost-shifting, the U.S. government passed regulations in 2006 to make outsourcing research harder. Despite many R&amp;D contracts given to Indian universities and labs, only some research solutions were patented.

While Pfizer moved some of its R&amp;D from the UK to India, a &quot;Forbes&quot; article suggested that it is increasingly more dangerous to offshore IP-sensitive projects to India, because of India&#x27;s continued ignorance of patent regulations. In turn, companies such as Pfizer and Novartis, have lost rights to sell many of their cancer medications in India because of lack of IP protection.

==== Future trends ====

A 2018 University of Chicago Law School article titled &quot;The Future of Outsourcing&quot; begins with &quot;The future of outsourcing is digital.&quot; According to other sources, the &quot;Do what you do best and outsource the rest&quot; approach means that &quot;integration with retained systems&quot; is the new transition challenge; people training still exists, but is merely an &quot;also.&quot;

There is more complexity than before, especially when the outside company may be an integrator.

While the number of technically skilled labor grows in India, Indian offshore companies are increasingly tapping into the skilled labor already available in Eastern Europe to better address the needs of the Western European R&amp;D market.

== Practices ==

=== Agreements ===

Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an exchange of services, expertise, and payments. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.

=== United States ===

Protection of some data involved in outsourcing, such as about patients (HIPAA) is one of the few federal protections.

&quot;Outsourcing&quot; is a continuing political issue in the U.S., having been conflated with offshoring during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The political debate centered on outsourcing&#x27;s consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. Democratic U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry called U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in tax havens to avoid paying their &quot;fair share&quot; of U.S. taxes &quot;Benedict Arnold corporations&quot;.

A Zogby International August 2004 poll found that 71% of American voters believed &quot;outsourcing jobs overseas&quot; hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against these companies, possibly in the form of increased taxes. President Obama promoted the Bring Jobs Home Act to help reshore jobs by using tax cuts and credits for moving operations back to the U.S. The same bill was reintroduced in the 113th U.S. Congress.

While labor advocates claim union busting as one possible cause of outsourcing, another claim is high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations, and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. Some counterclaim that the actual taxes paid by U.S. corporations may be considerably lower than &quot;official&quot; rates due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and &quot;gaming the system&quot;.

Sarbanes-Oxley has also been cited as a factor.

=== Europe ===

Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977 protects employees&#x27; rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended 29 June 1998, Directive 98/50/EC and 12 March 2001&#x27;s Directive 2001/23). Rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor.

Case subsequent to the European Court of Justice&#x27;s &quot;Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen&quot;, Case C-392/92 [1994] have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, &quot;Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice&quot;, Case C-13/95 [1997]). In principle, employees may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

=== Asia ===

Countries that have been the focus of outsourcing include India and the Philippines for American and European companies, and China and Vietnam for Japanese companies.

The Asian IT service market is still in its infancy, but in 2008 industry think tank Nasscom-McKinsey predicted a $17 billion IT service industry in India alone.

A China-based company, Lenovo, outsourced/reshored manufacturing of some time-critical customized PCs to the U.S. since &quot;If it made them in China they would spend six weeks on a ship.&quot;

Article 44 of Japan&#x27;s Employment Security Act implicitly bans the domestic/foreign workers supplied by unauthorized companies regardless of their operating locations. The law will apply if at least one party of suppliers, clients, labors reside in Japan, and if the labors are the integral part of the chain of command by the client company, or the supplier.
* No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.
** A person who falls under any of the following items shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen. (Article 64)
* Unless permitted by act, no person shall obtain profit by intervening, as a business, in the employment of another.

Victims can lodge a criminal complaint against the CEO of the suppliers and clients. The CEO risks arrest, and the Japanese company may face a private settlement with financial package in the range between 20 and 100 million JPY ($200,000 – US$1 million).

=== Outsourcing visa ===
The U.S. has a special visa, the H-1B, which enables American companies to temporarily (up to three years, or by extension, six) hire foreign workers to supplement their employees or replace those holding existing positions. In hearings on this matter, a U.S. senator called these &quot;their outsourcing visa&quot;.

== Examples ==

* In 2003 Procter &amp; Gamble outsourced their facilities&#x27; management support, but it did not involve offshoring.
* Dell offshored to India in 2001 but reversed this since &quot;customers were not happy with the prior arrangement ...&quot;.

=== Print and mail outsourcing ===

Print and mail outsourcing is the outsourcing of document printing and distribution.

The Print Services &amp; Distribution Association was formed in 1946, and its members provide services that today might involve the word outsource. Similarly, members of the Direct Mail Marketing Association (established 1917) were the &quot;outsourcers&quot; for advertising agencies and others doing mailings.

The term &quot;outsourcing&quot; became very common in the print and mail business during the 1990s, and later expanded to be very broad and inclusive of most any process by 2000. Today, there are web based print to mail solutions for small to mid-size companies which allow the user to send one to thousands of documents into the mail stream, directly from a desktop or web interface.

=== Marketing outsourcing ===

The term outsource marketing has been used in Britain to mean the outsourcing of the marketing function. The motivation for this has been:
* cost reduction
* specialized expertise
* speed of execution
* short term staff augmentation

While much of this work is the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of specialized departments within advertising agencies, sometimes specialist are used, such as when &quot;The Guardian&quot; outsourced most of its marketing design in May 2010.

=== Business process outsourcing ===


Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a subset of outsourcing that involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process to a third-party service provider. Originally, this was associated with manufacturing firms, such as Coca-Cola that outsourced large segments of its supply chain.

BPO is typically categorized into back office and front office outsourcing. BPO can help your business remain competitive and efficient by leveraging the expertise of other companies that are more specialized in certain functions.

BPO can be offshore outsourcing, near-shore outsourcing to a nearby country, or onshore outsourcing to the same country. Information technology-enabled service (ITES-BPO), knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and legal process outsourcing (LPO), a.k.a. legal outsourcing, are some of the sub-segments of BPO.

Although BPO began as a cost-reducer, changes (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies now choose to outsource their back-office increasingly for time flexibility and direct quality control. Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:

BPO vendor charges are project-based or fee-for-service, using business models such as remote in-sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models. This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into variable costs. A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.

BPO also permits focusing on a company&#x27;s core competencies.

Supply chain management with effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing can increase the speed of several business processes.

==== BPO caveats ====

Even various contractual compensation strategies may leave the company as having a new &quot;single point of failure&quot; (where even an after the fact payment is not enough to offset &quot;complete failure of the customer&#x27;s business&quot;). Unclear contractual issues are not the only risks; there&#x27;s also changing requirements and unforeseen charges, failure to meet service levels, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. The latter is called lock-in; flexibility may be lost due to penalty clauses and other contract terms. Also, the selection criteria may seem vague and undifferentiated.

Security risks can arise regarding both from physical communication and from a privacy perspective. Employee attitude may change, and the company risks losing independence.

Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximizing positive outcome, minimizing risks and avoiding any threats, a business continuity management (BCM) model is set up. BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a framework of BPO focused on identifying potential outsourceable information systems. L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald identify several contracting problems companies face, ranging from unclear contract formatting, to a lack of understanding of technical IT processes.

==== Technological pressures ====

Industry analysts have identified robotic process automation (RPA) software and in particular the enhanced self-guided RPAAI based on artificial intelligence as a potential threat to the industry and speculate as to the likely long-term impact. In the short term, however, there is likely to be little impact as existing contracts run their course: it is only reasonable to expect demand for cost efficiency and innovation to result in transformative changes at the point of contract renewals. With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more – and many contracts being longer – this hypothesis will take some time to play out.

On the other hand, an academic study by the London School of Economics was at pains to counter the so-called &#x27;myth&#x27; that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore. One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes-based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a &quot;lift and shift&quot; approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.

==== Industry size ====

One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.

India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India, the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the national industry association. The BPO industry is a small segment of the total outsourcing industry in India. The BPO industry workforce in India is expected to shrink by 14% in 2021.

The BPO industry and IT services industry in combination are worth a total of US$154 billion in revenue in 2017. The BPO industry in the Philippines generated $26.7 billion in revenues in 2020, while around 700 thousand medium and high skill jobs would be created by 2022.

In 2015, official statistics put the size of the total outsourcing industry in China, including not only the BPO industry but also IT outsourcing services, at $130.9 billion.

<doc id="235892" wikidata="Q1799148" url="?curid=235892" title="Plurality (voting)">
<text>A plurality vote (in North American English) or relative majority (in British English) describes the circumstance when a party, candidate, or proposition polls more votes than any other but does not receive more than half of all votes cast.

For example, if from 100 votes that were cast, 45 were for &quot;candidate A&quot;, 30 were for &quot;candidate B&quot; and 25 were for &quot;candidate C&quot;, then &quot;candidate A&quot; received a plurality of votes but not a majority. In some election contests, the winning candidate or proposition may need only a plurality, depending on the rules of the organization holding the vote.

== Versus majority ==
In international institutional law, a &quot;simple majority&quot; (also a &quot;plurality&quot;) is the largest number of votes cast (disregarding abstentions) &quot;among&quot; alternatives, always true when only two are in the competition. In some circles, a majority means more than half of the total including abstentions. However, in many jurisdictions, a simple majority is defined as more votes than half cast, excluding abstentions, are required. Thus, it is a stronger requirement than plurality (yet weaker than &quot;absolute majority&quot;). 

An &quot;absolute majority&quot; (also a &quot;majority&quot;) is a number of votes &quot;greater than the number of votes that possibly can be obtained at the same time for any other solution&quot;, when voting for &quot;multiple&quot; alternatives at a time 

A &quot;qualified majority&quot; (also a &quot;supermajority&quot;) is a number of votes above a specified percentage (e.g. two-thirds); a &quot;relative majority&quot; (also a &quot;plurality&quot;) is the number of votes obtained that is greater than any other option.

Henry Watson Fowler suggested that the American terms &quot;plurality&quot; and &quot;majority&quot; offer single-word alternatives for the corresponding two-word terms in British English, &quot;relative majority&quot; and &quot;absolute majority&quot;, and that in British English &quot;majority&quot; is sometimes understood to mean &quot;receiving the most votes&quot; and can therefore be confused with &quot;plurality&quot;.

<doc id="235893" wikidata="Q1853644" url="?curid=235893" title="Submersible pump">
<text>A submersible pump (or electric submersible pump (ESP) is a device which has a hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the pump body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage of this type of pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between the pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface, rather than jet pumps, which create a vacuum and rely upon atmospheric pressure. Submersibles use pressurized fluid from the surface to drive a hydraulic motor downhole, rather than an electric motor, and are used in heavy oil applications with heated water as the motive fluid.

== History ==
In. 1928 Armenian oil delivery system engineer and inventor Armais Arutunoff successfully installed the first submersible oil pump in an oil field. In 1929, Pleuger Pumps (today Pleuger Industries) developed the design of the submersible turbine pump, the forerunner of the modern multi-stage submersible pump.

== Working principle ==
Electric submersible pumps are multistage centrifugal pumps operating in a vertical position. Liquids, accelerated by the impeller, lose their kinetic energy in the diffuser, where a conversion of kinetic to pressure energy takes place. This is the main operational mechanism of radial and mixed flow pumps. In the HSP, the motor is a hydraulic motor rather than an electrical motor, and may be closed cycle (keeping the power fluid separate from the produced fluid) or open cycle (mingling the power fluid with the produced fluid downhole, with surface separation).

The pump shaft is connected to the gas separator or the protector by a mechanical coupling at the bottom of the pump. Fluids
enter the pump through an intake screen and are lifted by the pump stages. Other parts include the radial bearings (bushings) distributed along the length of the shaft, providing radial support to the pump shaft. An optional thrust bearing takes up part of the axial forces arising in the pump, but most of those forces are absorbed by the protector&#x27;s thrust bearing.

There are also screw-type submersible pumps, there is a steel screw which is used as a working element in them. The screw allows the pump to work in water with a high sand content and other mechanical impurities.

== Applications ==
Submersible pumps are found in many applications. Single stage pumps are used for drainage, sewage pumping, general industrial pumping and slurry pumping. They are also popular with Pond filters. Multiple stage submersible pumps are typically lowered down a borehole, and most typically used for residential, commercial, municipal and industrial water extraction (abstraction), water wells and in oil wells.

Other uses for submersible pumps include sewage treatment plants, seawater handling, fire fighting (since it is flame retardant cable), water well and deep well drilling, offshore drilling rigs, artificial lifts, mine dewatering, and irrigation systems.

Pumps in electrical hazardous locations used for combustible liquids or for water that may be contaminated with combustible liquids must be designed not to ignite the liquid or vapors.

== Use in oil wells ==
Submersible pumps are used in oil production to provide a relatively efficient form of &quot;artificial lift&quot;, able to operate across a broad range of flow rates and depths. By decreasing the pressure at the bottom of the well (by lowering bottom-hole flowing pressure, or increasing drawdown), significantly more oil can be produced from the well when compared with natural production. The pumps are typically electrically powered, referred to as Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) or if hydraulically powered, referred to as Hydraulic Submersible Pumps (HSP).

ESP systems consist of both surface components (housed in the production facility, for example an oil platform), and sub-surface components (found in the well hole). Surface components include the motor controller (often a variable speed controller), surface cables and transformers. The subsurface components are deployed by attaching to the downhole end of a tubing string, while at the surface, and then lowered into the well bore along with the tubing.

A high-voltage (3 to 5 kV) alternating-current source at the surface drives the subsurface motor. Until recently, ESPs had been costly to install due to the requirement of an electric cable extending from the source to the motor. This cable had to be wrapped around jointed tubing and connected at each joint. New coiled tubing umbilicals allow for both the piping and electric cable to be deployed with a single conventional coiled tubing unit. Cables for sensor and control data may also be included.

The subsurface components generally include a pump portion and a motor portion, with the motor downhole from the pump. The motor rotates a shaft that, in turn, rotates pump impellers to lift fluid through production tubing to the surface. These components must reliably work at high temperatures of up to and high pressures of up to , from deep wells of up to deep with high energy requirements of up to 1000 horsepower (750 kW). The pump itself is a multi-stage unit, with the number of stages being determined by the operating requirements. Each stage includes an impeller and diffuser. Each impeller is coupled to the rotating shaft and accelerates fluid from near the shaft radially outward. The fluid then enters a non-rotating diffuser, which is not coupled to the shaft and contains vanes that direct fluid back toward the shaft. Pumps come in diameters from 90 mm (3.5 inches) to 254 mm (10 inches) and vary between and in length. The motor used to drive the pump is typically a three-phase, squirrel cage induction motor, with a nameplate power rating in the range 7.5 kW to 560 kW (at 60 Hz).

ESP assemblies may also include: seals coupled to the shaft between the motor and pump; screens to reject sand; and fluid separators at the pump intake that separate gas, oil and water. ESPs have dramatically lower efficiencies with significant fractions of gas, greater than about 10% volume at the pump intake, so separating gas from oil prior to the pump can be important. Some ESPs include a water/oil separator which permits water to be re-injected downhole. As some wells produce up to 90% water, and fluid lift is a significant cost, re-injecting water before lifting it to the surface can reduce energy consumption and improve economics Given ESPs&#x27; high rotational speed of up to 4000 rpm (67 Hz) and tight clearances, they are not very tolerant of solids, such as sand.

There are at least 15 brands of oilfield ESPs used throughout the world.

==Submersible pump cable (SPC)==

Submersible pump cables are electrical conductors designed for use in wet ground or under water, with types specialized for pump environmental conditions.

A submersible pump cable is a specialized product to be used for a submersible pump in a deep well, or in similarly harsh conditions. The cable needed for this type of application must be durable and reliable, as the installation location and environment can be extremely restrictive as well as hostile. As such, submersible pump cable can be used in both fresh and salt water. It is also suitable for direct burial and within well castings. A submersible pump cable&#x27;s area of installation is physically restrictive. Cable manufacturers must keep these factors in mind to achieve the highest possible degree of reliability. 

The size and shape of submersible pump cable can vary depending on the usage and preference and pumping instrument of the installer. Pump cables are made in single and multiple conductor types and may be flat or round in cross section; some types include control wires as well as power conductors for the pump motor.
Conductors are often color-coded for identification and an overall cable jacket may also be color-coded.

<doc id="235896" wikidata="Q465413" url="?curid=235896" title="End-face mechanical seal">
<text>In mechanical engineering, an end-face mechanical seal (often shortened to mechanical seal) is a type of seal used in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as gland packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.

An end-face mechanical seal uses both rigid and flexible elements that maintain contact at a sealing interface and slide on each other, allowing a rotating element to pass through a sealed case. The elements are both hydraulically and mechanically loaded with a spring or other device to maintain contact. For similar designs using flexible elements, see radial shaft seal (or &quot;lip seal&quot;) and O-ring.

==Mechanical seal fundamentals==

An end-face mechanical seal consists of rotating and stationary components which are tightly pressed together using both mechanical and hydraulic forces. Even though these components are tightly pressed together, a small amount of leakage occurs through a clearance that is related to the surface roughness.

=== Components ===
All end-face mechanical seals have rotating elements, stationary elements, and include five basic components:
* seal ring
* mating ring
* secondary sealing elements
* springs
* Encasing

The seal ring and mating ring are sometimes referred to as the primary sealing surfaces. The primary sealing surfaces are the heart of the end-face mechanical seal. A common material combination for the primary sealing surfaces is a hard material, such as silicon carbide, ceramic or tungsten carbide and a softer material, such as carbon. Many other materials can be used depending on pressure, temperature and the chemical properties of the liquid being sealed. The seal ring and mating ring are in intimate contact, one ring rotates with the shaft and the other ring is stationary. Either ring may be rotating or stationary. Also, either ring may be made of hard or soft material. These two rings are machined using a process called lapping in order to obtain the necessary degree of surface finish and flatness. The seal ring is flexible in the axial direction; the mating ring is not flexible.

==== Seal ring ====
By definition, the seal ring is the axially flexible member of the end-face mechanical seal. The design of the seal ring must allow for minimizing distortion and maximizing heat transfer while considering the secondary sealing element, drive mechanism, spring and ease of assembly. Many seal rings contain the seal face diameters, although this is not a requirement of the primary ring. The seal ring always contains the balance diameter.

The shape of the seal ring may vary considerably according to the incorporation of various design features. In fact, the shape of the seal ring is often the most distinct identifying characteristic of a seal.

==== Mating ring ====
By definition, the mating ring is the non-flexible member of the mechanical seal. The design of the mating ring must allow for minimizing distortion and maximizing heat transfer while considering ease of assembly and the static secondary sealing element. The mating ring can contain the seal face diameters, although this is not a requirement of the mating ring. To minimize primary ring motion, the mating ring must be mounted solidly and should form a perpendicular plane for the primary ring to run against. Like seal rings, mating rings are available in many different shapes.

==== Secondary sealing elements ====
Secondary sealing elements are gaskets which provide sealing between the seal ring and shaft (or housing) and the mating ring and shaft (or housing). Typical secondary sealing elements include O-rings, wedges or rubber diaphragms. The secondary sealing elements (there may be a number of them) are not rotating relative to one another. The secondary sealing element for the mating ring is always static axially (although it may be rotating). Secondary sealing elements for the seal ring are described as being either pusher or non-pusher in the axial direction. The term pusher is applied to secondary seals that must be pushed back and forth by the movement of the shaft or primary ring whereas non-pusher secondary seals are static and associated with bellows seal rings.

==== Springs ====
In order to keep the primary sealing surfaces in intimate contact, an actuating force is required. This actuating force is provided by a spring. In conjunction with the spring, axial forces may also be provided by the pressure of the sealed fluid acting on the seal ring. Many different types of springs are used in mechanical seals: single spring, multiple springs, wave springs, and metal bellows.

==== Encasing ====
The term &quot;Encasing&quot; is used to describe various devices which hold the other components together in the desired relationship. For example, a retainer might be used to package the seal ring, secondary sealing element and springs into a single unit. Another example of encasing is the drive mechanism which is necessary to prevent axial and rotational slippage of the seal on the shaft.

==Classifications==

There are a number of different ways in which “seals” may be classified. Sometimes a reference to a “seal” may be to a sealing system whereas other times the reference is to a device such as a gasket, an O-ring, compression packing, etc. In this article, the reference is to an end-face mechanical seal.
One such method of classification considers design features or the configuration in which these features may be used. Classification by Design accounts for the details and features incorporated into a single seal ring/mating ring pair. Classification by Configuration includes the orientation and combination of the seal ring/mating ring pair.

=== Design features ===
The individual components of end-face mechanical seals may be designed to include features such as:
* face treatments such as hydrodynamic features, pads, etc.
* balance ratio
* pusher or bellows
* spring design
* hardware for containing assembly and providing drive mechanism
* considerations for secondary sealing element.
In general, design features are not completely independent; that is, emphasis of a particular feature may also influence other features. For example, selection of a particular secondary sealing element may influence the shape of the seal ring.

==== Face treatment ==== 
The most common seal face design is a plain, flat, smooth surface but there are many special treatments intended for specific applications. The most common objective for the face treatment is to reduce the magnitude of mechanical contact. In general, face treatments provide a means of modifying the pressure distribution between the seal faces through hydrostatic or hydrodynamic topography. Seal face topography refers to the three dimensional aspects of the seal face surface.

==== Balance ratio ==== 
In addition to the spring force, the seal faces are pushed together through pressure acting hydrostatically on the geometry of the seal. The ratio of the geometric area tending to close the seal faces to the area tending to open the seal faces is called the balance ratio.

==== Pusher or bellows seal ring ==== 
Pusher seals employ a dynamic secondary sealing element (typically an O-ring) which moves axially with the seal ring. Bellows seals employ a static secondary seal (such as an O-ring, high temperature graphite packing, or elastomeric bellows and axial movement is accommodated by contraction or expansion of the bellows.

==== Spring design ====
Many different types of springs are used, including: relatively large single coil springs, multiple sets of small coil springs, and wave springs. A formed or welded metal bellows can also act as the spring. Corrosion, clogging and movement are major considerations when selecting a spring design.

==== Hardware ==== 
In addition to retaining the other components, the seal hardware includes the drive mechanism which is necessary to prevent axial and rotational slippage of the seal on the shaft. The drive mechanism must withstand the torque produced by the seal faces while also allowing the seal ring to move axially. In addition to torque, the drive mechanism must withstand the axial thrust produced by hydrostatic pressure acting on the components. The various types of drive mechanisms include: dent drive, key drive, set screws, pins, slots, snap rings and many more. Typically, the retainer for the seal ring might include set screws, a dent or slot drive, recesses for the spring and a snap ring to complete the assembly. In contrast, mating ring hardware might be only a pin or slot to prevent rotation. Corrosion is a major consideration when selecting seal hardware.

==== Considerations for secondary sealing elements ====
Both the seal ring and mating must accommodate secondary sealing elements. In some designs, various retainers, sleeves and other components may also include secondary sealing elements. Whereas a simple O-ring might require only a groove for fitting, some secondary sealing elements (for example, packing) might require mechanical compression. Although O-rings are available in many elastomers, sometimes an elastomer might not be compatible with the fluid being sealed or might be considered too expensive. In such cases, a secondary sealing element might be manufactured from perfluoroelastomer and shaped in the form of a wedge, V or U.

=== Configurations ===
Although all end-face mechanical seals must contain the five elements described above, those functional elements may be arranged or oriented in many different ways. Several dimensional and functional standards exist, such as API Standard 682 - Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps, which describes the configurations for used in Oil &amp; Gas applications. Even though the scope of API 682 is somewhat limited, it may be extended to describe end-face mechanical seals in general.
Configuration refers to the number and orientation of the components in the end-face mechanical seal assembly. For example, springs may be rotating or stationary. Single or multiple pairs of sealing faces may be used. For multiple seals, the individual pairs of sealing faces may be similarly oriented or opposed. Containment devices such as bushings may or may not be used as part of the configuration.

==== Component vs cartridge ====
The basic components of an end-face mechanical seal may be installed directly onto the shaft but a popular approach is to pre-assemble the components into some sort of package for ease of installation. When the components are pre-assembled onto a sleeve and gland plate, the complete assembly is called a cartridge seal. This complete assembly can be easily slid onto the shaft and bolted in place thus reducing the potential for installation errors. Some cartridge seals use regular component seal parts whereas other cartridge seals might use specific purpose parts. API 682 specifies that only cartridge seals are acceptable to the standard.

==== Rotating vs stationary springs ==== 
Either the seal ring or the mating ring may be the rotating element. Seals with rotating seal rings are said to be &quot;rotating&quot; seals; seals with stationary seal rings are said to be &quot;stationary&quot; seals. Because the springs are always associated with the seal rings, sometimes the distinction is made as &quot;rotating springs&quot; versus &quot;stationary springs&quot;. For convenience, rotating seals are used in most equipment; however, stationary seals have some advantages over rotating seals. In small, mass-produced seals for modest services, the entire seal may be placed in a package which minimizes shaft and housing requirements for the equipment. Stationary seals are also used to advantage in large sizes or at high rotational speeds.

==== Single vs multiple ====
When classifying end-face mechanical seals by configuration, the first consideration is whether there is only one set of sealing faces or multiple sets. If multiple sets are used, are the sets configured to be unpressurized or pressurized.

===== Tandem seals ===== 
A tandem seal consists of two sets primary sealing surfaces with the space in-between the two seals filled with a compatible low pressure fluid called the buffer fluid. This buffer fluid/space may be monitored to detect performance of the assembly. Unfortunately, the definition of “tandem seal” was often stated in a confusing manner. In particular, a tandem seal was usually described as two seals pointing in the same direction; that is, in a face-to-back orientation. This orientation is not necessary to the function of the configuration and the API chose to use the term Arrangement 2 instead of tandem in the API 682 standard.

===== Double seals =====
A double seal consists of two sets primary sealing surfaces with the space in-between the two seals filled with a compatible pressurized fluid called the barrier fluid. This barrier fluid/space may be monitored to detect performance of the assembly. Unfortunately, the definition of “double seal” was often stated in a confusing manner. In particular, a double seal was usually described as two seals pointing in the opposite direction; that is, in a back-to-back orientation. This orientation is not necessary to the function of the configuration and the API chose to use the term Arrangement 3 instead of double in the API 682 standard.

==Seal piping plans==

An end-face mechanical seal generates heat from rubbing and viscous shear and must be cooled to assure good performance and reliable operation. Typically, cooling is provided by circulating fluid around the seal. This fluid, known as a flush, may be the same as the fluid being sealed or an entirely different fluid. The flush may be heated, filtered or otherwise treated to improve the operating environment around the seal. Collectively, the flush and treating systems are known as piping plans. Piping plans for mechanical seals are defined by American Petroleum Institute specification 682 and are given a number. Some piping plans are used for single seals and some only for multiple seals. Some piping plans are intended to provide a means of monitoring the seal. Some sealing systems include more than one piping plan. See the table below for a summary and description of piping plans.

==Origins and development==
The mechanical seal appears to have been invented by George J. Cooke 
 His design was originally called a &quot;Cooke Seal&quot; and he founded the Cooke Seal Company. Cooke&#x27;s seal (which actually did not have a means of drive) was first used in refrigeration compressors. The Cooke Seal Company was a sideline product for Cooke and he sold the company to Muskegon Piston Ring Company where it became the Rotary Seal Division. Muskegon Piston Ring sold its Rotary Seal Division to EG&amp;G Sealol who were later acquired by John Crane Incorporated.

The first commercially successful mechanical seal to be used on centrifugal pumps was probably made by the Cameron Division of the Ingersoll-Rand Company. The Cameron seal was installed in a number of centrifugal pipeline pumps in 1928.
Mechanical seals in the 1930s often used a face combination of hardened steel versus leaded bronze. Carbon-graphite was not widely used as a seal face material until after World War II. Soft packing was used as secondary sealing elements. The O-ring was developed in the 1930s but not used in mechanical seals until after World War II.

In the late 1930s, probably about 1938 or 1939, mechanical seals began to replace packing on automobile water pumps. The famous Jeep of WWII used a rubber bellows seal in the water pump. After WWII, all automobile water pumps used mechanical seals. 

In the mid-1940s pump manufacturers such as Ingersoll-Rand, Worthington, Pacific, Byron Jackson, United, Union and others began to make their own mechanical seals. Eventually most of these companies got out of the seal business but the Byron Jackson seal became the Borg-Warner seal (now Flowserve) and the Worthington seal was sold to Chempro (now John Crane - Sealol).

Cartridge seals were used on a regular basis by 1950; this convenient packaging of seal, sleeve and gland was probably developed by C. E. Wiessner of Durametallic about 1942.

By 1954, mechanical seals were used with such regularity in the refining and process industries that the American Petroleum Institute included seal specifications in the first edition of its Standard 610, &quot;Centrifugal Pumps for General Refinery Services&quot;.

By 1956, many of the conceptual designs and application guidelines that are in use today had been developed. Commercially available designs included both rotating and stationary flexible elements, balanced and unbalanced hydraulic loading, rubber and metal bellows, and a wide variety of spring designs and types. Secondary sealing elements included O-rings, wedges, U-cups and various packings. Carbon-graphite was widely used as a seal face material; the mating seal face was often cast iron, Ni-resist, 400 series stainless steel, Stellite or aluminum oxide although tungsten carbide was coming into use. Stainless steel was widely used for springs, retainers, sleeves and glands. Single and multiple seal arrangements were used as necessary to accomplish the required performance. In 1957, Sealol introduced the edge welded metal bellows seal. Previously, metal bellows seals had used a formed bellows which was much thicker and stiffer.

In 1959, John C. Copes of Baton Rouge, LA filed for a patent on a split seal and was awarded Patent #3025070 in 1962. In the Copes design, only the faces were split. Copes chose to provide custom split seals which he manufactured himself so very few of his split seals were produced.

The Clean Air Act of 1990 placed limits on fugitive emissions from pumps. Seal manufacturers responded with improved designs and better materials. In October, 1994, the American Petroleum Institute released API Standard 682, &quot;A Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps”. This standard had a major effect on the sealing industry. In addition to providing guidelines for seal selection, API 682 requires qualification testing by the seal manufacturers. API 682 is now in its 4th Edition and work has begun on 5th Edition.

There has been much consolidation in the mechanical seal industry. Among the major manufacturers:
* John Crane (Smiths Group of Great Britain) includes Sealol (Rotary), Flexibox, Safematic, Ropac; 
* Flowserve includes BW/IP (Borg-Warner), Durametallic, Five Star, Pacific Wietz; 
* EagleBurgmann includes Eagle, Burgmann.

Today, in addition to face patterns such as spiral grooves and waves, materials have been developed that have special surfaces to promote hydrodynamic lift. Lasers can be used to etch microscopic, performance enhancing textures on the surface of the seal face. Piezoelectric materials and electronic controls are being investigated for creating truly controllable seals. The application of specialized seal face patterns, surfaces, and controls is an emerging technology that is developing rapidly and holds great promise for the future.

<doc id="235898" wikidata="Q206907" url="?curid=235898" title="Short circuit">
<text>A short circuit (sometimes abbreviated to short or s/c) is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low electrical impedance. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.
The opposite of a short circuit is an open circuit, which is an infinite resistance (or very high impedance) between two nodes.

== Definition ==
A short circuit is an abnormal connection between two nodes of an electric circuit intended to be at different voltages. This results in an electric current limited only by the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the rest of the network which can cause circuit damage, overheating, fire or explosion. Although usually the result of a fault, there are cases where short circuits are caused intentionally, for example, for the purpose of voltage-sensing crowbar circuit protectors.

In circuit analysis, a &quot;short circuit&quot; is defined as a connection between two nodes that forces them to be at the same voltage. In an &#x27;ideal&#x27; short circuit, this means there is no resistance and thus no voltage drop across the connection. In real circuits, the result is a connection with almost no resistance. In such a case, the current is limited only by the resistance of the rest of the circuit.

== Examples ==
A common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery or a capacitor are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire. With a low resistance in the connection, a high current will flow, causing the delivery of a large amount of energy in a short period of time.

A high current flowing through a battery can cause a rapid increase of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion with the release of hydrogen gas and electrolyte (an acid or a base), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires will also overheat causing damage to the wire&#x27;s insulation, or starting a fire. 

In electrical devices, unintentional short circuits are usually caused when a wire&#x27;s insulation breaks down, or when another conducting material is introduced, allowing charge to flow along a different path than the one intended.

In mains circuits, short circuits may occur between two phases, between a phase and neutral or between a phase and earth (ground). Such short circuits are likely to result in a very high current and therefore quickly trigger an overcurrent protection device. However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors and between two conductors of the same phase. Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of leakage reactance. The leakage reactance (usually about 5 to 10% of the full load impedance) helps limit both the magnitude and rate of rise of the fault current.

A short circuit may lead to formation of an electric arc. The arc, a channel of hot ionized plasma, is highly conductive and can persist even after significant amounts of original material from the conductors has evaporated. Surface erosion is a typical sign of electric arc damage. Even short arcs can remove significant amounts of material from the electrodes. The temperature of the resulting electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current, as well as to escape into the air as fine particulate matter.

== Damage ==
Within milliseconds, a short circuit can deliver a fault current thousands of times higher than the normal operating current of the system. Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing fuses, circuit breakers, or other overload protection, which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current. Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit. Circuits for large home appliances require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits. Wire gauges specified in building and electrical codes are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum prospective short-circuit current.

In an improper installation, the overcurrent from a short circuit may cause ohmic heating of the circuit parts with poor conductivity (faulty joints in wiring, faulty contacts in power sockets, or even the site of the short circuit itself). Such overheating is a common cause of fires. An electric arc, if it forms during the short circuit, produces high amount of heat and can cause ignition of combustible substances as well.

In industrial and utility distribution systems, dynamic forces generated by high short-circuit currents cause conductors to spread apart. Busbars, cables, and apparatus can be damaged by the forces generated in a short circuit.

== Related concepts ==
In electronics, the ideal model (infinite gain) of an operational amplifier is said to produce a &quot;virtual short circuit&quot; between its input terminals because no matter what the output voltage is, the difference of potential between its input terminals is zero. If one of the input terminals is connected to the ground, then the other one is said to provide a virtual ground because its potential is (ideally) identical to that of the ground. An ideal operational amplifier also has infinite input impedance, so unlike a real short circuit, no current flows between the terminals of the virtual short.

<text>A circuit breaker is an electrical safety device designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by current in excess of that which the equipment can safely carry (overcurrent). Its basic function is to interrupt current flow to protect equipment and to prevent fire. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. 

Circuit breakers are commonly installed in distribution boards. Apart from its safety purpose, a circuit breaker is also often used as a main switch to manually disconnect (&quot;rack out&quot;) and connect (&quot;rack in&quot;) electrical power to a whole electrical sub-network.

Circuit breakers are made in varying current ratings, from devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliances, to switchgear designed to protect high-voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Any device which protects against excessive current by automatically removing power from a faulty system, such as a circuit breaker or fuse, can be referred to as an &quot;over-current protection device&quot; (&quot;OCPD&quot;).

==Origins==
An early form of circuit breaker was described by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses. Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker similar to the ones now in use was patented by Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, was credited as the inventor on German patent 458392. Stotz&#x27;s invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.

Interconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required the development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high-voltage circuits; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using the directed flow of pressurized air, or pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project used eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three AC cycles.

==Operation==
All circuit breaker systems have common features in their operation, but details vary substantially depending on the voltage class, current rating and type of the circuit breaker.

The circuit breaker must first detect a fault condition. In small mains and low-voltage circuit breakers, this is usually done within the device itself. Typically, the heating or magnetic effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with protective relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, protective relays, and internal power sources.

Once a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. A breaker may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, via thermal expansion or increased magnetic field. A small circuit breaker typically has a manual control lever to switch the circuit off or reset a tripped breaker, while a larger unit may use a solenoid to trip the mechanism, and an electric motor to restore energy to springs (which rapidly separate contacts when the breaker is tripped).

The circuit breaker contacts must carry the load current without excessive heating, and must also withstand the heat of the arc produced when interrupting (opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.

When a high current or voltage is interrupted, an arc is generated. The maximum length of the arc is generally proportional to the voltage while the intensity (or heat) is proportional to the current. This arc must be contained, cooled and extinguished in a controlled way, so that the gap between the contacts can again withstand the voltage in the circuit. Different circuit breakers use vacuum, air, insulating gas, or oil as the medium the arc forms in. Different techniques are used to extinguish the arc including:
* Lengthening or deflecting the arc
* Intensive cooling (in jet chambers)
* Division into partial arcs
* Zero-point quenching (contacts open at the moment in the AC waveform at which the current and potential are near zero, effectively breaking no load current at the time of opening. The zero-crossing occurs at twice the line frequency; i.e., 100 times per second for 50 Hz and 120 times per second for 60 Hz AC.)
* Connecting capacitors in parallel with contacts in DC circuits.

Finally, once the fault condition has been cleared, the contacts must again be closed to restore power to the interrupted circuit.

==Arc interruption==

Low-voltage miniature circuit breakers (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates that divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance that limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings). The number of plates in the arc chute is dependent on the short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.

In larger ratings, oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the oil to blast a jet of oil through the arc.

Gas (usually sulfur hexafluoride) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc using a magnetic field, and then rely upon the dielectric strength of the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) to quench the stretched arc.

Vacuum circuit breakers have minimal arcing (as there is nothing to ionize other than the contact material). The arc is quenched when it is stretched a very small amount (less than ). Vacuum circuit breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switch gear to .

Air circuit breakers may use compressed air to blow out the arc, or alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.

Circuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current very quickly: typically the arc is extinguished between 30 and 150 ms after the mechanism has been tripped, depending upon age and construction of the device. The maximum current value and let-through energy determine the quality of the circuit breakers.

==Short circuit==

Circuit breakers are rated both by the normal current that they are expected to carry, and the maximum short-circuit current that they can safely interrupt. This latter figure is the ampere interrupting capacity (AIC) of the breaker.

Under short-circuit conditions, the calculated or measured maximum prospective short-circuit current may be many times the normal, rated current of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, there is a tendency for an arc to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause the further continuation of the arc or create additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arcs.

The maximum short-circuit current that a breaker can interrupt is determined by testing. Application of a breaker in a circuit with a prospective short-circuit current higher than the breaker&#x27;s interrupting capacity rating may result in failure of the breaker to safely interrupt a fault. In a worst-case scenario, a breaker may successfully interrupt a fault only to explode when reset.

Typical domestic panel circuit breakers are rated to interrupt () short-circuit current.

Miniature circuit breakers used to protect control circuits or small appliances may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these circuit breakers are called &quot;supplemental circuit protectors&quot; to distinguish them from distribution-type circuit breakers.

==Standard current ratings==
Circuit breakers are manufactured with standard ratings, using a system of preferred numbers to create a useful selection of ratings. A miniature circuit breaker has a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires replacing the whole circuit breaker. Circuit breakers with higher ratings can have adjustable trip settings, allowing fewer standardized products to be used, adjusted to the applicable precise ratings when installed. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere &quot;frame size&quot; might have its over-current detection threshold set only 300 amperes where that rating is appropriate.

For low-voltage distribution circuit breakers an international standard, IEC 60898-1, defines &quot;rated current&quot; as the maximum current that a breaker is designed to carry continuously. The commonly available preferred values for rated current are 1A, 2A, 4A, 6 A, 10 A, 13 A, 16 A, 20 A, 25 A, 32 A, 40 A, 50 A, 63 A, 80 A, 100 A, and 125 A. The circuit breaker is labeled with the rated current in amperes prefixed by a letter, which indicates the &quot;instantaneous tripping current&quot; that causes the circuit breaker to trip without intentional time delay expressed in multiples of the rated current:

Circuit breakers are also rated by the maximum fault current that they can interrupt; this allows use of more economical devices on systems unlikely to develop the high short-circuit current found on, for example, a large commercial building distribution system.

In the United States, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certifies equipment ratings, called Series Ratings (or &quot;integrated equipment ratings&quot;) for circuit breaker equipment used for buildings. Power circuit breakers and medium- and high-voltage circuit breakers used for industrial or electric power systems are designed and tested to ANSI or IEEE standards in the C37 series. For example, standard C37.16 lists preferred frame size current ratings for power circuit breakers in the range of 600 to 5000 amperes. Trip current settings and time–current characteristics of these breakers are generally adjustable.

For medium- and high-voltage circuit breakers used in switchgear, substations and generating stations, relatively few standard frame sizes are generally manufactured. These circuit breakers are usually controlled by separate protective relay systems, offering adjustable tripping current and time settings as well as allowing for more complex protection schemes.

==Types==
Many classifications of circuit breakers can be made, based on their features such as voltage class, construction type, interrupting type, and structural features.

===Low-voltage===
Low-voltage (less than 1,000 VAC) types are common in domestic, commercial and industrial application, and include:
* Miniature circuit breaker (MCB)—rated current up to 125 A. Trip characteristics normally not adjustable. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Breakers illustrated above are in this category.
* Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB)—rated current up to 1,600 A. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Trip current may be adjustable in higher-rated units.
* Low-voltage power circuit breakers can be mounted in multiple tiers in low-voltage switchboards or switchgear cabinets.

The characteristics of low-voltage circuit breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 947. These circuit breakers are often installed in draw-out enclosures that allow removal and interchange without dismantling the switchgear.

Large low-voltage molded-case and power circuit breakers may have electric motor operators so they can open and close under remote control. These may form part of an automatic transfer switch system for standby power.

Low-voltage circuit breakers are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous—unlike an AC arc, which tends to go out on each half cycle, a direct-current circuit breaker has a blow-out coil that generates a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small circuit breakers are either installed directly in equipment or arranged in breaker panels.

The DIN-rail-mounted thermal-magnetic miniature circuit breaker is the most common style in modern domestic consumer units and commercial electrical distribution boards throughout Europe. The design includes the following components:

# Actuator leverused to manually trip and reset the circuit breaker. Also indicates the status of the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped). Most breakers are designed so they can still trip even if the lever is held or locked in the &quot;on&quot; position. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;free trip&quot; or &quot;positive trip&quot; operation.
# Actuator mechanismforces the contacts together or apart.
# Contactsallow current when touching and break the current when moved apart.
# Terminals
# Bimetallic stripseparates contacts in response to smaller, longer-term overcurrents
# Calibration screwallows the manufacturer to precisely adjust the trip current of the device after assembly.
# Solenoidseparates contacts rapidly in response to high overcurrents
# Arc divider/extinguisher

===Solid-state===
&quot;Solid-state&quot; circuit breakers (SSCBs), also known as &quot;digital&quot; circuit breakers, are a technological innovation which promises to advance circuit breaker technology out of the mechanical level, into the electrical. This promises several advantages, such as acting much more quickly (breaking circuits in fractions of microseconds), better monitoring of circuit loads and longer lifetimes. Solid-state circuit breakers have been developed for medium-voltage DC power and can use silicon carbide transistors or integrated gate-commutated thyristors (IGCTs) for switching.

===Magnetic===
A &quot;magnetic&quot; circuit breaker uses a solenoid (electromagnet) whose pulling force increases with the current. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces in addition to those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by a latch. As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the solenoid&#x27;s pull releases the latch, which lets the contacts open by spring action. They are the most commonly used circuit breakers in the United States.

===Thermal–magnetic===
A &quot;thermal–magnetic&quot; circuit breaker, which is the type found in most distribution boards in Europe and countries with a similar wiring arrangement, incorporates both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (such as short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to lesser but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time-response feature that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger over-currents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With a very large over-current, such as may be caused short circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.

===Magnetic–hydraulic===
A &quot;magnetic–hydraulic&quot; circuit breaker uses a solenoid coil to provide operating force to open the contacts. A magnetic–hydraulic breaker incorporates a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, the speed of the solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.

A large power circuit breaker, such as one applied in circuits of more than 1000 volts, may incorporate hydraulic elements in the contact operating mechanism. Hydraulic energy may be supplied by a pump or stored in accumulators. These form a distinct type from oil-filled circuit breakers where oil is the arc-extinguishing medium.

===Common-trip (ganged) breakers===
To provide simultaneous breaking on multiple circuits from a fault on any one, circuit breakers may be made as a ganged assembly. This is a very common requirement for three-phase systems, where breaking may be either three- or four-pole (solid or switched neutral). Some makers make ganging kits to allow groups of single-phase breakers to be interlinked as required.

In the US, where split-phase supplies are common, in a branch circuit with more than one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a &quot;common-trip&quot; set of breakers must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case or, for small breakers, have the breakers externally tied together via their operating handles. Two-pole common-trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common-trip breakers are typically used to supply three-phase power to powerful motors or further distribution boards.

Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a very dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don&#x27;t work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common-trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.

===Shunt-trip units===
A shunt-trip unit appears similar to a normal breaker and the moving actuators are &quot;ganged&quot; to a normal breaker mechanism to operate together in a similar way, but the shunt trip is a solenoid intended to be operated by an external constant-voltage signal, rather than a current, commonly the local mains voltage or DC. These are often used to cut the power when a high-risk event occurs, such as a fire or flood alarm, or another electrical condition, such as over-voltage detection. Shunt trips may be a user-fitted accessory to a standard breaker or supplied as an integral part of a circuit breaker.

===Medium-voltage===
Medium-voltage circuit breakers rated between 1 and 72kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line-ups for indoor use or may be individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break circuit breakers replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5kV). Like the high-voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current-sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.

Medium-voltage circuit breakers can be classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:
* Vacuum circuit breakers—With rated current up to 6,300A, and higher for generator circuit breakers application (up to 16,000A &amp; 140kA). These breakers interrupt the current by creating and extinguishing the arc in a vacuum containeraka &quot;bottle&quot;. Long life bellows are designed to travel the 6–10 mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for voltages up to about 40,500V, which corresponds roughly to the medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit breakers have longer life expectancy between overhaul than do other circuit breakers. In addition their global warming potential is by far lower than SF6 circuit breaker.
* Air circuit breakers—Rated current up to 6,300A and higher for generator circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully adjustable including configurable trip thresholds and delays. Usually electronically controlled, though some models are microprocessor controlled via an integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in large industrial plant, where the breakers are arranged in draw-out enclosures for ease of maintenance.
* SF6 circuit breakers extinguish the arc in a chamber filled with sulfur hexafluoride gas.

Medium-voltage circuit breakers may be connected into the circuit by bolted connections to bus bars or wires, especially in outdoor switchyards. Medium-voltage circuit breakers in switchgear line-ups are often built with draw-out construction, allowing breaker removal without disturbing power circuit connections, using a motor-operated or hand-cranked mechanism to separate the breaker from its enclosure.

===High-voltage===

Electrical power transmission networks are protected and controlled by high-voltage breakers. The definition of &quot;high voltage&quot; varies but in power transmission work is usually thought to be 72.5 kV or higher, according to a recent definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. In substations the protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.

High-voltage breakers are broadly classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:
* Bulk oil
* Minimum oil
* Air blast
* Vacuum
* SF6
* CO2

Due to environmental and cost concerns over insulating oil spills, most new breakers use SF6 gas to quench the arc.

Circuit breakers can be classified as &quot;live tank&quot;, where the enclosure that contains the breaking mechanism is at line potential, or &quot;dead tank&quot; with the enclosure at earth potential. High-voltage AC circuit breakers are routinely available with ratings up to 765 kV. 1,200kV breakers were launched by Siemens in November 2011, followed by ABB in April the following year.

High-voltage circuit breakers used on transmission systems may be arranged to allow a single pole of a three-phase line to trip, instead of tripping all three poles; for some classes of faults this improves the system stability and availability.

High-voltage direct current circuit breakers are still a field of research as of 2015. Such breakers would be useful to interconnect HVDC transmission systems.

===Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) high-voltage===
A sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker uses contacts surrounded by sulfur hexafluoride gas to quench the arc. They are most often used for transmission-level voltages and may be incorporated into compact gas-insulated switchgear. In cold climates, supplemental heating or different gas mixtures are used for high voltage circuit breakers, due to liquefaction of the SF6 gas. In some northern power grids, gas mixtures of N2 and SF6, or CF4 and SF6 are installed in puffer-type HVCB to quench the arc without any liquefaction of the gas. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4080767. The minimum temperature ratings of these models are as low as -50 °C for some northern substations.

===Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)===
The disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB) was introduced in 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, eliminating the need for separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, due to the lack of separate disconnectors.

In order to further reduce the required space of substation, as well as simplifying the design and engineering of the substation, a fiber optic current sensor (FOCS) can be integrated with the DCB. A 420 kV DCB with integrated FOCS can reduce a substation&#x27;s footprint with over 50% compared to a conventional solution of live tank breakers with disconnectors and current transformers, due to reduced material and no additional insulation medium.

===Carbon dioxide (CO2) high-voltage===
In 2012, ABB presented a 75kV high-voltage breaker that uses carbon dioxide as the medium to extinguish the arc. The carbon dioxide breaker works on the same principles as an SF6 breaker and can also be produced as a disconnecting circuit breaker. By switching from SF6 to CO2, it is possible to reduce the CO2 emissions by 10 tons during the product&#x27;s life cycle.

==&quot;Smart&quot; circuit breakers==
Several firms have looked at adding monitoring for appliances via electronics or using a digital circuit breaker to monitor the breakers remotely. Utility companies in the United States have been reviewing use of the technology to turn appliances on and off, as well as potentially turning off charging of electric cars during periods of high electrical grid load. These devices under research and testing would have wireless capability to monitor the electrical usage in a house via a smartphone app or other means.

==Other breakers==

The following types are described in separate articles.
* Breakers for protections against earth faults too small to trip an over-current device:
** Residual-current device (RCD), or residual-current circuit breaker (RCCB) — detects current imbalance, but does not provide over-current protection. In the United States and Canada, these are called ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI).
** Residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection (RCBO) — combines the functions of a RCD and a MCB in one package. In the United States and Canada, these are called GFCI breakers.
** Earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) — This detects current in the earth wire directly rather than detecting imbalance. They are no longer seen in new installations as they cannot detect any dangerous condition where the current is returning to earth by another routesuch as via a person on the ground or via plumbing. (also called VOELCB in the UK).
* Arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) or arc-fault detection device (AFDD) — detects electric arcs from the likes of loose wires.
* Recloser — A type of circuit breaker that closes automatically after a delay. These are used on overhead electric power distribution systems, to prevent short duration faults from causing sustained outages.
* Polyswitch (polyfuse) — A small device commonly described as an automatically resetting fuse rather than a circuit breaker.
